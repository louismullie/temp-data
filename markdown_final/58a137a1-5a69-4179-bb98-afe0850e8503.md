## Question

Why do we have pruritus in a patient with cirrhosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why patients with cirrhosis experience pruritus and what mechanisms explain it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and prevalence of pruritus in cirrhosis. Then, I should verify the core pathophysiology, especially the role of cholestasis and impaired bile flow. Next, I will examine candidate pruritogens, including bile acids, lysophosphatidic acid and autotaxin, and endogenous opioids. After that, I need to check how cirrhosis modifies these mechanisms. Finally, I will integrate these into a coherent, multifactorial model and note any exceptions or paradoxes, while confirming the strength of evidence for each pathway.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Pruritus is a common and often debilitating symptom in chronic liver disease, particularly in cholestatic disorders such as primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, and it can occur at any disease stage, including before jaundice appears, with severity that does not consistently correlate with liver biochemistry or histologic stage, which means I should not assume itch tracks with bilirubin or fibrosis grade [^114GguLL] [^116WhnNA] [^115ZX7Bu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single cause; I need to anchor the mechanism in cholestasis. Impaired bile formation or flow leads to retention of cholephilic compounds that enter systemic circulation and can act as pruritogens, and this aligns with the observation that interventions that reduce pruritogen load, such as nasobiliary drainage or liver transplantation, often relieve itch, supporting a cholestasis-driven model rather than a purely cutaneous one [^115ZX7Bu] [^112eJ874].

> I will now examine bile acids as candidate pruritogens. Historically, retained bile salts were thought to directly irritate cutaneous nerve endings, but wait, let me verify whether serum bile acids correlate with itch severity. They often do not, and a randomized trial of colesevelam, which lowers serum bile acids, failed to improve pruritus despite biochemical improvement, suggesting bile acids may be necessary but insufficient drivers and that other cholephilic anions or signaling pathways likely contribute [^116avJXA] [^113pWqRz].

> Next, I should review the lysophosphatidic acid axis. Let me consider the evidence that autotaxin, the enzyme that generates LPA, is elevated in cholestatic pruritus and that autotaxin activity correlates with itch intensity. LPA can activate sensory neurons via LPAR5, and temporary nasobiliary drainage reduces both autotaxin activity and pruritus, which strengthens the causal link between the LPA–autotaxin pathway and cholestatic itch [^115ZX7Bu] [^112ewAnU] [^112DuuCb].

> I need to check the endogenous opioid system as a central modulator. Cholestasis is associated with increased mu-opioid tone, which is pro-pruritic, and mu-opioid receptor antagonists such as naltrexone can reduce cholestatic itch in selected patients, although I should confirm that efficacy varies and that opioid-withdrawal–like reactions can occur, so patient selection and counseling matter [^116canvz] [^1149bjEd] [^112ewAnU].

> Let me think about how cirrhosis modifies these mechanisms. Cirrhosis amplifies cholestasis through architectural distortion and impaired bile secretion, which increases pruritogen accumulation; portal hypertension and shunting may alter hepatic clearance and increase systemic exposure to pruritogenic molecules; and progressive liver dysfunction reduces clearance of endogenous opioids, tilting the balance toward mu-opioid–mediated pruritus, while fibrosis-related signaling may upregulate autotaxin, further fueling LPA-driven itch [^112ewAnU] [^112DuuCb].

> But wait, what if the itch is paradoxical. I should double-check that pruritus severity does not reliably track with bilirubin or fibrosis stage, and in some patients itch may even improve as liver disease advances, which implies that pruritogen profiles and neural sensitization can shift over time and that non-bilirubin cholephilic anions or neuroimmune changes may predominate in different phases of disease [^114GguLL] [^116WhnNA] [^113pWqRz].

> Let me integrate this into a multifactorial model. Cholestasis leads to retained pruritogens, including bile acids and other cholephilic anions, while the LPA–autotaxin axis provides a quantitatively linked peripheral neuronal activator, and central mu-opioidergic tone sensitizes itch perception. Cirrhosis magnifies these effects through impaired bile flow, altered clearance, and neurohormonal changes, yielding a composite itch phenotype that is heterogeneous across patients and over time [^112ewAnU] [^115ZX7Bu] [^116canvz].

> I should confirm the therapeutic implications that flow from this model. Bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine remain first-line to reduce pruritogen enterohepatic cycling, rifampin can induce metabolism of pruritogens, naltrexone can modulate central opioid pathways, and sertraline may engage serotonergic modulation of itch perception; in refractory cases, temporizing measures like nasobiliary drainage or albumin dialysis, and liver transplantation for intractable pruritus with impaired quality of life, are supported, which indirectly validates the pathophysiologic model by showing clinical response when pruritogen load or neural modulation is addressed [^113HpPEW] [^113ebpDk] [^11781rAr].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion reflects the weight of evidence: pruritus in cirrhosis is best explained by a cholestasis-driven, multifactorial mechanism wherein impaired bile flow accumulates pruritogens, the LPA–autotaxin axis directly activates itch neurons, and central mu-opioidergic tone heightens pruritic perception, with cirrhosis amplifying these pathways through structural and functional liver changes. This explains why itch can be severe even without marked jaundice and why therapies that target pruritogens or neural modulators are variably effective across patients [^112ewAnU] [^115ZX7Bu].

Patients with cirrhosis often experience pruritus due to **cholestasis-driven accumulation of pruritogens** (bile acids, lysophosphatidic acid, endogenous opioids) [^112ewAnU] and **neurotransmitter imbalances** (serotonin, opioids) that amplify itch signaling [^112ewAnU]. Pruritus is most common in cholestatic cirrhosis (PBC, PSC) [^112ewAnU] but can occur in any cirrhosis with impaired bile flow [^116DjLVX]. Management is stepwise: start with skin care and cholestyramine [^113HpPEW]; if needed, add rifampin, naltrexone, or sertraline [^114D76V3]; and consider phototherapy, MARS, or liver transplantation for refractory cases [^113ebpDk] [^1151JFo1] [^115Q52jd].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of pruritus in cirrhosis

Pruritus in cirrhosis is **multifactorial**, involving peripheral and central mechanisms:

---

### Accumulation of pruritogenic substances

- **Bile acids**: Retained bile acids can directly irritate skin and nerves, though serum levels do not always correlate with itch severity [^112ewAnU].

- **Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)**: Autotaxin generates LPA, which activates sensory neurons via LPAR5; autotaxin activity correlates with itch intensity [^115ZX7Bu] [^117UtYWL].

- **Endogenous opioids**: Increased mu-opioid tone in cholestasis sensitizes itch pathways; opioid antagonists can reduce itch [^116canvz] [^1149bjEd].

---

### Neurotransmitter imbalances

Serotoninergic pathways modulate itch; SSRIs like sertraline can reduce cholestatic pruritus [^114f27fF]. An imbalance between mu- and kappa-opioid signaling also promotes itch in cholestasis [^112ewAnU].

---

### Hepatic encephalopathy and central nervous system involvement

In hepatic encephalopathy, **ammonia and neurotoxins** alter CNS function, potentially amplifying itch perception [^115nzFJt].

---

## Clinical features and prevalence

- **Prevalence**: Pruritus occurs in 20–70% of PBC, 30–50% of PSC, and 10–30% of other cirrhoses [^1148wNBW] [^116WhnNA].

- **Distribution**: Generalized, often worse on limbs and back; may precede jaundice [^115LNnSt].

- **Severity**: Can cause sleep loss, fatigue, depression, and suicidal ideation [^11572hpp].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured evaluation includes:

- **History and exam**: Characterize itch, exclude dermatologic causes, and assess disease stage [^111XYUnR].

- **Laboratory tests**: LFTs, bile acids, autotaxin, and endogenous opioids as available [^115ZX7Bu] [^112DuuCb].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound, MRCP, or ERCP to exclude biliary obstruction [^116p4tWE].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **stepwise**, tailored to severity and tolerance:

| **Step** | **Treatment** | **Mechanism** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Skin care, emollients, cool baths | Barrier support | First-line, low risk [^113HpPEW] |
| 2 | Cholestyramine (4–16 g/day) | Bile acid sequestrant | Take 2–4 h apart from other meds [^113HpPEW] [^113pWqRz] |
| 3 | Rifampin (150–300 mg BID) | Enzyme inducer | Monitor LFTs; avoid if bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dL [^114D76V3] [^113m1C23] |
| 4 | Naltrexone (12.5–50 mg/day) | Opioid antagonist | Start low, titrate; avoid with opioids [^114D76V3] [^116canvz] |
| 5 | Sertraline (75–100 mg/day) | SSRI | Start 25 mg, titrate [^113HpPEW] [^114f27fF] |
| Refractory | Phototherapy, MARS, LT | Remove pruritogens | For severe, intractable cases [^113ebpDk] [^1151JFo1] [^115Q52jd] |

---

## Impact on quality of life

Pruritus in cirrhosis causes **sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression, and social isolation**, significantly impairing quality of life and potentially prompting liver transplantation evaluation when refractory [^11572hpp] [^112QVsmA] [^115Q52jd].

---

Pruritus in cirrhosis reflects **cholestasis-driven pruritogens** and neurotransmitter imbalances; effective care requires a stepwise approach, with escalation to advanced therapies for refractory cases.

Discussion

Need for novel anti-pruritic drugs in PBC

Pruritus is a complex symptom and the drug treatment of pruritus in PBC patients remains a challenge in clinical practice. The four main classes of drugs that are recommended by current guidelines include bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine), enzyme inducers (rifampicin), opioid antagonists (naltrexone) and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (sertraline). These drugs are limited by their lack of universal efficacy, poor compliance (especially cholestyramine) and the need for regular monitoring for liver toxicity (rifampicin). Cholestyramine and rifampicin have good reports but clinical experience of both naltrexone and sertraline has been disappointing for many clinicians.

A critical review of literature shows that the strength of evidence for current anti-pruritic drug therapy is poor. Cholestyramine, the current first-line therapy was last studied over five decades ago but has never been subjected to randomised placebo-controlled trials and has evidence category II-2 (cohort or case control analytical studies). Only rifampicin and naltrexone have been studied in controlled trials and sertraline (evidence category II-2) is the last agent investigated with a positive outcome on pruritus. A number of other drugs have been investigated but with little success and more recently both gabapentin (2006) and colesevelam (2010) trials failed to show any therapeutic benefit in cholestatic pruritus.

### Itching as a systemic disease [^117CFTGo]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pruritus is a sensation that emanates from the skin and is transferred through peripheral nerve fibers to the central nervous system. It is easily understood that primary skin disorders, such as atopic eczema, skin dryness, psoriasis, and urticaria, can elicit pruritus. However, certain systemic diseases can cause chronic pruritus, which has a significant effect on the patient's quality of life. In this rostrum we provide an overview of the characteristics, pathophysiology, and mechanisms of pruritus of major systemic underlying diseases, including end-stage renal disease, cholestatic liver disease, endocrine/metabolic diseases, and hematologic/lymphoproliferative diseases.

### Systematic review: efficacy of therapies for cholestatic pruritus [^113d2eBZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Another RCT assessed the effectiveness and tolerability of UCDA (13−15 mg/kg/day) in PBC. The primary endpoint was treatment failure − defined as a doubling of the bilirubin level to more than 70 µmol, the occurrence of a severe complication of cirrhosis, or a side effect requiring therapy interruption. The study showed that itching resolved in 40% of the patients in the UDCA group versus 19% in the placebo group, and the relative risk of treatment failure was three times higher in the placebo group.

In another RCT that evaluated the long-term effects of UDCA (14–16 mg/kg/day) in PBC, a significant reduction in itching score was observed in the UDCA group [1.5 ± 0.1 versus 2.0 ± 0.1 (baseline); p < 0.001] compared to placebo [1.7 ± 0.1 versus 2.0 ± 0.1 (baseline); p < 0.05]. At the same time, there was a progression of the histological stage, ductular proliferation, and ductopenia in patients that received a placebo. In addition, comparing the liver biopsy at the study entry and the end, UDCA demonstrated improved portal inflammation and prevention of histological stage progression.

Another intervention study on the long-term effects of UDCA 600 mg three times daily (TID) in PBC patients observed that in seven of eight patients with itching, itching disappeared a month after UDCA administration. In addition, portal inflammation activity decreased in all five patients who had undergone follow-up liver biopsies more than 1 year after UDCA administration.

An RCT also assessed the effectiveness of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a metabolite of UDCA, in individuals with chronic hepatitis and pruritus, using daily doses of either 500 or 750 mg. Pretreatment: the VASs were 0.13 ± 0.35 for the control group and 1.18 ± 1.24 for the treatment group. After 6 months, a decrease in pruritus by 30% was observed in the TUDCA group, while an increase in pruritus by 50% was observed in the placebo group (p < 0.05). Common side effects of UDCA or TUDCA included gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain, flatulence, and diarrhea.

Pruritus, fatigue, and metabolic bone disease are frequent complications of cholestatic liver diseases, which can be quite distressing for the patient and can considerably reduce the quality of life. The molecular pathogenesis of these extrahepatic manifestations of cholestasis is poorly understood, and hypotheses to explain these symptoms are being discussed. This article provides treatment recommendations for the complications of cholestasis based on putative pathomechanisms and summarizes recent experimental and clinical data involving management options.

### Lysophosphatidic acid is a potential mediator of cholestatic pruritus [^115ZX7Bu]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Pruritus is a common and disabling symptom in cholestatic disorders. However, its causes remain unknown. We hypothesized that potential pruritogens accumulate in the circulation of cholestatic patients and activate sensory neurons.

Methods

Cytosolic free calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) was measured in neuronal cell lines by ratiometric fluorometry upon exposure to serum samples from pruritic patients with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), other cholestatic disorders, and pregnant, healthy, and nonpruritic disease controls. Putative [Ca(2+)](i)-inducing factors in pruritic serum were explored by analytical techniques, including quantification by high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy. In mice, scratch activity after intradermal pruritogen injection was quantified using a magnetic device.

Results

Transient increases in neuronal [Ca(2+)](i) induced by pruritic PBC and ICP sera were higher than corresponding controls. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) could be identified as a major [Ca(2+)](i) agonist in pruritic sera, and LPA concentrations were increased in cholestatic patients with pruritus. LPA injected intradermally into mice induced scratch responses. Autotaxin, the serum enzyme converting lysophosphatidylcholine into LPA, was markedly increased in patients with ICP versus pregnant controls (P < .0001) and cholestatic patients with versus without pruritus (P < .0001). Autotaxin activity correlated with intensity of pruritus (P < .0001), which was not the case for serum bile salts, histamine, tryptase, substance P, or mu-opioids. In patients with PBC who underwent temporary nasobiliary drainage, both itch intensity and autotaxin activity markedly decreased during drainage and returned to preexistent levels after drain removal.

Conclusions

We suggest that LPA and autotaxin play a critical role in cholestatic pruritus and may serve as potential targets for future therapeutic interventions.

### Safety and efficacy of long-term nasobiliary drainage to treat intractable pruritus in cholestatic liver disease [^111caNHA]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cholestasis related pruritus, secondary to intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic biliary obstruction is a common manifestation in chronic liver disease. Pruritus is difficult to treat, and results are often suboptimal. A stepwise medical approach is usually employed, followed by a trial molecular adsorbents recirculation system in medication resistant cases. Pruritus resulting in reduced quality of life is a variant syndrome eligible for liver transplantation in the setting of preserved synthetic function.

Aim

This case series describes the use of long-term (LT) nasobiliary drainage (NBD) in three patients with intractable pruritus. This case series tests the hypothesis that LT-NBD could be successfully used to alleviate cholestasis related pruritus, and prevent or delay the need for liver transplantation.

Method

LT-NBD was carried out in three female patients (mean age 43years) with intractable pruritus secondary to primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) (n = 2), and benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (n = 1). NBD was carried out through the endoscopic placement of a 6 French Cook Medical nasobiliary catheter into the common bile duct.

Results

Symptomatic relief of pruritus was described by all three cases within 24h of NBD placement. LT-NBD was stopped in the patient with benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis after 8weeks due to complete resolution of pruritus. In one patient with PBC, LT-NBD was undertaken over 12months, with complete resolution of pruritus. In the second patient with PBC, LT-NBD was carried out over 14months, with complete resolution of pruritus.

Discussion

This case series supports the efficacy of LT-NBD in the treatment of intractable pruritus. We propose that NBD offers an accessible modality for the treatment of intractable pruritus in liver disease, potentially avoiding the need for liver transplantation.

### BAT117213: ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibition as a treatment for pruritus in primary biliary cirrhosis: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^112nTDk7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

IBAT2330672 trial

The apparent lack of novel drug development in cholestatic pruritus can be attributed partly to incomplete understanding of the complex pathophysiology of the disease. More recent advances in molecular research have identified novel targets for drug development in cholestasis. IBAT inhibitors are novel class of drugs with therapeutic potential in cholestasis. They have been shown be beneficial in cholestasis by the experimental studies and their desired effects on serum and faecal bile acid profile has been proven in healthy people.

The BAT117213 study is the first phase 2 multicentre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover trial designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of IBAT inhibitor in PBC patients with pruritus. Unlike the only other phase 2 trial of an IBAT inhibitor drug (LUM001) in PBC (CLARITY study, NCT01904058), the main strength of the BAT117213 study is its crossover design which allows estimating the treatment effect in a smaller number of patients and reduces the between-patient variability and yields a more efficient comparison of treatments than a similar sized parallel group trial. In the BAT117213 study every patient will receive both the study drug and the placebo; therefore each patient will serve as his/her own matched control.

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) — indications and outcomes — Therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid has improved outcomes in PBC, reflected in a decrease in the number of patients with PBC requiring LT. Transplant outcomes in PBC are excellent, with 5-year patient survival rates of 80–85% after either living or deceased donor transplantation. 34. LT is indicated for decompensated PBC (1-A). 35. Severe pruritus, refractory to medical therapy, may also be an indication for LT (1-B).

### APASL clinical practice guidance: the diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^116AhDj7]. Hepatology International (2022). High credibility.

APASL PBC guidance — Liver transplantation indications and outcomes: Liver transplantation (LT) should be considered in PBC patients with decompensated cirrhosis (ascites, variceal hemorrhage, or hepatic encephalopathy), with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score > 15, or with a Mayo Risk Score > 7.8, and severe intractable pruritus that heavily compromises the HRQoL is an exceptional indication. Long-term outcomes are favorable with a 5-year survival rate of 80–85%, while post-transplant recurrence occurs approximately in 22%, 21–37%, and 40% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively, with a median time range of 3–6.9 years; diagnosis relies on histology and biochemical abnormalities since AMA may remain positive after LT even without recurrence.

### Recent developments in the management of idiopathic cholestatic liver disease [^1175QyP2]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Management of pruritus in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can occur in patients with PBC; a study involving 725 PBC patients followed up for a period of 9 years showed an estimated risk of 0.36 per 100 patient years for the development of HCC where 3% of patients developed HCC during the period of follow-up. Advanced histologic stage and male sex were the only reported risk factors for development of HCC in patients with PBC.

Finally, liver transplantation is an excellent option for patients with late-stage disease as the improvement in survival is outstanding. Patients are transplanted for reasons including decompensation of liver disease leading to a poor quality of life, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or persistent ascites not responding to other treatment modalities, developing complications such as encephalopathy, HCC or recurrent bleeding esophageal varices or anticipated death within one year.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary biliary cholangitis: a patient-friendly summary of the 2018 AASLD practice guidance [^114f7JWu]. Clinical Liver Disease (2021). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — definition, course, and care needs: Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system harms the liver by mistakenly attacking bile ducts, and in PBC it is primarily the small ducts in the liver that are harmed, leading to substances accumulating in the liver and blood that cause itching, fatigue, and issues with the body's metabolism; in late stages, PBC can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. The direct cause is not completely known and is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers, and people with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment; however, most people respond very well to medical treatment. As a chronic condition, individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care.

### Jaundice in non-cirrhotic primary biliary cirrhosis: the premature ductopenic variant [^115GBAfK]. Gut (2001). Low credibility.

The clinical and pathological findings of four females with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with an unusual and hitherto not well recognised course are reported. Patients suffered severe pruritus and weight loss with progressive icteric cholestasis which did not respond to such treatments as ursodeoxycholic acid and immunosuppressives. In all cases liver histology revealed marked bile duct loss without however significant fibrosis or cirrhosis. Further diagnostic studies and repeat biopsies confirmed the absence of liver cirrhosis as well as other potential causes of hyperbilirubinaemia. Comparison of the fibrosis-ductopenia relationship for our cases with that for a group of 101 non-cirrhotic PBC patients indicated that in the former the severity of bile duct loss relative to the amount of fibrosis was significantly higher. The proportion of portal triads containing an interlobular bile duct was 3%, 4%, 6%, and 10% compared with 45% (median; range 8.3–100%) for controls (p < 0.001). Three patients received a liver transplant 6–7 years after the first manifestation of PBC because of progressive cholestasis, refractory pruritus, and weight loss, while the fourth patient is considering this option. In one case cirrhosis had developed at the time of transplantation while the others still had non-cirrhotic disease. These cases suggest that cholestatic jaundice in non-cirrhotic PBC may be secondary to extensive "premature" or accelerated intrahepatic bile duct loss. Although the extent of fibrosis may be limited initially, progression to cirrhosis appears to be inevitable in the long run. Despite intact protein synthesis and absence of cirrhotic complications, liver transplantation in the pre-cirrhotic stage for preventing malnutrition and to improve quality of life should be considered for these patients.

### AASLD practice guidance on primary sclerosing cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma [^114MFtyc]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Liver transplantation (LT) for cirrhosis/cholangitis/CCA in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) — PSC accounts for approximately 5% of LTs annually in the United States. Typical transplant indications for PSC are life-threatening complications of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, intractable pruritus, recurrent bacterial cholangitis, and early-stage CCA. Patients with PSC with cirrhosis and at least two admissions to the hospital within a 1-year period for acute cholangitis with a documented bloodstream infection or evidence of sepsis including hemodynamic instability requiring vasopressors qualify for MELD exceptions.

### Clinical aspects and management of chronic itch [^111WKGoK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic pruritus (CP) (ie, itch that persists for more than 6 weeks) poses significant challenges to patients' health and quality of life. It is a common reason for visits to dermatologists and general practitioners and can be caused by a range of conditions, including systemic diseases such as chronic kidney disease or liver diseases, malignancies, neuropathic conditions, and dermatoses such as atopic dermatitis. CP often does not develop in parallel with the course of the disease and can become an entity of its own, which must be treated with antipruritic drugs, even if the underlying cause is already under therapy. Depending on the etiology of CP, different pathways in the pathogenesis have been analyzed recently, following which new treatments have been developed and tested in randomized controlled trials. This article discusses the recent results of these studies and highlights how best to manage health care for patients with CP.

### Systematic review: efficacy of therapies for cholestatic pruritus [^1166BiwV]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Data sources and methods

Search strategy

We comprehensively searched four major databases: EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. From their inception until 11 March 2023, we searched these databases to identify all relevant studies on CP therapies. We also explored ongoing clinical trials related to CP therapies on ClinicalTrial.gov and reviewed conference proceedings. This was necessary because CP therapies have rapidly evolved in recent years, and new therapies may have yet to be fully documented in published literature. To ensure the accuracy and completeness of our review, we followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, a widely recognized tool for conducting systematic reviews. We limited our search to articles published in English to ensure consistency in our review.

To capture the most relevant studies, we used a set of keywords that included ' pruritus ', ' cholestasis ', ' cholestatic pruritus ', ' cholestasis associated pruritus ", cholestatic liver disease ", itch ', and ' IBAT inhibitors ' in our initial review.

Study eligibility

The methods used in this study involved conducting a comprehensive literature search across various databases, with no limitations placed on the duration of the studies or the follow-up period. The search results were then screened by two independent reviewers using a two-step process, which involved evaluating the title and abstract of each article, reviewing the full text of relevant articles, and examining the references cited within those articles to identify any additional relevant publications. Inclusion criteria: (a) experimental and observational studies related to CP therapy that reported our study's primary endpoint, that is, the severity of CP after systemic treatments. Exclusion criteria: (a) non-human subjects' studies; (b) studies not published in English; (c) studies that did not investigate CP, letters, and systemic review articles; and (d) studies that did not provide sufficient data on participants' responses before and after CP treatment. To ensure the reliability of the study, any discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by consensus. This process helped to ensure that the final sample of articles included in the analysis was relevant and met the study's inclusion criteria (see Figure 1).

### ACG clinical guideline: primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113m1C23]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis — pruritus management states that "The management of pruritus should be directed to the underlying cause of cholestasis. In PSC, therapeutic intervention for patients with a dominant stricture should be considered". Symptomatic care includes "Mild pruritus may be treated with skin emollients and possibly antihistamines", and "More severe pruritus is best managed by bile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine", with "A total daily dose of cholestyramine of 4–16 g is needed to maintain symptom control (124)". Second-line options are specified: "Second-line therapies include rifampin, at a dose of 150–300 mg twice daily (liver tests and serum bilirubin should be monitored during rifampin therapy to evaluate for hepatotoxicity), naltrexone (up to 50 mg/day), sertraline (75–100 mg per day) or phenobarbital (90 mg at bedtime) (125,126)".

### Systematic review: efficacy of therapies for cholestatic pruritus [^111Kzt6p]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The initial approach to CP involves addresses the underlying cause, such as endoscopic treatment for dominant strictures in PSC and discontinuing causative medications in drug-induced cholestasis. Mild CP can be relieved with warm baths, emollients, and antihistamines. For moderate to severe cases or when the underlying pathology cannot be treated, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver suggest a stepwise drug approach. However, the effectiveness of this stepwise drug approach varies, working for some patients but not others. As a result, there is growing interest in exploring experimental methods for CP treatment. Our systematic review aims to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive review of conventional and investigational approaches to managing CP, which would be helpful for clinicians, researchers, and patients.

### Long-term efficacy of sertraline as a treatment for cholestatic pruritus in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis [^1152p69r]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Generalized pruritus is a common complication of cholestatic liver diseases, although its pathogenesis remains elusive. Current treatments are often inadequate and may be poorly tolerated, so the clinician is sometimes faced with a patient in misery and no good therapeutic options. Because, in our experience, several patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) claimed that sertraline had improved their pruritus, we sought to determine whether sertraline use was associated with changes in pruritus medications or self-reported severity of pruritus in a large cohort of patients with PBC.

Methods

The self-reported severity of pruritus was followed prospectively in 40 patients with PBC for a mean of 7.5 ± 1.3 yr. These data were then retrospectively examined to determine the effect of sertraline on pruritus in all subjects who had received sertraline at some time during the study.

Results

For 28 of 32 patients with pruritus, itching was stable or fluctuated slightly over the follow-up period. No patient experienced rapid progression of pruritus, and four patients experienced a sustained resolution of their pruritus. Ten subjects started sertraline and continued it long enough (> 6 months) to determine its lasting effect on pruritus. Three of these individuals did not have significant pruritus before or after sertraline. Of the seven patients with pruritus, six (86%) recorded a significant reduction or resolution of pruritus in their weekly diaries and also decreased or completely stopped other medications for pruritus.

Conclusions

Sertraline use is associated with an improvement in cholestatic pruritus. This novel observation implies that serotonergic fibers are important in regulating the perception of itch.

### Pruritus of liver disease (xanthomatous biliary cirrhosis) [^115ECkRQ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

FOR MANY years the dermatologist and the internist have been aware of the cutaneous manifestations of liver disease, such as spider nevi, xanthomata, erythema palmare, jaundice, and pruritus, but the mechanism by which some of these are produced has gone unanswered. This is particularly true of pruritus associated with liver disease, and the time-honored fact that the retention of bile salts causes an irritation of the nerve ending does not seem to be the complete answer. It is a well-known fact that in certain severe parenchymal diseases of the liver, as well as in hemolytic anemias, the jaundice may be equally as severe as the obstructive type; yet the pruritus is either absent or much less severe. The purpose of this paper is to point out that generalized pruritus from liver disease is not a rarity in the absence of clinical or laboratory jaundice and that the relief of. HICKS JH, MULLINS JF.

Table 1.
Prevalence of pruritus in CLDs.

Existing literature hypothesizes that in CLDs, potential pruritogens circulate systemically. When these molecules are excreted in bile, they undergo enterohepatic circulation (the efficient movement of bile acid molecules from the liver to the small intestine and back to the liver). As they undergo enterohepatic circulation, they are bio-transformed to pruritogens by cytochrome enzyme inducers in the liver and gut. The release of these pruritogens into plasma and tissues stimulates pruritogenic neural fibers in the skin that transmits an itch signal to the spinal cord and brain. The most compelling evidence suggests that circulating serum bile acids (s-BAs), which activate a G protein-coupled receptor−MRGPRX4, are the principal pruritogens evident by CP attenuation following treatment with bile acid resins, plasmapheresis, apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter inhibitors, nasobiliary drainage (NBD), etc. Endogenous opioids have also been linked to CP pathogenesis. Its effect varies depending on the receptor subtype activated. Opioid activity on μ-opioid receptors (MOR) induces pruritus, while incitement of κ-opioid receptors (KOR) inhibits pruritus. An imbalance between MOR (increased) and KOR (decreased) may cause pruritus in conditions such as CLDs and end-stage renal disease. In addition, progressive liver diseases reduce the hepatic clearance of endogenous opioids, leading to increased circulation of endogenous opioids. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a signaling molecule that acts on the G-coupled receptor (LPAR5) of many cells, autotaxin (ATX)−an enzyme that hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine into LPA, serotonin, Substance P acting on NK-1 receptors, and histamine on H1 and H4 receptors have also been linked to pruritogenic signaling cascade in CLDs.– Because the underlying mechanism of CP has yet to be fully understood, managing CP remains challenging.

Study objectives and outcomes

The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of oral GSK2330672 compared with placebo when administered for 14 days to PBC patients treated with UDCA. The secondary objectives are: 1) to evaluate the effects of oral GSK2330672 on subjects' experience of pruritus and its impact; 2) to demonstrate the lack of effect of oral GSK2330672 on steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of UDCA when UDCA is administered alone or in combination with GSK2330672; 3) to investigate the steady state PK of oral GSK2330672; 4) to evaluate the effects of oral GSK2330672 on total serum BA concentrations and serum markers of BA synthesis [7-alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4)]. Exploratory objectives of the study include investigating effects of 14-day oral administration of GSK2330672 on markers of disease progression, subject's experience of benefits and disadvantages with GSK2330672, metabonomics, microbiomics and pharmacogenomics. The primary, secondary and exploratory outcome measures are given in Table 2.

Recruitment and consent

The study is a UK multicentre study and recruitment was planned in three large, tertiary referral National Health Service (NHS) hospitals based in Newcastle, Birmingham and Cambridge. Patients were recruited from the out-patient department cohorts of these hospitals and in addition, trial information was published in newsletters and magazines from the UK-PBC research group and patient support groups (LIVErNORTH and PBC Foundation). Any PBC patient interested in participating in the study could contact the study team at the centre nearest to their location either directly or via referral from local primary or secondary care physicians. The UK-PBC platform was utilised for recruitment using a similar approach to the to the RIT-PBC trial reported recently by our group. The established UK-PBC database was screened for patients with PBC-40 itch domain scores meeting the definitions of persistent and/or severe pruritus. The clinicians looking after these patients were contacted to approach the patients and interested patients were referred to their local recruiting centre. All participants gave their written consent to participation before screening investigations were performed. Participants completed the consent process with study investigators trained in Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and assessment of capacity.

### BAT117213: ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibition as a treatment for pruritus in primary biliary cirrhosis: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^11572hpp]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Primary biliary cholangitis (cirrhosis) (PBC) is an autoimmune chronic cholestatic liver disease with a prevalence of 30/100,000, typically affecting middle aged women (female: male ratio 10:1). In untreated cases immunologically mediated chronic cholestasis ultimately results in liver cirrhosis with associated complications such as portal hypertension, varices, ascites, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. The precise aetiology of PBC is unclear, although genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a key role.

Pruritus (itch) is one of the characteristic symptoms of PBC and can affect patients at any stage of the disease. Recently, we studied the scale of the pruritus symptom within the United Kingdom (UK)-PBC cohort, a national cohort of over 3000 PBC patients recruited from every hospital in the UK. In this cohort 60–70% of PBC patients reported experience of pruritus at some point in the course of the disease, 30% had persistent pruritus and 15% suffered with severe pruritus since the diagnosis of PBC. A similar scale of symptom burden has also been reported in PBC cohorts from USA and Italy. Pruritus has a negative impact on perceived quality of life in PBC patients and has been associated with sleep deprivation, worsened day time fatigue and when severe, may lead to depression and suicidal tendencies.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), the current standard of care for PBC patients and the only licenced therapy for PBC has no role in treating pruritus. Current treatment of pruritus in PBC involves step-wise use of specific anti-pruritic agents in line with current international guidelines. These drugs include cholestyramine, rifampicin, naltrexone and sertraline. Of these, cholestyramine is the only licensed drug for treatment of cholestatic pruritus and use of other drugs is "off-label". The limitations of these drugs are that their efficacy is not universal, treatment is often associated with side effects and there is a need for regular monitoring for liver toxicity. Patients with medically refractory pruritus may either need to undergo phototherapy, invasive interventions such as nasobiliary drainage or extracorporeal albumin dialysis for temporary relief of pruritus, or may be considered for liver transplantation (LT) which is typically curative. Therefore, development of better drug therapies with fewer side effects is an unmet clinical need for PBC patients.

### Cholestatic syndromes [^115wip8A]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Further insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying hepatobiliary transport function and its regulation now permit a better understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment options of cholestatic liver diseases. Identification of the molecular basis of hereditary cholestatic syndromes will result in an improved diagnosis and management of these conditions. New insights into the pathogenesis of extrahepatic manifestations of cholestasis (eg, pruritus) have facilitated new treatment strategies. Important new studies have been published about the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, cholestasis of pregnancy, total parenteral nutrition-induced cholestasis, drug-induced cholestasis, and viral cholestatic syndromes.

### Effect of molecular adsorbent recirculating system in hepatitis C virus-related intractable pruritus [^1122Hs4W]. Liver Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Intractable pruritus is more common in cholestatic liver diseases and may be the presenting symptom and/or major complaint of hepatitis C and/or hepatitic C virus-related cirrhosis. From September 2000 to May 2002, three patients affected by intractable pruritus secondary to hepatitis C cirrhosis that failed medical treatment were treated with a molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS). MARS is an artificial liver support system that aims to clear the blood of metabolic waste products normally metabolized by the liver. Each patient underwent seven MARS sessions. Liver function tests, the 36-Item Short Form quality-of-life test, visual analog scale for itching, and bile acid measurement in the serum, albumin circuit and ultrafiltrate were performed before and after each MARS session. Moreover, at hospital admission, each patient underwent a psychological workup and abdominal imaging study. Subjective improvement in pruritus and quality of life, along with a decrease in serum bile acid concentration, was observed in every patient; no patient underwent retreatment and/or liver transplantation up to a 9-month follow-up. One patient died 201 days after MARS treatment. Although we observed a decreased level of serum bile acids, one cannot conclude that this was the mechanism of action for the reduction in pruritus intensity in patients in our series. Different toxins and/or a placebo effect might have had a role in this setting.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: pathogenesis and therapeutic opportunities [^114RQyK6]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis is a chronic, seropositive and female-predominant inflammatory and cholestatic liver disease, which has a variable rate of progression towards biliary cirrhosis. Substantial progress has been made in patient risk stratification with the goal of personalized care, including early adoption of next-generation therapy with licensed use of obeticholic acid or off-label fibrate derivatives for those with insufficient benefit from ursodeoxycholic acid, the current first-line drug. The disease biology spans genetic risk, epigenetic changes, dysregulated mucosal immunity and altered biliary epithelial cell function, all of which interact and arise in the context of ill-defined environmental triggers. A current focus of research on nuclear receptor pathway modulation that specifically and potently improves biliary excretion, reduces inflammation and attenuates fibrosis is redefining therapy. Patients are benefiting from pharmacological agonists of farnesoid X receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Immunotherapy remains a challenge, with a lack of target definition, pleiotropic immune pathways and an interplay between hepatic immune responses and cholestasis, wherein bile acid-induced inflammation and fibrosis are dominant clinically. The management of patient symptoms, particularly pruritus, is a notable goal reflected in the development of rational therapy with apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter inhibitors.

### Mediators of pruritus during cholestasis [^114Ln9SQ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pruritus is a frequent symptom in patients with cholestatic liver diseases. Itching may be excruciating, may seriously impair quality of life and even induce suicidal ideation in the most severe cases.

Recent Findings

The molecular mechanism of itch signal transduction in cholestasis is largely unclear. It may be caused or potentiated by compounds that accumulate in the circulation during cholestasis, which either directly or indirectly affect signalling in itch fibres. In the past, bile salts and endogenous opioids have been proposed but never been proven to be key factors in itch perception during cholestasis. We have performed a screen for compounds in plasma from patients with various cholestatic conditions for their capacity to activate neuronal cell lines. In these sera, we could identify a potent neuronal activator as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA is a very potent signalling phospholipid that can activate cells through various LPA receptors. Quite strikingly, samples from itchy cholestatic patients contained higher amounts of LPA. These increased levels of LPA turned out to be caused by elevated levels of serum autotaxin, the enzyme that converts lysophosphatidylcholine into LPA. This is a striking finding, as autotaxin has never been connected to itch perception thus far. We have also shown that LPA, when injected intradermally, caused scratching behaviour in mice.

Summary

On the basis of our results, we hypothesize that during cholestasis expression of autotaxin is induced, which gives rise to increased local formation of LPA near unmyelinated nerve endings of itch fibres. LPA activates these neurons through one of the LPA receptors, which in turn potentiates action potentials along itch fibres leading to the perception of pruritus.

### The treatment of primary biliary cholangitis: from shadow to light [^114Y2eP6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

OCA is contraindicated in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis. This conclusion was drawn based on the observations in 25 cirrhotic patients. In 10 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension, decompensation of cirrhosis occurred; in the remaining patients who had decompensation of liver cirrhosis before starting OCA treatment, liver failure occurred during treatment. Four patients had to undergo liver transplantation, two of whom died. In the updated recommendations for the treatment of PBC, the FDA states that OCA treatment is contraindicated in patients with advanced cirrhosis. This is defined by evidence of decompensated cirrhosis, currently or in the past, or if signs of portal hypertension are detected. These patients should not be treated, even at reduced doses.

Possible side effects may also be a limiting factor for the administration of OCA. A meta-analysis of eight studies of patients with PBC and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis treated with OCA showed that OCA increased the risk of pruritus by about 75% and the risk of constipation by about 88%.

OCA is an effective treatment for patients with PBC who have not responded to UDCA therapy or who have not tolerated UDCA therapy. It is currently the only approved second-line treatment for PBC. OCA is contraindicated in advanced liver cirrhosis.

Pruritus remains a significant problem facing dermatologists and can be associated with various dermatoses and systemic derangements. At times, one can treat the underlying cutaneous or systemic process to alleviate itch. However, it is frequently challenging to identify the cause of a patient's itch and, in this situation, even more difficult to manage the symptom effectively. In this article, the authors discuss the approach to a patient with generalized pruritus without clinically obvious dermatoses. They also addresses mechanisms and management modalities of itch in common systemic diseases, including cholestasis, uremia, and neuropathic dysfunction.

### Cholestatic pruritus: emerging mechanisms and therapeutics [^1148Bx9Z]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients suffering from cholestasis often report experiencing a debilitating, unrelenting itch. In contrast to conditions, such as urticaria, in which histamine primarily drives itch (pruritus), cholestatic pruritus is multifactorial and more difficult to treat. Existing therapies are not always effective and have undesirable adverse effect profiles. Here, we conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate conventional treatment strategy, current pathophysiologic understanding, and the role of new therapies in the context of cholestatic pruritus. We discuss novel findings implicating bile acids, lysophosphatidic acid, and bilirubin as potential important mediators of cholestatic itch. New therapies that aim to remove or modulate pruritogens have been supported in observational cohort studies and randomized controlled trials. Although these new therapies show promise, further research is needed to confirm the pathophysiology of cholestatic pruritus so that targeted therapy can be developed.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^114D76V3]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD Practice Guidance — pruritus management in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) notes that initial treatment includes moisturizing creams, avoidance of hot baths and rubbing of the skin, minimizing use of harsh soaps and detergents, and using loose-fitting clothing and cool humidified air; antihistamines may have sedating effects or exacerbate encephalopathy and are generally not efficacious for pruritus attributable to cholestasis, though their sedating properties may help pruritus-mediated sleep disturbances. Cholestyramine was shown to be effective in randomized studies with small numbers of patients (n = 8 and n = 10), and the recommended starting dose for cholestyramine is 4 g/d, with titration up to 16 g/d as needed and tolerated. For RIF, RIF should be initiated at a quarter dose and titrated slowly to 150–300 mg twice daily with careful monitoring of liver biochemistries, and RIF should not be used in patients with bilirubin levels > 2.5 mg/dL. Naltrexone for this indication requires a low dose, starting with 12.5 mg daily and up-titrating every 3–7 days to reach the maximum dose of 50 mg/d, and naltrexone use is also often inappropriate in persons receiving opioids for pain because it can block opioid binding, thus reducing analgesia and potentially causing opioid withdrawal. Sertraline has been shown to reduce cholestatic pruritus symptoms at 75- to 100-mg doses and, because sertraline is largely metabolized in the liver, it requires careful administration, for example a starting dose of 25 mg with titration in patients with DC.

Obeticholic acid (OCA) for PBC with inadequate response or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) shows biochemical improvements with defined dosing and safety cautions. In a phase II add‑on trial, three doses of OCA (10, 25, and 50 mg/day) were studied in patients with suboptimal response to UDCA (ALP > 1.5 x ULN), and ALP reductions persisted at the end of a 12‑month open‑label extension; in a phase II monotherapy study, ALP and other markers were reduced in both OCA 10 mg and OCA 50 mg groups at the end of a 3‑month double‑blind phase with improvement observed at the end of a 6‑year open‑label extension. In the phase III POISE program, after 12 months of OCA therapy nearly half of prior biochemical non‑responders or UDCA‑intolerant patients had better biochemical improvement than placebo, and a 3‑year interim analysis from the 5‑year extension showed ALP and total bilirubin significantly decreased after 12 months and 48 months. Common adverse events were pruritus (77%) and fatigue (33%), and dose‑dependent pruritus led to discontinuation in 15% (OCA 10 mg) to 38% (OCA 50 mg) of patients. The Food and Drug Administration warned that use of OCA in PBC patients with decompensated cirrhosis (Child–Pugh–Turcotte B and C) was associated with clinical worsening or even death, and use in decompensated cirrhosis was not recommended. Recommendation: 5. It is recommended that OCA (starting at 5 mg/day, increasing to 10 mg/day after 6 months if tolerated well) be added to UDCA therapy for PBC patients (non‑cirrhotic or cirrhosis with Child–Pugh–Turcotte A) and an inadequate response to UDCA or used as monotherapy in those intolerant to UDCA. Potential risks and adverse events of OCA should be discussed in detail with the patient, carefully evaluated and appropriately monitored.

Hepatic Adverse Reactions

In Trial 1, the following serious or otherwise clinically significant hepatic adverse reactions were reported at the recommended dosage of OCALIVA: one patient in the OCALIVA 10 mg treatment arm experienced ascites; one patient in the OCALIVA titration treatment arm experienced two episodes of ascites and four episodes of hepatic encephalopathy; one patient in the placebo treatment arm experienced variceal bleeding.

Pruritus

Approximately 60% of patients had a history of pruritus upon enrollment in Trial 1. Treatment-emergent pruritus, including all the terms described in Table 1, generally started within the first month following the initiation of treatment with OCALIVA.

The incidence of pruritus was higher in patients who started on OCALIVA 10 mg once daily relative to the OCALIVA titration arm, 70% and 56%, respectively. Discontinuation rates due to pruritus were also higher in patients who started on OCALIVA 10 mg once daily relative to the OCALIVA titration arm, 10% and 1%, respectively.

The number of patients with pruritus who required an intervention (e.g., dosage adjustment, treatment interruption, or initiation of bile acid binding resin or antihistamine) was 30 of 51 patients (59%) in the OCALIVA 10 mg arm, 24 of 39 patients (62%) in the OCALIVA titration arm, and 14 of 28 patients (50%) in the placebo arm.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of OCALIVA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure, particularly in PBC patients who have progressive liver disease.

### Plasma separation and anion adsorption transiently relieve intractable pruritus in primary biliary cirrhosis [^117GmKZ4]. Journal of Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Pruritus can be a severely disabling symptom in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis who do not respond to treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid, anion exchangers, enzyme inducers, or opiate antagonists. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy of plasma separation and anion adsorption in the treatment of intractable pruritus of cholestasis.

Methods

Three patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and intractable pruritus defined by severity of pruritus 7 on a rating scale between 0 (no pruritus) and 10 (maximal pruritus) on at least 4 of 7 days despite medical treatment were treated with plasma separation and anion adsorption on three consecutive days. Fatigue was assessed using the Fisk Fatigue Severity Score and quality of life was assessed by the PBC-40, a disease specific health related quality of life measure.

Results

Improvement in pruritus, fatigue, and quality of life was transiently observed in all patients. Serum bile acid levels showed no association with intensity of pruritus, and the bile acid pattern was not altered. The treatment was well tolerated by all patients.

Conclusions

Plasma separation and anion adsorption seem to be a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis suffering from intractable pruritus.

OCA titration strategies for pruritus management

If patients do not respond well to pruritus management strategies, OCA dose reduction or maintaining lowered dosages should be considered an option. There are several titration strategies that may help manage pruritus in patients who receive OCA, including delaying uptitration from 5 to 10 mg doses, taking a temporary down excursion from 10 to 5 mg doses, and temporary discontinuation of OCA until pruritus is controlled, followed by restarting medication with a slower uptitration. Figure 2 shows a practical guide to titration of OCA based on pruritus severity, as discussed by the expert panel. Pruritus severity can be difficult to quantify; clinicians may want to use itch scales such as the 5-D Itch Scale or VAS, which evaluate itch but were not developed for PBC.PBC severity tools, including the PBC-40, or the shorter and more quickly administered PBC-27, cover all aspects of PBC and have only four and three questions related to itch, respectively. The panel noted that pruritus may be subjective and have an aspect of clinical judgement in its diagnosis. The panel members did not have a specific scale that they used or recommended; however, for clinicians interested in scoring patients individually, the previously mentioned analytical tools can be used for patient management by employing the same scale at baseline and follow-up visits. It is important to note that making a clinical judgement on upward or downward titration, or temporarily pausing treatment to help alleviate symptoms, may not depend solely on pruritus symptoms but may also depend on the presence or absence of cirrhosis, or other markers of PBC disease progression. For example, OCA is not recommended for patients with decompensated PBC, and patients who have moderate or severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) should receive once-weekly doses of OCA 5 mg to start, with uptitration to twice-weekly doses if the drug is tolerated. While patients with non-cirrhotic or compensated Child-Pugh A may titrate up to daily 10 mg doses of OCA, the maximum dose for patients with Child-Pugh class B or C is 10 mg doses twice a week, with 3 days between doses. The benefits of dose changes, whether temporary or permanent, for pruritus management should be weighed against the PBC disease progression risks. However, the expert panel expressed that at any time throughout treatment with OCA, any patient experiencing pruritus should have a choice to reduce or pause OCA treatment as necessary to help manage symptoms, in consultation with their clinicians, particularly for those patients experiencing moderate to severe pruritus. The panel felt that patients should be considered a partner in disease management and in managing adverse events, and should have an equal voice in treatment decision-making, including starting, stopping, and modifying treatment dosage.

### Naltrexone for cholestatic itch: a systematic review [^116canvz]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2021). High credibility.

Background

Cholestatic itch is caused by intrahepatic liver diseases, such as primary biliary cirrhosis and extrahepatic obstruction of the biliary tree, often caused by tumours. The pathophysiology of cholestatic itch is complex and no single treatment has proved definitive. Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist, which reduces central opioidergic tone, believed to be raised in patients with cholestatic pruritus.

Aim

To review and assess the efficacy of oral naltrexone for the treatment of cholestatic itch.

Methods

Search of electronic databases, grey literature, clinical trials registries and handsearching for studies including naltrexone for cholestatic itch. Full papers were obtained if relevant and studies graded.

Results

Thirteen papers were included in the analysis, including three randomised controlled trials, one controlled clinical trial, one open-label pilot study, seven case reports and one retrospective notes review. All studies found naltrexone to be effective in relieving pruritus. In all five studies performing statistical analysis, naltrexone significantly reduced pruritus compared with baseline. 37% of patients reported side effects, notably opioid withdrawal-type reactions and recurrence of previous pain, from all pathologies.

Conclusions

Oral naltrexone therapy helps relieve cholestatic itch and although it should be used with caution in patients using exogenous opioids for analgesia, it should be considered when treating refractory pruritus in patients with end-stage liver disease.

### Pruritus in patients with chronic liver disease and serum autotaxin levels in patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^112DuuCb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pruritus is defined as an unpleasant sensation that triggers the need to scratch. It develops in association with chronic liver diseases, including hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and obstructive jaundice. Pruritus associated with chronic liver disease tends to be generalized and is not relieved by scratching, with marked negative impact on the quality of life of the patients. The intensity of pruritus does not correlate with biochemical indices of liver disease; thus, several factors might contribute directly or indirectly to pruritus. However, factors associated with severe pruritus in patients with chronic liver disease are not well known. Although several therapeutic options such as cholestyramine, antihistamines, hypnotics, ursodeoxycholic acid, anti-allergic agents, and nalfurafine hydrochloride are available for pruritus, the efficacy of each of these drugs is limited. Therefore, establishment of useful prediction markers for pruritus in chronic liver disease is required.

Autotaxin is a secreted enzyme originally discovered in conditioned medium from A2058 human melanoma cell cultures and has important functions in converting lysophosphatidylcholine to lysophosphatidic acid. Serum autotaxin levels increase with progression of liver fibrosis caused by various etiologies such as chronic hepatitis C, chronic hepatitis B, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and PBC, and serum autotaxin level is also associated with pruritus in patients with cholestasis.

In the present study, we undertook an interview-based survey and investigated the frequency and severity of pruritus and factors associated with severe pruritus based on a large number of patients with chronic liver disease. We also analyzed the relationship between serum autotaxin levels and liver fibrosis and pruritus in patients with PBC.

### Cholestatic liver diseases of genetic etiology: advances and controversies [^111ZPpkC]. Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

With the application of modern investigative technologies, cholestatic liver diseases of genetic etiology are increasingly identified as the root cause of previously designated "idiopathic" adult and pediatric liver diseases. Here, we review advances in the field enhanced by a deeper understanding of the phenotypes associated with specific gene defects that lead to cholestatic liver diseases. There are evolving areas for clinicians in the current era specifically regarding the role for biopsy and opportunities for a "sequencing first" approach. Risk stratification based on the severity of the genetic defect holds promise to guide the decision to pursue primary liver transplantation versus medical therapy or nontransplant surgery, as well as early screening for HCC. In the present era, the expanding toolbox of recently approved therapies for hepatologists has real potential to help many of our patients with genetic causes of cholestasis. In addition, there are promising agents under study in the pipeline. Relevant to the current era, there are still gaps in knowledge of causation and pathogenesis and lack of fully accepted biomarkers of disease progression and pruritus. We discuss strategies to overcome the challenges of genotype-phenotype correlation and draw attention to the extrahepatic manifestations of these diseases. Finally, with attention to identifying causes and treatments of genetic cholestatic disorders, we anticipate a vibrant future of this dynamic field which builds upon current and future therapies, real-world evaluations of individual and combined therapeutics, and the potential incorporation of effective gene editing and gene additive technologies.

### Management of chronic hepatic itch [^116DjLVX]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatic itch remains among the most agonizing symptoms for affected patients and a major clinical challenge for physicians. Pruritus may occur in almost all liver diseases, particularly those with cholestatic features. Hepatic itch arises irrespective of the severity of the underlying liver disease or extent of cholestasis. Antihistamines are ineffective in hepatic itch. Therapeutic recommendations consist of a guideline-based stepwise approach, starting with the anion exchange resin cholestyramine, followed by rifampicin, naltrexone, and sertraline. Bezafibrate and ileal bile acid transporter inhibitors are promising future treatment options. Experimental and invasive procedures should be reserved for refractory pruritus.

### Itch: epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic workup [^111XYUnR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Itch, or pruritus, is the uncomfortable sensation underlying the desire to scratch. Itch is a very common complaint in the general population that can result from dermatologic, systemic (eg, renal, hepatobiliary, endocrine), paraneoplastic, neuropathic, and psychogenic etiologies. Chronic itch is associated with significant sleep disturbances and profoundly reduces overall quality of life. Certain populations, including elderly and African Americans, are at increased risk of experiencing heightened burden of itch. Because of the variable clinical presentation and wide-ranging etiologies, itch presents a challenge for clinicians. The initial evaluation should include a complete blood count, with differential, hepatic, renal, and thyroid function testing along with diabetes screening. Further testing should be guided by history and physical examination findings. There should be a heightened concern for underlying malignancy in individuals older than 60 years of age who have a history of liver disease and diffuse itch less than 12 months of duration. For individuals with chronic pruritus of unknown origin, increased blood eosinophils may serve as a biomarker of T helper cell type 2 polarization and response to immunomodulator therapies. In this first part of a 2-part continuing medical education series, we describe the broader epidemiology and specific conditions associated with itch and the clinical presentation and diagnostic workup for patients with itch.

### Disorders of bile formation and biliary transport [^115raUtY]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

A wide range of cholestatic liver diseases result from various primary defects in bile formation. Clinical features include jaundice, pruritus, failure to thrive, fat malabsorption, cholelithiasis, and variably progressive cirrhosis. Accurate diagnosis of these disorders is essential for determination of prognosis and selection of the most appropriate therapies. Severe genetic defects in canalicular bile acid and phospholipid excretion lead to progressive liver disease that often requires liver transplantation. Defects in bile acid biosynthesis and aminophospholipid transport may be responsive to medical or non-transplant surgical approaches.

### Understanding pruritus in systemic disease [^114PJjKT]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2001). Low credibility.

Many pruritic conditions do not originate in the skin, but are the result of systemic abnormality. Among the diseases that can cause pruritus are renal insufficiency, cholestasis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, polycythemia vera, solid tumors, and many others. Other pruritic conditions appear to be iatrogenic; opioid-induced pruritus may be the most important in palliative medicine. Successful treatment of the underlying condition usually relieves itch. But, with time, many diseases progress and treatment of the cause will be impossible. Topical treatments may be of limited value. Strategies involving systemic treatments include use of antidepressants, oral opioid antagonists, or cholestyramine. There is no one cure for all pruritic symptoms. Better understanding of mechanisms of pruritus may help develop better treatments.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^115nzFJt]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Guidance statements — sleep disturbances in decompensated cirrhosis state: Clinicians should first evaluate and treat underlying causes for insomnia such as HE, pruritus, obstructive sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome. Clinicians should perform a thorough assessment of the timing of physical activity, meals, and medications to promote good sleep hygiene. Mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy approaches can be considered in patients with cirrhosis and disordered sleep. Short-term use of melatonin 3 mg or hydroxyzine 25 mg nightly can improve sleep quality in patients with Child-Pugh A and B cirrhosis, but data on long-term use of these medications are limited. Although chronic use of benzodiazepines should be generally avoided in patients with DC, specific clinical circumstances may warrant their use, such as anxiety at the end of life when comfort is the stated priority.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^1173ewPM]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Table 6 — Palliative symptom management in decompensated cirrhosis outlines options for dyspnea, muscle cramps, pruritus, and nausea/vomiting. For dyspnea, nonpharmacotherapies include managing reversible causes, bedside fans, supplemental oxygen therapy, mindfulness-based practices, paracentesis, thoracentesis, and placement of drains in hospice settings; pharmacotherapies note that opioids can be used cautiously in select cases at the end of life with an example starting dose of i.v. hydromorphone 0.2 mg every 3 h as needed, and anxiolytics can be considered for dyspnea‑associated anxiety. For muscle cramps, taurine (2–3 g daily), vitamin E (300 mg three times a day), and baclofen (5–10 mg three times a day) are listed. For pruritus, cholestyramine (4 g/d, titrated to 16 g/d if needed) and sertraline (25 mg/d, titrated to 75–100 mg if needed) are options; RIF and naltrexone may improve pruritus but have limited use in palliative treatment of patients with DC, and antihistamines may help pruritus‑associated sleep disturbance given their sedating properties. For nausea and vomiting, antacids (if contributing reflux) are included; ondansetron, up to 8 mg/d is preferred; metoclopramide up to 60 mg/d is noted, with alternatives such as prochlorperazine or haloperidol depending on goals of care; acupuncture is mentioned with caution if platelets < 50,000.

### The British society of gastroenterology / UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^113pWqRz]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendation 20

We recommend all patients should be evaluated for the presence of symptoms, particularly fatigue and itch. Clinicians should recognise that the severity of symptoms does not correlate with stage of disease. (Strong; Moderate)

Pruritus

Pruritus is one of the characteristic cholestatic symptoms in PBC and results in impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Approximately 80% of patients experience pruritus at some time during the course of their disease. It can occur at any stage of the disease process, but it is important to note that itch can improve as liver disease worsens. Patients with the ductopenic variant of PBC have particular problems with itch. Follow-up of patients and evaluation of change in pruritus and potential side effects is appropriate when changes are made in anti-pruritic therapy.

Bile duct obstruction must be excluded as the cause of pruritus, given the increased risk of gallstone disease in PBC, although in practice this distinction is rarely problematic. Bile sequestrants are used as first-line therapy but tolerability is often an issue with side effects including bloating and constipation. Cholestyramine is a non-absorbable resin that may help relieve pruritus. It is important to note that bile sequestrants must be given 2–4 hours before or after other medications (in particular UDCA) as they interfere with intestinal absorption. Patient education is important here (by clinicians and pharmacists) to avoid drug interactions. There is limited evidence to suggest that UDCA has any effect on pruritus. Colesevelam is a newer, often better tolerated, bile sequestrant which may have a role in management given the better side effect profile compared with cholestyramine. Despite clinicians describing anecdotal experience of benefit, and significant decreases in serum bile acid levels, a recent placebo-controlled trial failed to demonstrate effectiveness.

### IL-31 levels correlate with pruritus in patients with cholestatic and metabolic liver diseases and is farnesoid X receptor responsive in NASH [^1111pR96]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

The notion that multiple molecular mediators may differentially contribute to a complex symptom such as pruritus is suggested by the discrepant findings in this study in which patients with NASH demonstrated induction of IL‐31 with cilofexor, whereas patients with PBC and PSC showed no increase. In patients with PSC and PBC, baseline IL‐31 levels correlated with pruritus, but levels of IL‐31 were six to nine‐fold higher in patients with PBC/PSC versus cirrhotic NASH at baseline. In the Phase 2 NASH study, cilofexor led to a 13‐fold increase in IL‐31 levels that were associated with the development of pruritus. These cilofexor‐induced levels, however, were still below the levels seen in cholestatic liver disease at baseline prior to cilofexor treatment. In contrast, cilofexor did not increase IL‐31 in both cholestatic diseases, suggesting a potential "ceiling" effect of this cytokine. Determining the relative contribution of IL‐31 in mediating pruritus in these various liver diseases will likely require targeted therapies that interfere with IL‐31 directly.

Identification of IL‐31 as a causative pruritogen in other liver diseases, most notably cholestatic disorders, could provide clinical benefit to patients suffering from intractable pruritus. The ileal BA transporter (IBAT) inhibitor, linerixibat, reduced cholestatic itch in patients with PBC with moderate‐to‐severe pruritus; another IBAT inhibitor, maralixibat, reduced serum BA levels and pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome, an inherited cholestatic disease often characterized by severe pruritus. Determining whether IL‐31 levels decline in response to successful antipruritic interventions such as BA binding resins or IBAT inhibitors would provide further support for the role of IL‐31 in mediating cholestatic pruritus. Therapeutics directly targeting IL‐31 such as nemolizumab (an anti–IL‐31RA antibody) and abrocitinib (a Janus kinase inhibitor, targeting IL‐31 and other inflammatory pathways) have demonstrated efficacy in mitigating pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis. In addition to their ability to ameliorate pruritus in patients with atopic dermatitis, these molecules also have a known safety profile. Future randomized trials using clinically characterized anti–IL‐31 blocking agents would provide a critical test of IL‐31's role as a cytokine in mediating the pruritus associated with cholestatic diseases.

### Sertraline as a first-line treatment for cholestatic pruritus [^114f27fF]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Pruritus is frequently the most debilitating symptom of cholestatic liver diseases. Moreover, existing therapies are often ineffective. Recent small, retrospective case series reports suggest that serotonin reuptake inhibitors can improve pruritus. This study was undertaken to establish the dose of sertraline and to evaluate its efficacy for cholestatic pruritus. Twenty one subjects with chronic pruritus due to liver disease (including primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, chronic hepatitis C, and postnecrotic cirrhosis) initially underwent an open-label, dose escalation to determine the dose with optimal efficacy and tolerability. After a washout period, 12 of the subjects entered a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants quantified their pruritus using a 0–10 visual analog scale, and pruritus was assessed for distribution, timing, degree of disability, and physical evidence of scratching. The optimum sertraline dose (75–100 mg/day) was well tolerated. In the controlled portion of the study, itch scores improved in patients taking sertraline, but worsened in patients taking placebo (P = 0.009). Changes in itch distribution, duration, direction, and physical evidence of scratching paralleled changes in the visual analog pruritus score.

Conclusion

Sertraline seems to be an effective, well-tolerated treatment for pruritus due to chronic liver disease. These results suggest that serotonergic pathways are important in the perception of itch.

### A systematic approach to the management of cholestatic pruritus in primary biliary cirrhosis [^1155RBF5]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Pruritus (itch) is an important symptom of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), an archetypal cholestatic liver disease. Cholestatic pruritus can be a debilitating symptom causing significant deterioration in patients' quality of life. Effective management of pruritus in PBC involves awareness among clinicians to adequately assess its severity, and treatment with specific drug therapies in line with current practice guidelines. In PBC, antipruritic drugs are not universally effective and/or have significant side effects, and despite best efforts with various combinations of drugs, some patients remain significantly symptomatic, eventually opting for invasive or experimental treatments. Therefore, there is a clear unmet need for better alternative treatments for patients with refractory or intractable cholestatic pruritus. Recent advances in the understanding of pathogenesis of cholestatic pruritus and bile acid physiology have raised hopes for novel therapies, some of which are currently under trial. In this review, we aim to provide a practical guide to the management of this important and complex problem, discussing current knowledge and recent advances in the pathogenesis, summarise the evidence base for available therapeutic approaches and update potential novel future therapies for the management of pruritus in PBC.

Sleep disturbances in cirrhosis — prevalence and contributors: Sleep disturbances, which include insomnia (poor sleep quality), excessive daytime sleepiness, and sleep‑wake inversion, affect 50%–80% of patients with cirrhosis; although encephalopathy is associated with sleep‑wake inversion and daytime sleepiness, up to half of patients with cirrhosis without encephalopathy experience sleep disturbances linked to melatonin metabolism changes, immune mechanisms, and impaired thermoregulation that may disturb circadian rhythms. Patients with cirrhosis also have a higher prevalence of sleep‑related movement disorders, such as restless leg syndrome, compared with the general population, and complications of liver disease (LD) and disease‑specific symptoms (e.g., pruritus in primary biliary cholangitis and obstructive sleep apnea in metabolic‑associated fatty liver disease) may also contribute.

### Primary biliary cirrhosis [^113rj4GS]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of the liver with a striking female preponderance. It has an insidious onset and typically affects middle-aged women. The disease manifests gradually with symptoms of fatigue, pruritis, and increased alkaline phosphatase levels on laboratory evaluation. The hallmark of the disease is the circulating antimitochondrial antibody. Histology is characterized by inflammation of the bile ducts, destruction of cholangiocytes, and subsequent cholestasis, progressing to biliary cirrhosis. The standard treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis is ursodeoxycholic acid, which improves survival, but the disease can still lead to cirrhosis and liver failure over decades.

Primary biliary cholangitis — clinical manifestations indicate that the major symptoms are fatigue and itching, with no good correlation between these symptoms and stage of disease; fatigue is the most common symptom, found in 50% to 78% of patients and associated with a significant negative impact on quality of life, and severe fatigue may be associated with decreased overall survival and is relatively constant or slowly progressive over time; pruritus occurs in 20% to 70% of patients in early studies and is now less common because more patients are diagnosed in the early, asymptomatic phase.

### Pruritus in cholestasis: facts and fiction [^117UtYWL]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Pruritus is a common symptom in patients with cholestatic liver diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, or hereditary pediatric cholestatic disorders and may accompany, although less frequently, many other liver diseases. Recent findings indicate that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a potent neuronal activator, and autotaxin (ATX; ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2), the enzyme which forms LPA, may form a key element of the long-sought pruritogenic signaling cascade in cholestatic patients suffering from itch. Serum ATX, but no other pruritogen candidate studied so far, correlates with pruritus intensity and responds to therapeutic interventions. In this comprehensive review, we provide a short update on actual insights in signal transmission related to pruritus and discuss pruritogen candidates in cholestasis. We also summarize evidence-based and guideline-approved as well as experimental therapeutic approaches for patients suffering from pruritus in cholestasis.

### Primary biliary cirrhosis [^114GguLL]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterised by destruction of small intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to fibrosis and potential cirrhosis through resulting complications. The serological hallmark of primary biliary cirrhosis is the antimitochondrial antibody, a highly disease-specific antibody identified in about 95% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. These patients usually have fatigue and pruritus, both of which occur independently of disease severity. The typical course of primary biliary cirrhosis has changed substantially with the introduöction of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Several randomised placebo-controlled studies have shown that UDCA improves transplant-free survival in primary biliary cirrhosis. However, about 40% of patients do not have a biochemical response to UDCA and would benefit from new therapies. Liver transplantation is a life-saving surgery with excellent outcomes for those with decompensated cirrhosis. Meanwhile, research on nuclear receptor hormones has led to the development of exciting new potential treatments. This Seminar will review the current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and natural history of primary biliary cirrhosis, discuss management of the disease and its sequelae, and introduce research on new therapeutic options.

### BAT117213: ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibition as a treatment for pruritus in primary biliary cirrhosis: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^116MqRL6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Sample size

The efficacy endpoint in this study is pruritus score and the sample size for efficacy endpoint is based on the pruritus 0 to 10 points scale. On this scale the average effect of rifampicin is 1.62 points and the reported pooled total standard deviations of various anti-pruritic drugs ranges from 1.22 to 3.84 points. Assuming that GSK2330672 is at least as effective as rifampicin, a sample size of 40 will result in a reasonable power (> 90%) if the standard deviation (SD) is 3.1 points or less. For estimation of relative bioavailability 20 subjects taking UDCA are required to ensure that the resultant 90% CI of the ratio will be within 0.8 and 1.25 assuming that the true ratio is 1 and the SD on the log10 scale is less than 0.25.

An initial sample-size of 40 subjects was selected based on considerations of both efficacy and PK endpoints. However, due to the uncertainty around sample-size assumptions a series of interim analyses for futility and possible sample-size re-estimation were carried out at regular intervals. Data from completed patients were reviewed by an unblinded review committee (composed of GSK personnel not directly involved in study conduct). As the probability of demonstrating sufficient difference was high, the sponsor revised the sample-size from 40 to 22. No other changes to study conduct were planned as a result of the interim analyses.

Liver transplantation

When conservative and experimental therapeutic options fail, liver (re)transplantation can be an effective treatment for patients with progressive liver dysfunction and severe portal hypertensionor for those whose liver function is preserved but develop pruritus that substantially impacts HRQoL or causes suicidal ideation. In pediatric CLDs, the most common indication for liver transplantation is biliary atresia, accounting for 42–54% of pediatric liver transplants. Nearly 22% of BA patients reach adulthood with their native liver, with half requiring liver transplantation later in life. In adults, CLD is responsible for about 5.7–11% of all liver transplants, with PSC and PBC being the most common indications. Postoperatively, PBC and PSC have the most favorable outcomes, with 10-year survival rates of 79% and 83%, respectively, compared to other indications for liver transplantation. However, autoimmune diseases, including PBC and PSC, notably recur in many liver transplant recipients and may be more aggressive than the original disease. The recurrence rates of PBC range from 8 to 16% at 1–6 years, 21 to 37% at 10 years, and > 43% at 15 years, while autoimmune hepatitis recurs in 25% at 5 years and 50% at 10 years. The recurrence rate of PSC ranges from 8.6 to 25%. The underlying mechanism of these recurrences remains to be determined, making ideal management challenging.

Strengths and limitations: The primary advantage of our research lies in its extensive analysis of current literature to derive broad theoretical conclusions on the efficacy of traditional and new therapies for CP. However, our research is not without limitations. Our analysis included studies that utilized various scales and tools to quantify pruritus, a complex construct which pose a challenge to making a direct comparison between studies that use different evaluation instruments to assess the efficacy of a particular drug, thus impeding the ability to draw reliable conclusions about treatment effectiveness and/or hindering the development of consistent treatment guidelines. In addition, our systematic review may be at risk of publication bias, where studies with significant findings are more likely to be published than those with negative or inconclusive results, thus overestimating the true effect of an intervention.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling:

Hepatic Decompensation and Failure in PBC Patients with Cirrhosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Severe Pruritus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Reduction in HDL-C [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

A total of 432 patients with PBC were studied in three double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Of these patients, 290 were treated with OCALIVA for at least 6 months, 232 were treated for at least 12 months, and 70 were treated for at least 2 years. There were 131 patients who received OCALIVA 10 mg once daily and 70 who received OCALIVA 5 mg once daily.

In Trial 1, 216 patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive either:

OCALIVA 10 mg once daily for the entire 12 months of the trial (n = 73)
OCALIVA titration (5 mg once daily for the initial 6 months, with the option to increase to 10 mg once daily for the last 6 months, in patients who were tolerating OCALIVA, but had ALP 1.67-times ULN or greater, and/or total bilirubin greater than ULN, or less than 15% ALP reduction) (n = 70); or
placebo (n = 73).

During the trial, OCALIVA or placebo was administered in combination with UDCA in 93% of patients and as monotherapy in 7% of patients who were unable to tolerate UDCA. The overall discontinuation rate was 12% in the OCALIVA 10 mg arm, 10% in the OCALIVA titration arm, and 4% in the placebo arm.

The recommended starting dosage of OCALIVA is 5 mg orally once daily for 3 months with titration to 10 mg once daily based upon tolerability and response [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Initiation of therapy with OCALIVA 10 mg once daily is not recommended due to an increased risk of pruritus.

The most common adverse reactions in Trial 1 occurring in at least 5% of patients in either OCALIVA treatment arm and at an incidence at least 1% higher than the placebo treatment arm are shown in Table 1.

### Seladelpar treatment reduces IL-31 and pruritus in patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^111wNT1J]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a rare, slowly progressive, female-predominant liver disease characterized by immune-mediated destruction of small intrahepatic bile ducts followed by the development of chronic cholestasis. If untreated, patients with PBC have a higher risk of cirrhosis and its complications, liver failure, and death. Along with fatigue, pruritus is one of the most common presenting symptoms in patients with PBC. Treatments for cholestatic pruritus are currently limited, and active pruritus can cause sleep deprivation, exacerbate fatigue, and impact the quality of life for patients living with PBC. The currently approved first-line [ursodeoxycholic acid; ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)] and second-line therapies (obeticholic acid) improve biochemical markers of PBC associated with disease progression, but fail to address key symptoms, including pruritus, associated with the disease. In the absence of efficacious therapy acceptable to patients, pruritus remains a high unmet need for patients with PBC.

Seladelpar is a potent and selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-delta agonist in development for the treatment of patients with PBC. In studies with patients with PBC having insufficient response to UDCA, seladelpar 10 mg demonstrated significant improvements in biochemical markers of cholestasis as well as significant reductions in patient-reported pruritus measurements in those patients with moderate-to-severe pruritus. – Seladelpar treatment also improved sleep disturbance and fatigue, as measured by the 5-D itch and PBC-40 questionnaires.

A variety of pruritogenic molecules have been suggested to play a role in the pruritus experienced by patients with PBC, but the precise mechanism remains elusive. Individual bile acids, or sets of them, may be components of an ensemble of pruritogenic or pruritus-sensitizing signaling molecules, although serum bile acids are not always correlated with itch. Nevertheless, bile acids can initiate signaling through G protein-coupled receptors such as MRGPRX4, which has been localized to human dorsal root ganglia–associated sensory neurons as well as a variety of other cells. Autotaxin, a lysophosphatidic acid–forming enzyme, is associated with the severity of cholestatic itch and is lowered by certain but not all antipruritic treatments.

### Liver transplantation for intractable pruritus is contraindicated before an adequate trial of opiate antagonist therapy [^112iQnJ5]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

A woman with stage III (pre-cirrhotic) primary biliary cirrhosis was referred for liver transplantation because of intractable pruritus. Oral administration of 50 mg naltrexone precipitated a severe opioid withdrawal-like reaction. Subsequently, when oral naltrexone therapy was reintroduced following a cautious infusion of naloxone, no reaction occurred and the pruritus resolved completely. Liver transplantation should not be considered for apparently intractable pruritus of cholestasis before an adequate trial of opiate antagonist therapy.

### The potent bile acid sequestrant colesevelam is not effective in cholestatic pruritus: results of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^116avJXA]. Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Colesevelam is an anion-exchange resin with a 7-fold higher bile acid-binding capacity and fewer side effects than cholestyramine, the current first-line treatment option for cholestatic pruritus. The aim of this trial was to compare the effects of colesevelam and a placebo in patients with cholestatic pruritus. In a randomized, double-blind, investigator-initiated, multicenter trial, patients with cholestatic pruritus, both treatment-naive and previously treated, received 1875 mg of colesevelam or an identical placebo twice daily for 3 weeks. The effect on pruritus was assessed with daily visual analogue scales, quality-of-life scores, and evaluations of cutaneous scratch lesions. The predefined primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with at least a 40% reduction in pruritus visual analogue scale scores. Thirty-eight patients were included, and 35 were evaluable: 17 took colesevelam, 18 took the placebo, 22 were female, 8 were treatment-naive, 14 had primary biliary cirrhosis, and 14 had primary sclerosing cholangitis. The mean serum bile acid levels were comparable between the groups before treatment (P = 0.74), but they were significantly different after treatment (P = 0.01) in favor of patients treated with colesevelam. Thirty-six percent of patients in the colesevelam group reached the primary endpoint versus 35% in the placebo group (P = 1.0). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to pruritus scores, quality-of-life scores, and severity of cutaneous scratch lesions. Mild side effects occurred in one colesevelam-treated patient and four placebo-treated patients.

Conclusion

Although colesevelam significantly decreased serum bile acid levels, this trial was unable to demonstrate that it was more effective than a placebo in alleviating the severity of pruritus of cholestasis.

### Pruritus in hepatic cholestasis… [^113kbtfY]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Pruritus associated with hepatic cholestasis may cause significant morbidity. Current evidence indicates that bile acids may not be the pruritogenic factor. Rather, the factor may be some other cholephilic anion or anions that bind to cholestyramine resin and are photolabile. Effective treatment modalities used currently include cholestyramine resin and phenobarbital. Phototherapy is a promising modality in which the mechanism and most effective wavelengths remain to be elucidated. Analysis of the possible role of non-steady state bile acid compartmentalization in the pathogenesis of pruritus is presented. Garden JM, Ostrow JD, Roenigk HH.

### Cholestasis in alcohol-associated liver disease [^115QJ8fe]. The American Journal of Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. ALD covers a spectrum of diseases, ranging from mild and reversible hepatic steatosis to the development of fibrosis, cirrhosis, and alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH). AH is marked by a rapid onset of jaundice and elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase in individuals with heavy alcohol use. It can progress to acute-on-chronic liver failure, with a mortality rate of approximately 30% within the first month. Unfortunately, treatment options for AH are still limited. Cholestasis refers to an impairment in bile formation or flow, leading to clinical symptoms, such as fatigue, pruritus, and jaundice. Cholestasis and biliary dysfunction are commonly seen in patients with AH and can significantly worsen the prognosis. However, the mechanisms and roles of cholestasis in ALD are not yet fully understood. In this review, we will summarize recent findings and explore the potential roles and mechanisms of cholestasis in the progression of ALD.

### Diagnosis and management of cholestatic liver disease [^116p4tWE]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Cholestasis (slowing of bile flow) may be acute or chronic and affect any age group. In infants and children the causes often are congenital or inherited and as a result of improved management some affected children now survive to adulthood. Although jaundice is a hallmark of cholestasis it may be absent, particularly in adults with chronic cholestatic liver disease most of whom are entirely asymptomatic. A detailed history and physical are crucial to the diagnosis and noninvasive radiologic tests (ultrasound, computerized tomography scan, and magnetic resonance cholangiography) greatly facilitate diagnosis, particularly when the cause is extrahepatic. Only if sufficient portal tracts (> 10) are present on liver biopsy examination can this test reliably evaluate damage to the small bile ducts. Therapy should address both the cause and the consequences of retained bile acids within the liver, and diminished delivery of bile to the gastrointestinal tract. Therapies should address symptoms, mostly pruritus and prevention, particularly osteoporosis and osteomalacia. Portal hypertension can be an early event in chronic cholestatic liver disease, sometimes occurring before the development of cirrhosis. Ursodeoxycholic acid improves the biochemical markers of cholestasis regardless of cause and may delay liver disease progression; only liver transplant is potentially curative.

### Extracorporeal albumin dialysis: a procedure for prolonged relief of intractable pruritus in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis [^116SrRkW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Pruritus is a distressing symptom in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, and when uncontrollable it is an indication for liver transplantation. Since pruritus can result from unknown substances that accumulate systemically as a consequence of impaired biliary secretion, we have assessed whether a new extracorporeal albumin dialysis (ECAD) procedure, the molecular-adsorbing recirculating system-MARS, has any effect on pruritus of cholestasis.

Methods

Four patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and resistant pruritus were treated with two 7-h ECAD sessions 1 day apart. Pruritus was recorded from 15 days before the first session, before and after each session, and during the follow-up using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Standard liver tests as well as serum bile acid levels were also measured.

Results

There was a clear association between ECAD treatment and relief of itching, which promptly disappeared in two patients, or decreased markedly in the other two. One patient was free of pruritus for 18 months except for short periods with mild pruritus. The second patient experienced amelioration of itching, which almost disappeared completely and recurred mildly 4 months later. In the other two patients pruritus was alleviated markedly after ECAD but gradually recurred. These two patients were treated again 9 and 7 months later with favorable effects on pruritus. The scratching skin lesions improved or disappeared in parallel with the alleviation of itching. The albumin dialysis procedure did not result in liver test changes, except for circulating bile acids, which decreased in all the patients. No significant adverse effects were observed.

Conclusions

The ECAD procedure seems to be an effective alternative for the treatment of patients with pruritus of cholestasis who do not respond to other therapeutic methods.

### Systematic review: efficacy of therapies for cholestatic pruritus [^1151JFo1]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

In a prospective study of three HCV-cirrhotic patients with intractable pruritus who had failed medical treatment, MARS therapy resulted in subjective improvement in pruritus and quality of life and decreased s-BA levels. The patients did not require retreatment or liver transplantation up to a 9-month follow-up.

In a fifth study, MARS therapy was evaluated in PBC patients with intractable pruritus. Pruritus, scratching lesions, and standard liver tests, including s-BA levels, were measured. The study found that MARS therapy was associated with substantial relief of itching and scratching, with pruritus quickly resolving in two patients and markedly improving in the other two. The s-BA levels decreased in all patients, and no patient needed retreatment up to a 7-month follow-up.

A retrospective study on the efficacy of MARS in severe CP was conducted among three children who received a total of 135 MARS sessions before liver transplantation. Total bilirubin, s-BA levels, and pruritus (NRS 0 = no pruritus, 10 = maximal pruritus) were assessed. Pre-MARS s-BA concentrations averaged 207 ± 67 μmol/L. After MARS therapy, a significant reduction in s-BA levels from baseline to 67 ± 9%, 48 ± 3%, 38 ± 14%, and 37 ± 5%, respectively, within 2, 4, 6, and 8 h of therapy (p < 0.05) and a reduction in the mean itch-NRS score decreased [3.3 ± 2.9 versus 6.5 ± 2.3 (baseline), p < 0.01].

7.2.3 Chronic liver disease (especially cholestasis)

The close association between itch and jaundice has been recognized since antiquity and the ancient Greek physician Aretaeus (Ἀρεταῖος) of Cappadocia described cholestatic itch in the second century. Itch associated with chronic liver disease is referred to as hepatic pruritus. When cholestasis appears to significantly contribute to hepatic pruritus, it is also referred to as cholestatic pruritus. The list of chronic liver diseases that may cause hepatic pruritus/cholestatic include not only cholestatic diseases (e.g. primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, or hereditary pediatric cholestatic disorders) but also chronic liver diseases (e.g. chronic hepatitis C virus infection and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease). A large‐scale surveillance study conducted in Japan revealed that 40.3% of patients with chronic liver diseases complain of itch. The prevalence of itch varies among chronic liver diseases, with higher prevalences observed in overlap syndrome (60.0%), primary biliary cirrhosis (51.4%), chronic hepatitis C virus infection (45.4%), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (44.7%) and relatively lower prevalences in alcoholic liver disease (24.3%) and inactive hepatitis B virus carrier (22.2%). Cholestatic pruritus typically affects the limbs and the back, although it can be generalized. Of note, hepatic pruritus can precede the appearance of jaundice.

The pathogenesis of hepatic itch remains unclear. Recent studies have indicated that abnormalities in lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and the endogenous opioid system play a role in the pathogenesis of cholestatic pruritus. The serum levels of LPA and the activity of its synthetic enzyme autotaxin are elevated in cholestatic patients and correlate with the severity of itch. LPA is reported to activate itch‐related sensory nerve fibers through its receptor LPAR5, and biliary drainage has been shown to reduce autotaxin activity and improve itching. Cholestatic patients exhibit increased serum levels of endogenous opioids, particularly MOR agonists. MOR agonists possess the propruritic properties, which may contribute to the sensitization and modulation of nervous systems, rather than directly activating itch‐associated sensory nerve fibers. However, the direct correlation between blood endogenous opioid levels and itch severity has yet to be demonstrated.

Recommendation 32

We recommend that all patients with PBC should have a risk assessment for osteoporosis. Treatment and follow-up should be according to national guidelines. (Strong; High)

When should patients be considered for clinical trials?

For many years following the original UDCA trials there has been little or no trials activity in PBC. This is now changing with a number of trials targeting areas of perceived unmet clinic need in the condition, with progress to new licensed second-line therapies such as OCA, which has FDA and EMA approval, as well as NICE evaluation in the UK. Currently there are trials in three distinct areas and patients should be offered the opportunity to participate if they fall into targeted groups (see).

High-risk/UDCA-unresponsive disease

The significantly worse clinical outcome seen in patients showing an inadequate response to UDCA has focused interest on trials of enhanced or second-line therapy. Trials currently under development target two aspects of the disease process — namely, the upstream autoimmune response causing initial bile duct injury (typically but not exclusively using second-generation biological-based approaches) and the cycle of cholestatic injury (using second-line bile acid-targeting therapeutics such as FXR agonists that suppress bile acid production and fibrates, which have anecdotal evidence but as yet no randomised placebo-controlled data). The standard approach in current and proposed enhanced disease therapy trials is to target patients not meeting UDCA response criteria at the end of 1 year of treatment at 13–15 mg/kg/day (or who are intolerant of UDCA) and any patient failing to meet this criterion should be considered for participation in ongoing trials of second-line or enhanced therapy.

Pruritus resistant to current therapy

Current and proposed trials are targeting resistant pruritus including through breaking of the enterohepatic circulation for bile acids and, it is proposed, targeting the autotoxin pathway. Protocols vary, but typically target patients with significant residual pruritus (defined in terms of severity and/or frequency) following first and established second-line therapy or who are intolerant of current therapy, and should therefore be considered for participation in clinical trials.

Fatigue

Trials targeting fatigue are complex, reflecting the nature of the clinical problem. They form part of the management approach undertaken in specialist centres and patients with severe fatigue should be considered for referral to such centres. Critical for trials of fatigue in PBC is the need to exclude confounding causes, and the systematic approach to addressing such confounding processes outlined elsewhere in these guidelines should be followed before trial participation is considered.

### Cutting-edge issues in primary biliary cirrhosis [^113JwdzF]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Several crucial issues remain open in our understanding of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), an autoimmune liver disease targeting the small- and medium-sized intrahepatic bile ducts. These issues include the high tissue specificity of the autoimmune injury despite the nontraditional autoantigens found in all mitochondria recognized by PBC-associated autoantibodies, the causes of the commonly observed pruritus, and the disease etiology per se. In all these fields, there has been recent interest secondary to the use of large-scale efforts (such as genome-wide association studies) that were previously considered poorly feasible in a rare disease such as PBC as well as other intuitions. Accordingly, there are now fascinating theories to explain the onset and severity of pruritus due to elevated autotaxin levels, the peculiar apoptotic features of bile duct cells to explain the tissue specificity, and genomic and epigenetic associations contributing to disease susceptibility. We have arbitrarily chosen these four aspects as the most promising in the PBC recent literature and will provide herein a discussion of the recent data and their potential implications.

### Methotrexate for primary biliary cirrhosis [^115mgLsj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Methotrexate has been used to treat patients with primary biliary cirrhosis as it possesses immunosuppressive properties. The previously prepared version of this review from 2005 showed that methotrexate seemed to significantly increase mortality in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Since that last review version, follow-up data of the included trials have been published.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methotrexate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.

Search Strategy

Randomised clinical trials were identified by searching The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE (from their inception until September 2009). Reference lists were also read through. Authors of trials were contacted.

Selection Criteria

We searched to include randomised clinical trials comparing methotrexate with placebo, no intervention, or another drug irrespective of blinding, language, year of publication, or publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Our primary outcomes were mortality, and mortality or liver transplantation combined. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risks (RR) and hazard ratios (HR) if applicable. Continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences (MD).

Main Results

Five trials were included. Four trials with 370 patients compared methotrexate with placebo or no intervention (three trials added an equal dose of ursodeoxycholic acid to the intervention groups). The bias risk of these trials was high. We did not find statistically significant effects of methotrexate on mortality (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.64), mortality or liver transplantation combined, pruritus, fatigue, liver complications, liver biochemistry, liver histology, or adverse events. The pruritus score (MD - 0.17, 95% CI - 0.25 to - 0.09) was significantly lower in patients receiving methotrexate. The prothrombin time was significantly worsened in patients receiving methotrexate (MD 1.60 s, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.02). One trial with 85 patients compared methotrexate with colchicine. The trial had low risk of bias. Methotrexate, when compared to colchicine, did not significantly effect mortality, fatigue, liver biopsy, or adverse events. Methotrexate significantly benefited pruritus score (MD - 0.68, 95% CI - 1.11 to - 0.25), serum alkaline phosphatases (MD - 0.41 U/l, 95% CI - 0.70 to - 0.12), and plasma immunoglobulin M (MD - 0.47 mg/dl, 95% CI - 0.74 to - 0.20) compared with colchicine. Other outcomes showed no statistical difference.

Authors' Conclusions

Methotrexate had no statistically significant effect on mortality in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis nor the need for liver transplantation. Although methotrexate may benefit other outcomes (pruritus score, serum alkaline phosphatase, immunoglobulin M levels), there is no sufficient evidence to support methotrexate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.

### The British society of gastroenterology / UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^112wbsaJ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendation 35

We suggest that the presence of severe interface hepatitis in the correct context is usually required to initiate immunosuppression after the risks and benefits of treatment, particularly with corticosteroids, have been discussed with the patient. (Weak; Moderate)

Pregnancy and PBC

While most patients are diagnosed at an age when pregnancy is not a relevant consideration, a significant minority of patients with PBC are women of reproductive age. In this younger age range of PBC, pregnancy may either be a reason for diagnosis (failure of resolution of obstetric cholestasis) or may be complicated by worsening pruritus. Significant medical risks are infrequent but can be relevant if patients have cirrhosis and portal hypertension. In this setting, management is no different from any other aetiology of cirrhosis (eg, gastroscopy if concern over portal hypertension; exclusion of splenic artery aneurysm by ultrasound).

PBC specific experience is limited to case series, but expert clinical opinion is that UDCA is safe during conception, pregnancy and post-partum. Additionally, cholestyramine and rifampicin (second trimester onwards) are considered safe in pregnancy, although the data are limited. Rarely, itch during pregnancy becomes unbearable and plasmapheresis may help. In those with notable cholestasis, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency should be avoided. Post-partum cholestatic flares have been described and clinical follow-up in the post-partum period is important.

Pre-pregnancy counselling should be pragmatic; recognition that in those with a marked ductopenic variant of PBC, disease progression from intense added cholestasis during pregnancy does need consideration. Similarly, patients with portal hypertension have the greatest risks associated with pregnancy and should be appropriately counselled. Variceal bleeding can occur in patients with cirrhosis of any aetiology as a consequence of pregnancy-related increase in portal pressure. Such patients should be electively endoscoped in the second trimester and managed appropriately. Pregnant patients with PBC should be screened for anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, as their presence would change obstetric practice regarding fetal screening for bradycardia.

### BAT117213: ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibition as a treatment for pruritus in primary biliary cirrhosis: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^114DqrM4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT)

Primary BAs are synthesized in the liver from an enzymatic catabolism of cholesterol, a process regulated by enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 7A1. Unconjugated BAs are conjugated in hepatocytes with glycine and taurine, secreted into the bile and stored in the gallbladder. Upon ingestion of a meal, conjugated BAs ("bile salts") are released into the intestinal lumen where they facilitate absorption of fat and fat soluble vitamins. After their normal physiological function is completed in the intestine, BAs reach the ileum where they are reabsorbed. The ileal bile acid transporter [(IBAT), also called apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT)], is a protein predominantly located in the terminal ileum and serves as the main transporter mediating the ileal uptake of conjugated BAs and their return to the liver via the portal circulation (enterohepatic circulation).

Bile salts (and their protonated form, BAs) have been suggested to play role in the pathogenesis of pruritus in cholestatic conditions. In cholestasis, the ileal uptake of BAs has been shown to be upregulated. Also, the evidence that pruritus dramatically improves in patients undergoing nasobiliary drainage and is effectively cured by LT suggests a direct or indirect role for BAs in mediating cholestatic pruritus. Therefore a pharmaceutical agent that can reduce their levels in the enterohepatic and systemic circulations may be predicted to improve pruritus. In two animal studies treatment with IBAT inhibitors SC-435 and A4250 produced BA malabsorption and attenuated BA-mediated cholestatic liver injury by reducing biliary BA output. In humans, use of IBAT inhibitor A4250 has been shown to decrease the serum BAs and increase faecal BAs by highly efficient interruption of their enterohepatic circulation with no serious adverse events.

### The treatment of primary biliary cholangitis: time for personalized medicine [^113f2dSb]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Stricter Symptom Management: Pruritus Control

Pruritus manifested in as many as 70% of patients with PBC, which significantly impairs the ability to focus on daily tasks and may even result in uncontrollable scratching and bleeding, fatigue, insomnia, and depression. Enhancing life quality through targeted management strategies has been underscored as an effective way to alleviate symptoms like pruritus. Fundamental skincare is suitable for all patients. The initial pharmacotherapy for mild pruritus is Cholestyramine (4 ~ 16 g/day), whereas its tolerability is limited for causing adverse reactions such as nausea, abdominal distension, and constipation. Rifampicin (150 ~ 300 mg BID), as an alternative second-line medication, has the potential to induce hepatic injury, hemolytic anemia, and renal impairment, as well as interactions with other pharmaceuticals, requiring close surveillance of liver tests.

### Cutaneous manifestations of liver diseases [^113WgBnx]. Clinics in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

The cutaneous manifestations of liver disorders are protean. In addition to the well-recognized stigmata of liver cirrhosis, various infectious, metabolic, autoimmune, hereditary, developmental, and neoplastic liver disorders can result in various cutaneous and mucosal changes as well as in pruritus and abnormal hair and nail growth. Although many of these changes are nonspecific, some are associated with distinct liver diseases and correlate with the severity of hepatic pathology. Familiarization with the spectrum of these manifestations is important for early detection and treatment of hepatic diseases. We review the medical literature and discuss the spectrum of dermatologic manifestations of liver cirrhosis and of important liver diseases, their etiopathogenesis, significance, and treatment.

### Methotrexate for primary biliary cirrhosis [^116aYk36]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Methotrexate, a folic acid antagonist with immunosuppressive properties, has been used to treat patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The therapeutic responses to methotrexate in randomised clinical trials have been heterogeneous.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methotrexate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.

Search Strategy

Relevant randomised clinical trials were identified by searching The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (June 2004), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2004), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2004), and manual searches of bibliographies. We contacted authors of trials and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing methotrexate with placebo, no intervention, or another drug were included irrespective of blinding, language, year of publication, and publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Our primary outcomes were mortality and mortality or liver transplantation. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk (RR) and hazard ratio (HR) if applicable. Continuous outcomes were reported as weighted mean difference (WMD). We examined intervention effects by using both a random-effects model and a fixed-effect model. Heterogeneity was investigated by subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

We identified four trials (370 patients) that compared methotrexate with placebo with or without ursodeoxycholic acid as co-intervention. One additional trial (87 patients) compared methotrexate with colchicine without and later with ursodeoxycholic acid as co-intervention. The methodological quality of the trials was low. We did not find significant effects of methotrexate on pruritus, fatigue, liver complications, liver biochemistry, liver histology, or adverse events. The pruritus score (WMD - 0.68, 95% CI - 1.11 to - 0.25), the levels of serum alkaline phosphatases (WMD - 0.41, 95% CI - 0.70 to - 0.12) and plasma immunoglobulin M (WMD - 0.47, 95% CI - 0.74 to - 0.20) were significantly lower in the patients receiving methotrexate.

Authors' Conclusions

Methotrexate increased mortality in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. We do not recommend methotrexate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis outside randomised trials.

### Ursodeoxycholic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis [^11241TX1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Primary biliary cirrhosis is a rare autoimmune liver disease and an effective treatment has been difficult to establish. Some randomised clinical trials have found an effect of ursodeoxycholic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis.

Objectives

Evaluate the beneficial effects and adverse effects of peroral ursodeoxycholic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis versus placebo or no intervention.

Search Strategy

The Controlled Trials Register of The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the full text of the identified studies were searched until April 2001. The electronic searches were done by entering the search terms 'ursodeoxycholic acid', 'UDCA', 'primary biliary cirrhosis', and 'PBC'.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials evaluating ursodeoxycholic acid administered perorally at any dose versus placebo or no intervention in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis diagnosed by any method. Only trials using an adequate method for randomisation were included, regardless of blinding and language.

Data Collection and Analysis

The methodologic quality of the randomised clinical trials was evaluated by components and the Jadad-score. The following outcomes were extracted: mortality, liver transplantation, pruritus, other clinical symptoms (jaundice, portal pressure, (bleeding) oesophageal varices, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, hepato-renal syndrome, autoimmune conditions), liver biochemistry, liver function, liver biopsy findings, quality of life, and adverse events. All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat method.

Main Results

A total of 16 randomised clinical trials evaluating ursodeoxycholic acid against placebo (n = 15) or no intervention (n = 1) in 1422 patients were identified. The median Jadad-score was 3 (range 1–5). A number of trials described as double blind had problems with the blinding. Neither mortality (odds ratio = 0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.48), liver transplantation (odds ratio = 0.83; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.32), mortality or liver transplantation (odds ratio = 0.90; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.26), pruritus, fatigue, autoimmune conditions, quality of life, liver histology, or portal pressure were significantly affected by ursodeoxycholic acid (given in doses of 8–15 mg/kg/day for three months to five years). However, ursodeoxycholic acid significantly (P < 0.05) reduced ascites, jaundice, and biochemical variables such as serum bilirubin and liver enzymes. Ursodeoxycholic acid was not significantly associated with adverse events. Including data after patients had been switched onto open label ursodeoxycholic acid confirmed the findings regarding the lack of a significant effect of ursodeoxycholic acid on mortality and mortality or liver transplantation. A significant (P = 0.04) effect was, however, observed on the incidence of liver transplantation (odds ratio = 0.68; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.98).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Ursodeoxycholic acid has a marginal therapeutic effect for primary biliary cirrhosis. On the positive side, ursodeoxycholic acid has few side effects. The general usage of ursodeoxycholic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis needs reevaluation.

### Chronic pruritus in the absence of specific skin disease: an update on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapy [^112tTwvW]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic pruritus is a major and distressing symptom of many cutaneous and systemic diseases and can significantly impair the patient's quality of life. Pruritus perception is the final result of a complex network involving dedicated nerve pathways and brain areas, and an increasing number of peripheral and central mediators are thought to be involved. Itch is associated with most cutaneous disorders and, in these circumstances, its management overlaps with that of the skin disease. Itch can also occur without associated skin diseases or primary skin lesions, but only with nonspecific lesions secondary to rubbing or scratching. Chronic itch with no or minimal skin changes can be secondary to important diseases, such as neurologic disorders, chronic renal failure, cholestasis, systemic infections, malignancies, and endocrine disorders, and may also result from exposure to some drugs. The search for the cause of pruritus usually requires a meticulous step-by-step assessment involving careful history taking as well as clinical examination and laboratory investigations. Few evidence-based treatments for pruritus are available. Topical therapy, oral histamine H(1) receptor antagonists, and phototherapy with UV radiation can target pruritus elicitation in the skin, whereas antiepileptic drugs, opioid receptor antagonists, and antidepressants can block signal processing in the CNS.

### APASL clinical practice guidance: the diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^112hTPG9]. Hepatology International (2022). High credibility.

APASL primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — liver transplantation and post-transplant ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) guidance states: It is recommended that liver transplantation should be considered in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, MELD ≥ 15, Mayo Risk Score > 7.8, or severe, intractable pruritus. (II, 1). Post-transplant UDCA treatment is safe and effective in improving liver function tests and prevent PBC recurrence. (II, 1). Prophylactic use of UDCA is safe and effective in preventing PBC recurrence after liver transplantation.

### Refractory pruritus in primary biliary cirrhosis [^113wRps9]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Pruritus is a major symptom of primary biliary cirrhosis, cholestatic autoimmune disease which affects mostly middle-age women. Often, it can be severe and refractory to multiple treatments, and mostly affecting the patient's health-related quality of life. Intense pruritus can be itself an indication to liver transplantation, in extreme cases leading to suicide. Its physiopathology has not yet been fully elucidated, but recent studies added the elevation of autotaxin and lysophosphatidic acid to the group of classic mechanisms already linked to cholestatic pruritus. In this case report we illustrate how ultraviolet B phototherapy appears to successfully control severe pruritus and contribute to the healing of pruritic skin lesions caused by intense scratching. There is limited medical literature concerning this therapeutic approach on cholestatic pruritus, but we hope that further randomised controlled trials will successfully establish it as an effective treatment in the near future.

### BAT117213: ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibition as a treatment for pruritus in primary biliary cirrhosis: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^113YUWzv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pruritus (itch) is a symptom commonly experienced by patients with cholestatic liver diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC, previously referred to as primary biliary cirrhosis). Bile acids (BAs) have been proposed as potential pruritogens in PBC. The ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) protein expressed in the distal ileum plays a key role in the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Pharmacological inhibition of IBAT with GSK2330672 may reduce BA levels in the systemic circulation and improve pruritus.

Methods

This clinical study (BAT117213 study) is sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) with associated exploratory studies supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). It is a phase 2a, multi-centre, randomised, double bind, placebo controlled, cross-over trial for PBC patients with pruritus. The primary objective is to investigate the safety and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK2330672, and explore whether GSK2330672 administration for 14 days improves pruritus compared with placebo. The key outcomes include improvement in pruritus scores evaluated on a numerical rating scale and other PBC symptoms in an electronic diary completed twice daily by the patients. The secondary outcomes include the evaluation of the effect of GSK2330672 on total serum bile acid (BA) concentrations, serum markers of BA synthesis and steady-state pharmacokinetics of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).

Discussion

BAT117213 study is the first randomised controlled crossover trial of ileal bile acid transporter inhibitor, a novel class of drug to treat pruritus in PBC. The main strengths of the trial are utility of a novel, study specific, electronic symptom diary as patient reported outcome to measure the treatment response objectively and the crossover design that allows estimating the treatment effect in a smaller number of patients. The outcome of this trial will inform the trial design of future development phase of the IBAT inhibitor drug. The trial will also provide opportunity to conduct metabonomic and gut microbiome studies as explorative and mechanistic research in patients with cholestatic pruritus.

### Odevixibat (Bylvay) [^1176HtbP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of BYLVAY have been established in pediatric patients 3 months to 17 years of age for the treatment of pruritus in PFIC. Use of BYLVAY in this age group is supported by evidence from one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 62 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PFIC type 1 or type 2 (Trial 1), and an open-label extension trial in PFIC patients (Trial 2) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14)].

The safety and effectiveness of BYLVAY for the treatment of pruritus in PFIC in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age have not been established.

The safety and effectiveness of BYLVAY have been established in pediatric patients 12 months to 17 years of age for the treatment of pruritus in ALGS. Use of BYLVAY in this age group is supported by evidence from one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 52 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ALGS (Trial 3) and one open-label extension trial in ALGS patients (Trial 4) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14)].

The safety and effectiveness of BYLVAY for the treatment of pruritus in ALGS in pediatric patients less than 12 months of age have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

PFIC and ALGS are largely diseases of pediatric and young adult patients. Clinical studies in BYLVAY did not include patients 65 years of age and older.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

Patients with PFIC and ALGS may have impaired hepatic function. The efficacy and safety of BYLVAY in PFIC and ALGS patients with clinically significant portal hypertension, and in patients with decompensated cirrhosis have not been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warning and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Studies (14)].
