## Question

most common mechanism of septic arthritis in infants

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most common mechanism of septic arthritis in infants. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching pathophysiology of pediatric septic arthritis and whether hematogenous spread predominates. Then, I should verify age-specific nuances for infants, including neonates versus older infants. Next, I will examine alternative mechanisms such as contiguous spread and direct inoculation to ensure I'm not missing a competing pathway. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically grounded conclusion and note any exceptions that might modify the general rule.

> Let me first confirm the general principle. In children, septic arthritis is most commonly due to hematogenous spread from bacteremia, with bacteria seeding the richly vascular synovium and then proliferating within the joint space. This hematogenous mechanism is repeatedly emphasized in pediatric reviews and emergency care summaries, and it aligns with the classic teaching that osteoarticular infections in children are predominantly hematogenous [^11498V1v] [^1172jAPC].

> Wait, let me verify whether this generalization holds for infants specifically. I initially thought "direct inoculation might be more common in infants because of immature immune defenses", but hold on, that's not supported by the literature; in fact, even in neonates and young infants, hematogenous spread remains the predominant mechanism, with contiguous spread from adjacent osteomyelitis and direct inoculation being less common by comparison, though they do occur in select contexts [^notfound].

> I should double-check the anatomic rationale that makes hematogenous spread particularly plausible in infants. The transphyseal vessels in neonates and young infants allow bacteria to traverse the physis, explaining why osteomyelitis and septic arthritis frequently coexist in this age group. This vascular anatomy supports hematogenous seeding of both metaphyseal bone and adjacent joint in infants, reinforcing hematogenous spread as the leading mechanism in this population [^114H9j2Q] [^116cvkxu].

> Next, I should review the alternative pathways to ensure completeness. Contiguous spread from adjacent osteomyelitis into the joint can occur, especially in the proximal femur and hip, and direct inoculation from procedures, trauma, or deep infections is described but remains less common than hematogenous routes in infants. Case reports of psoas abscess with concomitant hip septic arthritis and facet joint infection illustrate these alternative mechanisms, yet they do not overturn the predominance of hematogenous spread in infants [^114H9j2Q] [^115g8HQh] [^111Jd5DX].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit. The most common mechanism of septic arthritis in infants is hematogenous spread from bacteremia, with neonatal transphyseal circulation facilitating joint seeding and frequent coexistence with osteomyelitis. While contiguous extension and direct inoculation can occur, they are comparatively less frequent explanations for infant septic arthritis than hematogenous dissemination [^114H9j2Q] [^116cvkxu].

---

The most common mechanism of septic arthritis in infants is **hematogenous spread** from bacteremia, with pathogens reaching the joint via the bloodstream [^11498V1v] [^114H9j2Q]. This route is facilitated by the **transphyseal vessels** in infants, allowing direct communication between metaphyseal bone and the joint space, which increases the risk of concurrent osteomyelitis and septic arthritis [^114H9j2Q] [^116cvkxu]. Direct inoculation and contiguous spread from adjacent infections are less common but can occur, especially in neonates or with invasive procedures [^114H9j2Q]. Early recognition and prompt management are critical to prevent joint destruction and growth disturbances [^111qS4GS].

---

## Hematogenous spread: the primary mechanism

Hematogenous spread is the **predominant mechanism** of septic arthritis in infants, accounting for the majority of cases [^notfound]. Bacteria enter the bloodstream from primary infection sites — such as the respiratory tract, skin, or gastrointestinal tract — and seed the highly vascular synovial membrane, leading to joint infection [^114H9j2Q]. This route is particularly common in infants due to their **immature immune systems** and the presence of transphyseal vessels, which connect the metaphyseal bone to the joint space, allowing pathogens to spread directly from bone to joint [^114H9j2Q].

---

## Anatomical and physiological factors facilitating hematogenous spread

Several anatomical and physiological factors in infants facilitate hematogenous spread and increase the risk of septic arthritis:

- **Transphyseal vessels**: In infants, transphyseal vessels provide a direct pathway for bacteria to spread from the metaphyseal bone to the joint space, increasing the risk of concurrent osteomyelitis and septic arthritis [^114H9j2Q].

- **Immature immune system**: Infants have underdeveloped immune systems, making them more susceptible to bacterial infections and hematogenous spread [^11698SRD].

- **High vascularity of the synovial membrane**: The synovial membrane is highly vascularized, providing an ideal environment for bacterial seeding and proliferation [^notfound].

---

## Common pathogens involved in hematogenous spread

The most common pathogens responsible for septic arthritis in infants via hematogenous spread include:

| **Pathogen** | **Frequency** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Staphylococcus aureus | Most common | - Acute presentation <br/> - Rapid progression <br/> - Severe joint destruction [^11232XFk] |
| Kingella kingae | Increasingly common in young children | - Milder clinical presentation <br/> - Indolent course <br/> - Often affects the knee [^112WcwXR] |
| Group B Streptococcus | Common in neonates | - Associated with maternal colonization <br/> - Early-onset infection [^notfound] |
| Escherichia coli | Common in neonates | - Associated with urinary tract infections <br/> - Hematogenous spread [^112uqhz8] |

---

## Alternative mechanisms of septic arthritis in infants

While hematogenous spread is the primary mechanism, alternative pathways include **direct inoculation** — via trauma, invasive procedures, or surgery — and **contiguous spread** from adjacent infections such as osteomyelitis or soft-tissue abscesses [^114H9j2Q]. These are less common but important in specific clinical scenarios, particularly in neonates or infants with recent invasive procedures [^116cvkxu].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Understanding the primary mechanism of hematogenous spread in infants has important clinical implications:

- **Early recognition**: Infants with septic arthritis may present with subtle signs such as irritability, refusal to move the affected joint, and pseudoparalysis. Early recognition and prompt intervention are critical to prevent joint destruction and growth disturbances [^111qS4GS].

- **Empiric antibiotic therapy**: Empiric antibiotic therapy should cover the most common pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Kingella kingae, while awaiting culture results [^11172zU9] [^112cjJba].

- **Surgical intervention**: Early surgical drainage and irrigation of the affected joint are essential to prevent joint destruction and growth disturbances [^112utD5x].

---

Hematogenous spread is the **most common mechanism** of septic arthritis in infants, facilitated by anatomical and physiological factors unique to this age group. Early recognition, appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy, and surgical intervention are essential to prevent complications and ensure optimal outcomes [^114H9j2Q].

C-reactive protein (CRP) monitoring in pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — The guideline panel suggests sequential CRP monitoring as an adjunct to clinical assessment, noting there are no data to support a particular frequency and that measurement every 2 to 3 days during the early therapeutic course, rather than daily, followed by weekly or other periodic measurement until a clear trend towards normalization is evident, is an acceptable approach; imaging studies generally are not needed to confirm response but may be indicated when clinical and laboratory findings are not showing expected resolution, and persistent elevation of CRP may prompt changes in management including additional imaging, surgical intervention(s), and re-consideration of the etiology of arthritis.

### Impact of antibiotic pretreatment on cultures in children with osteomyelitis and septic arthritis: a retrospective review [^114FjH5R]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteomyelitis and septic arthritis are two diagnoses commonly encountered in pediatric hospital medicine with an incidence of 1 in 5000–10,000 and 1 in 2700–100,000, respectively. These diagnoses frequently require hospitalization for workup and initiation of treatment. Treatment involves prompt diagnosis, long-term antimicrobial therapy, and sometimes surgical debridement. Though there is a lack of universally-accepted diagnostic criteria for these infections, a combination of pathogen detection, imaging consistent with osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis, and clinical data such as inability to bear weight, decreased range of motion, presence of fever, and elevated inflammatory markers or white blood cell (WBC) count is often used to confirm the diagnosis.

Pathogen detection is important to direct and narrow antimicrobial therapy, but patients may be treated for these infections even with negative cultures to avoid complications related to untreated infection. Cultures may not yield the causative organism, or the pathogen may only be isolated from the affected bone or joint. Rates of culture-negative pediatric musculoskeletal infection range from 16 to 42%. Initial blood cultures have been reported to be positive in 30–50% of children with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, whereas bone biopsy cultures are reported to be positive in 50–70%. A systematic review and several other small studies of pediatric patients with acute osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis found that pathogens were more likely to be isolated from culture samples at the source of infection (joint aspirate, bone biopsy, pus) than from blood culture.

Scope and population — overlap with osteomyelitis and neonatal exclusions are specified: The clinical presentations of osteomyelitis and acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) can overlap substantially in children and these entities may occur concurrently. Neonates are excluded due to important differences in bacterial pathogens, complications of infection, immunologic immaturity, as well as lack of adequate antimicrobial pharmacokinetic data for neonates of various gestational and postnatal ages. For uncommon pathogens, adequate, controlled data are not available to support recommendations, and treatment recommendations for these uncommon pathogens may be found in other organism-specific or disease-specific texts and publications.

### Bone and joint infections [^1172jAPC]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

An acute osteoarticular infection in a child is most often hematogenous. The infection manifests as osteomyelitis or septic arthritis. The most common causative organism is Staphylococcus aureus. Medical advice is usually sought within 2 to 6 days from the onset of symptoms. A child with an osteomyelitis in a lower extremity characteristically presents with limping with or without notable local tenderness, whereas acute septic arthritis is often readily visible because the joint is red, tender, and swollen. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment remain pivotal in avoiding complications in acute bacterial bone and joint infections.

### Aetiology of arthritis in hospitalised children: an observational study [^111Fand3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Arthritis in children has many causes and includes septic and viral arthritis, reactive arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). We aimed to describe the different types of arthritis among children hospitalised for a first episode of arthritis.

Design

Retrospective, descriptive case series study.

Setting

A French tertiary care centre.

Patients

Children under 16years of age hospitalised for an arthritis episode between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2009.

Main Outcome Measures

Demographic and clinical features were compared with χ(2) or Fisher's exact tests and non-parametric tests.

Results

173 children were hospitalised for a first episode of arthritis during the study period, with a male/female ratio of 1.14. The most frequent cause of hospitalisation was septic arthritis (43.4% of cases, 69.3% of which were due to Kingella kingae and 10.7% to Staphylococcus aureus). JIA was responsible for 8.1% of cases and arthritis without any definitive diagnosis for 40.4%. Median age at diagnosis was 2.7years (IQR 0.3–14.6) and was lower in the septic arthritis group (1.5years; 1.1–3.4) than in the JIA group (4.7years; 2.5–10.9) (p < 0.01). Septic arthritis involved a single joint in 97.3% of cases, while JIA involved four joints in 14.3% of cases and two to four joints in 28.6% of cases (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Septic arthritis was the most frequent cause of arthritis in hospitalised children. Despite the increasing application of microbiological molecular methods to synovial fluid analysis, further measures are required to improve the diagnosis of arthritis of unknown cause.

### Fetal breech presentation predisposes to subsequent development of septic arthritis of the hip [^113RzRh6]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

We postulated a link between breech presentation and septic arthritis of the hip. To examine the potential association between these 2 relatively uncommon entities, we used the Patient Administration Systems and Biostatistics Activity (PASBA) database, which contains coded information derived from hospitalizations and ambulatory encounters at U.S. military hospitals worldwide. Among a cohort of nearly 1 million infants born in a 14-year period, 3.37% were found to be in the breech presentation. The rate of septic arthritis of the hip or pelvis during the first year of life among these breech infants was approximately 1/8000, providing a relative risk of 4.1 (95% confidence interval, < 1.4–11.7) compared with the rate among nonbreech infants. Fetal breech presentation predisposes to the development of septic hip during the first year of life.

### Clinical and biologic characteristics of Kingella kingae-induced septic arthritis of the knee in young children [^116C9B1K]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To the best of our knowledge, the present work represents the largest consecutive case series on K. kingae -induced septic arthritis in infants younger than 4 years old. It provides important data about this infection in terms of epidemiology and clinical and biological presentations.

Clinically, only 11.7% of patients with K. kingae -induced septic arthritis had a body temperature > 38.5°C at admission, but 64% of them were unable to bear weight on the affected limb. The study also highlighted that there might be few moderate laboratory findings in cases of K. kingae -induced septic arthritis. Indeed, our infant cohort only presented with mild-to-moderate clinical and biological inflammatory responses to an infection, and thus they fulfilled few, if any, of the usual criteria suggestive of an osteoarticular infection: 88% of infant patients with K. kingae -induced septic arthritis had normal WBC counts of ≤ 17,000/mm 3, and half had WBC counts below 12,000/mm 3; 55% of the infants had CRP levels below 20 mg/l, and 76% of them had an ESR below 40 mm/h. In this context, faced with a more benign clinical picture, we insist on the need for diagnostic arthrocentesis. Our results were thus in line with existing published data.

Musculoskeletal infections

Musculoskeletal infections make up a significant burden of disease in LMICs compared to HICs, straining already limited health care services, but these have been neglected as a public health priority. Joint and bone infections, such as acute septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, affect up to 12 million children, disproportionately affecting school age children. When these infections go unaddressed, children can often require multiple surgeries to control infection and often suffer limb loss, resulting in lifelong disability.

Septic arthritis

Septic arthritis is a joint infection that is caused by hematogenous or contiguous spread of bacteria, and sometimes due to direct inoculation. The incidence of septic arthritis is higher in younger children. Due to the varied epidemiology that mimic acute bacterial septic arthritis such as tuberculosis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated arthropathy, across LMICs, it can be challenging to clinically distinguish a bacterial infection from other causes of an inflamed joint. Moreover, the clinical presentation can manifest as less acute in immunocompromised children, such as those who are malnourished or HIV infected, and radiological changes are not apparent immediately. The invariable lack of access to microbiology services can lead to delayed diagnosis and resultant chronic infection, that in turn lead to physical limitations, chronic sinus formation and subsequent superinfection. In addition, osteomyelitis can develop if the infection spreads into the adjacent bone.

### Management of a child with suspected acute septic arthritis [^11482TQy]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Acute septic arthritis of childhood is a potentially devastating disease that causes permanent disability and can result in death. Traditional treatment consists of a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics combined with aggressive surgery. However, this approach is challenged by trials showing satisfactory outcomes with shorter treatment and less invasive surgery. Diagnostic arthrocentesis alone and an antibiotic for a fortnight, including initial intravenous administration for 2–4 days, suffice in most non-neonatal cases. A good penetrating agent, such as clindamycin or a first-generation cephalosporin, exceptionally high doses, and administration four times a day are probably key factors. If the symptoms and signs subside within a few days, and the serum C-reactive protein level drops below 20 mg/l, the antibiotic can usually be safely discontinued. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a concern, but fortunately, most strains have retained susceptibility to clindamycin. The above guidance is not applicable to neonates and immunocompromised patients who may require a different approach.

### Treatment of acute septic arthritis [^112XunEM]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Acute septic arthritis is a rare, but potentially devastating disease. The treatment is initiated intravenously, but can be safely switched to oral after 2–4 days providing large doses of a well-absorbing antibiotic and, for time-dependent antibiotics, 4 times-a-day administration are used. Empiric treatment should always cover Staphylococcus aureus and common respiratory pathogens, whereas Kingella kingae and Salmonella are important only regionally. Studies conducted by our group have shown that a total course of 10 days may suffice for previously healthy children in a Western setting. Treatment of neonates, patients with immunodeficiency or cases caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus, may deserve a different approach.

Clinical questions and evidence review — search strategy, time frames, and inclusion criteria are detailed: The clinical practice guideline development started in 2011 and a first iteration was nearly completed by 2017, after which the methodology was revisited to fulfill National Academy of Medicine standards; in line with these standards, the GRADE approach for the assessment of the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendation was integrated, and a new set of clinical questions was developed with outcomes identified a priori and explicitly rated. The Health Sciences Library System at the University of Pittsburgh and the William H. Welch Medical Library of Johns Hopkins University designed literature searches and MeSH terms for Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Reviews. Searches were limited to studies published in English and restricted to year of publication from January 2005 to January 2022, with an initial internal search in August 2017 and updates in May 2019, February 2021, and January 2022. Screening used predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria with all potentially relevant citations undergoing full-text review; abstracts and conference proceedings, letters to the editor, editorials, review articles, and unpublished data were excluded, and a minimum of 10 reported confirmed ABA cases was required for published manuscripts to be included in the pooled analysis.

Regarding specific circumstances for septic arthritis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (management of resistant disease), IDSA/PIDS 2024 guidelines recommend to assess the following in pediatric patients with presumed or confirmed acute bacterial arthritis either experiencing primary treatment failure or early or late recurrence:

- the adequacy of the antimicrobial regimen (spectrum of activity, dosage, and antibiotic exposure at the site of infection, adherence) and of joint debridement and irrigation before deciding on the need to broaden the spectrum or restart antimicrobials

- the need for additional diagnostic evaluation for possible adjacent osteomyelitis, along with any need for surgical intervention for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes.

### What's new in pediatric septic arthritis? A review of pertinent clinical questions [^111Y5hvG]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The evaluation and treatment of children with septic arthritis (SA) is challenging and requires an organized approach to address the spectrum of pathogens which appear to aggregate in age-specific groups. Although evidence-based guidelines have recently been published for the evaluation and treatment of children with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, there is a relative dearth of literature devoted exclusively to SA.

Methods

Recently published guidance for the evaluation and treatment of children with SA was reviewed and evaluated with respect to pertinent clinical questions to summarize what is new in this area of practice for pediatric orthopaedic surgeons.

Results

Evidence suggests that there is a profound difference between children with primary SA and those who have contiguous osteomyelitis. This disruption of the commonly accepted paradigm of a continuum of osteoarticular infections has important implications in the evaluation and treatment of children with primary SA. Clinical prediction algorithms have been established to help determine the applicability of magnetic resonance imaging during the evaluation of children suspected to have SA. Antibiotic duration for SA has been recently studied with some evidence in favor of short-course parenteral followed by short-course oral therapy may be successful if the pathogen is not methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Conclusion

Recent studies of children with SA have provided better guidance for evaluation and treatment to improve diagnostic accuracy, processes of evaluation, and clinical outcomes.

Level Of Evidence

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) with clinical sepsis — timing of antimicrobials and outcomes: For the ill-appearing child with clinical sepsis and rapidly progressive disease, early antibiotic therapy is associated with improved outcomes. In pediatric sepsis cohorts, antimicrobials given > 3 hours after presentation were associated with a 4.92-fold increased risk of mortality (95% CI: 1.30 to 18.6) in a retrospective, multicenter study of 130 children with sepsis (21%) or septic shock (79%), and completion of a sepsis bundle including empiric antimicrobials within 1 hour was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (Odds ratio [OR]: 0.59, 95% CI: .38 to .93, p-value = 0.02) among 1,179 children at 54 hospitals. Adult data align, as appropriate therapy within one hour from documentation of hypotension yielded a survival rate of 80%, with each hour of delay during the first 6 hours associated with a 7.6% decrease in survival, and a large retrospective review of 18 000 adults from 165 ICUs found increased mortality with each additional hour to first antimicrobials during the first 6 hours. These data indirectly support the recommendation for early administration of antimicrobials to children with sepsis and suspected ABA when invasive joint sampling is not immediately available at presentation.

### Joint fluid multi-omics improves diagnostic confidence during evaluation of children with presumed septic arthritis [^113Ay36r]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The multiomics approach, including a comprehensive autoantibody screening of joint-fluid, rapidly identified those children with either pathogen reactive versus autoimmune inflammatory conditions. This will help guide appropriate treatment strategies in a higher percentage of cases than previously possible using standard evaluation strategies. Based on our results, a rapid autoantibody screening of joint fluid, especially in case of culture/PCR negative cases, is of clinical value.

Introduction: A common cause of arthritis in children is reactive arthritis, which most often is self-limiting. On the contrary, septic arthritis, which is less common, demands immediate treatment with intravenous antibiotics to prevent long-term joint damage. At first presentation, it often is a diagnostic challenge to differentiate between septic and non-septic arthritis.

Objectives: To compare characteristics of children aged 6 months to 18 years old with septic arthritis and non-septic arthritis.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter cohort study at four general hospitals in the Netherlands, including children with a first-onset arthritis lasting less than 6 weeks between March 1, 2011, and March 1, 2021. Eligible subjects were retrieved using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. We collected clinical, laboratory and imaging data of these patients. Patients with immunodeficiency, acute rheumatic fever, IgA vasculitis and other arthritis related diseases were excluded. Group comparisons were performed using Chi-square/Fisher's exact tests and Mann-Whitney U test.

### Current concepts in pediatric septic arthritis [^111J6Vcr]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Septic arthritis continues to present challenges regarding the clinical diagnosis, workup, and definitive management. Urgent management is essential, so treating surgeons must efficiently work through differential diagnoses, identify concomitant infections, and do a timely irrigation and débridement. The incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is increasing, typically resulting in a more rapid progression of symptoms with more severe clinical presentation. The diagnostic utility of MRI has resulted in improved detection of concomitant septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, although MRI must not substantially delay definitive management. Early diagnosis followed by urgent irrigation and débridement and antibiotic therapy are essential for satisfactory long-term outcomes. Antibiotics should not be administered until blood cultures and arthrocentesis fluid are obtained, except in rare cases of a septic or toxic patient. Once cultures are obtained, empiric antibiotic therapy should commence and provide coverage for the most likely pathogens, given the patient's age. Laboratory markers, especially C-reactive protein, should be followed until normalization and correlate with resolution of clinical symptoms. Definitive antibiotic selection should be shared with a pediatric infectious disease specialist, who can help guide the duration of treatment.

Phelps summarized the then postulated causes of congenital dislocation of the hip. He quoted Ambrose Paré, from his book in 1678, "Hippocrates himself avers that infants in the very womb may have their joints dislocated by a fall, a blow, or compression [1]". "Heredity", Phelps commented, "no doubt has much to do with producing this deformity". He again cites Paré, on the role of heredity: ".hereditary causes: 'such as parents transfuse into their offspring; hence it is that crooked, not necessarily, but oftentimes, are generated by crooked, and lame by lame'. Other causes he noted were "An original defect in the organization of the germ, or the operation of the formative power"; "Arrest of development of the cotyloid cavity"; "Certain articular maladies occurring in the fœtus during intrauterine life"; and "Diseases of the primitive nerve centers". He concluded, "Congenital dislocation of the hip is produced, I believe, by injury at birth; injury in utero, or disease in utero; rachitis; hereditary influences, and in exceptional cases, if such there are, by arrest of development of the acetabulum". Yet, "I am inclined to believe.that the deformity is more frequently produced by violence, or by pathological changes the result of inflammation, than from any other cause". (Septic arthritis of the hip in those days was not an uncommon condition in infants and children, and often led to dislocation owing to delayed diagnosis and lack of proper treatment.)

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^11232XFk]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) in children — pathogen patterns and clinical presentation: S. aureus is the most commonly identified pathogen among highly immunized populations of children in reports that relied on traditional bacterial culture-based diagnostic techniques, whereas K. kingae is reported as the most common pathogen detected in recent studies of young children. Multiple retrospective reviews suggest differences between S. aureus and K. kingae, with S. aureus more often presenting with relatively acute onset and more rapid progression of joint pain over 24–48 hours across age groups, while K. kingae in infants and preschool-aged children often shows a more indolent, less well-defined presentation and limited ability to localize symptoms. ABA with associated contiguous osteomyelitis, particularly with S. aureus, is common, and multiple concurrent infected joints are uncommon in ABA caused by S. aureus or K. kingae.

### Clinical spectrum and microbial etiology of bone and joint infections in children: a retrospective analysis from south India [^111fQwNe]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute infections of bone and joints are medical emergencies. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for limb salvage and prevention of deformities. Data from developing countries are essential to develop region-specific treatment guidelines including choice of empiric antibiotics. We reviewed electronic medical records of children (≤ 12 years old) admitted to the pediatrics or orthopedics department of a tertiary care hospital in South India from 2013 to 2017 with a diagnosis of septic arthritis and/or osteomyelitis. Clinical, microbiological, and follow-up data were collected and analyzed. The median (interquartile range, IQR) age of the children (N = 207) was 48 (7.5–105) months. Acute infections were more common in infants, whereas chronic cases were common in children > 5 years of age. Staphylococcus aureus (71%) was the most common organism identified. Gram-negative organisms were more frequently isolated in infants compared with older children. Blood and/or wound culture positivity was 78% (N = 161) overall and 78% (N = 31) in chronic cases. The median (IQR) duration of antibiotics was 7 (5–8) weeks. Sequelae and readmissions occurred in 47% (N = 81) of the 172 patients followed for a year. Culture positivity rates especially of wound were high even after receiving antibiotics.

### Group A streptococcal septic hip arthritis in a child with spastic triplegic cerebral palsy [^111jHFXC]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

The long-term effects of septic hip arthritis depend on the age of occurrence whether there was delayed initiation of antimicrobial treatment and the shape of the hip joint at skeletal maturity. For example, in infants under age 6 months old who have septic hip arthritis, delayed, inadequate, or no treatment can lead to complete destruction of the proximal femoral epiphysis and consequently to an unstable hip joint. On the other hand, untreated septic arthritis in older children is most likely to lead to a stiff hip joint and ankylosis. Given that our patient is older, we would have predicted joint stiffness rather than instability. This deviation from expected course may indicate that perhaps patients with cerebral palsy have a different pathophysiology or suggests that perhaps repeated surgical intervention contributed to instability.

In conclusion, this case highlights the difficulties in diagnosing and managing septic joint arthritis in pediatric patients with cerebral palsy. These difficulties include the atypical features of the clinical presentation, the possibility of postinfectious progression of hip subluxation, and, in this particular case, the resistant nature of the inflammatory response related to the infection. Septic arthritis should be entertained in cerebral palsy patients who present with fever and new limitation of joint movement, especially if there is associated bacteremia.

Objective

To evaluate the existing evidence on the diagnosis and management of septic arthritis in native joints.

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, National Electronic Library for Health, reference lists, national experts.

Review Methods

Systematic review of the literature with evaluation of the methodological quality of the selected papers using defined criteria set out by the Clinical Effectiveness and Evaluation Unit of the Royal College of Physicians.

Results

3291 citations were initially identified. Of these, 189 full text articles were identified for potential selection. Following review of these full text articles, 80 articles were found to fulfil the inclusion criteria and were included in the final list.

Conclusions

were drawn on the diagnosis, investigation and management of septic arthritis.

Discussion

Little good quality evidence exists to guide the diagnosis and management of septic arthritis. Overall, no investigation is more reliable in the diagnosis of septic arthritis than the opinion of an experienced doctor. Aspiration and culture of synovial fluid is crucial to the diagnosis, but measurement of cell count is unhelpful. Antibiotics are clearly required for a prolonged period, but there are no data to indicate by which route or for how long. Key unanswered questions remain surrounding the medical and surgical management of the infected joint.

### Current approach to the evaluation and management of septic arthritis [^11498V1v]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Septic arthritis is an emergent condition caused by bacterial infection of a joint space. The most common etiology is hematogenous spread from bacteremia, but it can also occur from direct inoculation from bites, injection injuries, cellulitis, abscesses, or local trauma. Septic arthritis occurs most frequently in the lower extremities, with the hips and knees serving as the most common locations. The most sensitive findings include pain with motion of the joint, limited range of motion, tenderness of the joint, new joint swelling, and new effusion. Laboratory testing and imaging can support the diagnosis, but the criterion standard is diagnostic arthrocentesis. Treatment involves intravenous antibiotics and joint decompression.

### Comparison of clinical and biologic features of Kingella kingae and Staphylococcus aureus arthritis at initial evaluation [^113go9RH]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

We conducted a retrospective study comparing the presenting clinical and biologic features of 64 children who had septic arthritis caused by Kingella kingae with 26 children who had septic arthritis caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Children with K. kingae septic arthritis were significantly younger than those with S. aureus septic arthritis. Otherwise, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to fever, location, white blood cell count, synovial fluid cell count, C-reactive protein, or serum fibrinogen. However, the clinical course was significantly better for children with septic arthritis caused by K. kingae as evidenced by shorter hospitalization and fewer adverse events. Presumptive antibiotic therapy for septic arthritis in young infants should take into account both of these pathogens, even in case of mild presentation.

Ankylosis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can be a result of trauma, degenerative changes and infection or of a space-occupying lesion and, when occurring during early childhood, can result in severe functional disability and facial distortion. Septic arthritis of the TMJ is extremely rare in young infants. We report two children with TMJ ankylosis that is believed to have been a consequence of undiagnosed septic arthritis of the TMJ in the neonatal period.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

PIDS/IDSA pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — post-acute follow-up and growth arrest: Growth arrest can be typically detected within months from the initial infection, and monitoring for growth arrest may be performed as part of routine well-childcare by primary care providers as well as by orthopedic specialists; there are no data describing what can be done to prevent growth arrest, but orthopedic procedures to manage growth arrest can be performed if needed. This conditional recommendation is based on very low certainty of evidence and recommends that children with either presumed or confirmed primary ABA who have substantial recovery at the end of acute management will not routinely require either orthopedic or infectious diseases follow-up, whereas the recommendation for ongoing orthopedic specialist follow-up applies to children who appear to have higher risk of long-term complications with joint or bone growth or function to allow for early intervention. Future research needs include comprehensive controlled prospective studies stratified by joint and causative organism.

### Psoas abscess with associated septic arthritis of the hip in infants [^115g8HQh]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

We describe psoas abscess with concomitant septic hip arthritis in 2 infants, 3 and 7 months old. The common clinical features were a palpable mass in the inguinal region, irritable hip, and delayed treatment. The diagnosis of septic hip was delayed in one child, and they both had residual hip deformity at follow-up. It is possible that initial delay in diagnoses resulted in the concurrent pathologic condition because of spread of infection. These 2 cases demonstrate the first known reports of concurrent psoas abscess and septic hip arthritis in infancy. Magnetic resonance imaging is a valuable method to identify these concurrent pathologic conditions. A proposed etiologic mechanism is also discussed in the article.

### Is It pediatric septic arthritis or transient synovitis of the hip? [^114Zpdwg]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Differentiating a case of transient synovitis from septic arthritis of the hip in children can be difficult because the presentations of these two entities are similar. Fever, a limp, unwillingness to bear weight, limited motion and joint effusion can occur with both. Kocher and associates conducted a retrospective study of presenting signs in children with septic arthritis and transient synovitis of the hip. The diagnosis of transient synovitis was given to 86 of 282 children who had a white blood cell count in joint fluid of less than 50, 000 per mm 3 and negative findings on culture, resolution of symptoms without antimicrobial therapy and no further problems. The 114 children excluded from further analysis were those in atypical groups, such as those with renal failure, an immunocompromised state, neonatal sepsis, postoperative infection of the hip and other disorders.

The presenting signs in the 82 patients with septic arthritis differed significantly from those in the 86 children with transient synovitis. Compared with children with transient synovitis, those with septic arthritis had a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a higher serum white blood cell count. As many as 78 of the patients with septic arthritis could not bear weight on the hip, compared with 30 of the patients with transient synovitis. A history of fever was present in 67 of the children with septic arthritis but in only seven of those with transient synovitis. There was a strong relationship between an increasing number of these predictors and the proportion of patients with septic arthritis.

The authors conclude that the risk of septic arthritis of the hip can be accurately predicted by the presence of three or four specific factors. The authors state that children presenting with such signs, which indicate a high probability of septic arthritis of the hip, may be good candidates for aspiration in the operating room, given the likelihood that arthrotomy and drainage will subsequently be needed. Patients with a low probability of septic arthritis can be safely observed without aspiration. Validation of this clinical prediction algorithm awaits prospective studies.

### Corticosteroids for septic arthritis in children [^116dDPUY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Septic arthritis is an acute infection of the joints characterised by erosive disruption of the articular space. It is the most common non-degenerative articular disease in developing countries. The most vulnerable population for septic arthritis includes infants and preschoolers, especially boys. Septic arthritis disproportionately affects populations of low socioeconomic status. Systemic corticosteroids and antibiotic therapy may be beneficial for treatment of septic arthritis. Even if the joint infection is eradicated by antibiotic treatment, the inflammatory process may produce residual joint damage and sequelae.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in children with a diagnosis of septic arthritis.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov), and Google Scholar. We searched all databases from their inception to 17 April 2018, with no restrictions on language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with patients from two months to 18 years of age with a diagnosis of septic arthritis who were receiving corticosteroids in addition to antibiotic therapy or as an adjuvant to other therapies such as surgical drainage, intra-articular puncture, arthroscopic irrigation, or debridement.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, data extraction, and evaluation of risk of bias. We considered as major outcomes the presence of pain, activities of daily living, normal physical joint function, days of antibiotic treatment, length of hospital stay, and numbers of total and serious adverse events. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included two RCTs involving a total of 149 children between three months and 18 years of age who were receiving antibiotics for septic arthritis. The most commonly affected joints were hips and knees. These studies were performed in Costa Rica and Israel. In both studies, dexamethasone administered intravenously (ranging from 0.15 to 0.2 mg/kg/dose every six to eight hours) during four days was the corticosteroid, and the comparator was placebo. Trials excluded patients with any degree of immunodeficiency or immunosuppression. The longest follow-up was one year. Trials did not report activities of daily living nor length of hospital stay. Both studies used adequate processes for randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding, and review authors judged them to have low risk of selection and performance bias. Losses to follow-up were substantive in both studies, and we judged them to have high risk of attrition bias and of selective outcome reporting. We graded all outcomes as low quality due to concerns about study limitations and imprecision. The risk ratio (RR) for absence of pain at 12 months of follow-up was 1.33, favouring corticosteroids (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.72; P = 0.03; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 13, 95% CI 6 to 139; absolute risk difference 24%, 95% CI 5% to 43%). The RR for normal function of the affected joint at 12 months of follow-up was 1.32, favouring corticosteroids (95% CI 1.12 to 1.57; P = 0.001; NNTB = 13, 95% CI 7 to 33; absolute risk difference 24%, 95% CI 11% to 37%). We found a reduction in the number of days of intravenous antibiotic treatment favouring corticosteroids (mean difference (MD) -2.77, 95% CI -4.16 to -1.39) based on two trials with 149 participants. Researchers did not report length of hospital stay. One trial (49 participants) reported that treatment with dexamethasone was associated with a shorter duration of IV antibiotic treatment, leading to a shorter hospital stay, and although duration of hospitalisation was a primary outcome of the study, study authors did not provide data on the duration of hospitalisation. We downgraded the quality by one level for concerns about study limitations (high risk of attrition bias and selective reporting), and by another level for imprecision. In one trial of 49 participants, researchers followed 29 children for 12 months, and parents reported that no children demonstrated adverse effects of the intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in children with a diagnosis of septic arthritis is of low quality and is derived from the findings of two trials (N = 149). Corticosteroids may increase the proportion of patients without pain and the proportion of patients with normal function of the affected joint at 12 months, and may also reduce the number of days of antibiotic treatment. However, we cannot draw strong conclusions based upon these trial results. Additional randomised clinical trials in children with relevant outcomes are needed.

### Septic arthritis of a posterior lumbar facet joint in an infant: a case report [^111Jd5DX]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Objective

To describe a case of septic arthritis of the facet joint in an infant.

Summary Of Background Data

To our knowledge, no more than 50 cases of septic arthritis of a facet joint are reported in literature, including only 4 cases in children and none in infants.

Methods

A girl of age 18 months presented with a fever pattern of 4 days evolution, right lumbar paravertebral tumefaction with local inflammatory signs and limping related to pain with weight-bearing on the right lower extremity. The mother reported a pharyngeal infection 2 weeks earlier. Conventional radiology showed no alterations. MR and scintigraphy with radioactivity-marked leukocytes showed affectation only of the posterior facet joint of right L4-L5, without associated collections. Blood and urine cultures were negative. The diagnosis was established as right L4-L5 septic arthritis of a lumbar facet joint, probably of hematogenous origin.

Results

The fever pattern and the limp disappeared in 24 hours with wide-spectrum empirical intravenous antibiotherapy. Although no microorganism was isolated, the good response to the empirical treatment and the background of pharyngeal infection point to a hematogenous dissemination by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus spp.

Conclusion

Septic arthritis of a facet joint does not differ clinically from other spinal infections and its incidence is possibly underestimated in favor of other more common entities. Only imaging techniques can differentiate the affected structures and establish the exact diagnosis.MR allows the detection in initial stages, delimits the affectation and extension through the soft tissues, and rules out other more common entities such as discitis. Scintigraphy and SPECT can detect other active foci and be useful in the follow-up. The result achieved with antibiotic treatment in early stages is usually satisfactory. Surgical debridement is only necessary when associated purulent collections appear. From the pediatric point of view, spinal infections should also be taken into consideration within the differential diagnostic of limp in children.

### Septic arthritis in an afebrile young infant with a urinary tract infection [^112uqhz8]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Although guidelines exist for the evaluation of serious bacterial infections in febrile young infants, these infections are less likely to be considered in those who are afebrile. We discuss the case of an afebrile, well-appearing, previously healthy 5-week-old girl who presented with left knee swelling and was found to have an Escherichia coli urinary tract infection complicated by E coli septic arthritis. This case underscores the importance of considering serious bacterial infections in afebrile, well-appearing infants less than 2 months old and maintaining a low threshold for diagnostic testing. Furthermore, this case highlights a unique pathophysiology of septic arthritis from a urinary source, emphasizing the need for providers to consider urine testing in cases of young infants with septic arthritis.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2021 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in pediatrics [^114pJz9Q]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Pediatric AHO — surgical source control principles and supporting evidence: Every established source of infection should be controlled as soon as possible, and adult sepsis data provide indirect evidence supporting source control in pediatric AHO; in a Spanish national multicenter prospective observational trial in adults, crude ICU mortality was lower (21.2% vs 25.1%; p = 0.010) with source control, adjusted hospital mortality was lower (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.99), and delay in source control beyond 12 hours was not associated with increased mortality. When surgery is undertaken, the goal is to debride all dead and devitalized tissue, with bone opening sized to avoid destabilization (generally 1 x 3 cm in dimension), and drain placement after debridement allows continued evacuation. Regarding abscess size thresholds, drainage of abscesses 2 cm or more in diameter has been suggested, while resolution with medical management alone has been described in small numbers for abscesses < 1 cm diameter. Bacterial arthritis can be associated with AHO, and the involved joint(s) is usually drained at presentation when clinically apparent.

### Primary septic arthritis in children demonstrates presumed and confirmed varieties which require age-specific evaluation and treatment strategies [^1139j63i]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is uncertainty involved in the evaluation and treatment of children suspected to have septic arthritis particularly when no causative pathogen is confirmed. This study evaluates children with primary septic arthritis to refine the processes of evaluation and treatment and improve the rate of pathogen confirmation.

Methods

Children suspected to have septic arthritis from 2009 to 2019 were retrospectively studied. Diagnosis of primary septic arthritis, defined as hematogenous joint infection without associated osteomyelitis, was established by clinical evaluation, radiology and laboratory results, including joint fluid analysis. Excluded cases were categorized by etiology. Children with primary septic arthritis were divided into confirmed and presumed cohorts for statistical comparison.

Results

A total of 355 children (average age 4.4y, range 0.05 to 18y) were initially treated as septic arthritis. Eighty-seven (24.5%) were excluded due to other conditions, including 34 (9.6%) with noninfectious conditions. Among 268 children with primary septic arthritis, 134 were confirmed and 134 were presumed. A higher rate of 16S polymerase chain reaction (PCR) acquisition (71.6% vs. 45.5%) occurred in the confirmed cohort. Overall yield for various methods of pathogen identification were 27 of 239 (11.3%) by blood culture, 83 of 268 (31.0%) by joint fluid culture and 85 of 157 (54.1%) by PCR. PCR identified a pathogen in 87.5% of children with confirmed septic arthritis. Antibiotic pretreatment was associated with a lower rate of joint fluid culture positivity. Pathogens aggregated within specific age groups. The 4 to 9-year-old age group displayed the widest spectrum of pathogens with limited predictability.

Conclusions

This study emphasizes the need for systematic processes of evaluation and treatment for children suspected to have primary septic arthritis, including minimization of antibiotic pretreatment, age-based empiric antibiotic selection, and sufficient follow-up to ensure noninfectious conditions are distinguished in culture-negative cases. Extended observation, before intervention, may be appropriate for some children.

Level Of Evidence

Level III-retrospective control study.

Vaso-occlusive crises and bone disease

Painful vaso-occlusive crisis due to bony infarction is the commonest cause for hospital admissions. Infants may present with dactylitis or bony infarction of digits, irritability and swelling of fingers or toes. Infarction can affect any bone or joint and may mimic osteomyelitis. Avascular necrosis — the result of recurrent vaso-occlusion and infarction of the articular surfaces and heads of long bones — is found in 12%–15% of children with SCAand has been associated with both high haematocrit and the concomitant presence of α-thalassaemia. Osteomyelitis and septic arthritis, most commonly due to Salmonella spp, Staphylococcus aureus and Gram negative enteric bacilli, are also common, a cumulative incidence of 12% having been reported in one paediatric cohort in metropolitan France. Osteopaenia and osteoporosis are frequent findings in SCD and patients may suffer from chronic back pain as a result of vertebral collapse.

Conclusions

Pretreatment of patients with antibiotics prior to culture was not associated with a significant change in culture yield, even as the duration of antibiotics increased. Routinely initiating antibiotics early in the illness course may enable reduction of variability and improve coordination of care as these infections often require a multidisciplinary approach. Prospective studies or trials are needed to determine if early initiation of antibiotics affects culture positivity or improves clinical outcomes.

### Abnormal gait in a child with fever: diagnosing septic arthritis of the hip [^113AaLV6]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of septic arthritis should be considered in all children with hip pain. We review the evaluation of children who present with fever and hip pain, emphasizing features that may assist in distinguishing septic arthritis of the hip from transient synovitis. We also discuss the impact of the increased prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus on the management of septic arthritis of the hip.

### Joint fluid multi-omics improves diagnostic confidence during evaluation of children with presumed septic arthritis [^1117zwNw]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Multi-omics is an integrated approach to combine genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Clinical applications of multi-omics are rapidly expanding globally. Metagenomics Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) offers sensitive, quick, and culture-free identification of pathogens which are difficult to grow or identify in joint fluid. The small sample volume requirement makes this especially attractive for use in young children and infants. Furthermore, ability to rapidly identify biomarkers of host response to infection or inflammation through proteomics has the potential to improve the diagnosis and treatment of affected children.

Childhood arthritis prevalence ranges from 21 to 403 per 100,000 population among U.S. children and adolescents < 18 years old. A national survey (2017–2021) estimated that 220,000 U.S. children and adolescents are diagnosed with arthritis. Current clinical and laboratory parameters do not reliably differentiate those with infectious, inflammatory, versus autoimmune arthritis. It results in presumptive surgical and/or antibiotic therapy along with prolonged follow-up care.

The objective of the present study was to assess the feasibility and clinical utility of multiomics approach incorporating mNGS, cytokine/antibody proteomics, and single cell transcriptomics of joint-fluid to rapidly identify causal pathogens (viral, bacteria, fungal) or autoimmune manifestations (autoantibodies and cytokine repertoires). This will guide the clinical decision making for children diagnosed with presumed septic arthritis.

### Acute osteomyelitis, septic arthritis and discitis: differences between neonates and older children [^116cvkxu]. European Journal of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

There are aetiological, clinical, radiological and therapeutic differences between musculoskeletal infection in the neonate (and infant) and in older children and adults. Due to the anatomy and blood supply in neonates, osteomyelitis often co-exists with septic arthritis. Discitis is more common in infants whereas vertebral body infection is more common in adults. This review article discusses the important clinical and radiological differences that in the past have led many authors to consider neonatal osteomyelitis a separate entity from osteomyelitis in the older child.

### COVID-19 control measures and common paediatric infections [^112qiAdm]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Research, doi:

The covid-19 pandemic upended virtually all aspects of society, not least patterns of healthcare use. In a linked paper (doi:), Kadambari and colleagues report dramatic decreases in hospital admissions due to a range of 19 childhood infections in UK children in the 16 months after the start of the covid-19 pandemic. Almost all studied infections declined, including common respiratory viruses, vaccine preventable infections, and common bacterial infections. These findings support and expand data from the United States showing major decreases in childhood respiratory viruses.

While some of the results might be expected, one surprising finding was the decrease in sporadic bacterial infections, osteomyelitis and septic arthritis, most commonly caused by Kingella kingae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Although progression from pathogen acquisition to symptomatic infection in bacterial musculoskeletal infections is not well understood, conditions such as acute haematogenous osteomyelitis probably begin with colonisation of mucosal sites with the causative pathogen. Encounters with such pathogens were probably less frequent during the study period. Furthermore, co-occurringviral respiratory infections appear to increase the colonisation density of pneumococci and other pathogenic bacteria in the upper respiratory tract. Therefore, it is conceivable that viral infections are a risk factor for invasive bacterial infections and a reduction in viral infections might help explain the decline in bacterial infections.

Acute septic arthritis is a condition with the potential for joint destruction, physeal damage, and osteonecrosis, which warrants urgent identification and treatment. The organism most frequently responsible is Staphylococcus aureus; however, our understanding of pathogens continues to evolve as detection methods continue to improve. MRI has improved our ability to detect concurrent infections and is a useful clinical tool where available. The treatment course involves intravenous antibiotics followed by transition to oral antibiotics when clinically appropriate. The recommended surgical treatment of septic arthritis is open arthrotomy with decompression of the joint, irrigation, and debridement and treatment of concurrent infections.

### Septic arthritis: diagnosis and treatment… [^117Xmko7]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

1, 3 A joint is most commonly infected hematogenously from bacteremia. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species are the most common causes. Septic arthritis is diagnosed through laboratory testing, particularly synovial fluid studies. ORGANISMS In adults, S. aureus is the most common cause of native joint septic arthritis, followed by Streptococcus species. Native joint septic arthritis can be associated with some viral infections, including chikungunya, rubella, and parvovirus B19. Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection is a common cause of oligoarticular arthritis, and group B streptococci are more common in oligoarticular arthritis than in monoarticular septic arthritis. Septic arthritis caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus requires drainage or debridement and three to four weeks of antibiotics. Parenteral options include intravenous vancomycin and daptomycin.

Parenteral and oral options include trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with rifampin, linezolid, and clindamycin, but there is no specific guidance regarding the duration of intravenous therapy before initiation of oral therapy.
7. Special Considerations GONOCOCCAL ARTHRITIS Gonococcal arthritis is caused by bacteremia from a sexually transmitted N. gonorrhoeae infection. Two forms of disseminated gonococcal infection that present with arthritis are localized septic arthritis and an arthritis-dermatitis syndrome that is characterized by malaise, polyarthralgias, tenosynovitis, and dermatitis. 31, 32 Gonococcal arthritis can present as a monoarthritis, oligoarthritis, or polyarthritis and affect any joint.
33. FUNGAL ARTHRITIS The presentation of fungal infections varies significantly. Many infections are indolent in presentation, whereas some cause rapid destruction.

22 Risk factors for fungal arthritis include diabetes, HIV infection, immunosuppression from disease or medication use, organ transplantation, parenteral hyperalimentation, indwelling catheter, substance abuse, and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. 41 Candida is the most common pathogen causing fungal septic arthritis, although it is normal flora found on the skin and mucous membranes of healthy individuals.

### Humeral shortening and inferior subluxation as sequelae of septic arthritis of the shoulder in neonates and infants [^112utD5x]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Although humeral shortening as a sequel of septic arthritis of the shoulder in infants has been reported in previous studies, functional disorders of the shoulder resulting from humeral shortening have not yet been clarified. In this study, we retrospectively investigated the long-term outcome of septic arthritis of the shoulder in neonates and infants and examined the relationship between growth disturbance of the humerus and decreased range of motion with respect to glenohumeral joint laxity.

Methods

We reviewed the cases of fifteen patients (sixteen shoulders) with an age of a few days to 2.6 years at the onset of the disease who were followed from 5.0 to 17.9 years. We noted the initial treatment method and evaluated humeral length and shoulder function at the time of the final follow-up. For the final treatment results, we classified the shoulders with normal findings on radiographs as Grade I, those with humeral head deformity as Grade II, and those with humeral head deformity with inferior subluxation as Grade III.

Results

Primary treatment included arthrotomy in ten shoulders. The delay between the onset of the disease and surgery ranged from three to twenty-six days. At the time of the final follow-up, the results were Grade I in five shoulders, Grade II in six shoulders, and Grade III in five shoulders. The mean humeral shortening was 0.1 cm for Grade-I shoulders, 0.9 cm for Grade-II shoulders, and 7.3 cm for Grade-III shoulders. All Grade-III shoulders had ≥ 3 cm of shortening, and four of the five Grade-III shoulders showed limitation of elevation (abduction of < 130 degrees). None of the Grade-III shoulders had undergone arthrotomy within ten days after the onset of the disease.

Conclusions

Inferior subluxation of the humeral head related to shoulder dysfunction resulting from early childhood septic arthritis accompanied humeral shortening of ≥ 3 cm and was only observed in patients who did not undergo arthrotomy of the shoulder within ten days after the onset of the infection.

### Septic arthritis of the neonatal hip: acute management and late reconstruction [^114H9j2Q]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis of the hip in neonates is rare but can have devastating consequences. Presenting signs and symptoms may differ from those encountered in older children, which may result in diagnostic challenge or delay. Many risk factors predispose neonates to septic arthritis, including the presence of transphyseal vessels and invasive procedures. Bacterial infection of the joint occurs via hematogenous invasion, extension from an adjacent site, or direct inoculation. A strong correlation exists between younger age at presentation and severity of residual hip deformity. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination, laboratory markers, and ultrasound evaluation. Early management includes parenteral antibiotics and surgical drainage. Late-stage management options include femoral and pelvic osteotomies, trochanteric arthroplasty, arthrodesis, pelvic support procedures, and nonsurgical measures. Early diagnosis and management continues to be the most important prognostic factor for a favorable outcome in the neonate with septic arthritis.

### Epidemiology, etiology, and clinical features of septic arthritis in children younger than 24 months… [^113LqGWt]. JAMA Network (1995). Excellent credibility.

Objective: To examine the incidence, etiology, and clinical features of septic arthritis in patients younger than 24 months. Design: Retrospective, 1988 through 1993 period, chart review–based survey. Patients: All children with bacteriologically proved septic arthritis that was diagnosed at a medical center serving southern Israel. Septic arthritis was defined by clinical evidence of joint inflammation and a positive synovial fluid or blood culture, antigen detection test, or a standard tube agglutination titer of 160 or greater for Brucella species. Interventions: None. Results: During the 6-year period, 40 children had septic arthritis diagnosed. Twenty-six were male. The annual incidence of septic arthritis was 37. 1 per 100
000. The two most common organisms isolated were Kingella kingae in 19 and Haemophilus influenzae type b in eight. The clinical presentation was frequently mild: a body temperature of less than 38.

3°C was recorded in 14 of 40 children, leukocyte count of less than 15×109/L in 13 of 38, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of less than 30 mm per hour in four of
35. In eight of 22 patients, less than 50×109/L leukocytes were counted in the synovial fluid. Conclusions: The diagnosis of septic arthritis in young children requires a high index of suspicion, and the disease cannot be excluded on the basis of lack of fever or normal results of laboratory tests. Kingella kingae appears to be the most common cause of septic arthritis in patients younger than 24 months, although confirmatory studies from other geographic areas are still needed.

### Etiology of septic arthritis in children: an update for the new millennium [^112gqfhN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to describe the causative organisms and joints involved in cases of pediatric septic arthritis in the post-Haemophilus influenzae type B and post-pneumococcal vaccine age and in the age of increasing infection with community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA).

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review of all children younger than 13 years presenting to our tertiary care pediatric emergency department between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2007, with the diagnosis of septic arthritis. We reviewed the results of synovial fluid Gram stain and synovial fluid and blood culture. We defined septic arthritis as any of these 3 tests being positive for a known pathogen. We report patient characteristics, joint(s) involved, and organisms identified in these cases.

Results

We describe 13 cases of septic arthritis. Fifteen joints were involved. The most common joint involved was the hip (6/15) followed by the elbow (3/15), knee (2/15), and ankle (2/15). The most common organism involved was methicillin-sensitive S aureus (6/13), followed by CA-MRSA (2/13) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2/13).

Conclusion

Our results support continued concern for involvement of the hip and knee in cases of pediatric septic arthritis and consideration of other joints such as the elbow. Our data also suggest that empiric antibiotic coverage for CA-MRSA is indicated in cases of pediatric septic arthritis, as well as continued coverage for methicillin-sensitive S aureus and S pneumoniae.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of pediatric hip pain [^1168Ktpj]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

A variety of clinical, laboratory, and radiographic criteria are used to help differentiate septic arthritis from transient synovitis, but because of the substantial overlap between the two groups there are no absolute criteria for definitive diagnosis of either condition. Kocher and colleagues described an Evidence-Based Clinical Prediction Algorithm to determine the probability of septic arthritis and subsequently validated the algorithm in a prospective study. The four independent multivariate clinical predictors to differentiate between septic arthritis and transient synovitis are: history of fever, non-weight-bearing, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of at least 40 millimeters per hour, and serum white blood-cell count of more than 12,000 cells per mm 3 (12.0 × 10 9 cells per liter). The predicted probability of septic arthritis was determined for all sixteen combinations of these four predictors and is summarized (original cohort/prospective cohort) as less than 0.2 percent for zero predictors, 3.0/9.5 percent for one predictor, 40.0/35.0 percent for two predictors, 93.1/72.8 percent for three predictors, and 99.6/93.0 percent for four predictors. In another preliminary retrospective study, Jung and colleagues found the probability of diagnosing acute septic arthritis was 98.8% according to multivariate regression analysis and the presence of all of the following five features: body temperature > 37°C, ESR > 20 mm/h, CRP > 1 mg/dL, WBC > 11,000/mL, and an increased medial hip joint space of > 2 mm on A/P radiographs.

Clinical prediction rules serves as guidelines but clinical judgment ultimately dictates patient management.

Osteomyelitis

Proximal femur or pelvic osteomyelitis presents similar to septic arthritis of the hip with fever and pain but children may have some passive range of motion if there is not extension of the infection into the joint. Osteomyelitis of the femur is common and usually occurs in the rapidly growing metaphyseal region. Pelvic osteomyelitis is not common; it usually occurs in late childhood and affects the ilium (40%), ischium (28%) and the pubis (15%). Pain may be referred to the hip, thigh, or abdomen, often leading to delays in diagnosis. Results of blood cultures are positive in less than 50% of patients. The most common pathogen in normal hosts is S. aureus. Technetium bone scan will localize the infection and CT or MRI imaging can better characterize the extent of involvement. Treatment includes initial intravenous antibiotics followed by oral antibiotics. If there is an abscess surgical drainage is required.

TABLE 1.
Population Description (n = 51)

From a bacteriological point of view, K. kingae was recovered from classic blood cultures in 6 cases, in one case this pathogen was revealed by K. Kingae -specific real-time PCR assay in peripheral blood. In 45 cases, K. kingae -specific real-time PCR assays were performed on joint fluid, resulting in 44 positive cases (99.7%). Finally, all 45 K. kingae -specific real-time PCR assays performed on throat swabs were positive (100%). Children sustained classical cultures of the articular fluid.

Next, the five modified criteria predictive of septic arthritis were evaluated, as defined by Kocher and Caird (i.e. fever > 38.5°C, inability to bear weight, serum WBC count > 12,000/mm 3, ESR > 40 mm/h, and CRP level > 20 mg/l). Inability to bear weight was found in 33 children (64%) and was the most frequently noted risk factor for childhood K. kingae -induced septic arthritis. WBC count > 12,000/mm3 was found in 25 children (49%), a CRP level > 20 mg/l was found in 23 patients (45%), an ESR > 40 mm/h was found in 14 cases (24%), and a fever > 38.5°C was noted in 6 infants (12%) (Figure 1). When all the predictive risk factors were analyzed together, we noted that 7 infants with K.kingae -induced septic arthritis had none of them; 8 children had 1 factor, 20 had 2 factors, 12 had 3 factors, and 4 had 4 factors. None of the children was positive for all 5 risk factors. The average number of risk factors per patient was 1.96, corresponding to a less than 62% probability of infectious arthritis in this patient cohort with K. kingae -induced septic arthritis (Figure 1).

Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully followed.

Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and, if exposed, to obtain medical advice.

Intra-articular injection of a corticosteroid may produce systemic as well as local effects.

Appropriate examination of any joint fluid present is necessary to exclude a septic process.

A marked increase in pain accompanied by local swelling, further restriction of joint motion, fever, and malaise are suggestive of septic arthritis. If this complication occurs and the diagnosis of sepsis is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be instituted.

Local injection of a steroid into a previously infected joint is to be avoided. Corticosteroids should not be injected into unstable joints.

Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis they do not show that they affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect. (See Dosage and Administration Section).

Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.

Acute septic arthritis is a rare, potentially severe infection that requires immediate treatment to avoid long-term morbidity. Most common aetiological agents are commonly used for empirical treatment, but the choice of antibiotics may be influenced by other factors, such as the patient's age and the epidemiological context. We report an infant with elbow arthritis, whose treatment was changed after Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 9N was isolated in the blood and synovial fluid. The child underwent arthrocentesis and received intravenous ampicillin followed by oral amoxicillin, with a favourable response and no sequelae at 1-year follow-up. We report an uncommon manifestation of invasive pneumococcal disease in a young immunised healthy infant caused by a non-vaccine serotype. The presence of S. pneumoniae should be considered in joint infections, especially in infants and those with a history of respiratory symptoms.

### Current variation in joint aspiration practice for the evaluation of pediatric septic arthritis [^115yZ1SM]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Septic arthritis (SA) in childhood is a rare condition, but one with the potential for serious sequelae if not identified early and appropriately treated. Because earlier diagnosis and treatment has been shown to increase the rate of satisfactory outcomes, numerous attempts have been made to standardize the evaluation of children with concern for SA. However, without universally accepted management guidelines for pediatric SA, there remains significant variability in the proposed algorithms for clinical evaluation and management of musculoskeletal infections. Differences can range from units of measure for predictive markers to joint aspiration protocols for diagnostic imaging.

Although institutional variation has been inferred from previous publications, no study has sought to objectively evaluate these variations in the evaluation of pediatric SA. Details about the areas of concordance and discordance in the assessment of pediatric SA will help guide protocol development efforts and drive future prospective studies.

The purpose of this study was to assess practice variations between pediatric tertiary care institutions during the evaluation and treatment of pediatric SA.

### Kingella kingae displaced S. aureus as the most common cause of acute septic arthritis in children of all ages [^114J356H]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute septic arthritis (SA) still remains a challenge with significant worldwide morbidity. In recent years, Kingella kingae has emerged and treatment regimens have become shorter. We aim to analyze trends in SA etiology and management and to identify risk factors for complications.

Methods

Longitudinal observational, single center study of children (< 18 years old) with SA admitted to a tertiary care pediatric hospital, from 2003 to 2018, in 2 cohorts, before and after implementation of nucleic acid amplification assays (2014). Clinical, treatment and disease progression data were obtained.

Results

A total of 247 children were identified, with an average annual incidence of 24.9/100,000, 57.9% males with a median age of 2 (1–6) years. In the last 5 years, a 1.7-fold increase in the annual incidence, a lower median age at diagnosis and an improved microbiologic yield (49%) was noticed. K. kingae became the most frequent bacteria (51.9%) followed by MSSA (19.2%) and S. pyogenes (9.6%). Children were more often treated for fewer intravenous days (10.7 vs. 13.2 days, P = 0.01) but had more complications (20.6% vs. 11.4%, P = 0.049) with a similar sequelae rate (3.7%). Risk factors for complications were C-reactive protein ≥ 80mg/L and Staphylococcus aureus infection, and for sequelae at 6 months, age ≥ 4 years and CRP ≥ 80mg/L.

Conclusions

The present study confirms that K. kingae was the most common causative organism of acute SA. There was a trend, although small, for decreasing antibiotic duration. Older children with high inflammatory parameters might be at higher risk of sequelae.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) in children — empiric antimicrobial therapy and organism targets: The panel judged that the benefit of empiric therapy active against Staphylococcus aureus outweighs harms and thus support a strong recommendation. For Kingella kingae, the available indirect evidence shows a possible but minimal clinical effect of empirically adding coverage for K. kingae, the certainty in the balance of benefits versus harms was low, and for infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children (6 to 48 months of age) only a conditional recommendation was made. Appropriate choice of empiric therapy should be guided by local antibiotic resistance patterns (CA-MRSA) and/or hospital antibiogram as well as disease severity and immunization status; due to lack of published data for alternative options, this does not permit recommendations for their routine use at this time, and the committee did not provide a recommendation for starting treatment by the oral route of administration.

It was developed by Kocher et al. and includes four parameters: non-weight bearing on the affected side, fever (> 38.5°C), an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 40 mm/hr, and a serum white blood cell (WBC) count greater than 12,000 cells/mm³. The presence of all four criteria indicates a high probability of septic arthritis. The Kocher Criteria is useful in guiding clinical decision-making and determining the need for invasive procedures such as joint aspiration or surgery. It should be noted that this scoring system is not applicable to neonates, patients with underlying immunodeficiency, or those with a known history of hip pathology.

The Kocher criteria calculator evaluates the risk of septic arthritis based on four clinical indicators. It starts by asking whether the patient has an inability to bear weight, a fever higher than 38.5 degrees Celsius (101.3 degrees Fahrenheit), an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) over 40 mm/hour, and a white blood cell count exceeding 12,000 cells/mm³. Each positive answer adds 1 point to the total score, which ranges from 0 to 4.

To compute the score, consider these factors:

- Inability to bear weight
- Fever > 38.5°C (101.3°F)
- ESR > 40 mm/hour
- White blood cell count > 12,000 cells/mm³

For each indicator that is true, assign 1 point. After summing the points from all four indicators, you get a total score that indicates the risk of septic arthritis.

Here's what the total score means:

- **Score 0**: The risk of septic arthritis is 0.2%.
- **Score 1**: The risk of septic arthritis is 3%.
- **Score 2**: The risk of septic arthritis is 40%.
- **Score 3**: The risk of septic arthritis is 93%.
- **Score 4**: The risk of septic arthritis is 99%.

This scoring system helps clinicians gauge the likelihood of septic arthritis. A score of 0 suggests an extremely low risk, while a score of 4 implies near certainty, guiding further diagnostic or treatment actions.

Regarding specific circumstances for septic arthritis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, antibiotic therapy, choice of agent, EBJIS 2023 guidelines recommend to administer empirical antibiotics covering the most common pathogen (S. aureus), first-generation cephalosporin, anti-staphylococcal penicillin, or clindamycin.

Musculoskeletal infections are a common cause of morbidity in children. A multitude of studies over the past few years have improved our knowledge and understanding of the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric osteomyelitis and septic arthritis. Staphylococcus aureus continues to be the most common pathogen; however, new and innovative organism identification techniques are improving the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and increasing the identification of other less common organisms. Improved capability for patient assessment with a combination of advanced imaging studies and timely laboratory tests allow for a more thorough understanding of the disease process and more efficient patient care.

Septic arthritis of the shoulder is rare in the pediatric population. In younger children and infants, it can be very difficult to diagnose. Septic arthritis of the shoulder is more commonly associated with concurrent osteomyelitis when compared to septic arthritis of the lower extremity. We describe a case of a 9-month-old patient with septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and pyomyositis of the shoulder, and a discussion of diagnosis and management of pediatric bone and joint infection in the emergency department setting.

### Clinical and biologic characteristics of Kingella kingae-induced septic arthritis of the knee in young children [^1131S2Wq]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Septic arthritis of the knee is one of the most frequently observed forms of K. kingae -induced joint infection. As with the other osteoarticular infections due to K. kingae, septic arthritis induced by this pathogen is reported to present with a milder clinical picture than pyogenic pathogens. The modified Kocher–Caird criteria only have a limited utility in predicting K. kingae -induced septic arthritis of the knee, but this is also the case for knee infections caused by other pathogens. However, as several previous studies have suggested, we believe the inability to bear weight is probably the strongest independent risk factor for septic arthritis of the knee, especially when K. kingae is the microorganism responsible, and we insist that to have a clear diagnosis, an arthrocentesis should be considered.

Regarding specific circumstances for septic arthritis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (antibiotic therapy, route), IDSA/PIDS 2024 guidelines recommend to switch to oral antibiotics rather than outpatient parenteral antibiotics when an appropriate, well-tolerated oral antibiotic option is available and the antibiotic is active against the confirmed or presumed pathogens in pediatric patients with presumed or confirmed acute bacterial arthritis responding to initial IV antibiotic therapy.

Key Points Septic arthritis is a surgical emergency. Septic arthritis affects children of all ages; most common in children younger than 3 years. Staphylococcus aureusis the most common cause in children. When septic arthritis is suspected an orthopedic surgeon should be consulted urgently; tapping the joint is useful for diagnosis as well as for therapy. Initial therapy should include antistaphylococcal antibiotics, which can be changed subsequently depending on culture and sensitivity results.
