## Question

A 3-month-old with recurrent bacterial infections and persistently low absolute neutrophil count is diagnosed with Kostmann disease. For billing, which ICD-10-CM code should be assigned?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be assigned for a 3-month-old diagnosed with Kostmann disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the clinical entity and its classification. Then, I should verify the most specific ICD-10-CM code for congenital neutropenia. Next, I will check whether any alternative or more granular codes exist that might fit better. Finally, I will confirm coding rules and ensure the diagnosis is documented appropriately for billing and claims processing.

> Let me first confirm the condition. Kostmann disease is congenital neutropenia, a rare inherited disorder characterized by severe neutropenia and recurrent bacterial infections due to impaired myeloid differentiation, and it is explicitly named in pediatric hematology-oncology guidance as a congenital disorder associated with myelodysplastic syndromes in children, which supports using a congenital neutropenia code rather than a generic neutropenia code [^f265e7a7] [^36c42e09].

> Now, I need to find the most specific ICD-10-CM code. Wait, let me verify the exact entry. The most specific code for congenital neutropenia is D70.0, which maps to "Congenital neutropenia, including Kostmann's disease". This is the correct, billable diagnosis code for Kostmann disease in ICD-10-CM [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — could there be a more granular or alternative code I should consider? I should double-check for any subtypes or etiologic codes. I initially wondered if there might be a genetic subtype code, but I need to ensure I don't over-specify beyond what ICD-10-CM provides; D70.0 already captures congenital neutropenia and explicitly includes Kostmann's, and I do not see a more specific ICD-10-CM code for Kostmann itself, so D70.0 remains the appropriate choice [^notfound].

> Next, I should review coding rules and documentation requirements. I need to ensure the diagnosis is clearly documented in the medical record as "Kostmann disease" or "congenital neutropenia" to support D70.0, and I should confirm that the age of 3 months does not alter code selection — congenital conditions are coded the same regardless of age at presentation, so the infant age does not change the ICD-10-CM code in this case [^notfound].

> Final answer: Assign ICD-10-CM code D70.0 for Kostmann disease in a 3-month-old with recurrent bacterial infections and severe neutropenia [^notfound].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for Kostmann disease (congenital neutropenia) is **D70.0** (Congenital neutropenia, including Kostmann's disease). This code should be used for billing and documentation when Kostmann disease is diagnosed, as it is the most specific and accurate ICD-10-CM entry for this condition [^notfound].

---

## Clinical features of Kostmann disease

Kostmann disease is characterized by:

- **Severe congenital neutropenia**: Persistent absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500/µL, typically < 200/µL [^36c42e09].
- **Recurrent bacterial infections**: Frequent and severe infections, including pneumonia, otitis media, skin infections, and sepsis [^36c42e09].
- **Bone marrow findings**: Maturation arrest at the promyelocyte-myelocyte stage, with absent or markedly reduced mature neutrophils [^notfound].
- **Genetic mutations**: Commonly HAX1, ELANE, or GFI1 mutations, inherited in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant pattern [^notfound].

---

## ICD-10-CM coding for Kostmann disease

The ICD-10-CM code for Kostmann disease is **D70.0**, defined as "Congenital neutropenia, including Kostmann's disease". This code specifically encompasses Kostmann disease and other congenital neutropenias, ensuring accurate documentation and billing [^notfound].

---

## Coding guidelines and documentation requirements

When coding for Kostmann disease, the following guidelines and documentation requirements should be adhered to:

- **Accurate diagnosis**: The diagnosis of Kostmann disease must be clearly documented by the treating physician, including clinical findings, laboratory results, and genetic testing if available.
- **Specificity**: Use the most specific ICD-10-CM code available. In this case, D70.0 is the most specific code for Kostmann disease.
- **Supporting documentation**: Include documentation of recurrent infections, persistent neutropenia, and any genetic testing results to support the diagnosis and justify medical necessity.

---

## Clinical implications of accurate coding

Accurate coding of Kostmann disease has several important clinical and administrative implications:

- **Reimbursement**: Ensures appropriate reimbursement for medical services, including specialized treatments such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
- **Patient care**: Facilitates coordination of care among healthcare providers, including specialists in hematology, immunology, and infectious diseases.
- **Epidemiological tracking**: Enables accurate tracking of disease prevalence and incidence for public health purposes and research studies.

---

## Potential coding pitfalls and how to avoid them

Common coding pitfalls associated with Kostmann disease include:

- **Using nonspecific codes**: Avoid using nonspecific codes such as D70.9 (Neutropenia, unspecified) when a more specific code (D70.0) is available.
- **Incomplete documentation**: Ensure comprehensive documentation of clinical findings, laboratory results, and genetic testing to support the diagnosis.
- **Lack of awareness**: Stay informed about updates and changes in ICD-10-CM coding guidelines and codes related to congenital neutropenia.

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for Kostmann disease is **D70.0** (Congenital neutropenia, including Kostmann's disease). Accurate coding and documentation are essential for appropriate reimbursement, coordination of care, and epidemiological tracking. Healthcare providers should ensure comprehensive documentation and stay informed about coding guidelines to avoid common pitfalls.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

In recent months, organized medicine has been consumed by the anticipated transition to the 10th iteration of the International Classification of Disease system. Implementation has come and gone without the disruptive effects predicted by many. Despite the fundamental role the International Classification of Disease system plays in health care delivery and payment policy, few neuroradiologists are familiar with the history of its implementation and implications beyond coding for diseases.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^3fb71031]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^d719b817]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study suggest that the transition to ICD-10-CM in October 2015 was associated with changes in levels and trends for most diagnostic categories in 3 common diagnostic classification systems. While the broad categories used in WHO disease chapters showed only small changes at the transition, numerous large changes (ie, ≥ 20%) in diagnostic category prevalence occurred in the more detailed HHS-HCCs and AHRQ-CCS categories. These 2 classification systems have been widely adopted by health care organizations for many purposes. Given the frequent, large discontinuities in diagnostic category prevalence rates that we identified, predictive models and diagnostic category mappings developed for ICD-9-CM should be refined for ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for health care payment, performance assessment, or disease surveillance.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Development and assessment of a new framework for disease surveillance, prediction, and risk adjustment: the diagnostic items classification system [^51dc9da0]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

This diagnostic modeling study describes and tests a new classification system that maps ICD-10-CM codes into a rich set of diagnostic items (referred to as DXIs), far more fully exploiting ICD-10-CM 's expanded diagnostic detail than widely used existing models. The DXI system predicts key spending and utilization outcomes more accurately than the existing models, potentially enabling improved plan payment, health services research, cost-effectiveness studies, quality reporting, and disease surveillance.

### Vision rehabilitation preferred practice pattern ® [^df3dce24]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

ICD-10 CM (International Classification of Diseases [ICD] Clinical Modification) visual field defect codes include a directive to "Code any associated underlying cause of the blindness first". For Scotoma involving central area, codes are H53.411 (right eye), H53.412 (left eye), H53.413 (bilateral), and H53.419 (unspecified eye). Homonymous bilateral field defects are coded as H53.461 (right eye), H53.462 (left eye), and H53.469 (unspecified side). Heteronymous bilateral field defects use H53.47. Generalized contraction of visual field is coded H53.481 (right eye), H53.482 (left eye), H53.483 (bilateral), and H53.489 (unspecified eye).

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^cd55411e]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^6ece3d7b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Rapid access to well-characterized, large SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 cohorts is critical for scientific discovery. ICD-10 codes are a standard terminology and are attractive for data aggregation because they are uniformly used among health care systems. However, these codes perform poorly in capturing COVID-19–related symptoms. Our findings highlight the critical need for meticulous data validation to feed multicenter registries built from EMRs. Reliable, accurate data are the foundation of scientific discovery; the right data lead to the right solutions.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^cd799048]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye ICD-10 CM classifications — entities and codes include: Dry eye, unspecified, right lacrimal gland H04.121; left lacrimal gland H04.122; bilateral lacrimal gland H04.123; keratoconjunctivitis sicca (not specified as Sjögren) H16.22-; Sjögren syndrome, sicca syndrome M35.00; Sjögren syndrome with keratoconjunctivitis M35.01; filamentary keratitis H16.12-; exposure keratoconjunctivitis H16.21-; punctate keratitis H11.14-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, and the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct; the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder x must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Use of ICD-10-CM coded hospitalisation and emergency department data for injury surveillance [^ee350889]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Injury surveillance, the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of injury data, provides critical information to support public health efforts to reduce injury-related morbidity, mortality and disability. For the past several decades, state and local health departments and national agencies in the USA have relied on the use of hospital discharge and emergency department (ED) data coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to conduct injury surveillance. Surveillance case definitions and analyses have been based on ICD-9-CM codes. However, a US mandate to code using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)has resulted in a need to update injury surveillance case definitions and analysis guidance based on ICD-10-CM.

Beginning in October 2015, the US Department of Health and Human Services required all hospitals and healthcare providers covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act to use the ICD-10-CM to report electronic healthcare transactions. The coding structure of ICD-10-CM is based on ICD-10 mortality coding and classification published by the WHO, however, the classification scheme has been greatly expanded to capture the diagnostic detail needed for medical diagnoses. ICD-10-CM contains nearly five times the number of codes found in ICD-9-CM (approximately 72 000 codes in ICD-10-CM compared with 15 000 codes in ICD-9-CM). Because ICD-10-CM captures greater detail than either ICD-9-CM or ICD-10, this classification system has the potential to provide enhanced understanding of the types and causes of non-fatal injury.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^7fc5a2da]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

From 1979 through September 2015, the Clinical Modification of the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) was used in the USA to code morbidity data. On 1 October 2015, the Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of ICD (ICD-10-CM), developed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, was implemented in the USA for classification and coding of morbidity data. ICD-10-CM codes provide much more detail about diseases, injuries, and external causes of injuries than ICD-9-CM codes, making this classification system more useful for measuring quality of care, public health surveillance and epidemiological research.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD)injury matrices are nationally and internationally recognised tools or frameworks for organising and reporting ICD-coded injury data. These tools have multiple versions based on different clinical modifications of the ICD, and can categorise both external cause codes, which describe the mechanism and intent of injury, and diagnosis codes, which describe the body region and type of injury. The ICD-9-CM external cause of injury matrix (hereafter referred to as matrix) was used extensively to generate county, state, regional, national and international comparisons of non-fatal injury data. The ICD-10-CM matrix should prove to be similarly useful over the next decade.

Data from Sweden suggest that the conversion to ICD-10 may have been associated with important discontinuities in observed rates at the mechanism/cause level. To interpret injury morbidity data across the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM in the USA, it would be helpful to understand any differences in how the same records would be classified using the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM matrices. We were able to obtain such dually coded data from two large academic trauma centres and apply both matrices to estimate comparability ratios (CRs) and identify potential reasons for discrepant classification of mechanism/cause.

### Survival strategies for tsunami of ICD-10-CM for interventionalists: pursue or perish! [^f1ee71f0]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The unfunded mandate for the implementation of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) is scheduled October 1, 2015. The development of ICD-10-CM has been a complicated process. We have endeavored to keep Interventional Pain Management doctors apprised via a variety of related topical manuscripts. The major issues relate to the lack of formal physician participation in its preparation. While the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) and American Hospital Association (AHA) as active partners in its preparation. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are major players; 3M and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association are also involved. The cost of ICD-10-CM implementation is high, similar to the implementation of electronic health records (EHRs), likely consuming substantial resources. While ICD-10, utilized worldwide, includes 14,400 different codes, ICD-10-CM, specific for the United States, has expanded to 144,000 codes, which also includes procedural coding system. It is imperative for physicians to prepare for the mandatory implementation. Conversion from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM coding in interventional pain management is not a conversion of one to one that can be easily obtained from software packages. It is a both a difficult and time-consuming task with each physician, early on, expected to spend on estimation at least 10 minutes per visit on extra coding for established and new patients. For interventional pain physicians, there have been a multitude of changes, including creation of new codes and confusing conversion of existing codes. This manuscript describes a variety of codes that are relevant to interventional pain physicians and often utilized in daily practices. It is our objective that this manuscript will provide coding assistance to interventional pain physicians.

### ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM mapping of the AAST emergency general surgery disease severity grading systems: conceptual approach, limitations, and recommendations for the future [^57d673b3]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) recently established a grading system for uniform reporting of anatomic severity of several emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases. There are five grades of severity for each disease, ranging from I (lowest severity) to V (highest severity). However, the grading process requires manual chart review. We sought to evaluate whether International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM) codes might allow estimation of AAST grades for EGS diseases. The Patient Assessment and Outcomes Committee of the AAST reviewed all available ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes relevant to 16 EGS diseases with available AAST grades. We then matched grades for each EGS disease with one or more ICD codes. We used the Official Coding Guidelines for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and the American Hospital Association's "Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM" for coding guidance. The ICD codes did not allow for matching all five AAST grades of severity for each of the 16 diseases. With ICD-9-CM, six diseases mapped into four categories of severity (instead of five), another six diseases into three categories of severity, and four diseases into only two categories of severity. With ICD-10-CM, five diseases mapped into four categories of severity, seven diseases into three categories, and four diseases into two categories. Two diseases mapped into discontinuous categories of grades (two in ICD-9-CM and one in ICD-10-CM). Although resolution is limited, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes might have some utility in roughly approximating the severity of the AAST grades in the absence of more precise information. These ICD mappings should be validated and refined before widespread use to characterize EGS disease severity. In the long-term, it may be desirable to develop alternatives to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for routine collection of disease severity characteristics.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^5e1c6ada]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Interrupted time series analysis of cannabis coding in Colorado during the ICD-10-CM transition [^1095ee2f]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Observed level and slope changes could be due to increased number or specificity of cannabis codes in ICD-10-CM, structural coding differences, coder learning curves or actual changes in substance use patterns and health events over time. When examining cannabis trends crossing the transition, we recommend visually addressing the change in coding schema and using caution with interpretations.

What is already known on the subject

Cannabis ICD codes have been used to measure public health impacts of cannabis legalisation.
The ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, 10 th Revision, Clinical Modification) transition expanded and improved specificity of cannabis codes.

### Large-scale long-tailed disease diagnosis on radiology images [^03fe217f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Afterwards, we map disorders to ICD-10-CM codes. Upon getting disorder classes, they may fall into varying hierarchical granularity levels, here, we hope to map them to internationally recognized standards. For this purpose, we utilize the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes, which is a customized version of the ICD-10 used for coding diagnoses in the U.S. healthcare system. The ICD was originally designed as a healthcare classification system, providing a system of diagnostic codes for classifying diseases, including nuanced classifications of a wide variety of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or disease. Specifically, we hire ten medical Ph.D. students to manually map the article titles into ICD-10-CM codes. After cross-checking by a ten-year clinician, we have mapped the 5,568 disorders into the corresponding ICD-10-CM codes. We unify various disorders into the first hierarchical level of ICD-10-CM code tree, resulting in 930 ICD-10-CM classes. For example, both "J12.0 Adenoviral pneumonia" and "J12 Viral pneumonia" are mapped to the code "J12 Viral pneumonia, not elsewhere classified", dismissing the ambiguities caused by diagnosis granularity. Note that, we will provide the ICD-10-CM codes along with the original 5,568 classes, each accompanied by its corresponding definition, thus, the dataset can be employed for training diagnosis or visual-language models.

At last, we supplement some normal cases. Despite there exist normal cases on, covering most anatomies and modalities, we additionally collect more normal cases from additional external datasets, including Brain-Tumor-17, CheXpert, Vertebrase-Xray, KneeMRI, and VinDr-Mammo, and, with images available for research under a CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, i.e. simply adding the normal case part introduced in them. The expanded normal cases include 2503 cases.

In total, we get 40,936 cases containing 195,010 images labeled by 5568 disorder classes and 930 ICD-10-CM classes and will continually maintain the dataset, growing the case number.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^3a864023]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis — ICD-10 CM classifications and laterality rules include the following: Entities coded under bacterial keratitis include corneal ulcer, unspecified (H16.00-), marginal corneal ulcer (H16.04-), ring corneal ulcer (H16.02-), central corneal ulcer (H16.01-), hypopyon ulcer (H16.03-), perforated corneal ulcer (H16.07-), unspecified corneal edema (H18.20), contact lens keratitis (H18.82-), and bacterial keratitis (H16.8). Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; "The applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct", "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field", and "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned", and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available".

Corneal opacification — ICD-10 CM classifications list minor corneal opacity H17.81-, peripheral corneal opacity H17.82-, central corneal opacity H17.1-, and phthisical cornea A18.59, H44.52-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^8b6d266d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Retinal vein occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^f45120fb]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal vein occlusion ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM codes — International Classification of Diseases (ICD) classifications include: central retinal vein occlusion — ICD-9 CM 362.35; ICD-10 CM H34.811-, H34.812-, H34.813-; venous tributary (branch) occlusion — ICD-9 CM 362.36; ICD-10 CM H34.831-, H34.832-, H34.833-; venous engorgement — ICD-9 CM 362.37; ICD-10 CM H34.821-, H34.822-, H34.823-. For ICD-10 CM laterality, the guidance states: "For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1 Left is always 2 Bilateral is always 3".

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^5ad88265]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we only examined the association of diagnostic category prevalence with the ICD-10-CM transition for individuals younger than 65 years who were privately insured by employer-sponsored insurance, a population mostly enrolled in relatively generous health plans. Coding patterns and discontinuities in frequencies of diagnostic categories may not generalize to individuals covered by other insurers (eg, the ACA marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid). Many health care practitioners have been encouraged by their institutions to maximize the capture of patient complexity in their billing. However, our study data came from commercial plans whose payments are rarely risk adjusted for disease prevalence. Specifically, their payments do not generally rely on HHS-HCCs, reducing the explicit incentive to increase the prevalence of well-reimbursed HHS-HCC categories. Second, we did not examine changes at the ICD-10-CM transition on coding for particular conditions for specific patients or in category prevalence based on other sources of diagnoses, such as electronic medical records. Third, we used a piecewise linear model to look for changes in level and trend, but for some categories in which diagnostic category prevalence trends are not linear, our model may find changes at the transition when a nonlinear model would not.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks, and lattice degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^ab59a3b4]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes — precursors to rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and related entities are mapped between ICD-9 CM and ICD-10 CM, including break, unspecified (361.00; H33.00-), break, giant (361.03; H33.03-), vitreous detachment/degeneration (379.21; H43.81-), and retinal break without detachment types such as retinal break, unspecified (361.30; H33.30-), horseshoe tear (361.32; H33.31-), and round hole (361.31; H33.32-), as well as retinal dialysis (361.04; H33.04-) and lattice degeneration of the retina (362.63; H35.41-). Additional information for ICD-10 CM states that certain categories have applicable 7th characters and that "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used", and that for bilateral sites "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; the table specifies " = 1, right eye; 2, left eye; 3, bilateral", and that "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old… [^19408254]. publications.aap.org (2021). Medium credibility.

For each key action statement, the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationship were assessed and graded to determine the strength of recommendations. When appropriate, parents' values and preferences should be incorporated as part of shared decision-making. For diagnostic testing, the committee has attempted to develop numbers needed to test, and for antimicrobial administration, the committee provided numbers needed to treat. 3 or > 15 000 per mm³ was not methodologically derived but established in advance as an indicator and tested in combination with other predictor variables. Recommendations emerged that generally relied on clinical appearance, age, urinalysis, WBC, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. 10 All had somewhat similar sensitivities and specificities as well as predictive values.

The models were promulgated because of moderately high sensitivities and high negative predictive values. The high NPVs were expected because of the uncommon occurrence of the most serious infections, which, along with modest specificities, also explained the relatively low positive predictive values.

1. Changing Bacteriology Since the 1980s, the epidemiology of bacterial infections in neonates and infants has changed as a result of many factors, including prenatal GBS screening and incorporation of immunization against. Streptococcus pneumoniae. Furthermore, improvements in food safety may have resulted in a decrease in the incidence of disease caused by Listeria monocytogenes in this age group. Recent studies demonstrate that Escherichia coli is now the most common organism to cause bacteremia; it is the leading or second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in infants 1 to 60 days of age.

25, 27–33 Infections with L monocytogenes are now rare in the United States. 32, 33 The shift from Gram-positive to Gram-negative predominance has implications for the choice of tests, interpretation of values for decision-making, and the selection of antimicrobial drugs. Using the decision models of the 1980s today can lead to misclassification of bacterial meningitis in 23. 3% to
32. 1% of cases.
34. Costs are justified on the basis of the magnitude of the benefit and/or reduction of potential harms. In studies of prediction models, instances of missed invasive bacterial infections in well-appearing low-risk infants are rare. For infants not managed according to existing clinical prediction models, there are also rare misses reported in the literature. These factors suggested there is an opportunity to "safely do less. " 36.
3.

Advances in Testing Inflammatory Markers The WBC, ANC, and band count, combined with clinical appearance and urinalysis, have been the foundation of earlier clinical prediction models. With. E coli replacing GBS as the most common bacterial pathogen in this age group, these markers are no longer as useful. C-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker produced by the liver in response to infections and numerous other conditions, is now available for point-of-care testing. 37 Procalcitonin, expressed mainly by thyroid C cells, is produced rapidly in response to infection and other tissue injuries. It is more specific for bacterial infections than other IMs and rises more quickly to abnormal values. Procalcitonin has emerged as the most accurate IM for risk stratification available, although not currently available at many sites in the United States with timely results on a 24/7 basis. 38, 39.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^db3b6dae]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Our findings have important implications for interpreting differences in billing-code-derived disease prevalence over time. For epidemiology, it is critical to distinguish between changes in actual disease prevalence and changes in coding behaviors and mappings, which are often responsible for observed changes in coded prevalence. We have seen that 3 separate, widely used classification systems made different distinctions that affected apparent diagnostic category prevalence. Given that HHS payment formulas rely on the prevalence of HCC categories to set billions of dollars in payments, our finding of many large (artifactual) changes in diagnostic category prevalence has potentially large implications for reimbursement.

Although HHS-HCCs are used for the ACA's marketplace risk adjustment payments, this study did not examine financial outcomes. Because the ACA uses risk adjustment to reallocate the available funds among plans in a given region rather than to decide on the size of the funds available (as is done in Medicare Advantage and Part D), changes in diagnostic category prevalence may have had less financial effect in the marketplace than in Medicare Advantage. Classifications used for bonus or performance evaluation are also vulnerable to large changes in level or trend when preexisting ICD-9-CM –derived formulas are used across the ICD-10-CM transition. In addition, claims-based analyses of disease prevalence may also be misleading if changes in the underlying classification system are not recognized.

Our study used the earliest mappings accommodating all valid 2017 diagnoses for the included classification systems. In 2019, the WHO, HHS, and AHRQ released new classification systems with expanded diagnostic categories designed for 2019 diagnoses. Future research will need to examine changes under these new systems. In the meantime, it is important to understand the current mappings that will continue to be used to set payments and evaluate performance for several more years.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^2f8e03a3]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 3
Injury case selection disagreements between the Clinical Modification of the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) coded principal diagnosis and the Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of the ICD (ICD-10-CM) coded principal diagnosis on the same dually coded records

Among the selected injury records (table 2), the ICD-9-CM External Cause of Injury Morbidity Matrix SAS program identified 657 records in the MCA dataset and 532 records in the MCB dataset with at least one valid external cause code. By comparison, the ICD-10-CM matrix SAS program identified 632 records in the MCA dataset and 526 records in the MCB dataset with at least one valid external cause code. Overall, the completeness of external cause of injury coding was significantly higher in ICD-9-CM subsets than in ICD-10-CM subsets: 100% versus 95% at MCA and 99% versus 97% at MCB, respectively (both p < 0.01 by Fisher's exact test).

For subsequent analyses, all records without valid external cause of injury codes in both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM subsets were excluded, leaving 632 cases from the MCA dataset and 520 cases from the MCB dataset.

External cause of injury matrices

In the two analysed datasets (tables 4 and 5), 86% and 90% of cases were coded as unintentional injuries and fewer than 1% were coded as undetermined injuries; at least 50% of cases in both datasets were classified as either falls or motor vehicle traffic (MVT) related. The proportion of cases with assault in the final MCA dataset (9%) was about twice that in the final MCB dataset (5%).

### Updating and validating the rheumatic disease comorbidity index to incorporate ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes [^b80625ec]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we aimed to translate the ICD-9-CM codes defined for the RDCI to ICD-10-CM and validate its predictive ability for the key long-term rheumatic disease outcomes of mortality and functional status. We created a set of ICD-10-CM codes that generated comparable RDCI scores and individual comorbidity prevalence estimates to those derived from ICD-9-CM codes within a large, multicenter RA registry, then tested the predictive ability of the RDCI score using the ICD-10-CM code set. We found the ICD-10-CM code set was able to predict mortality and functional status as well as the ICD-9-CM codes. With the updated codes (Table 1), the RDCI can continue to be used in rheumatic disease outcomes research utilizing ICD-10-CM era data.

After assembling an ICD-10-CM code set using a cross walk and clinical expertise, we calculated RDCI scores for RA cohorts spanning ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM time periods. RDCI scores were comparable between cohorts (mean scores of 2.93 vs. 2.92) and, among individuals observed during both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM eras, RDCI scores had substantial agreement (K = 0.71). Similarly, when we assessed the prevalence of individual comorbidities between coding systems, the absolute differences were quite small (all < 6%). While evaluating individuals in both cohorts, we discovered that agreement between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM varied across individual conditions. Individual conditions with greater chronicity had stronger agreement than acute conditions. For example, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, other cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and depression (chronic conditions) all had at least substantial agreement (K > 0.60). In contrast, ulcer or GI problem and fracture of the spine, hip, or leg (acute conditions) had fair and slight agreement (K = 0.27, K = 0.13). We postulate the superior agreement for the more chronic conditions is primarily the result of these conditions being continually addressed and recorded during clinical encounters. However, it is also possible that medical care for acute conditions may have occurred solely outside the VA system. Finally, the variability in agreement may be related to differences in the prevalence of these conditions, with those having the lowest prevalence also having poorer agreement.

Diagnoses

Between the baseline and post-acute phases, the frequency of individual ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes increased within several chapters (Fig. 2). The greatest percentage increase was observed in the ICD-10 chapter of "diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving the immune mechanism" (+ 16.3%), followed by "diseases of the nervous system" (+ 11.1%), "external causes of morbidity and mortality" (+ 7.9%), and "mental and behavioral disorders" (+ 7.7%).

Fig. 2
Percentage change from baseline to post-acute phase in ICD-10 diagnoses in the overall population (N = 19,558). Diagnosis codes (shown in parentheses) include those with a prevalence of ≥ 2% in the baseline population and with an increase from baseline to post-acute phases. Code ranges, raw values at baseline and post-acute phases, and diagnoses decreasing from baseline to post-acute phases are shown in Table 3. ICD-10, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision

Frequencies of other disorders increased more modestly or decreased (Table 3); the greatest percentage decrease was observed in the chapter of "diseases of the respiratory system" (–18.3%). Within this chapter, the decrease was driven specifically by a drop in frequency of the subchapters acute upper and lower respiratory infections (–56.6% and –69.3%, respectively), which outweighed increases in frequency of other respiratory conditions, such as "other respiratory diseases principally affecting the interstitium" (+ 59.8%; Table S 2 and Fig. S 1).

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^a36ea6dd]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Case selection

A total of 4832 records from MCA and 5211 records from MCB were included in the study and analysed in a parallel manner (table 2). On average, the ICD-9-CM subsets had more codes per record than the ICD-10-CM subsets: 8.9 versus 8.4 and 12.5 versus 12.3 in the MCA and MCB datasets, respectively. In the MCA dataset, 657 and 659 dually coded records had a principal diagnosis from the list of nature-of-injury codes shown in table 1, using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, respectively. In the MCB dataset, the corresponding numbers were 537 and 544 records, respectively.

Table 2
Sample selection and characteristics of the Clinical Modification of the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM)/Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of ICD (ICD-10-CM) dually coded datasets

In the MCA dataset, five records had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas seven records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). In the MCB dataset, one record had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas eight records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). Specifically, the ICD-10-CM case definition for injury has been slightly expanded by the NCHS, such that initial encounters for periprosthetic fractures around internal prosthetic joints (T84.04 before 10/01/2016; M97 thereafter) and encounters for injuries and abuse complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (O9A.2-O9A.5) are now included. These expansions accounted for 9 of the additional 15 records that were selected as injuries based only on ICD-10-CM diagnoses, whereas the exclusion of subsequent encounters from the ICD-10-CM case definition accounted for five of the six records selected based only on ICD-9-CM diagnoses.

### Interrupted time series analysis to evaluate the performance of drug overdose morbidity indicators shows discontinuities across the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM transition [^cbc33640]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM appears to have introduced major systematic differences in measurement of drug overdoses such that data from the two coding systems should not be interpreted as continuous. However, understanding that trend data are paramount amid the current drug overdose epidemic, the results of this study can be used to guide methodology for overdose surveillance and research employing ICD-coded ED visit or hospitalisation data. Graphs presenting longitudinal data across October 2015 should clearly indicate the ICD-10-CM transition with a vertical line and label. Statistical models of overdose trends that incorporate data from both coding schemes should include terms to control for the ICD-10-CM transition. Summary statistics for the year 2015 should not combine data from both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM. Instead, consider reporting statistics for fiscal year 2015 (October 2014–September 2015) or the first three quarters of calendar year 2015 only (January 2015–September 2015). Lastly, it is important to consider the structural comparability of indicator definitions used to capture cases under each coding system, both in terms of which codes are included and which fields are searched.

What is already known on the subject

Epidemiologists rely on International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-coded administrative claims data to monitor drug overdose morbidity, a major public health problem.
Drug overdose coding went through substantial revision in the transition from International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM).
Studies have begun to evaluate the impact of the transition on surveillance of health outcomes.

What this study adds

This study uses interrupted time series methodology to analyse the performance of all-drug and opioid overdose indicators across the ICD transition in both ED and inpatient datasets.
No other study has evaluated how adjusting the number of diagnostic fields searched in ICD-9-CM indicator definitions impacts trend comparability across the transition.

### Emergency department coding of bicycle and pedestrian injuries during the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 [^c0c5cfeb]. Injury Prevention (2012). Low credibility.

ICD-9 diagnosis codes consist of the following: 3-digit numeric characters (001–999), with two decimals representing illnesses and conditions; alphanumeric E-codes (E000–E999), describing external causes of injuries, poisonings, and adverse effects; and V codes (V01–V82), describing factors influencing health status and contact with health services. ICD-10 uses 3-digit alphanumeric codes (A00–Z99) with two decimals. There are many other changes in ICD-10 that have been described in detail elsewhere. Canada implemented ICD-10 for the classification of cause of death, beginning in 2000. In an agreement with WHO, Canada adopted an enhanced version of ICD-10-CA by keeping the main structure of ICD-10, yet including more subgroup definitions using a third decimal and introducing the first Canadian classification of intervention.

E-codes have been widely used in surveillance system for mortality in traffic-related injuriesand morbidity of bicyclists, pedestrians, and those with sport and recreational related injuries; however, coding issues might have led to errors in the interpretation of research findings. Appropriate coding by ICD-9 and ICD-10 has always been an important issue for health surveillance and health services research. Many studies have evaluated the validity and/or reliability of ICD-9 coding for external causes of injuries (from now on called E-coding for both ICD-9 and ICD-10), or focused on principal diagnosis. Other studies evaluated the validity/reliability of ICD-10 for E-codingor only principal diagnosis in ICD-10.

For those countries that implemented ICD-10, the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 may have had an impact on the trends of causes of injuries. Bridge coding studies, to date, have evaluated the impact of a coding change by focusing on principal causes of mortality and not external cause of injury. One study examined the usefulness of ICD-10-CM in capturing public health diseases (reportable diseases, leading cause of death and morbidity/mortality related to terrorism) and reported agreement levels of coders when coding such diseases in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM. They found that ICD-10-CM was more specific and fully captured more diseases than ICD-9-CM; however, coders were more consistent in coding ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM.

### Interrupted time series analysis of cannabis coding in Colorado during the ICD-10-CM transition [^1aa0b7d6]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Trends in cannabis and psychodysleptic codes across the transition to ICD-10-CM may be actual trends or may result from systematic biasses introduced by the change in coding systems. This analysis did not assess the sensitivity or specificity of cannabis ICD-10-CM codes and therefore cannot quantify effects due to the change in coding system verses actual trends in discharges involving cannabis. However, level changes observed at the time of the transition to ICD-10-CM are difficult to explain by other external factors. As ICD-10-CM continues to be used, it is possible changes in coding patterns over time could be from implementation and training on the new coding system. The ICD-10-CM system is complex and coding to include the new information like cannabis intoxication or mental health symptoms may take longer to adopt. Examining these more specific codes individually over time may be biassed by coder learning curves. Despite these limitations, the expansion and increased specificity of cannabis codes in ICD-10-CM will strengthen the ability to conduct surveillance of cannabis-related adverse health events. Over time, it is expected that coding practice will stabilise, and true trends will become apparent. However, trends observed in the early years of the ICD-10-CM coding system should be interpreted with caution.

### International classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification for the pulmonary, critical care, and sleep physician [^d06e16db]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

After a patient encounter, the physician uses two coding systems to bill for the service rendered to the patient. The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code is used to describe the encounter or procedure. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code is used to describe the diagnosis(es) of the patient. On October 1, 2015, ICD-9-CM coding will end, and all physicians will be required to use a new diagnostic coding system, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). This article describes the new diagnostic coding system and how it differs from the old system. There are resources and costs involved for physicians and physician practices to prepare properly for ICD-10-CM. Similar to other important events, the more thorough the preparation, the more likely a positive outcome will occur. Resource use is very important in preparation for the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Greater familiarity with ICD-10-CM plus a thorough, effective preparation will lead to reduced costs and a smooth transition. Coding descriptor changes and additional codes occur in ICD-10-CM for chronic bronchitis and emphysema, asthma, and respiratory failure. These changes will affect the coding of these diseases and disorders by physicians. Because the number of codes will increase more than fivefold, the complexity of documentation to support ICD-10-CM will increase substantially. The documentation in the patient's chart to support the ICD-10-CM codes used will need to be enhanced. The requirement for accurate and comprehensive documentation cannot be emphasized enough. All of the coding and documentation changes will be a challenge to pulmonary, critical care, and sleep physicians. They must be prepared fully when ICD-10-CM coding begins and ICD-9-CM coding stops abruptly on October 1, 2015.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^0e8b5ae9]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

External cause of injury matrices is used to classify mechanisms/causes of injuries for surveillance and research. Little is known about the performance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's new external cause of injury matrix for Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-CM), compared with the ICD-9-CM version.

Methods

Dually coded (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) administrative data were obtained from two major academic trauma centres. Injury-related cases were identified and categorised by mechanism/cause and manner/intent. Comparability ratios (CR) were used to estimate the net impact of changing from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM on the number of cases classified to each mechanism/cause category. Chamberlain's percent positive agreements (PPA) were calculated and McNemar's test was used to assess the significance of observed classification differences.

Results

Of 4832 and 5211 dual-coded records from the two centres, 632 and 520 with injury-related principal diagnoses and external cause codes in both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM were identified. CRs for the mechanisms/causes with at least 20 records ranged from 0.85 to 1.9 at one centre and from 0.97 to 1.07 at the other. Among these mechanisms/causes, PPAs ranged from 33% for 'other transport' to 94% for poisoning at one centre, and from 75% for 'other transport' to 100% for fires/burns at the other centre. Case assignment differed significantly for falls, motor vehicle traffic, other transport, and 'struck by/against' injuries at one centre, and for 'other pedal cyclist' at the other centre.

Conclusion

Switching to ICD-10-CM and the new external cause of injury matrix may affect injury surveillance and research, especially for certain mechanisms/causes.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma suspect preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^c5bd4139]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

ICD-10-CM laterality and 7th-character rules — Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and a placeholder X is required if a code needing a 7th character is not 6 characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the code indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When laterality is specified in the diagnosis code, Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Simulation of ICD-9 to ICD-10-CM transition for family medicine: simple or convoluted? [^3f7280a1]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the transition from International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to Interactional Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), on family medicine and to identify areas where additional training might be required.

Methods

Family medicine ICD-9-CM codes were obtained from an Illinois Medicaid data set (113,000 patient visits and $5.5 million in claims). Using the science of networks, we evaluated each ICD-9-CM code used by family medicine physicians to determine whether the transition was simple or convoluted. A simple transition is defined as 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to 1 ICD-10-CM code, or 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to multiple ICD-10-CM codes. A convoluted transition is where the transitions between coding systems is nonreciprocal and complex, with multiple codes for which definitions become intertwined. Three family medicine physicians evaluated the most frequently encountered complex mappings for clinical accuracy.

Results

Of the 1635 diagnosis codes used by family medicine physicians, 70% of the codes were categorized as simple, 27% of codes were convoluted, and 3% had no mapping. For the visits, 75%, 24%, and 1% corresponded with simple, convoluted, and no mapping, respectively. Payment for submitted claims was similarly aligned. Of the frequently encountered convoluted codes, 3 diagnosis codes were clinically incorrect, but they represent only < 0.1% of the overall diagnosis codes.

Conclusions

The transition to ICD-10-CM is simple for 70% or more of diagnosis codes, visits, and reimbursement for a family medicine physician. However, some frequently used codes for disease management are convoluted and incorrect, and for which additional resources need to be invested to ensure a successful transition to ICD-10-CM.

### Updating and validating the rheumatic disease comorbidity index to incorporate ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes [^7e2b2302]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update and validate the Rheumatic Disease Comorbidity Index (RDCI) utilizing International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes.

Methods

We defined ICD-9-CM (n = 1,068) and ICD-10-CM (n = 1,425) era cohorts (n = 862 in both) spanning the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM transition in a multicenter, prospective rheumatoid arthritis registry. Information regarding comorbidities was collected from linked administrative data over 2-year assessment periods. An ICD-10-CM code list was generated from crosswalks and clinical expertise. ICD-9- and ICD-10-derived RDCI scores were compared using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). The predictive ability of the RDCI for functional status and death during follow-up was assessed using multivariable regression models and goodness-of-fit statistics (Akaike's information criterion [AIC] and quasi information criterion [QIC]) in both cohorts.

Results

Mean ± SD RDCI scores were 2.93 ± 1.72 in the ICD-9-CM cohort and 2.92 ± 1.74 in the ICD-10-CM cohort. RDCI scores had substantial agreement in individuals who were in both cohorts (ICC 0.71 [95% confidence interval 0.68–0.74]). Prevalence of comorbidities was similar between cohorts with absolute differences < 6%. Higher RDCI scores were associated with a greater risk of death and poorer functional status during follow-up in both cohorts. Similarly, in both cohorts, models including the RDCI score had the lowest QIC (functional status) and AIC (death) values, indicating better model performance.

Conclusion

The newly proposed ICD-10-CM codes for the RDCI-generated comparable RDCI scores to those derived from ICD-9-CM codes and are highly predictive of functional status and death. The proposed ICD-10-CM codes for the RDCI can be used in rheumatic disease outcomes research spanning the ICD-10-CM era.

### Defining indicators for drug overdose emergency department visits and hospitalisations in ICD-10-CM coded discharge data [^6d35411e]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Challenges to identifying ED visits and hospital inpatient admissions using ICD-10-CM

Multiple challenges, however, impede the standard use of ICD-10-CM codes for drug overdose surveillance. A primary challenge is translating ED and inpatient drug overdose (referred to as 'poisoning' in the ICD-10-CM) definitions from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to ICD-10-CM. On 1 October 2015, the US Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) mandated that all healthcare providers covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act transition from ICD-9-CM coding to ICD-10-CM coding. The ICD-10-CM coding system is substantially different from the ICD-9-CM coding system (See figure 1 for a breakdown of an ICD-10-CM drug poisoning code). For instance, the number of injury diagnosis codes increased from 2600 to 43 000 in the ICD-9-CM compared with the ICD-10-CM, while the number of external cause of injury codes increased from 1300 to 7500. Thus, translation of ICD-9-CM drug overdose definitions to ICD-10-CM requires extensive conceptual work informed by empirical validation.

For code construction, "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field. If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes indicates laterality", and when laterality is specified "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

Figure 1
The anatomy of an ICD-10-CM drug poisoning diagnosis code. ICD-10-CM, International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification.

Several key changes in the diagnosis codes from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM guidance had to be considered when defining and tracking drug overdose indicators. These include the following:

External cause of injury codes for drug poisoning were combined with diagnostic codes in ICD-10-CM: under ICD-9-CM, poisoning surveillance indicators relied on both poisoning diagnosis codes, which described the substances involved, and poisoning external cause codes, which conveyed the intent (eg, suicide or unintentional). Under ICD-10-CM, the poisoning diagnosis codes or T-codes (T36-T50) include information on both the substances involved and intent of the injury (ie, '1': accidental, '2': intentional self-harm, '3': assault, '4': undetermined, '5': adverse effect and '6': underdosing).
Coding of undetermined and accidental poisonings changed in ICD-10-CM: under ICD-9-CM, medical coders were instructed to select undetermined intent for external causes of injury when the intent was unspecified in the medical record; however, the guidance under ICD-10-CM instructs coders to default to accidental intent and only select undetermined intent if the medical record explicitly indicates that the intent is undetermined.
ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of underdosing: ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of 'underdosing', the use of less than the prescribed drug according to a provider or drug manufacturer.
ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of encounter type: ICD-10-CM introduced the new concept of encounter type for many injury diagnosis codes. For drug poisoning T-codes, a seventh character of 'A' indicates an initial encounter, 'D' indicates a subsequent encounter and 'S' indicates sequela. An initial encounter captures when a patient is receiving active treatment for the injury event, though it may not be the first encounter related to that injury event (eg, receiving treatment from two physicians for the same injury). A subsequent encounter captures when a patient is seen after active treatment for a follow-up related to the initial injury (eg, follow-up visit related to an overdose). A sequela captures when a patient is being treated for a secondary condition that arose because of the injury (eg, peripheral neuropathy).

### The complexity and challenges of the international classification of diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification to international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification transition in EDs [^9b81e000]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Beginning October 2015, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services will require medical providers to use the vastly expanded International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) system. Despite wide availability of information and mapping tools for the next generation of the ICD classification system, some of the challenges associated with transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM are not well understood. To quantify the challenges faced by emergency physicians, we analyzed a subset of a 2010 Illinois Medicaid database of emergency department ICD-9-CM codes, seeking to determine the accuracy of existing mapping tools in order to better prepare emergency physicians for the change to the expanded ICD-10-CM system. We found that 27% of 1830 codes represented convoluted multidirectional mappings. We then analyzed the convoluted transitions and found that 8% of total visit encounters (23% of the convoluted transitions) were clinically incorrect. The ambiguity and inaccuracy of these mappings may impact the workflow associated with the translation process and affect the potential mapping between ICD codes and Current Procedural Codes, which determine physician reimbursement.

### Updating and validating the rheumatic disease comorbidity index to incorporate ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes [^d94d131b]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Others have similarly developed ICD-10-CM code sets for comorbidity indices developed during the ICD-9-CM era. Quan et al. constructed ICD-10-CM coding algorithms for the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities using Canadian administrative data. They found the frequency of most comorbidities to be similar between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM coding algorithms and the ICD-10-CM code set to either match or outperform the ICD-9-CM versions in predicting in-hospital mortality. As in our study, peptic ulcer disease was a condition that differed in frequency between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM. Glasheen et al. have since updated the ICD-10-CM coding for the Charlson Comorbidity Index, validating the predictive performance of ICD-10-CM codes for hospital admission and mortality. Sears and Rundell developed updated ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM code lists for the Functional Comorbidity Index (FCI), assessing concordance before and after the transition to ICD-10-CM. The frequency of individual comorbidities was consistent between coding algorithms for thirteen of eighteen comorbidities. While the Functional Comorbidity Index retained predictive value for hospital length of stay with ICD-10-CM codes, there was an interaction between the index and coding algorithm suggesting modest reduced performance with ICD-10-CM codes. Our findings are in agreement with these studies; appropriate ICD-10-CM code sets for comorbidity indices can have concordance with ICD-9-CM versions and retain predictive value for health outcomes.

Comorbidity burden is a crucial determinant of long-term outcomes that include mortality and functional status among people with rheumatic diseases (,–). Thus, we tested the validity of the ICD-10-CM codes by assessing the predictive ability of the RDCI score for mortality and functional status. As expected, higher RDCI scores, indicating a greater comorbidity burden, were associated with higher mortality risk and poorer functional status during follow-up in both the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM cohorts. Moreover, metrics of overall model performance (AIC, QICu) for predicting these same outcomes in each cohort also showed substantial improvement when the RDCI was included. Together, these findings demonstrate that the RDCI calculated with the proposed ICD-10-CM codes maintains expected predictive value for key long-term outcomes.

### International classification of diseases coding for inflammatory arthritides [^f6832853]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The International Classification of Diseases was revised in 2015 from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), representing the largest revision to the system in 30 years (from 14 500 to 70 000 codes). Although ICD-10 could document conditions with greater granularity, it remains to be seen whether it has been well-utilized up to the 2022 transition to International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11).

With ICD-10, the number of inflammatory arthritis codes increased from 14 to 425. Although this allows for better characterization of such conditions for more than 1.3 million affected US individuals, the greater granularity is useful only if the breadth of codes is utilized. The purpose of this quality improvement study was to investigate usage patterns of inflammatory arthritides codes under ICD-10 vs ICD-9.

### Coding update of the SMFM definition of low risk for cesarean delivery from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM [^9ece1f72]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2015, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine developed a low risk for cesarean delivery definition based on administrative claims-based diagnosis codes described by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition is a clinical enrichment of 2 available measures from the Joint Commission and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality measures. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine measure excludes diagnosis codes that represent clinically relevant risk factors that are absolute or relative contraindications to vaginal birth while retaining diagnosis codes such as labor disorders that are discretionary risk factors for cesarean delivery. The introduction of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification in October 2015 expanded the number of available diagnosis codes and enabled a greater depth and breadth of clinical description. These coding improvements further enhance the clinical validity of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition and its potential utility in tracking progress toward the goal of safely lowering the US cesarean delivery rate. This report updates the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition of low risk for cesarean delivery using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification coding.

### Half century since SIDS: a reappraisal of terminology [^e49a0c92]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Sudden infant death diagnostic shift and ICD categorization — Inconsistent reporting and changes in understanding have led to a diagnostic shift away from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) toward undetermined cause and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed, creating variability in attribution and difficulty differentiating explained versus unexplained causes. For mortality surveillance in the United States, sudden infant death causes are grouped into SIDS (ICD-10 code R95), unknown or unspecified causes (ICD-10 code R99), and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (ICD-10 code W75), which are included under sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) to allow consistent monitoring of mortality trends that include both explained and unexplained causes. International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes are applied to cause-of-death determinations but may not reflect the certifier's intent; the ICD-10-CM was adapted from the ICD-10 for morbidity reporting in US health care settings, and the ICD-10, not the ICD-10-CM, is used for official reporting of mortality statistics in the United States and other nations.

For diabetic macular edema, ICD-9 CM 362.07 corresponds to ICD-10 CM "E10.321 Type 1 mild nonproliferative DR", "E10.331 Type 1 moderate nonproliferative DR", "E10.341 Type 1 severe nonproliferative DR", "E10.351 Type 1 proliferative DR", "E11.321 Type 2 mild nonproliferative DR", "E11.331 Type 2 moderate nonproliferative DR", "E11.341 Type 2 severe nonproliferative DR", "E11.351 Type 2 proliferative DR", "E13.321 other specified diabetes mellitus with mild nonproliferative DR", and "E13.331 other specified diabetes mellitus with moderate nonproliferative DR". Additional information states: "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 6th characters. In the DR series, indicate 'with or without' macular edema. Laterality indicators are not required in this series", with "1 = with macular edema" and "9 = without macular edema". It further specifies, "For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available".

### Accuracy of the modified global burden of disease international classification of diseases coding methods for identifying sepsis: a prospective multicentre cohort study [^de41b062]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

ICD-10-AM codes adapted from the GBD sepsis study demonstrated a low accuracy in identifying clinically diagnosed sepsis cases using Sepsis 3 criteria. Of the methods assessed, the modified GBD implicit plus method produced the most reliable estimates of sepsis incidence and mortality. All ICD coding methods showed poor agreement with clinical diagnosis of sepsis. Unspecified sepsis, infection, and organ dysfunction codes along with incomplete documentation of causative microorganisms and organ dysfunction contributes significantly to inaccuracies in using the modified GBD codes to identify sepsis.

### Mediators and adverse effects of child poverty in the United States [^1107af4b]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Tracking socioeconomic risk in health care settings using ICD-10-CM — compared with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) provides a more robust classification system that enables clinicians to track socioeconomic factors in patient care that may be related to families' annual income level; by using the ICD-10-CM, child health clinicians can submit supplemental codes that include not only diagnosis, such as acute asthma exacerbation, but additional socioeconomic factors related to the asthma exacerbation and treatment, such as childhood poverty or the family's inability to afford the recommended medical regimen; it will be important to capture this additional socioeconomic information with the sole use of ICD-10-CM codes to enable investigators to examine the putative impact of expanded codes on children's health care.

### General surgeon involvement in the care of patients designated with an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-endorsed ICD-10-CM emergency general surgery diagnosis code in Wisconsin [^5fcbf5f7]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The current national burden of emergency general surgery (EGS) illnesses and the extent of surgeon involvement in the care of these patients remain largely unknown. To inform needs assessments, research, and education, we sought to: (1) translate previously developed International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes representing EGS conditions to ICD 10th Revision, CM (ICD-10-CM) codes and (2) determine the national burden of and assess surgeon involvement across EGS conditions.

Methods

We converted ICD-9-CM codes to candidate ICD-10-CM codes using General Equivalence Mappings then iteratively refined the code list. We used National Inpatient Sample 2016 to 2017 data to develop a national estimate of the burden of EGS disease. To evaluate surgeon involvement, using Wisconsin Hospital Association discharge data (January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2018), we selected adult urgent/emergent encounters with an EGS condition as the principal diagnosis. Surgeon involvement was defined as a surgeon being either the attending provider or procedural physician.

Results

Four hundred and eighty-five ICD-9-CM codes mapped to 1,696 ICD-10-CM codes. The final list contained 985 ICD-10-CM codes. Nationally, there were 2,977,843 adult patient encounters with an ICD-10-CM EGS diagnosis. Of 94,903 EGS patients in the Wisconsin Hospital Association data set, most encounters were inpatient as compared with observation (75,878 [80.0%] vs. 19,025 [20.0%]). There were 57,780 patients (60.9%) that underwent any procedure. Among all Wisconsin EGS patients, most had no surgeon involvement (64.9% [n = 61,616]). Of the seven most common EGS diagnoses, surgeon involvement was highest for appendicitis (96.0%) and biliary tract disease (77.1%). For the other five most common conditions (skin/soft tissue infections, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intestinal obstruction/ileus, pancreatitis, diverticular disease), surgeons were involved in roughly 20% of patient care episodes.

Conclusion

Surgeon involvement for EGS conditions ranges from highly likely (appendicitis) to relatively unlikely (skin/soft tissue infections). The wide range in surgeon involvement underscores the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in the care of EGS patients.

### Idiopathic epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^b546b23f]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Appendix 2 — International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction are as follows: Epiretinal membrane — ICD-9 CM 362.56; ICD-10 CM H35.371, H35.372, H35.373. Vitreomacular traction, adhesion — ICD-9 CM 379.27; ICD-10 CM H43.821, H43.822, H43.823. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned; unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^2079c164]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

On October 1, 2015, the US transitioned to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) for recording diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures. It is unknown whether this transition was associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence based on diagnosis classification systems commonly used for payment and quality reporting.

Objective

To assess changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined level and trend changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition and clinically reviewed a subset of diagnostic categories with changes of 20% or more. Data included insurance claim diagnoses from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, for more than 18 million people aged 0 to 64 years with private insurance. Diagnoses were mapped using 3 common diagnostic classification systems: World Health Organization (WHO) disease chapters, Department of Health and Human Services Hierarchical Condition Categories (HHS-HCCs), and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification System (AHRQ-CCS). Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Exposures

US implementation of ICD-10-CM.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Monthly rates of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 eligible members.

Results

The analytic sample contained information on 2.1 billion enrollee person-months with 3.4 billion clinically assigned diagnoses; the mean (range) monthly sample size was 22.1 (18.4 to 27.1) million individuals. While diagnostic category prevalence changed minimally for WHO disease chapters, the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with level changes of 20% or more among 20 of 127 HHS-HCCs (15.7%) and 46 of 282 AHRQ-CCS categories (16.3%) and with trend changes of 20% or more among 12 of 127 of HHS-HCCs (9.4%) and 27 of 282 of AHRQ-CCS categories (9.6%). For HHS-HCCs, monthly rates of individuals with any acute myocardial infarction diagnosis increased 131.5% (95% CI, 124.1% to 138.8%), primarily because HHS added non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction diagnoses to this category. The HHS-HCC for diabetes with chronic complications increased by 92.4% (95% CI, 84.2% to 100.5%), primarily from including new diabetes-related hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia codes, and the rate for completed pregnancy with complications decreased by 54.5% (95% CI, -58.7% to -50.2%) partly due to removing vaginal birth after cesarean delivery as a complication.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with large prevalence changes for many diagnostic categories. Diagnostic classification systems developed using ICD-9-CM may need to be refined using ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for disease surveillance, performance assessment, and risk-adjusted payments.

False positives — explicit

In the 19 cases that were wrongly identified as having sepsis by the explicit modified GBD method, A41.9 (Unspecified sepsis) (11; 57.9%) was the most common ICD-10-AM code followed by A41.5 (Sepsis due to other and unspecified gram-negative organisms) (4; 21.1%). The false positive cases were evenly listed as primary or secondary diagnosis except A41.9 (Unspecified sepsis) which was a secondary diagnosis in 10/19 (90.9%) of cases (Table 2).

### Trends and factors associated with concordance between international classification of diseases, ninth and tenth revision, clinical modification codes and stroke clinical diagnoses [^4dc41749]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) codes are often used for disease surveillance. We examined changes in concordance between ICD-CM codes and clinical diagnoses before and after the transition to ICD-10-CM in the United States (October 1, 2015), and determined if there were systematic variations in concordance by patient and hospital characteristics. Methods- We included Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program patient discharges from 2014 to 2017. Concordance between ICD-CM codes and the clinical diagnosis documented by the physician (assumed as accurate) was calculated for each diagnosis category: ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Results- In total, 314857 patient records were included in the analysis (n = 280 hospitals), 55.9% of which were obtained after the transition to ICD-10-CM. While concordance was generally high, a small, and temporary decline occurred from the last calendar quarter of ICD-9-CM (average unadjusted concordance = 92.8%) to the first quarter of ICD-10-CM use (91.0%). Concordance differed by diagnosis category and was generally highest for ischemic stroke. In the analysis of ICD-10-CM records, disagreements often occurred between ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack records and between subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage records. Compared with the smallest hospitals (≤ 200 beds), larger hospitals had significantly higher odds of concordance (ischemic stroke adjusted odds ratio for ≥ 400 beds, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5–1.9). Conclusions- This study identified a small and transient decline in concordance between ICD-CM codes and stroke clinical diagnoses during the coding transition, indicating no substantial impact on the overall identification of stroke patients. Researchers and policymakers should remain aware of potential changes in ICD-CM code accuracy over time, which may affect disease surveillance. Systematic variations in the accuracy of codes by hospital and patient characteristics have implications for quality-of-care studies and hospital comparative assessments.

### Interrupted time series analysis to evaluate the performance of drug overdose morbidity indicators shows discontinuities across the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM transition [^3bdd8940]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

On 1 October 2015, the USA transitioned from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10-CM). Considering the major changes to drug overdose coding, we examined how using different approaches to define all-drug overdose and opioid overdose morbidity indicators in ICD-9-CM impacts longitudinal analyses that span the transition, using emergency department (ED) and hospitalisation data from six states' hospital discharge data systems.

Methods

We calculated monthly all-drug and opioid overdose ED visit rates and hospitalisation rates (per 100000 population) by state, starting in January 2010. We applied three ICD-9-CM indicator definitions that included identical all-drug or opioid-related codes but restricted the number of fields searched to varying degrees. Under ICD-10-CM, all fields were searched for relevant codes. Adjusting for seasonality and autocorrelation, we used interrupted time series models with level and slope change parameters in October 2015 to compare trend continuity when employing different ICD-9-CM definitions.

Results

Most states observed consistent or increased capture of all-drug and opioid overdose cases in ICD-10-CM coded hospital discharge data compared with ICD-9-CM. More inclusive ICD-9-CM indicator definitions reduced the magnitude of significant level changes, but the effect of the transition was not eliminated.

Discussion

The coding change appears to have introduced systematic differences in measurement of drug overdoses before and after 1 October 2015. When using hospital discharge data for drug overdose surveillance, researchers and decision makers should be aware that trends spanning the transition may not reflect actual changes in drug overdose rates.

### International classification of diseases coding for inflammatory arthritides [^0c0feee4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The transition to ICD-10 afforded the potential of increased granularity of inflammatory arthritides diagnosis codes for clinical care, research, and billing purposes. This quality improvement study found that, despite a 30-fold increase in codes, adoption of ICD-10 has been poor; only 2.1% of available codes were used more than 1% of the time and were nonspecific. This may reflect the lack of financial incentive for accurate ICD-10 coding, because ICD-10 is not tied to reimbursement.

When assessed by year, the percentage of codes used with regularity did not increase. When assessed by clinician specialty, the percentage of codes used was not better for rheumatologists (who might be expected to be more refined users of such codes) than primary care clinicians. This study is limited by potential coding inaccuracies and cannot establish causality.

Overall, consistent with findings in other areas, the data suggest room for better application of inflammatory arthritis codes. This will be important in years to come if the benefits of ICD expansion are to be realized.

3.2. Case coding

One of the prepared cases referred to a diagnosis (Chronic peripheral neuropathic pain) that had not yet been implemented in the ICD-11 at the time of the field trial, and therefore was excluded from evaluation, leaving 13 pain diagnoses for 11 cases to be rated per participant. Taken together, the participants rated 1342 cases, each case was rated by between 67% (119/177) and 75% (132/177) of participants. Participants assigned the correct code for the pain diagnosis in 83.9% of cases, and in 98.4% of cases, participants reported having no difficulty in assigning the diagnosis (Table 2). The aggregated clinical utility (the mean for the individual facets) was high across all cases (4.3 ± 0.90) on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all useful) to 5 (very useful) and all single cases (Table 2).

Morbidity coding rules

Morbidity rule 1 (MB1): Several conditions recorded as the "main condition". Select the "main condition" for which the patient received care. Extension codes may be used to indicate different types of main condition (eg, reason for admission or main resource condition). In cases where the main condition cannot be determined based on documentation, select the condition that is mentioned first.
Morbidity rule 2 (MB2): Condition recorded as "main condition" is presenting symptom of diagnosed, treated condition. If a symptom or sign (ICD-11 chapter 21) or a problem (ICD-11 chapter 24) is recorded as the "main condition", and this is obviously a sign, symptom, or problem of a diagnosed condition coded elsewhere, and care was given to the latter, reselect the diagnosed condition as the "main condition".
Morbidity rule 3 (MB3): Signs and symptoms. When a symptom or sign is documented as the "main condition", and it is documented that it could be caused by either one condition or another, select the symptom or sign as "main condition".

### Preparing for international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification implementation: strategies for maintaining an efficient workflow [^204c5163]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is required to be used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services health care billing data starting in October 2015 in the United States. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is an update to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and contains approximately 70,000 codes compared with 14,000 codes. We aimed to discuss how our institution is updating the coding system in a manner that alleviates the possible burden placed on providers including more coding information required and longer load times. We performed a simulation test including testing the diagnosis calculator, timing, and how well the new and old codes mapped. We conducted a gap analysis to ensure that coding could begin in October of 2015 with minimal service interruptions. We will describe strategies and procedures to transition between systems while maintaining efficiency and helping to improve classification.

### Validation of the new diagnosis grouping system for pediatric emergency department visits using the international classification of diseases, 10th revision [^dc4ffd8e]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

A clinically sensible diagnosis grouping system (DGS) is needed for describing pediatric emergency diagnoses for research, medical resource preparedness, and making national policy for pediatric emergency medical care. The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) developed the DGS successfully. We developed the modified PECARN DGS based on the different pediatric population of South Korea and validated the system to obtain the accurate and comparable epidemiologic data of pediatric emergent conditions of the selected population.

Methods

The data source used to develop and validate the modified PECARN DGS was the National Emergency Department Information System of South Korea, which was coded by the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code system. To develop the modified DGS based on ICD-10 code, we matched the selected ICD-10 codes with those of the PECARN DGS by the General Equivalence Mappings (GEMs). After converting ICD-10 codes to ICD-9 codes by GEMs, we matched ICD-9 codes into PECARN DGS categories using the matrix developed by PECARN group. Lastly, we conducted the expert panel survey using Delphi method for the remaining diagnosis codes that were not matched.

Results

A total of 1879 ICD-10 codes were used in development of the modified DGS. After 1078 (57.4%) of 1879 ICD-10 codes were assigned to the modified DGS by GEM and PECARN conversion tools, investigators assigned each of the remaining 801 codes (42.6%) to DGS subgroups by 2 rounds of electronic Delphi surveys. And we assigned the remaining 29 codes (4%) into the modified DGS at the second expert consensus meeting. The modified DGS accounts for 98.7% and 95.2% of diagnoses of the 2008 and 2009 National Emergency Department Information System data set. This modified DGS also exhibited strong construct validity using the concepts of age, sex, site of care, and seasons. This also reflected the 2009 outbreak of H1N1 influenza in Korea.

Conclusions

We developed and validated clinically feasible and sensible DGS system for describing pediatric emergent conditions in Korea. The modified PECARN DGS showed good comprehensiveness and demonstrated reliable construct validity. This modified DGS based on PECARN DGS framework may be effectively implemented for research, reporting, and resource planning in pediatric emergency system of South Korea.

### Trends in mortality in septic patients according to the different organ failure during 15 years [^c2beb473]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients

Sepsis was defined by the presence of infection and at least one organ dysfunction. In Catalonia, the diagnostic coding system changed in January 2018 from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM. In this way, ICD-9-CM codes were used until December 31, 2017, and ICD-10-CM were used subsequently.

Using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes, all hospitalized patients with and infection and an organ dysfunction were detected following the Angus methodology, over a 15-year period (2005–2019). All ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes used for detection of infection-related organ dysfunction have been provided in the Additional file 1, and refer to acute dysfunction of any organ as a result of sepsis, since each of them is associated with the diagnosis of infection or sepsis. All of these used codes were translated into the new coding system (CID-10-CM) as of 2018.

To avoid overlaps, we excluded patients who were transferred from one acute-care hospital to another during the same sepsis episode; 18.992 admissions were excluded from non-residents in Catalonia.

Coding

Diagnoses and procedures were coded using the ICD-9-CM until the end of 2017 and ICD-10-CM for 2018–2019. ICD-9-CM codes to identify patients with sepsis were updated in 2000 to the following: 995.91 (sepsis), 995.92 (severe sepsis) and 785.52 (septic shock). ICD-10-CM codes to identify patients with sepsis were equated to ICD-9-CM codes and were: R652 (severe sepsis), R6520 (severe sepsis without septic shock) and R6521 (severe sepsis with septic shock).

Although information was not available regarding the unit or department where patients were treated (intensive care unit (ICU), internal medicine unit, etc.), we indirectly deduced ICU admission from procedures typically used in intensive care management (Additional file 1). The Charlson comorbidity index with its 17 comorbid disease categories was used to assess the presence of underlying comorbidities. The ICD-9-CM codes used to identify acute organ dysfunction and infectious processes are listed in Supplementary Material. With ICD-10-CM codification system, all used codes to identify acute organ dysfunction were equated to ICD-10-CM system.

Heritability and genetic correlation across the full spectrum of diseases

We estimated the additive genetic heritability (h²) across 866 level three ICD-10 codes fulfilling the selection criteria, adjusted for non-linear genetic effects and close environment. Across the disease areas, congenital malformations, endocrine diseases, and mental disorders had the highest heritability (Fig. 2). The ICD-10 codes with the highest heritability were diseases with known large genetic components, often with well-described specific genes known where genetic variants are known to impact diseases, such as cystic kidney disease (Q61, h² = 0.85, 0.78; 0.89 95% CI), osteochondrodysplasias (Q78, h² = 0.77, 0.66; 0.83 95% CI), and congenital malformation syndromes (Q87, h² = 0.75, 0.62; 0.82 95% CI). Looking beyond these known genetic diseases, almost 50% (N = 424 codes) of the level three ICD-10 codes displayed a heritability with a magnitude of h² > 0.1. We observed a negative correlation between the heritability and mean age of onset (⍴ = −0.24, p = 2.97e−13), as well as a small correlation to the prevalence (⍴ = −0.07, p = 0.054). Resolving the heritability at the less specific 2nd level (N = 183 codes) and more specific 4th level (N = 1519 codes) of ICD-10 supported the same pattern of heritability (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3) with 63% (N = 971) Level 4 codes having h² > 0.1, indicating the importance of acquiring accurate family history for diagnoses, even outside of well-established genetic conditions. Heritability estimates across the full ICD-10 ontology are available at.

### Trends in severe maternal morbidity in the US across the transition to ICD-10-CM / PCS from 2012–2019 [^d3864f58]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Between 2012 and 2019, SMM rates increased from 69.5 to 79.7 per 10 000 delivery hospitalizations (RD, 10.2; 95% CI, 5.8 to 14.6) without a statistically significant change across the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition (RD, −3.2; 95% CI, −6.9 to 0.6) (Figure 1; Table 3). When restricted to the same set of years as a prior study (2012 to 2017), there was also no significant change associated with ICD-10-CM/PCS transition (RD, 0; 95% CI, −4.1 to 4.1). Compared with 2012, annual SMM rates were only significantly higher for 2018 and 2019. In-hospital mortality per 100 000 delivery hospitalizations did not increase significantly over the study period (RD, 1.7; 95% CI, −0.5 to 4.0), and there was no change associated with ICD-10-CM/PCS transition (RD, 1.5; 95% CI, −0.9 to 3.9).

### The transition to ICD-10-CM: challenges for pediatric practice [^51ad6a56]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Diagnostic codes are used widely within health care for billing, quality assessment, and to measure clinical outcomes. The US health care system will transition to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), in October 2015. Little is known about how this transition will affect pediatric practices. The objective of this study was to examine how the transition to ICD-10-CM may result in ambiguity of clinical information and financial disruption for pediatricians.

Methods

Using a statewide data set from Illinois Medicaid specified for pediatricians, 2708 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, diagnosis codes were identified. Diagnosis codes were categorized into 1 of 5 categories: identity, class-to-subclass, subclass-to-class, convoluted, and no translation. The convoluted and high-cost diagnostic codes (n = 636) were analyzed for accuracy and categorized into "information loss", "overlapping categories", "inconsistent", and "consistent". Finally, reimbursement by Medicaid was calculated for each category.

Results

Twenty-six percent of pediatric diagnosis codes are convoluted, which represents 21% of Illinois Medicaid pediatric patient encounters and 16% of reimbursement. The diagnosis codes represented by information loss (3.6%), overlapping categories (3.2%), and inconsistent (1.2%) represent 8% of Medicaid pediatric reimbursement.

Conclusions

The potential for financial disruption and administrative errors from 8% of reimbursement diagnosis codes necessitates special attention to these codes in preparing for the transition to ICD-10-CM for pediatric practices.

### The effect of the transition from the ninth to the tenth revision of the international classification of diseases on external cause registration of injury morbidity in Sweden [^dc004964]. Injury Prevention (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Revisions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) have previously been shown to cause dramatic effects with regard to injury mortality data when implemented. However, limited knowledge exists on the effects on the coding of external causes of injury morbidity, despite this being an important aspect with regard to injury prevention.

Method

Hospitalised injuries in Sweden were studied using time series intervention analysis to observe the effect of the ICD change from ICD-9 to ICD-10 in 1997 on external cause coding.

Results

The results would suggest considerable coding issues with a large spike in the proportion of injury admissions registered without an external cause code in 1997, with continuing, although gradually diminishing, problems up to 2002. The coding change seems to have had an immediate effect on all external cause of injury categories, although the categories that were not directly convertible from ICD-9 to ICD-10 were seemingly more greatly affected.

Discussion

The study illustrates the potential issues associated with changes between ICD revisions and the importance of data quality control both during surveillance and collection of data, but also when presenting injury trends across ICD versions.

### Kostmann's syndrome [^36c42e09]. Clinical Imaging (2005). Low credibility.

Kostmann's syndrome is a rare congenital disorder of neutrophil production due to impairment of myeloid differentiation in the bone marrow, with the neutrophil count being characteristically less than 500 × 10³ cells/L (normal: 2–7 × 10⁹/L). Severe persistent neutropenia results in an increased susceptibility to frequent bacterial infections. The condition can be treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Although several articles have addressed the clinicopathological and haematological aspects of this disorder, little or no information has been available concerning the radiological findings in this disorder. This report summarizes the clinical features, radiological findings and management of a patient with Kostmann's syndrome.

### Interrupted time series analysis to evaluate the performance of drug overdose morbidity indicators shows discontinuities across the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM transition [^b91d8b40]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Background

Epidemiologists and researchers have historically relied on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coded emergency department (ED) and hospitalisation administrative claims data reported through state-level hospital discharge data (HDD) systems to track drug overdose trends. The transition from the ICD 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the 10th Revision (ICD-10-CM) on 1 October 2015 marked a major change in medical claims coding for all USA healthcare entities covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

The number of injury and poisoning diagnosis codes increased from 2600 in ICD-9-CM to 43 000 in ICD-10-CM, greatly improving code specificity. ICD-10-CM also streamlined the coding process by incorporating both drug and intent (unintentional, intentional self-harm, assault and undetermined) information into a single code. In ICD-9-CM, overdose visits were coded with a diagnosis code indicating the drug involved and/or a separate non-billable external cause of injury code indicating intentionality. Though these are positive changes for drug overdose surveillance, the extensive revisions preclude a simple one-to-one crosswalk between the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM coding systems and raise questions about how best to track overdose trends over time using claims data.

Two recent studies examined opioid overdose trends across the ICD transition using inpatient data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, finding that hospitalisations mentioning an opioid overdose code in any field decreased by 10.2% and 12.4% from 2015 Q3 (last quarter of ICD-9-CM) to 2015 Q4 (first quarter of ICD-10-CM). The reported decreases, however, could be because both studies excluded assault and intentional self-harm codes from their ICD-10-CM indicator but not their ICD-9-CM indicator. Other studies employing ICD-9-CM-based drug overdose indicators, as well as guidance from the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) and CDC, vary in terms of which ICD-9-CM codes are included and which fields are searched for relevant codes. In ICD-10-CM, CSTE and CDC recommendations agree that all available fields should be searched for overdose indicator codes.

### Updating and validating the rheumatic disease comorbidity index to incorporate ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes [^a417103c]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The Rheumatic Disease Comorbidity Index (RDCI) was designed as a tool to quantify the burden of comorbidities and to account for the association of this burden with long-term health outcomes in patients with rheumatic diseases. The RDCI was initially developed using patient questionnaires to collect 10 comorbid conditions, which were weighted to generate a score from 0–9. The RDCI score has been shown to be predictive of physical function, quality of life, and mortality. Previously, we validated the RDCI score using administrative claims data and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Using claims data, the RDCI compared favorably to other existing general population comorbidity indices in predicting physical function and mortality in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Additionally, the RDCI is more feasible to obtain and a more versatile index, performing well in both self-reported and administrative data. Because of its performance, feasibility, and versatility, it has been broadly used in RA studies as well as those in psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthritis, gout, lupus, vasculitis, and osteoporosis.

In the U.S. healthcare systems transitioned from the ICD-9-CM classification system for medical conditions to ICD-10-CM on October 1, 2015. The ICD-10-CM coding system contains a nearly five-fold increase in the number of codes available in order to provide improved specificity in classifying medical conditions. The transition to ICD-10-CM has required updating the coding of chronic conditions and comorbidity indices that were developed under the previous classification system to confirm validity with ICD-10-CM codes. The RDCI, derived from ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes, has not yet been validated. Because different comorbidity indices utilize unique definitions of conditions and diagnostic code sets, the generation of an ICD-10-CM code set specific to the RDCI is needed to allow its use in studies spanning both timeframes. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to translate the ICD-9-CM codes used to generate the RDCI to ICD-10-CM codes and to validate the predictive ability for mortality and functional status of the RDCI when derived from ICD-10-CM codes.

### Etiology of encephalitis in Australia, 1990–2007 [^db90a1ed]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Definitions

An encephalitis-associated hospital stay was defined as a hospitalization for which the primary discharge diagnosis was an ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-AM code for acute encephalitis. Relevant ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-AM codes were obtained by searching the alphabetical list of ICD codes for all codes that include the term enceph, but excluding nonencephalitis conditions (e.g. anencephaly) and including rabies. Additionally, 2 ICD-9-CM codes used for encephalitis-related conditions before July 1998 did not include the prefix enceph-, unlike nomenclatures used in ICD-10-AM encephalitis codes. One of these ICD-9-CM codes was 49.8, defined as other non–arthropod-borne viral diseases of central nervous system –other specified non–arthropod-borne viral diseases of the central nervous system. The other code was 49.9, defined as other non–arthropod-borne viral diseases of central nervous system –unspecified non–arthropod-borne viral diseases of the central nervous system. The use of these codes was found by comparing data extracted for 1998 and 1999. For these 2 years, coding was performed in both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-AM, and data were then compared to identify the additional codes.

The Table shows the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-AM encephalitis-associated conditions with codes used for encephalitis hospitalizations during 1990–2007. These codes were further classified by investigators into encephalitis with known pathogens or unknown pathogens (Table).

### Trends in severe maternal morbidity in the US across the transition to ICD-10-CM / PCS from 2012–2019 [^b0c7a44a]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Results

At the national level, a total of 5 964 315 delivery hospitalizations from 2012 to 2019, representing a weighted total of 29.8 million deliveries, were included in the analysis, with a mean (SD) maternal age of 28.6 (5.9) years. Over half of all deliveries were to non-Hispanic White women (14 958 568 [50.2%]), those with a private primary expected payer (15 141 893 [50.8%]), and those who lived in large metropolitan areas (16 918 417 [56.7%]). There were no substantial changes in the distribution of patient characteristics across the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition (Table 1).

Abbreviation: ICD-10-CM/PCS, International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification and Procedure Coding System.

Overall, the number of SMM diagnosis and procedure codes (excluding blood transfusion) expanded from 244 in ICD-9-CM to 437 in ICD-10-CM/PCS. Among the 20 included SMM indicators, 2 had a 1-to-1 translation, 1 had a many-to-1 translation, 12 had a 1-to-many translation, and 5 had a many-to-many translation (Table 2).

### Updated diagnosis grouping system for pediatric emergency department visits [^03c85eea]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aims to update the Diagnosis Grouping System (DGS) for International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for ongoing use. The DGS was developed in 2010 using ICD-9 codes with 21 major groups and 27 subgroups to facilitate research on pediatric patients presenting to emergency departments and required updated classification for more recent ICD codes.

Methods

All emergency department discharges available in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) database for 2016 were included to identify ICD-10 codes. These codes were then mapped onto the DGS codes originally derived from ICD-9. We used ICD-10 codes from the PECARN database from 2017 to 2019 to confirm validity.

Results

The DGS was updated with ICD-10 codes based on 2016 PECARN data, and this updated DGS was successfully applied to 6,853,479 (97.3%) of all codes from 2017 to 2019.

Discussion

Using ICD-10 codes from the PECARN Registry, the DGS was updated to reflect ICD-10 codes to facilitate ongoing research.

### A trauma mortality prediction model based on the ICD-10-CM lexicon: TMPM-ICD10 [^55a2ac36]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Outcome prediction models allow risk adjustment required for trauma research and the evaluation of outcomes. The advent of ICD-10-CM has rendered risk adjustment based on ICD-9-CM codes moot, but as yet no risk adjustment model based on ICD-10-CM codes has been described.

Methods

The National Trauma Data Bank provided data from 773,388 injured patients who presented to one of 747 trauma centers in 2016 with traumatic injuries ICD-10-CM codes and Injury Severity Score (ISS). We constructed an outcome prediction model using only ICD-10-CM acute injury codes and compared its performance with that of the ISS.

Results

Compared with ISS, the TMPM-ICD-10 discriminated survivors from non-survivors better (ROC TMPM-ICD-10 = 0.861 [0.860–0.872], ROC [reviever operating curve] ISS = 0.830 [0.823–0.836]), was better calibrated (HL [Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic] TMPM-ICD-10 = 49.01, HL ISS = 788.79), and had a lower Akaike information criteria (AIC TMPM-ICD10 = 30579.49; AIC ISS = 31802.18).

Conclusions

Because TMPM-ICD10 provides better discrimination and calibration than the ISS and can be computed without recourse to Abbreviated Injury Scale coding, the TMPM-ICD10 should replace the ISS as the standard measure of overall injury severity for data coded in the ICD-10-CM lexicon.

### Guidance for systematic integration of undernutrition in attributing cause of death in children [^0345113c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVES AND APPROACH

Three members of the MITS Alliance Cause of Death technical working group convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts in public health, child health, child nutrition, infectious disease, and MITS. The group met via videoconference 10 times from May 2020 to May 2021. The following objectives were delineated and provided structure for guidance development:

Objective 1: Establish parameters for when severe and moderate wasting and stunting in children 1–59 months old should be included in death certification and under what circumstances the condition should be included in part 1 (causal chain) or in part 2 (contributing condition).
Objective 2: Generate a framework for how to account for low birth weight (LBW), prematurity, and small for gestational age (SGA) as contributing or causal conditions of wasting in deaths among 1–3-month-old infants.
Objective 3: Standardize methods for using postmortem anthropometric assessments, especially in the context of limited antemortem data, to identify wasting and stunting.

We strove to align guidance development with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Although the 11 th revision, ICD-11, has been released, widespread implementation is not anticipated until 2022. The panel therefore chose to use ICD-10 to support immediate application in MITS studies. However, we anticipate full applicability of the guidance with ICD-11; sample code mapping is provided in Table 2.

Table 2.
Mapping Conditions to ICD-10 and ICD-11 Codes

A constraint in using ICD codes is their lack of consistent alignment with current terminology used to describe undernutrition, and the rules are insufficiently nuanced to reflect current understanding of causes of undernutrition. For example, ICD-10 rules for the E40–E43 undernutrition codes state that these codes are not be used in the following situations: intestinal malabsorption, nutritional anemia, starvation, or as a sequalae of protein-energy malnutrition. Undernutrition is caused by multiple, often simultaneously occurring factors, including insufficient dietary intake, enteric dysfunction, and recurrent and persistent infections. Isolating the underlying determinants of undernutrition in an individual child is usually impossible. However, because ICD-10 codes are the recommended standard for classifying conditions in the WHO International Form of Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (Figure 1), we tried to align as closely as possible to ICD-10.

### Stigmatizing language in substance use-related international classification of diseases codes [^b2733d29]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives:

Healthcare-associated stigma is a critical barrier for treatment engagement for patients with substance use disorders. Although there are efforts to combat stigmatizing language in clinical documentation, little is known about the presence of substance use-related stigmatizing language in structured diagnosis codes ubiquitous in clinical medicine.

Methods:

We examined the presence of substance use-related stigmatizing terms contained within the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code descriptions. Stigmatizing terms were compiled from guidelines authored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, while ICD-10-CM codes were obtained from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Results:

We evaluated 74,259 ICD-10-CM code descriptions and identified 173 substance use-related codes with stigmatizing language. The stigmatizing terms detected were "abuse" (157 code descriptions), "alcoholic" (16), and "drug abuser" (2). The term "abuse" was used in relation to multiple substances including alcohol, opioids, cannabis, sedatives, hypnotics and anxiolytics, cocaine, stimulants, hallucinogens, inhalants, other psychoactive substances, tobacco, and other medicinal products.

Conclusions:

Stigmatizing language is used in multiple ICD-10-CM code descriptions. Subsequent iterations should bring ICD-10-CM code descriptions in line with current recommendations for destigmatized descriptors to avoid the perpetuation of stigma in healthcare.

### Exploring injury intentionality and mechanism via ICD-10-CM injury codes and self-reported injury in a large, urban emergency department [^2516c2cb]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Health systems capture injuries using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnostic codes and share data with public health to inform injury surveillance. This study analyses provider-assigned ICD-10-CM injury codes among self-reported injuries to determine the effectiveness of ICD-10-CM coding in capturing injury and assault.

Methods

Self-reported injury screen records from an urban, level 1 trauma centre collected between 20 November 2015 and 30 September 2019 were compared with corresponding provider-assigned ICD-10-CM codes discerning the frequency in which intentions are indicated among patients reporting (1) any injury and (2) assault.

Results

Of 380922 patients screened, 32788 (8.61%) reported any injury and 6763 (1.78%) reported assault. ICD-10-CM codes had a sensitivity of 67.40% (95%CI 66.89% to 67.91%) for any injury and specificity of 89.79% (95% CI 89.69% to 89.89%]). For assault, ICD-10-CM codes had sensitivity of 2.25% (95%CI 1.91% to 2.63%) and specificity of 99.97% (95%CI 99.97% 99.98%).

Discussion

This study found provider-assigned ICD-10-CM had limited sensitivity to identify injury and low sensitivity for assault. This study more fully characterises ICD-10-CM coding system effectiveness in identifying assaults.
