## Question

What are the potential risks and benefits of statin therapy in patients with comorbidities?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the potential risks and benefits of statin therapy in patients with comorbidities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core evidence base and how comorbidity modifies absolute risk and absolute benefit. Then, I should verify how comorbidity alters safety profiles, including muscle, hepatic, renal, cognitive, and metabolic effects. Next, I will examine special populations where the balance shifts, such as the very elderly, frailty, diabetes, CKD, heart failure, COPD, and HIV. After that, I should review deprescribing principles and tools like CAC scoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered decision framework and highlight evidence gaps that require caution in interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the foundational benefit signal. Across randomized trials and meta-analyses, statins reduce all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and revascularization in primary and secondary prevention, with benefits proportional to baseline risk and LDL-C lowering, and without a signal for increased serious adverse events in aggregate analyses of typical adults aged 40–75 years [^113RwmeF] [^113puV6h]. Hold on, I should verify applicability to older adults; the USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient for adults 76 years or older without CVD, reflecting underrepresentation and competing risks rather than absence of benefit, so I need to be cautious extrapolating to the very old [^114zkBRW] [^115FFUSv].

> I need to check how comorbidity changes the risk–benefit calculus. Higher baseline ASCVD risk from comorbidities such as diabetes, CKD, and polyvascular disease increases the absolute risk reduction from statins, making the same relative risk reduction more clinically meaningful in absolute terms, which is a key reason guidelines prioritize statins in these groups [^111CzrrQ] [^113RwmeF]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude; in diabetes, absolute benefits are roughly twofold greater than in non-diabetic populations with similar LDL-C, reinforcing the value of statins in this comorbidity profile [^115PBRJ8].

> Next, I should review safety signals that comorbidity may amplify. Muscle symptoms are the most common, with observational data linking statins to musculoskeletal conditions and injuries, though randomized trials show low rates of serious myopathy and rhabdomyolysis; risk is higher with interacting drugs, high-intensity regimens, and possibly pre-existing neuromuscular disease, so I need to ensure drug–drug interaction checks and dose moderation in multimorbidity and polypharmacy [^114d86KS] [^115wBqQf] [^116qF8w9]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; most patients can find a tolerated statin regimen with adjustments, and true statin intolerance requiring nonstatin therapy is uncommon but real, necessitating individualized strategies [^116qF8w9].

> I will now examine hepatic and renal considerations. Statins can cause mild, reversible transaminase elevations, and severe hepatotoxicity is rare. In CKD, dose adjustments are prudent, and although some dialysis-era trials were neutral, contemporary guidance still supports statins for ASCVD risk reduction in CKD when life expectancy exceeds the time-to-benefit, with careful monitoring and dose selection [^116NaGWq] [^113gLtyz]. Wait, I should double-check the dialysis signal; the 4D trial did not show benefit, but modern practice often still uses statins in CKD not on dialysis, aligning with risk-based approaches and guideline pathways [^113gLtyz].

> Let me consider metabolic effects, especially diabetes. Statins modestly increase incident type 2 diabetes risk, particularly with high-intensity therapy and in patients with prediabetes risk factors. The absolute increase is small, and cardiovascular benefits still outweigh diabetes risk, but I should monitor glucose after initiation and reinforce lifestyle in those at risk [^117W8o15] [^115hPWnv]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the diabetes risk might be negligible across the board. I should correct that — meta-analytic estimates suggest about 1 additional diabetes case per 255 patients treated over 4 years, concentrated in high-risk metabolic phenotypes, which is clinically manageable with surveillance [^117W8o15].

> Cognitive effects deserve careful verification. Early case reports raised concern, but large observational datasets and meta-analyses generally show neutral or protective associations of statins with cognition, and guideline bodies advise that routine cognitive monitoring is not required. Nonetheless, in older adults with baseline cognitive impairment, I should individualize decisions and communicate uncertainties transparently [^114ZF7ct] [^11563kkW]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with geriatric guidance. Yes, consensus statements emphasize that the preponderance of evidence does not support a causal cognitive harm signal from statins [^114ZF7ct].

> Now, I will examine the very elderly and frailty. Traditional 10-year risk tools overestimate risk due to competing mortality, so I should use competing-risk–adjusted models, geriatric assessments, and life expectancy to frame decisions. Benefits accrue after 2–3 years, so if life expectancy is under 1–2 years, deprescribing may be reasonable, whereas healthier older adults with longer expected survival often benefit from statins [^1135hSSu] [^115vLsgj] [^116BFpBU]. Let me reconsider the strength of evidence. While RCTs are limited, large observational cohorts in veterans suggest mortality benefits even at advanced ages, though residual confounding is possible, so shared decision-making is essential here [^116AzPAb].

> For diabetes specifically, I should confirm that statins remain first-line regardless of baseline ASCVD risk in adults 40–75 years, with high-intensity therapy reasonable when multiple risk factors are present. The absolute risk reduction is larger, and the diabetes signal should not deter indicated therapy given net cardiovascular benefit [^111CzrrQ] [^115PBRJ8]. I need to ensure I integrate lifestyle and, when needed, additional LDL-C lowering to reach thresholds that further reduce events in very high-risk diabetic patients [^111CzrrQ].

> In heart failure, I should verify stage-specific guidance. For ischemic etiologies and adequate life expectancy, statins are reasonable for secondary prevention, but for nonischemic HF, routine statins are not beneficial. Thus, I must align intensity with etiology and prognosis, avoiding overtreatment when time-to-benefit exceeds survival [^11171dBJ] [^116cqcAK]. Wait, let me verify the evidence base. Pooled analyses show reduced MI with statins in ischemic HF, supporting selective use rather than blanket therapy [^116cqcAK].

> For COPD, I should double-check that anti-inflammatory hypotheses have not translated into clear clinical benefit. A Cochrane review shows no reduction in exacerbations or mortality with statins, despite modest reductions in inflammatory markers, so statins should not be initiated solely for COPD management; if used, it should be for standard ASCVD indications [^112ToMdj]. Hold on, I should verify whether any subgroup benefits emerged; none were identified in high-quality syntheses, reinforcing a risk-based rather than disease-specific indication [^112ToMdj].

> In HIV, let me verify the latest guidance. The REPRIEVE trial demonstrated that pitavastatin reduced major adverse cardiovascular events in people with HIV at elevated risk, leading to strong recommendations for statins when 10-year ASCVD risk is 5% or higher, with individualized discussions below that threshold. This addresses HIV-specific inflammation and elevated ASCVD risk [^114wAz2R]. I should confirm that drug–drug interactions with antiretrovirals are manageable; yes, pitavastatin and some other statins can be used with attention to interactions, supporting implementation [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I cover deprescribing and when to stop. In older adults with limited life expectancy, severe frailty, or unacceptable side effects, deprescribing can improve quality of life without worsening short-term outcomes; observational data suggest higher ASCVD events after discontinuation, but a randomized deprescribing trial in patients with life-limiting illness showed improved quality of life without excess 60-day mortality, supporting selective discontinuation in palliative contexts [^113Zga8L] [^112zN96A]. But wait, what if we overgeneralize from observational hazard signals? I should caution that confounding by indication is likely, so decisions should remain individualized and preference-sensitive [^113Zga8L].

> Next, I should review decision tools that refine risk estimation. Competing-risk–adjusted models and CAC scoring can reclassify risk in older adults; a CAC score of zero in a primary prevention context supports deferring statins, whereas higher CAC strengthens the case for therapy, and these tools should be integrated into shared decision-making conversations [^115vLsgj] [^112T57cu]. Hold on, I should verify that CAC is reasonable up to age 80 in selected patients; yes, guidelines endorse CAC in older adults with low-risk phenotypes who question benefit, with attention to radiation minimization [^112T57cu].

> I should confirm a practical, patient-centered framework. Start with life expectancy and time-to-benefit, assess frailty, cognition, and polypharmacy, screen for drug–drug interactions, and then estimate absolute risk and absolute risk reduction using appropriate tools. Choose intensity based on risk and tolerance, monitor lipids and tolerability, and revisit goals as comorbidity and preferences evolve [^117C5V8q] [^111sWz51]. Let me verify that this aligns with major guidelines. Yes, ACC/AHA and AACE emphasize shared decision-making, risk discussion, and periodic reassessment, which is especially critical in multimorbidity [^117C5V8q] [^1133CrqA].

> Finally, I need to highlight evidence gaps and avoid overconfidence. Very elderly, frail, and multimorbid patients are underrepresented in trials, so some recommendations rely on observational data and expert consensus. Ongoing trials like STAREE and PREVENTABLE, and deprescribing studies, should refine practice, but until then, clinicians must communicate uncertainty and tailor decisions to patient values and prognosis [^116TtG53] [^113gLtyz]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines acknowledge these gaps. Yes, USPSTF and ACC/AHA explicitly note insufficient evidence in adults over 75 and call for more inclusive trials, reinforcing the need for cautious, individualized care [^114zkBRW].

Statin therapy offers **substantial cardiovascular benefits** for patients with comorbidities, including reduced ASCVD events and mortality in diabetes, CKD, and polyvascular disease [^111CzrrQ] [^115PBRJ8]. Benefits are **greater in secondary prevention** and in high-risk primary prevention settings, with modest absolute benefit in lower-risk groups [^114zkBRW] [^1176EN33]. Risks include muscle symptoms, a small increase in diabetes, and rare hepatic or cognitive effects; these are generally manageable and outweighed by benefits in high-risk patients [^116NaGWq] [^117W8o15]. In older adults, use shared decision-making to balance life expectancy, frailty, and polypharmacy; consider deprescribing when life expectancy is limited or harms outweigh benefits [^115vLsgj] [^113Zga8L]. For statin intolerance, consider ezetimibe or bempedoic acid; monitor for interactions and adjust dosing in hepatic or renal impairment [^115vLsgj] [^115wBqQf].

## Benefits of statin therapy in patients with comorbidities

### Cardiovascular benefits

- **Reduced ASCVD events**: Statins lower myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetes, CKD, and polyvascular disease [^115PBRJ8].

- **Secondary prevention**: High-intensity statins are first-line after ACS or revascularization, with robust event reduction [^115vtFC5] [^112n7kJa].

- **Primary prevention**: Moderate-intensity statins benefit adults 40–75 years with diabetes or elevated ASCVD risk, with greater absolute benefit at higher baseline risk [^111CzrrQ] [^1176EN33].

---

### Non-cardiovascular benefits

Non-cardiovascular benefits include **reduced liver-related events** — lower incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, decompensated cirrhosis, and liver-related mortality in MASLD — and **anti-inflammatory effects**, with potential reductions in inflammatory markers and possible benefits in autoimmune or inflammatory conditions [^114s52T2] [^111Lyaw6].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of statin therapy in patients with comorbidities

### Musculoskeletal effects

Musculoskeletal effects include **statin-associated muscle symptoms** — myalgias, weakness, and rare rhabdomyolysis — with higher risk in older adults, those with renal impairment, or on interacting drugs [^116NaGWq] [^115wBqQf]. Statin-associated necrotizing autoimmune myopathy is a rare but serious immune-mediated myopathy requiring immunosuppression [^116YM5PJ].

---

### Metabolic effects

Metabolic effects include a **small increase in new-onset type 2 diabetes**, particularly with high-intensity statins and in patients with prediabetes risk factors; monitor glucose and reinforce lifestyle [^117W8o15] [^115hPWnv].

---

### Hepatic and cognitive effects

Hepatic effects are uncommon and include mild, reversible transaminase elevations; rare clinically significant hepatotoxicity may occur [^112X4NuX] [^11486Fz4]. Cognitive effects are rare and generally neutral overall, though isolated reports suggest possible cognitive changes; the balance of evidence does not support routine concern [^114ZF7ct].

## Impact of specific comorbidities on statin therapy

| **Comorbidity** | **Impact on statin therapy** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Diabetes mellitus | - Strong benefit in primary and secondary prevention <br/> - Small diabetes risk | - Moderate- or high-intensity statin recommended <br/> - Monitor glucose [^111CzrrQ] [^115hPWnv] |
| Chronic kidney disease | - Benefit in non-dialysis CKD <br/> - Limited benefit in dialysis | - Adjust dose <br/> - Monitor renal function <br/> - Avoid in severe renal impairment [^113gLtyz] |
| Heart failure | - Benefit in ischemic HF <br/> - No benefit in non-ischemic HF | - Use in ischemic HF <br/> - Avoid routine use in non-ischemic HF [^11171dBJ] [^116cqcAK] |
| Liver disease (MASLD) | - Reduced liver events and mortality | - Statins are safe and beneficial in MASLD [^114s52T2] |
| Rheumatoid arthritis | - Potential dual benefit (lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory) | - Consider statins in RA with elevated CV risk [^111Lyaw6] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Shared decision-making**: Essential in older adults and those with multimorbidity to balance benefits, risks, and preferences [^115vLsgj] [^117C5V8q].

- **Deprescribing**: Consider stopping statins in patients with limited life expectancy, severe frailty, or unacceptable side effects [^113Zga8L] [^112zN96A].

- **Alternative therapies**: Ezetimibe or bempedoic acid for statin intolerance or inadequate LDL-C lowering [^115vLsgj] [^116cqcAK].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing risk-benefit balance

- **Age and frailty**: Older adults have higher adverse effect risk; tailor intensity and consider deprescribing [^115vLsgj] [^115128CK].

- **Polypharmacy**: Increases interaction risk; review medications and adjust statin choice/dose [^115wBqQf].

- **Life expectancy**: If shorter than time-to-benefit, consider deprescribing [^116BFpBU].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Baseline assessment**: Lipid panel, liver enzymes, renal function, glucose, and CK if indicated [^notfound].

- **Follow-up**: Reassess lipids, adherence, and adverse effects every 3–12 months [^115vLsgj].

- **Dose adjustments**: Modify based on tolerance, interactions, and organ function [^115wBqQf].

---

Statin therapy provides **substantial cardiovascular benefits** for patients with comorbidities, with the greatest absolute benefit in secondary prevention and high-risk primary prevention. Risks are generally manageable; use shared decision-making, monitor for adverse effects, and adjust therapy to comorbidities and patient preferences.

Importance

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, may be potentially preventable with statin therapy.

Objective

To systematically review benefits and harms of statins for prevention of CVD to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE (from 1946), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from 1991), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (from 2005) to June 2016.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials of statins vs placebo, fixed-dose vs titrated statins, and higher- vs lower-intensity statins in adults without prior cardiovascular events.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

One investigator abstracted data, a second checked data for accuracy, and 2 investigators independently assessed study quality using predefined criteria. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause mortality, CVD-related morbidity or mortality, and harms.

Results

Nineteen trials (n = 71 344 participants [range, 95–17 802]; mean age, 51–66 years) compared statins vs placebo or no statin. Statin therapy was associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.80 to 0.93]; I² = 0%; absolute risk difference [ARD], -0.40% [95% CI, -0.64% to -0.17%]), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.88]; I² = 54%; ARD, -0.43% [95% CI, -0.75% to -0.11%]), stroke (RR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.82]; I² = 0; ARD, -0.38% [95% CI, -0.53% to -0.23%]), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.71]; I² = 0%; ARD, -0.81% [95% CI, -1.19 to -0.43%]), and composite cardiovascular outcomes (RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.63 to 0.78]; I² = 36%; ARD, -1.39% [95% CI, -1.79 to -0.99%]). Relative benefits appeared consistent in demographic and clinical subgroups, including populations without marked hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level < 200 mg/dL); absolute benefits were higher in subgroups at higher baseline risk. Statins were not associated with increased risk of serious adverse events (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94 to 1.04]), myalgias (RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.16]), or liver-related harms (RR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.35]). In pooled analysis, statins were not associated with increased risk of diabetes (RR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.20]), although statistical heterogeneity was present (I² = 52%), and 1 trial found high-intensity statins associated with increased risk (RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.49]). No trial directly compared titrated vs fixed-dose statins, and there were no clear differences based on statin intensity.

Conclusions and Relevance

In adults at increased CVD risk but without prior CVD events, statin therapy was associated with reduced risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and CVD events, with greater absolute benefits in patients at greater baseline risk.

### Combination therapy with statins: who benefits? [^116KNohX]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Many lipid-lowering drugs improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. However, when therapies have been studied in addition to statins, it has been challenging to show an additional clinical benefit in terms of CV event reduction, although overall safety seems acceptable. This debate has been complicated by recent guidelines that emphasize treatment with high-potency statin monotherapy. Combination therapy allows more patients to successfully reach their ideal lipid targets. Further testing of novel therapies may introduce an era of potent low-density lipoprotein decrease without dependence on statins, but until then, they remain the mainstay of therapy.

### Statin therapy as primary prevention for persons with HIV: a synopsis of recommendations from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services antiretroviral treatment guidelines panel [^114wAz2R]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

REPRIEVE (Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV) showed benefits of pitavastatin as preventive therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in people with HIV (PWH). In February 2024, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Panel for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Adults and Adolescents with HIV (ARV Guidelines Panel) developed statin therapy recommendations for PWH. These recommendations were issued in collaboration with representatives from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA). This synopsis summarizes the development process, the recommendations, and how they supplement the AHA/ACC/multisociety cholesterol guidelines and outlines gaps in primary prevention of ASCVD for PWH.

Methods

The ARV Guidelines Panel convened a writing group of 10 members (6 members of the Panel with expertise in HIV-related comorbid conditions, biostatistics, and pharmacology and 4 consultants representing ACC, AHA, and HIVMA with cardiometabolic and HIV management expertise). The writing group reviewed REPRIEVE trial data, other studies evaluating the use of statins in PWH, and the AHA/ACC/multisociety cholesterol guidelines to devise recommendations. Recommendations were based on scientific evidence with a rating scheme developed since the 1998 inception of the ARV guidelines. Proposed recommendations were presented to the full ARV Guidelines Panel, rated via vote, and approved by the Panel's voting members. These recommendations were then endorsed by ACC, AHA, and HIVMA.

Recommendations

The ARV Guidelines Panel issued a strong recommendation for initiating statin therapy among PWH with a 10-year ASCVD risk score of 5% or higher, whose absolute benefit from statins in REPRIEVE was greatest. For patients with a 10-year ASCVD risk score below 5%, the Panel favored statins but recommended patient-clinician risk discussions considering additional HIV-related factors that can increase ASCVD risk.

ASCVD statin benefit groups — candidates for statin therapy are stratified by clinical ASCVD status, LDL–C level, diabetes, and estimated 10‑y ASCVD risk, with prevention anchored by heart‑healthy lifestyle and periodic risk reassessment. For clinical ASCVD, Age < 75 y leads to High‑intensity statin (Moderate‑intensity statin if not candidate for high‑intensity statin), whereas Age ≥ 75 y OR if not candidate for high‑intensity statin leads to Moderate‑intensity statin. Without clinical ASCVD, if LDL–C ≥ 190 mg/dL use High‑intensity statin (Moderate‑intensity statin if not candidate for high‑intensity statin). For Diabetes Type 1 or 2 Age 40‑75 y, if Estimated 10‑y ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% use High‑intensity statin; otherwise Moderate‑intensity statin. If no diabetes, Estimate 10‑y ASCVD Risk with Pooled Cohort Equations and, when ≥ 7.5%, estimated 10‑y ASCVD risk and age 40‑75 y, use Moderate‑to‑high intensity statin; if not, ASCVD prevention benefit of statin therapy may be less clear in other groups and, in selected individuals, consider additional factors, potential benefits and adverse effects, drug‑drug interactions, and patient preferences. Additionally, in individuals not receiving cholesterol‑lowering drug therapy, recalculate estimated 10‑y ASCVD risk every 4‑6 y in individuals aged 40‑75 y without clinical ASCVD or diabetes and with LDL–C 70‑189 mg/dL.

### Managing hypercholesterolemia in adults older than 75 years without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association and the American Geriatrics Society [^11563kkW]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

The risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease increases with advancing age. Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL)-cholesterol levels remain predictive of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular events among individuals older than 75 years. Risk prediction among older individuals is less certain because most current risk calculators lack specificity in those older than 75 years and do not adjust for co-morbidities, functional status, frailty, and cognition which significantly impact prognosis in this age group. Data on the benefits and risks of lowering LDL-cholesterol with statins in older patients without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are also limited since most primary prevention trials have included mostly younger patients. Available data suggest that statin therapy in older primary prevention patients may reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and that benefits from lipid-lowering with statins outweigh potential risks such as statin-associated muscle symptoms and incident type 2 diabetes mellitus. While some evidence suggests the possibility that statins may be associated with incident cognitive impairment in older adults, a preponderance of literature indicates neutral or even protective statin-related cognitive effects. Shared decision-making which is recommended for all patients when considering statin therapy is particularly important in older patients. Randomized clinical trial data evaluating the use of non-statin lipid-lowering therapy in older patients are sparse. Deprescribing of lipid-lowering agents may be appropriate for select patients older than 75 years with life-limiting diseases. Finally, a patient-centered approach should be taken when considering primary prevention strategies for older adults.

### Lipid-lowering therapy in patients 75 years and older: clinical priority or superfluous therapy? [^114dbk44]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular (CV)-related morbidity and mortality significantly increase with age. In the elderly, hypercholesterolemia with elevated total and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol is a significant predictor of incident and recurrent CV disease. Multiple lines of evidence have established the benefit of statin therapy to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of CV events as well as prevent progression of subclinical atherosclerotic disease. Elderly patients, particularly those older than 75 years, have not been well represented in randomized clinical trials evaluating lipid lowering therapy. The limited available data from clinical trials do support the benefit of statin therapy in the elderly population. Based upon these data, cholesterol treatment guidelines endorse statin therapy as the primary treatment of hypercholesterolemia in elderly patients, though caution is recommended given the greater number of co-morbid conditions and concern for poly-pharmacy common in the elderly. Additional research is needed to better establish the benefit of statin therapy in the elderly within the context of reducing CV risk, minimizing side effects, and improving overall quality of life.

### Clinical commentary: reaching new targets in monotherapy and combination therapy [^1151FWzG]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2008). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of death in the United States. There has, however, been a decline in the age-adjusted death rate for coronary heart disease. This decline may be due, in part, to more aggressive treatment guidelines for treating cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. The 2004 update to the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines have recommended lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals in high-risk patients. Based on the new targets for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, clinicians will need more efficacious lipid-lowering therapies and improved options for combination therapy. Statin and statin-based combinations have been the mainstays of therapy during the last several years, and as statin utilization increases in the United States, more high-risk patients become exposed to potential statin intolerance. This commentary reviews statin-sparing combinations and use of cholesterol-absorption inhibitors.

### Statins and primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention-what we know, where we need to Go, and… [^115keNEX]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

and 3 large cohort studies. 1, 2 The evidence review found that statin therapy use in patients for primary prevention was associated with reductions in all-cause mortality, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, revascularization, and the composite cardiovascular outcome. 1, 2 Insufficient data were available for older adults, especially individuals older than 75 years. Importantly, the evidence review did not find any significant harm associated with statin therapy, suggesting a significant overall net benefit in primary prevention in appropriate groups of individuals. 1, 2. For example, the 10-year hard ASCVD event rates in 3 trials of pure primary prevention showed benefits of statin therapy ranging from
5. 1% to 7. 6%.

4 Indeed, statin therapy shows efficacy at even lower 10-year ASCVD risk levels, and there is some indication that the relative benefits of statin therapy may be higher among individuals with lower 10-year ASCVD risk. 5 For most therapies, treating individuals with lower ASCVD risk comes at a price of treating a large number of individuals for a longer period of time. Presence of some of these risk factors may increase short-term or long-term risk of ASCVD. Including these risk factors in risk calculation may also allow for more personalized risk discussion and decision-making between the patient and the clinician, especially when 10-year risk estimates are in borderline or intermediate ranges. 8 This is also important because the 10-year ASCVD risk assessment estimates events on a 10-year time horizon. Most patients who initiate preventive therapies use those therapies for a much longer period of time.

It is important to note that although most RCTs of statin therapy by design only evaluated a first ASCVD event, preventive therapies also are associated with reduced risk of second and subsequent cardiovascular events. The disability associated with first and subsequent myocardial infarction or stroke is not fully captured in these RCTs, given their short follow-up, but is extremely important to patients. Fourth, clinicians should consider titrating the intensity of therapy to the risk of the individual. Therefore, patients who belong to high-risk primary prevention groups may derive further benefit from the use of high-intensity statin therapy. Disclaimer: The opinions expressed reflect those of the author and not necessarily those of the Department of Veterans Affairs or the US government.

B 3.10 Statin therapy may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in people at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes; in such individuals, glucose status should be monitored regularly and diabetes prevention approaches reinforced, and it is not recommended that statins be avoided or discontinued for this adverse effect. In the DPP, statin use was associated with greater diabetes risk (pooled hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI] for incident diabetes 1.36 [1.17–1.58]), while in trials of cardiovascular disease prevention, cardiovascular and mortality benefits of statin therapy exceed the risk of diabetes.

### Do statins reduce mortality in older people? Findings from a longitudinal study using primary care records [^111HNhR3]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study showed significant absolute and relative reductions in all-cause mortality associated with statins for primary and secondary prevention of CVD at all ages over 65 years, including those at age 75 or older, in routine clinical practice over 25 years. This supports the use of statins, where clinically indicated and after discussion of the potential risks and benefits with the patient, in those aged over 75 years.

NLA dyslipidemia management — older patients (Chart 6) states that primary prevention strategies in patients 65–79 years of age should be managed in accordance with the NLA Recommendations for the Patient-Centered Management of Dyslipidemia-Part 1, and that for patients age ≥ 65 to < 80 years of age with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, moderate or high intensity statin therapy should be considered after a careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio. For secondary prevention in patients ≥ 80 years of age, moderate intensity statin therapy should be considered based upon a provider-patient discussion of the risks and benefits of such therapy, consideration of drug-drug interactions, polypharmacy, concomitant medical conditions including frailty, cost considerations, and patient preference. Risk calculators such as the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Risk calculator or the ATP III Framingham Risk Calculator can be used in select older individuals with one additional risk factor to further assess risk, using the thresholds for high risk of ≥ 15% 10-year risk for a hard ASCVD event with the Pooled Cohort Equations, and ≥ 10% 10-year risk for a hard CHD event using the ATP III Framingham risk calculator; however, these risk calculators have several limitations for use in older patients and may result in overestimation of lower risk older individuals. Older, primary prevention patients who are statin-eligible should undergo a patient-centered discussion with their provider about the risks and benefits of statin therapy, and if unable to achieve atherogenic cholesterol goals after a minimum 3–6 month trial on lifestyle modification, the provider should discuss the pros and cons of drug therapy and, if feasible, prescribe moderate intensity statin therapy, particularly when risk exceeds the high risk threshold. CAC scoring may be useful to further assess risk in older patients for whom questions remain about whether to prescribe drug therapy. If statin intolerance is an issue, consideration should be given to alternate statin regimens or low dose statin combination therapy or non-statin monotherapy, with a goal of at least a 30% reduction in LDL-C.

### Primary prevention: do the very elderly require a different approach? [^1134rTrZ]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Recent cardiovascular prevention guidelines place a greater emphasis on randomized placebo-controlled trial data as the basis for recommendations. While such trial data are sparse for people over the age of 75 or 80 years, data demonstrate altered risk-benefit relationships in these older patients. Primary prevention strategy decisions should consider estimated life expectancy and overall function as well as cardiovascular event risks, magnitude and time to benefit or harm, potentially altered adverse effect profiles, and informed patient preferences. Data support treatment of systolic hypertension to reduce stroke, cardiovascular events, and dementia in older patients with at least a 2-year estimated lifespan with modifications in systolic blood pressure goals and a need for greater attention to non-cardiovascular side effects such as falls in the very old. Lowering of elevated cholesterol levels with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for primary prevention in people over the age of 75 years requires greater individual considerations, as benefits may not accrue for 3–5 years and there is the potential impact of adverse effects. There is a rationale for lipid-lowering treatment in the more highly functional older patient with cardiovascular (especially stroke) risk higher than side effect risks in the near term and with an estimated lifespan longer than the time to benefit. Aspirin has higher side effect risks and requires a longer time to achieve benefit. Trial data are lacking on exercise interventions, but multi-system benefits have been shown in older patients such that exercise should be part of a preventive regimen. Preventive therapy in the very old means considering not only medical issues of co-morbidities, polypharmacy, and altered risk-benefit relationship of medications but also adjusting goals and approaches across the older agespan in keeping with informed patient preferences.

Clinical recommendations quoted from the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline state that high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued as first-line therapy in women and men ≤ 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, unless contraindicated (Class I; Level of Evidence: A); in individuals with clinical ASCVD in whom high-intensity statin therapy would otherwise be used, when high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or when characteristics predisposing to statin-associated adverse effects are present, moderate-intensity statin should be used as the second option if tolerated (Class I; Level of Evidence: A); and in individuals with clinical ASCVD > 75 years of age, it is reasonable to evaluate the potential for ASCVD risk-reduction benefits and for adverse effects, drug-drug interactions and to consider patient preferences when initiating a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and it is reasonable to continue statin therapy in those who are tolerating it (Class IIa; Level of Evidence: A).

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1176EN33]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Risk–benefit gradient and patient discussion — The likelihood that a patient will benefit from statin use depends on their absolute risk of having a future CVD event, the higher a person's 10-year risk of a CVD event, the greater the chance of benefit from statin use, and thus the expected benefit of statin therapy for persons with a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater exceeds the expected benefit for persons with a 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10%; clinicians should discuss with patients the potential risk of having a CVD event and the expected benefits and harms of statin therapy.

### Treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in older adults calls for a patient-centred approach [^117Gq854]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Due to an increasing number of older adults with (risk factors for) cardiovascular disease (CVD), the sum of older adults eligible for lipid-lowering drugs will increase. This has risen questions about benefits and harms of lipid-lowering therapy in older adults with a varying number of (cardiovascular) comorbidities and functional status. The heterogeneity in physical and functional health increases with age, leading to a much wider variety in cardiovascular risk and life expectancy than in younger adults. We suggest treatment decisions on hypercholesterolaemia in adults aged ≥ 75 years should shift from a strictly 10-year cardiovascular risk-driven approach to a patient-centred and lifetime benefit-based approach. With this, estimated 10-year risk of CVD should be placed into the perspective of life expectancy. Moreover, frailty and safety concerns must be taken into account for a risk-benefit discussion between clinician and patient. Based on the Dutch addendum 'Cardiovascular Risk Management in (frail) older adults', our approach offers more detailed information on when not to initiate or deprescribe therapy than standard guidelines. Instead of using traditional risk estimating tools which tend to overestimate risk of CVD in older adults, use a competing risk adjusted, older adults-specific risk score (available at https://u-prevent.com). By filling in a patient's (cardiovascular) health profile (eg, cholesterol, renal function), the tool estimates risk of CVD and models the effect of medication in terms of absolute risk reduction for an individual patient. Using this tool can guide doctors and patients in making shared decisions on initiating, continuing or deprescribing lipid-lowering therapy.

### Statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: cons [^116wHW7Y]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

While recent decades have seen substantial reductions in cardiovascular mortality, heart disease remains the number one cause of death both in the United States and globally. This has led many to advocate for prescribing statins even more widely, including to patients with low risk of cardiovascular disease, based on the hypothesis that any reduction in lipid levels will eventually translate to a reduction in the development of atherosclerosis and thus to subsequent mortality. However, empirical evidence to date has not substantiated the hoped for benefits of this strategy. When healthy patients without cardiovascular disease are prescribed statins they do not live longer, and they have only a marginal reduction in the risk of ischemic events. Furthermore, statins cause numerous side effects which substantially limit their net benefit. These tradeoffs are even more lopsided in elderly patients treated for primary prevention, in whom statin therapy does not lead to a reduction in mortality or ischemic events and has the potential for significant harms. Strategies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease should therefore avoid a focus on cholesterol levels and subsequent pharmacological therapy and should instead redouble efforts to improve the lifestyle factors that are far more consequential to the development of cardiovascular disease and overall good health.

### Aspirin and statin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in older adults [^1137GPof]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

The value of primary preventative therapies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in older adults (age ≥ 75 years) is less certain than in younger patients. There is a lack of quality evidence in older adults due to underenrolment in pivotal trials. While aspirin is no longer recommended for routine use in primary prevention of CVD in older adults, statins may be efficacious. However, it is unclear which patient subgroups may benefit most, and guidelines differ between expert panels. Three relevant geriatric conditions (cognitive impairment, functional impairment and polypharmacy) may influence therapeutic decision making; for example, baseline frailty may affect statin efficacy, and some have advocated for deprescription in this scenario. Evidence regarding statins and incident functional decline are mixed, and vigilance for adverse effects is important, especially in the setting of polypharmacy. However, aspirin has not been shown to affect incident cognitive or functional decline, and its lack of efficacy extends to patients with baseline cognitive impairment or frailty. Ultimately, the utility of primary preventative therapies for CVD in older adults depends on potential lifetime benefit. Rather than basing treatment decisions on absolute risk alone, consideration of comorbidities, polypharmacy and life expectancy should play a significant role in decision making. Coronary calcium score and new tools for risk stratification validated in older adults that account for the competing risk of death may aid in evaluating potential benefits. Given the complexity of therapeutic decisions in this context, shared decision making provides an important framework.

### Statinopause [^115kh8SZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Statins are the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention. The 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines represent a fundamental shift in how statins will be prescribed. The new guidelines recommend statins for nearly all older patients up to age 75 years, including healthy adults with low normal lipid levels and no atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors other than age. Under the 2013 guidelines, age becomes a main determinant for initiating statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults. Specifically, according to the new guidelines, white males aged 63–75, white females aged 71–75, African American males aged 66–75, and African American females aged 70–75 with optimal risk factors would be recommended for statin treatment for primary prevention. Based on the new guidelines, one could term these older adults as having "statin deficiency", a condition warranting statin treatment. We call this putative condition of age-related statin deficiency "statinopause". After careful examination of the trial evidence, we find very little support for the new recommendations for primary prevention. The lack of evidence underscores the need for clinical trials to determine the risks and benefits of statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115FFUSv]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) rationale — primary prevention statins in adults with risk factors: In adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (eg, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking), the USPSTF finds convincing evidence of benefit and concludes with moderate certainty that net benefit is at least moderate when the estimated 10-year CVD event risk is 10% or greater and at least small when risk is 7.5% to less than 10%. The USPSTF states that harms in adults 40 to 75 years are at most small and that evidence is inadequate for benefits and harms in adults 76 years or older; for the small-benefit group, it states the decision to initiate statin therapy should depend on individual patient preference. The USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms for adults 76 years or older with no history of CVD.

### Safety and efficacy of statin therapy [^116NaGWq]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines on blood cholesterol management were a major shift in the delineation of the main patient groups that could benefit from statin therapy and emphasized the use of higher-intensity statin therapies. In 2016, an expert consensus panel from the ACC recommended the use of nonstatin therapies (ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors) in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy in individuals whose LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol levels remained above certain thresholds after statin treatment. Given the substantial benefits of statin therapies in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, their long-term safety has become a concern. The potential harmful effects of statin therapy on muscle and liver have been known for some time, but new concerns have emerged regarding the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus, cognitive impairment and haemorrhagic stroke associated with the use of statins and the risks of achieving very low levels of LDL cholesterol. The increased media attention on the adverse events associated with statins has unfortunately led to statin therapy discontinuation, nonadherence to therapy or concerns about initiating statin therapy. In this Review, we explore the safety of statin therapy in light of the latest evidence and provide clinicians with reassurance about the safety of statins. Overwhelming evidence suggests that the benefits of statin therapy far outweigh any real or perceived risks.

### Managing hypercholesterolemia in adults older than 75 years without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association and the American Geriatrics Society [^114BkR9o]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

The risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease increases with advancing age. Elevated LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol levels remain predictive of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular events among individuals older than 75years. Risk prediction among older individuals is less certain because most current risk calculators lack specificity in those older than 75years and do not adjust for co-morbidities, functional status, frailty, and cognition which significantly impact prognosis in this age group. Data on the benefits and risks of lowering LDL-cholesterol with statins in older patients without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are also limited since most primary prevention trials have included mostly younger patients. Available data suggest that statin therapy in older primary prevention patients may reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and that benefits from lipid-lowering with statins outweigh potential risks such as statin-associated muscle symptoms and incident Type 2 diabetes mellitus. While some evidence suggests the possibility that statins may be associated with incident cognitive impairment in older adults, a preponderance of literature indicates neutral or even protective statin-related cognitive effects. Shared decision-making which is recommended for all patients when considering statin therapy is particularly important in older patients. Randomized clinical trial data evaluating the use of non-statin lipid-lowering therapy in older patients are sparse. Deprescribing of lipid-lowering agents may be appropriate for select patients older than 75years with life-limiting diseases. Finally, a patient-centered approach should be taken when considering primary prevention strategies for older adults.

ABSTRACT

The risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease increases with advancing age. Elevated LDL‐cholesterol and non‐HDL‐cholesterol levels remain predictive of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular events among individuals older than 75 years. Risk prediction among older individuals is less certain because most current risk calculators lack specificity in those older than 75 years and do not adjust for co‐morbidities, functional status, frailty, and cognition which significantly impact prognosis in this age group. Data on the benefits and risks of lowering LDL‐cholesterol with statins in older patients without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are also limited since most primary prevention trials have included mostly younger patients. Available data suggest that statin therapy in older primary prevention patients may reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and that benefits from lipid‐lowering with statins outweigh potential risks such as statin‐associated muscle symptoms and incident Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

QUESTION 5
For the population of adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD, how do we assess the expected net benefit of statin therapy?

Synopsis

Comorbidity burden and life expectancy vary widely among older adults of the same age. There is thus considerable variability in the likelihood that an older adult will benefit from preventive and therapeutic interventions. Any benefit from preventive measures may be attenuated by competing health risks from multiple chronic conditions, and the risk of adverse outcomes may be magnified. Lifetables and validated mortality indexes which consider co‐morbidities are available to allow clinicians to refine their patient's prognosis. Furthermore, as discussed under Question 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, competing risk‐adjusted models can help assess ASCVD risk and potential benefit.

Frailty, a syndrome of biologic aging and vulnerability, ranges in prevalence from 7% in community‐dwelling older adults to over 50% in institutionalized patients. The prevalence of functional limitation is 66% in adults aged 65 years and older (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health, United States, 2020‐2021: Functional Limitation. Updated January 16, 2024. Accessed February 21, 2024). In the U.S. in 2022, an estimated 37.2% of people aged 75–84 years and 35.7% of people aged 85 years and older have Alzheimer's dementia and other dementias. Mild cognitive impairment affects 12‐18% of people aged 60 and older in the United States. Frailty, cognition and functional impairment should be considered in person‐centered decision making about preventive measures. Numerous tools are available to assess these geriatric conditions at the bedside, and decision aids can be helpful in assessing patient preferences.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Older adults — deprescribing and coronary artery calcium (CAC)–guided decisions include the following statements. In some patients, the aggregate risks associated with statins may exceed their likely benefits, and for older adults with CAC scores of zero, the likelihood of benefits from statin therapy does not outweigh the risks. Deprescribing statins becomes an important option to be considered, and one randomized trial and several nonrandomized studies show feasibility and utility of deprescribing in older adults with significant management complexity. Multiple studies indicate the utility of CAC measurement in identifying the absence of atherosclerotic pathophysiology in older adults, and if CAC score is zero, the patient may be reclassified to a lower-risk status to avoid statin therapy. Limiting statin therapy to those with CAC scores greater than zero, combined with clinical judgment and patient preference, could provide a valuable awareness with which to inform shared decision-making.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of zero — examples of candidates who might benefit from knowing their CAC score is zero and related caveats are provided: Patients reluctant to initiate statin who wish to understand their risk and potential for benefit more precisely; patients concerned about need to reinstitute statin therapy after discontinuation for statin-associated symptoms; older patients (men 55–80 y of age; women 60–80 y of age) with low burden of risk factors who question whether they would benefit from statin therapy; and middle-aged adults (45–55 y of age) with PCE-calculated 10-year risk for ASCVD 5% to < 7.5%, with factors that increase their ASCVD risk, although they are in a borderline risk group. Caveats state that if a coronary artery calcium score of zero is obtained at intermediate risk and a risk decision is uncertain, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions are present and to reassess the coronary artery calcium score in 5 to 10 years, and that CAC testing should be performed in facilities with current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation possible.

QUESTION 7
In adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD, what are the best practices for statin deprescribing?

Synopsis

Deprescribing medications is an important part of the prescribing continuum and an essential component of high‐quality care for older adults with multiple comorbidities, geriatric syndromes and polypharmacy who are more susceptible to medication‐related harms. Benefits of deprescribing statins (e.g. taking fewer medications, avoiding interactions with other medications such as antibiotics or antifungal agents that are metabolized through the same pathway as the statin, avoiding adverse effects in general) must be balanced against the potential for harm, such as an increase in ASCVD events after statin discontinuation. General principles of deprescribing include viewing deprescribing as a routine part of care designed to improve patient well‐being (rather than withdrawal of appropriate care) and shared decision‐making with the patient/caregiver. Three large cohort studies provide evidence for clinicians and patients regarding the risks and benefits of statin discontinuation on cardiovascular events in older adults without a history of cardiovascular disease who are taking statins (Table 6). One small prospective trial found benefits of deprescribing among older adults near the end of life.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

QUESTION 4
For the population of adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD, how should we weigh potential safety concerns versus benefits of statin therapy?

Synopsis

Adults older than 75 years are intrinsically more susceptible to iatrogenic risks from medications amidst age‐related changes in metabolism, body composition, mitochondrial energetics, and cognition. Sarcopenia, frailty, and insulin resistance are common, along with changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Therefore, many hypothesize that older adults may be more susceptible to statin‐associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and cognitive decline if they use statins.

Meta‐analyses of RCTs and recent observational data from patient registries do not indicate any increase in the risk of SAMS among those above age 75 compared to younger individuals. Multiple meta‐analyses suggest that statin therapy leads to a small increase in risk of new onset T2DM. It is estimated that statin therapy is associated with one additional case of T2DM per 255 patients taking statins for 4 years, largely confined to patients with risk factors for T2DM including advanced age. Risk of new onset T2DM is greater with high‐intensity statin regimens than with the moderate‐intensity statins typically used in primary prevention among older adults. The increase in risk of new onset T2DM associated with statin therapy is outweighed by robust reductions in major cardiovascular events among individuals with T2DM.

Analyses of the impact of statin therapy on cognition have significant methodological limitations. The diagnosis of dementia or cognitive change as an endpoint is rarely measured systematically, and confounders like education level and intelligence are rarely considered. Many studies do not adequately measure longitudinal changes in cognition and types of dementia are generally not distinguished. Few studies use in vivo brain imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis or serological biomarkers. While there has been some literature suggesting the possibility that statins may be associated with incident cognitive impairment in older adults, a preponderance of literature indicates neutral or even protective statin‐related cognitive effects.

### Cardiometabolic comorbidities in cancer Survivors: state-of-the-art review [^117Vq2ST]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of dyslipidemia in patients receiving active cancer therapy

Regarding tumor progression in patients with active cancer, it is well established that cholesterol is concentrated in cancerous tissue, and increased dietary cholesterol is associated with increased cancer progression. Higher dietary cholesterol intake is associated with increased tumor progression across many cancers; similarly, cholesterol-lowering diets are associated with a decreased cancer risk. As noted in the recommendations by the ACC/AHA Task Force, lifestyle modification through diet and exercise are the first-line recommendations to avoid or manage dyslipidemia.

The use of statins for patients on active cancer therapy remains less clear. Some early observational studies demonstrated an association between lower or declining cholesterol levels and an increased risk of cancer-specific mortality. This literature base even began to call into question treatment guidelines for cholesterol in the 1990s. Studies have long demonstrated that cholesterol-lowering diets, a key recommended lifestyle modification strategy for dyslipidemia management, do not increase cancer risk or cancer-specific mortality. More recently, evidence on the impact of statins on cancer-specific mortality continues to offer mixed conclusions. While most of the meta-analytic evidence suggests statins have no effect on cancer-specific mortality, large studies suggest small effects of statins reducing cancer-specific mortality in various populations. In contrast to studies in the general population, in which overall and CVD-specific mortality are the primary outcomes, among cancer populations, CVD-specific mortality is rarely examined. Statin therapy has several benefits for patients on active cancer therapy. Statins may impact cancer-specific mortality; however, the primary goal for prescribing statins among cancer survivors is the reduction of CVD mortality. Prevailing evidence suggests that statin use is not associated with decreased cancer-specific mortality. In a meta-analysis of 26 separate randomized controlled trials comprising almost 87,000 patients, 6,662 incidences of cancer, and 2,407 cancer-related deaths, statin use was unrelated to cancer-specific mortality, with point estimate odds ratios very close to 1 on both accounts. In a more recent meta-analysis, 27 separate trials comprising 175,000 patients, 10,431 incidences of cancer, and 3,651 cancer-related deaths, both the presence and intensity of statin use was again unrelated to cancer incidence or cancer-specific mortality. These meta-analyses alleviate some concerns of the PROSPER (PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) and CARE (Cholesterol and Recurrent Events) statin trials, which found increased incidence of gastrointestinal cancer and breast cancer among statin users, respectively. Any evidence suggesting an association between statin use and cancer incidence or cancer-specific mortality should be interpreted cautiously. Nevertheless, this unclear and sometimes conflicting evidence on statins and their association with cancer-related outcomes has caused confusion among patients and their providers regarding statin adherence. The role of statins in reducing CVD-mortality is clear. Thus, among cancer survivors treated with curative intent, the reduction of CVD risk is essential.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111CzrrQ]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

### Vascular comorbidity in rheumatoid arthritis: potential mechanisms and solutions [^111Lyaw6]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarise recent evidence for elevated risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and explore explanatory mechanisms and modalities that may lessen such risk.

Recent Findings

Evidence for elevated CHD risk in RA is convincing. On current estimates, individuals who have had RA for several years have around a twofold higher risk for CHD compared with non-RA persons after taking account of most traditional risk factors. Such excess risk appears to be driven by systemic inflammation both directly via its deleterious effects on blood vessels (endothelial dysfunction inclusive of myocardial microvascular abnormalities) and indirectly by its accentuation of multiple risk pathways including lipid abnormalities. Established therapies that lessen RA disease activity and systemic inflammation will likely lessen CHD risk, although there remains considerable scope for more robust studies employing better measures of vascular disease (e.g., carotid intima-media thickening). Other emerging evidence indicates statins may have dual effects in RA, with a modest disease-modifying effect (requiring confirmation) and significant lipid-lowering action. The latter finding is particularly important because extrapolation of data from all statin endpoint trials suggests that the extent of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction may account for most statin clinical benefit.

Summary

Systemic inflammation is the major driver for excess vascular comorbidity in RA. Controlling systemic inflammation should lessen vascular risk but complete, long-term suppression of articular inflammation is rarely achieved. Thus, the use of conventional CHD risk reduction strategies, in particular statins, should be considered in patients with RA with prevalent CHD or at elevated risk.

### Statin use in patients with non-HMGCR idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: a retrospective study [^116YM5PJ]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are a group of autoinflammatory muscle diseases characterized by debilitating muscle weakness and increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with IIM have a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease and dyslipidemia compared to the general population. 1, 2, 3 HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are the first line pharmacologic intervention for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 4, 5 Studies have consistently demonstrated the efficacy of statins on LDL cholesterol (LDL‐C) and reducing the risk of ischemic heart disease, stroke and CVD associated mortality. 6, 7, 8 Data also suggests potential anti‐inflammatory benefits of statins in autoimmune diseases. 9

Muscle adverse effects (AEs) including muscle pain, weakness and cramps are reported in 5% to 20% of patients on statins, and the majority of these resolve within weeks to months after drug cessation. 10, 11 Rhabdomyolysis occurs with an incidence of approximately 0.4 per 10 000 patient years 12 and has been reported mostly in patients with pre‐existing comorbid conditions or on multiple medications. 13 Recently, a unique entity of statin induced immune mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) has been described with autoantibodies targeting the HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR) protein. 14, 15

Patients with underlying muscle disease including muscular dystrophies or metabolic myopathies are frequently hesitant to comply with statin therapy due to the widely publicized muscular AEs and small studies suggesting possible increased risk in these populations. 16, 17 Such reports raise the concern of whether statins can be used safely for prevention of CV disease in these patients. To date, there is limited data on the safety and tolerability of statin use in IIM patients and further evaluation is warranted. Here we describe our experience of statin use in a longitudinal cohort of patients with IIM from a single tertiary academic center.

### Reducing residual risk for patients on statin therapy: the potential role of combination therapy [^1145KDRr]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Cholesterol-lowering therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, has been established as an effective method of reducing death and myocardial infarction among patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, a significant number of patients receiving statin therapy continue to have high residual risk. An important clinical challenge exists in reducing residual CAD risk with optimal therapies without increasing adverse effects. Combination therapy appears most appropriate for patients with a high rate of events of residual risk despite optimal statin therapy. This article discusses the role of combination therapy in managing CAD and in achieving optional targets in high-risk patient populations.

### Safety of urate-lowering therapies: managing the risks to gain the benefits [^117TDXoV]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a metabolic disorder of purine metabolism and uric acid elimination. Over time, acute gout can develop into a chronic, disabling arthropathy, often associated with multiple comorbidities. Gout patients have often been undertreated, partly because of the clinician's perceived risks of a therapy outweighing its potential benefits. The approval of new therapies to treat hyperuricemia in gout has led to a new understanding of gout management and medication safety regarding new and old therapies. This review focuses on potential safety issues of currently available urate-lowering therapies and outlines strategies to minimize risks so their benefits can be reached.

### NLA scientific statement on statin intolerance: a new definition and key considerations for ASCVD risk reduction in the statin intolerant patient [^116qF8w9]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Key points for statin intolerance management state that an acceptable statin treatment regimen can be identified for most patients with statin intolerance which may require a different dose, statin, or dosing schedule. Non-statin therapy may be required for patients who cannot reach therapeutic objectives with lifestyle and maximal tolerated statin therapy, and clinicians should favor non-statin therapies with data from outcome trials showing a reduction in adverse cardiovascular events. The evidence base for non-statin interventions for dyslipidemia management to lower adverse cardiovascular event risk is not as well-developed as that for statin therapy but has been growing in recent years and is bolstered by results from observational data, particularly Mendelian randomization studies, supporting that adverse cardiovascular event risk is lowered by reduction of the plasma atherogenic lipoprotein level with benefit proportional to both the degree of reduction and the length of time that a lower level is maintained. Ongoing and planned randomized controlled trials are expected to provide additional information regarding the risks and potential benefits of non-statin therapies for reducing adverse cardiovascular event risk.

### Recommendations for (discontinuation of) statin treatment in older adults: review of guidelines [^115128CK]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Up to the age of approximately 75 years, the effectiveness of cardiovascular preventive medication is undisputed and, together with lifestyle interventions, significantly reduces the impact of cardiovascular disease. 1, 2, 3 Also, for vital adults aged 75 to 85 years, there is evidence that the benefits of statins generally outweigh the risks, especially in secondary prevention. 4, 5 However, when confronted with declining health status and the development of complex health problems, the use of preventive medications with long‐term effects might become of questionable benefit; on the one hand, treatment priorities shift and life expectancy shortens, while on the other hand, the risks of adverse effects increase due to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes, polypharmacy, and multimorbidity, 6, 7, 8, 9 especially in old age. These risks can be influenced positively by decreasing medication prescriptions. In addition, high‐quality evidence is not yet available for either primary or secondary statin‐based prevention in people aged 85 years and older or in those with complex health problems (as they are currently excluded from trials). 10 In a recent meta‐analysis of the efficacy and safety of statins for primary cardiovascular disease prevention in older adults, which included data from 28 trials, only 8% of all patients were aged older than 75 years at enrollment. 5 As statins are one of the most commonly used drugs in the older population, with a prevalence ranging between 18% and 45%, 11, 12 with concerns about the benefits, they have been identified as possible candidates for deprescribing (the process of tapering or stopping inappropriate medication) by both clinicians and patients. 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 In a modified Delphi approach, physicians, pharmacists, and nurses prioritized statins in the top three of a list of medication classes where evidence‐based deprescribing guidelines would be of benefit to clinicians because of concerns about benefit given the lack of older patients in trials, the lack of clarity around ongoing indication and when they can be stopped, as well as an emerging recognition of adverse effects and overtreatment of low‐risk patients. 14

7.1 pharmacotherapy within a multiple speciality team

In the past, pharmacotherapy for treating MASH was limited, but today many drug classes are being studied, and some may soon become standard of care (Table 3). The expansion of pharmacotherapy for MASH will require appropriate non‐invasive monitoring, which will further underscore the need to engage a multiple‐speciality team.

TABLE 3
Summary of phase 3 and approved drugs for the treatment of MASLD and MASH.

Importantly, holistic disease management requires a full understanding of the pharmacology of drugs, as they can impact both cardiovascular and liver disease, including their possible mixed benefits and synergistic effects in patients. Patients with MASLD can exhibit altered drug metabolism which may lead to altered pharmacologic efficacy or adverse drug reactions; therefore, prescription of drugs to treat comorbidities requires careful consideration of potential hepatotoxicity.

Education about the appropriateness of pharmacological management strategies for certain patients with MASLD is required. Therapies that target comorbidities such as obesity and T2D could impact MASLD morbidity and mortality, and also improve cardiovascular health. In addition, as CVD is the leading cause of mortality in MASLD patients, there is a need to prioritise therapies that provide additional cardiovascular benefits. A recent study found that the use of statins in patients with MASLD significantly reduces the incidence and risk of liver‐related events, as well as HCC, decompensated liver cirrhosis, and mortality (all‐cause, CVD‐related, and liver‐related).PCPs and hepatologists need to recognise the interplay between CVD and MASLD, and look for therapeutic strategies that can reduce the burden of both diseases.

### Refining statin prescribing in lower-risk individuals: informing risk / benefit decisions [^1122Jvkr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, as well as those from the Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense and the Joint British Societies all recommended treating more people with statins than previous guidelines. In each guideline, the decision-making process began with an assessment of overall cardiovascular risk. Each group proposed updated treatment thresholds, and all of them lowered the threshold compared with earlier guidelines. Since release of these new guidelines in 2013 and 2014, additional evidence has emerged to suggest a rationale for extending statin consideration to an even larger proportion of asymptomatic adults-even those with a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk below 7.5%. This review discusses new findings since 2013 and proposes strategies emanating from the current guidelines to help clinicians and patients make more informed decisions about long-term statin use, especially pertinent to lower-risk patients.

### Statins for all? [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

### Treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in older adults calls for a patient-centred approach [^115E6hKD]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Making treatment decisions: from a risk-based to a benefit-based approach

Treatment decisions on hypercholesterolaemia in adults aged ≥ 75 years call for shift from a strictly 10-year cardiovascular risk-driven approach to a patient-centred and lifetime benefit-based approach in which shared decision-making is key. With the latter, estimated 10-year risk of CVD is also taking into consideration, but only after putting this into the perspective of life expectancy and by including potential negative effects of lipid-lowering therapy. To avoid overestimating an individual patient's 10-year risk of CVD with traditional (older adults-specific) risk tools, we propose to use a competing risk adjusted, older adults-specific risk score. Contrary to traditional risk tools, this tool has been validated in studies that also included older patients and patients with several comorbidities. The tool is available free of charge on, and models the effect of medication changes in terms of 10-year absolute risk reduction (or number needed to treat). Together with the patient, risk is estimated after filling in easily available clinical parameters, such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, renal function and number of drugs used. The clear graphics (figure 4, online supplementary appendix) can help facilitate a physician–patient discussion on whether the potential lifetime benefits versus the impact potential adverse effects are sufficient to validate therapy for the years left to live. This tool is less suitable in very frail patients, those with multimorbidity or those with a limited life expectancy, as these patients were not included in the (cohort) studies the tool algorithm is based on. Randomised studies on deprescribing lipid-lowering therapy in older adults are scarce, and there is no need to deprescribe therapy solely because of chronological age. However, we believe that there are two reasons to consider deprescribing lipid-lowering therapy: limited life expectancy (< 1–2 years) and adverse effects overshadowing preventive treatment benefits. In patients with a limited lifespan, lifetime risk of CVD has fallen to such a degree that it is unlikely treatment will prevent (new) cardiovascular events, even in patients at (very) high baseline risk of CVD. In these patients, quality of life, functional status and doing no harm take priority over preventing (fatal) CVD. Although observational studies observed increased risk of cardiovascular events after deprescribing statins in older patients, randomised deprescribing trials observed no increase in mortality after deprescribing statins, and a potential to improve quality of life.

Clinical Question

Do statins reduce rates of cardiovascular events when used for primary prevention?

### Is aggressive lipid-lowering effective and safe in the older adult? [^114JC223]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

With improvements in diet and health care over the last several decades, the elderly have become the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Along with this progress, however, has come increasing morbidity, much of which is attributable to cardiovascular disease, and which is burdensome both to patients and to the health-care system. New medications, including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have the potential to prevent or delay the progression of disease and vascular events. Large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials continue to show that elderly patients benefit from statin therapy and that aggressive therapy is generally very safe in this population; however, statins remain under-used in older individuals. This paper reviews the benefits of statin therapy in the elderly and discusses the reality versus the perception of risk, selection of appropriate patients, and ways in which any risks that may exist can be minimized further.

### Should statin therapy be allocated on the basis of global risk or on the basis of randomized trial evidence? [^115jiJJ7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Current clinical guidelines recommend the use of a global risk assessment tool, such as those pioneered by the Framingham Heart Study, to determine eligibility for statin therapy in patients with absolute risk levels greater than a certain threshold. In support of this approach, several randomized trials have reported that patients with high absolute risk clearly benefit from statin therapy. Therefore, the guideline recommendations would seem intuitive and effective, albeit on the core assumption that the mortality and morbidity benefits associated with statin therapy would be greatest in those with high predicted absolute risk. However, if this assumption is incorrect, using predicted absolute risk to guide statin therapy could easily result in underuse in some groups and overuse in others. Herein, the authors question the utility of global risk assessment strategies based on the Framingham risk score for guiding statin therapy in light of current data that have become available from more recent and robust prospective randomized clinical trials since the publication of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Moreover, the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines do not support treatment of some patients who may benefit from statin therapy. In conclusion, the authors propose an alternative approach for incorporating more recent randomized trial data into future statin allocation algorithms and treatment guidelines.

Recommendation‐specific supportive text

Clinical decision making and communication for deprescribing statins can be complex regardless of the patient's medical conditions and frailty. It is prudent for clinicians to have thoughtful conversations with their patients and their caregivers regarding the potential benefits and risks of statin continuation and deprescribing in older age. Some clinicians may need to acknowledge and overcome their own uncertainty about stopping statins if their patients are interested in discontinuation. A study of 180 acutely ill Australian older adults found that 95% were willing to stop their statin, predominantly over concerns for adverse effects. When discussing statin discontinuation through shared decision‐making, clinicians may also need to alter their communication about deprescribing based on their patient's preferences. A survey of 90 Danish general practitioners identified that the most important topic clinicians wanted to discuss related to stopping statins was goals of therapy, while adverse effects were considered less important. However, a U.S. study of 835 older adults found that most patients preferred phrasing focused on the risk of adverse effects when discussing deprescribing a statin. Although existing data suggest the risk of statin‐related adverse effects is low, older adults with frailty, severe functional or cognitive impairment, or polypharmacy have not been well‐represented in studies that assessed adverse effects. Adverse effects, even mild ones, may play a greater role in driving decisions about statin therapy for such patients, and observational data suggest that nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and dizziness are associated with the total number of medications as well as with individual medications. Another small qualitative study of clinicians, caregivers and older adults with dementia found that patients and caregivers preferred clinicians to explain that aging and comorbid conditions may shift the balance of benefits and risks of medications such as statins. Examples of such phrasing are "Our bodies change over time and certain medicines may no longer be needed" and "These medications take years to have an effect and I think that we should focus on what can help you right now".
Three observational cohort studies of older adults taking statins for primary prevention in France, Denmark and Italy (aggregate N > 200,000 individuals) reported an increased risk of cardiovascular events over a subsequent 2–5 year period among patients who stopped their statin, compared to patients who continued (Table 6). Adjusted HRs suggested an approximately 30% increase in admissions for ASCVD events during follow‐up among those who discontinued statins. The reasons for statin discontinuation were unknown. While investigators adjusted for baseline characteristics or performed propensity‐matching prior to data analysis, results may in part reflect residual unmeasured or unknown confounding. It is also unknown whether these estimates translate to the U.S. population. Nevertheless, these studies provide risk estimates for statin discontinuation that can be incorporated into shared decision‐making conversations.
Deprescribing may provide benefits for patients near the end of their life. Kutner et al. evaluated 60‐day survival after statin deprescribing in an unblinded randomized, parallel group non‐inferiority trial of 381 individuals with life‐limiting illness and an estimated survival of < 1 year; 36% of patients were enrolled in hospice. There were no differences in 60‐day survival or cardiovascular events between the 2 groups. Quality of life was improved and medication cost (using 2012 retail pricing) lowered among those who discontinued their statin. These results indicate that it may be reasonable to discontinue statin therapy in patients with limited life expectancy due to co‐morbid conditions. Further research would be helpful to guide deprescribing discussions in this population.

Recommendation‐specifc supportive text

There is substantial variability in life expectancy among older adults of the same age, e.g. a healthy 85‐year‐old woman is expected to live an additional 10 years (and would be likely to benefit from primary prevention) while a frail, multimorbid 85‐year‐old woman may have less than 2 years remaining life expectancy and may not stand to benefit. Clinicians can consider morbidity burden, functional status and frailty to estimate life expectancy. If an individual's life expectancy is greater than the time to benefit for a given preventive intervention, the intervention may help and should generally be recommended. If the life expectancy is shorter than the time to benefit, the intervention is more likely to harm and generally should not be recommended. If the life expectancy is approximately equal to the time to benefit, patient preferences should be the guiding factor in decision making. An online calculator, ePrognosis, can help clinicians incorporate evidence‐based information about life expectancy for older adults into decisions about preventive therapies such as statins. For example, for an individual with advanced dementia, the time to benefit of primary prevention statin therapy may exceed life expectancy and the goals of therapy may shift over time from preventing illness and prolonging life to reducing the burden of treatment and maintaining quality of life.
For patients with frailty, severe functional impairment or dementia, incorporating patient preferences in decisions about statin therapy is essential for patient‐centered care. These conditions are associated with physical and functional decline, increased mortality risk, and increased risk of harm from polypharmacy. Yet, individuals with frailty, functional impairment and dementia should not automatically be denied statin therapy. Although few studies have included such patients, a retrospective cohort study of 326,981 Veterans aged 75 years and older without ASCVD at baseline found that new statin use was significantly associated with a lower risk of all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality, even at advanced ages (e.g. aged > 90 years) and in those with dementia. This association was evident within 2 years and remained significant in those with frailty. However, for some patients with frailty, severe functional impairment or dementia, goals of therapy may shift from preventing illness and prolonging life to reducing the burden of treatment and maintaining quality of life. Practical tools to assess functional status, frailty and cognition are listed in Table 5. The presence of any of these syndromes may prompt elicitation of patient values and preferences for prevention and medication use (see Question 6, Section 2).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in… [^114K8STJ]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Thus, the expected benefit of statin therapy for persons with a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater exceeds the expected benefit for persons with a 10-year CVD risk of 7. 5% to less than 10%. Clinicians should discuss with patients the potential risk of having a CVD event and the expected benefits and harms of statin use. Evidence on the potential harms of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events specifically in adults 76 years or older is limited. In several trials, primary outcome was reported as a composite of CVD events, with the exact components of this end point varying across trials. In a pooled analysis of 15 trials, statin therapy was also associated with a decreased risk of composite cardiovascular outcomes. 13, 31.]) among persons taking a statin compared with placebo.

### Treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in older adults calls for a patient-centred approach [^114HS4zs]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In the older population, a wider distribution of cardiovascular risk exists compared with younger adults due to heterogeneity in physical and functional health. Treatment decisions on hypercholesterolaemia in adults aged ≥ 75 years should call for shift from a strictly 10-year cardiovascular risk-driven approach to a patient-centred and lifetime benefit-based approach by putting estimated 10-year risk of CVD into the perspective of remaining life expectancy, patients preferences, frailty and potential adverse effects of treatment. When estimating 10-year risk of CVD, use a competing risk adjusted, older adults-specific risk score instead of traditional risk tools as the latter tend to overestimate risk of CVD. Evidence on the benefits versus harms of lipid-lowering therapy is inconclusive and inconsistent for a large number of older adults, particularly adults aged > 80 years and frail older adults. We therefore advocate for randomised (de)prescribing trials studying a full range of outcomes, such as quality of life, functional capacity and symptom burden related to statins.

Outcomes data from more recent trials involving atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin, have since expanded the patient population shown to benefit from statin therapy. Current studies are evaluating the benefits of lowering lipid levels with statins to below current goals, as well as examining benefits in special patient populations and evaluating the value of surrogate markers of CHD. Early trials provided a solid foundation of knowledge on the efficacy and safety of statins. Recent and ongoing trials generate new data to resolve remaining questions in the fields of CHD prevention and lipidology.

### Lipid-lowering therapy and hemorrhagic stroke: a never-ending debate of clinical implications. have we found the answer? [^111V2pp7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

The authors conclude that although the RR of HS increased by 17% with statin therapy, the absolute risk is low and the benefit of preventing ischemic events exceeds the risk of HS: the fear of HS risk should not preclude statin use if clinically indicated.

Bétrisey et al must be applauded for carrying out this comprehensive and thoughtful meta‐analysis. Is this the end of the statins controversy? The crux of the statins debate is about their use and potential benefit/risk in patients with history of HS and those with perceived low risk for ischemic events and not patients with ischemic stroke. Although the SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels) trial has clearly established that atorvastatin is overall beneficial in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attacks attributed to atherosclerosis, there are insufficient prospective randomized data regarding risk/benefit of statin therapy in patients with HS. The meta‐analysis by Bétrisey et al, like its predecessors, does not address this uncertainty. Only 3 of the 48 included trials reported the number of participants with HS as a comorbidity; 7 trials excluded patients with HS and 38 did not report the number of patients with HS, if any, at baseline. Overall, only 250 of the 405 285 (0.06%) participants in the included trials had HS or history of HS at trial's entry, and it is unknown whether these cases clustered within a particular patient subpopulation. Therefore, the results of this meta‐analysis, its overall conclusions, and practice implications should be interpreted with caution. One must caution against misinterpreting the results to assume that nonstatin therapies are safer alternatives to statins in patients with HS. The authors appropriately acknowledge that currently available data are insufficient to draw conclusions about the association between nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapies and HS risk because of the small number of nonstatin trials and exclusion of patients with history of HS from most of these trials.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112QMZmt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The 2019 ESC/EAS guideline recommends using the Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation system, based on large, European cohort data sets, for estimating the 10‐year risk of fatal ASCVD events in adults > 40 years of age. The Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation tool has since been updated as Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation 2, which predicts 10‐year risk for both fatal and nonfatal ASCVD events. Also, CAC scoring is recommended in asymptomatic individuals classified as low or intermediate risk for whom statin therapy is being considered. A summary of the risk categories and recommendations for LDL‐C lowering in both the ACC/AHA/Multisociety and ESC/EAS guidelines is provided in Table 1.

Table 1
Classification of ASCVD Risk and LDL‐C Thresholds Defined by US and European Guidelines

Both the US and European guidelines recommend consideration of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy in addition to statins for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events; however, the guidelines differ in their respective definitions of patients at "very high risk". In the ACC/AHA/Multisociety guidelines, patients with a history of multiple major ASCVD events or those who have had one major ASCVD event plus multiple high‐risk conditions are considered very high risk. Recommendation for add‐on nonstatin therapy is therefore restricted to secondary prevention for patients at an LDL‐C threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. The ESC/EAS guideline adopts a broader definition of very high risk, encompassing those with documented ASCVD, either clinical or unequivocal on imaging or various other higher‐risk conditions in the absence of ASCVD. A more aggressive approach to lipid lowering is advocated. Add‐on nonstatin therapies are recommended if a target reduction of ≥ 50% in LDL‐C values from baseline and a treatment goal of < 55 mg/dL are not achieved.

Statin therapy initiation — predisposition assessment and patient discussion: In patients with indication for statin therapy, identification of potential predisposing factors for statin-associated side effects, including new-onset diabetes mellitus and SAMS, is recommended before initiation of treatment. A clinician–patient risk discussion focused on indications, benefits, risks of statin-associated side effects, and patient concerns and preferences should precede initiation of statin treatment.

### Statins versus placebo for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112ToMdj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, preventable, and treatable respiratory disease. COPD exacerbations are associated with worse quality of life, increased hospitalisations, and increased mortality. Currently available pharmacological interventions have variable impact on exacerbation frequency. The anti-inflammatory effects of statins may lead to decreased pulmonary and systemic inflammation, resulting in fewer exacerbations of COPD. Several observational studies have shown potential benefits of statins for patients with COPD.

Objectives

This review aims to evaluate available evidence on benefits and harms associated with statin therapy compared with placebo as adjunct therapy for patients with COPD. Primary objectives include the following.• To determine whether statins reduce mortality rates in COPD.• To determine whether statins reduce exacerbation frequency, improve quality of life, or improve lung function in COPD.• To determine whether statins are associated with adverse effects.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted the most recent search on 20 May 2019.

Selection Criteria

Parallel, randomised controlled trials recruiting adults with COPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods as expected by Cochrane. Prespecified primary outcomes were number of exacerbations, all-cause mortality, and COPD-specific mortality.

Main Results

Eight studies including 1323 participants with COPD were included in the review. Participants had a mean age of 61.4 to 72 years, and most were male (median 73.4%). Mean baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) ranged from 41% to 90% predicted. All studies compared moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy versus placebo. The duration of treatment ranged from 12 weeks to 36 months. We found no statistically significant difference between statins and placebo in our primary outcome of number of exacerbations per person-year (mean difference (MD) -0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.25 to 0.19, 1 trial, 877 participants), including number of exacerbations requiring hospitalisation per person-year (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.10, 1 trial, 877 exacerbations). This evidence was of moderate quality after downgrading for unclear risk of bias. Our primary outcomes of all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.74, 2 trials, 952 participants) and COPD-specific mortality (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.13, 1 trial, 877 participants) showed no significant difference between statins and placebo, with wide confidence intervals suggesting uncertainty about the precision of the results. This evidence was of low quality after downgrading for unclear risk of bias and imprecision. Results of the secondary outcomes analysis showed no clear differences between statins and placebo for FEV₁ (% predicted) (MD 1.18, 95% CI -2.6 to 4.97, 6 trials, 325 participants) but did show a statistically significant improvement in FEV₁/forced vital capacity (FVC) (MD 2.66, 95% CI 0.12 to 5.2; P = 0.04; 6 trials, 325 participants). A sensitivity analysis excluding two trials at high risk of bias showed no statistically significant difference in FEV₁/FVC (MD 2.05, 95% CI -0.87 to -4.97; P = 0.17; 4 trials, 255 participants). We also found no significant differences between the two groups in functional capacity measured by six-minute walk distance in metres (MD 1.79, 95% CI -52.51 to 56.09, 3 trials, 71 participants), with wide confidence intervals suggesting uncertainty about the precision of the results. Results show no clear difference in quality of life, which was reported in three trials, and a slight reduction in C-reactive protein (CRP) in the intervention group, which was statistically significant (MD -1.03, 95% CI -1.95 to -0.11; I² = 0%, P = 0.03; 3 trials, 142 participants). We noted a significant reduction in interleukin (IL)-6 in the intervention group (MD -2.11, 95% CI -2.65 to -1.56; I² = 0%, P ≤ 0.00001; 2 trials, 125 participants). All trials mentioned adverse events and indicated that statins were generally well tolerated. One study reported adverse events in detail and indicated that rates of all non-fatal adverse events (the number of serious adverse events per person-year) were similar in both groups (0.63 ± 1.56 events (intervention group) and 0.62 ± 1.48 events (control group); P > 0.20) for all comparisons, except for non-fatal serious adverse events involving the gastrointestinal tract, which were more frequent in the intervention group (in 30 patients (0.05 events per person-year) vs 17 patients (0.02 events per person-year); P = 0.02). Another trial lists the total numbers and percentages of adverse events in the intervention group (12 (26%)) and in the control group (21 (43%)) and of serious adverse events in the intervention group (4 (9%)) and in the control group (3 (6%)). The other trials stated that researchers found no significant adverse effects of statins but did not report adverse events in detail.

Authors' Conclusions

A small number of trials providing low- or moderate-quality evidence were suitable for inclusion in this review. They showed that use of statins resulted in a reduction in CRP and IL-6, but that this did not translate into clear clinical benefit for people with COPD. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to explore this topic.

### Cost-effectiveness of intensifying lipid-lowering therapy with statins based on individual absolute benefit in coronary artery disease patients [^111mC9oU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), intensive lipid‐lowering therapy (LLT) with statins renders a 15% relative risk reduction in vascular events compared to standard LLT. 1 Therefore, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) clinical guideline recommends intensive lipid lowering in patients with CAD unless characteristics like older age, history of statin intolerance, or serious comorbidities diminish safety of intensive LLT. 2 Nevertheless, high‐dose statin treatment rates are low, especially in women. 3, 4 This might be attributed to a dose‐related higher incidence of adverse effects like myopathy, new‐onset diabetes mellitus, and elevation of liver transaminits. 5, 6 Selection of the appropriate statin and dosage is ideally made by weighing individual expected benefit against the potential for adverse effects. Given that CAD patients differ widely in history of and risk factors for vascular disease, there is a potential range in absolute benefit from intensification of LLT. Previously, we derived a prediction model in the Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial population that estimates 5‐year absolute treatment effect of intensive versus standard LLT with statins on recurrent vascular events for an individual patient, which was validated in the Incremental Decrease in End point through Aggressive Lipid‐lowering (IDEAL) trial population. 7, 8, 9 With this model, we are able to estimate the individual 5‐year absolute risk reduction (ARR) for vascular events based on simple patient characteristics. 7, 10 Considering the intention for lifelong treatment and potential adverse effects, it may be worthwhile to target intensification of LTT to those patients who benefit most.

Before implementing a benefit‐based treatment strategy in clinical practice, an estimation of expected costs and health outcomes is required. Previous studies have shown that treating all patients with stable CAD with intensive LLT is a cost‐effective strategy. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 The costs and effects of treating patients with the highest predicted absolute benefit intensively and those with smaller benefit with standard therapy are unknown. Thus, is targeting intensive LLT with statins to CAD patients with the highest predicted absolute benefit cost‐effective compared to standard or intensive LLT for all?

Top 10 take-home messages — risk discussion for primary prevention: In adults 40 to 75 years of age evaluated for primary ASCVD prevention, have a clinician-patient risk discussion before starting statin therapy; risk discussion should include a review of major risk factors, the presence of risk-enhancing factors, the potential benefits of lifestyle and statin therapies, the potential for adverse effects and drug-drug interactions, consideration of costs of statin therapy, and patient preferences and values in shared decision-making.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium measurement — selected candidates and caveats — Patients reluctant to initiate statin who wish to understand their risk and potential for benefit more precisely and those concerned about need to reinstitute statin therapy after discontinuation for statin-associated symptoms are listed, as are older patients (men 55–80 y of age; women 60–80 y of age) with low burden of risk factors who question whether they would benefit from statin therapy and middle-aged adults (45–55 y of age) with pooled cohort equations (PCE)–calculated 10-year risk for ASCVD 5% to < 7.5% with factors that increase their ASCVD risk. Caveats include that if patient is at intermediate risk and if a risk decision is uncertain and a CAC score is obtained, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions are present and to reassess the CAC score in 5 to 10 years, and that, if CAC is recommended, it should be performed in facilities with current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation possible.

### Lipid-lowering therapy and risk of hemorrhagic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113cirz9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study was strengthened by our focus on a wide range of LDL‐C lowering therapy, including statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK‐9 inhibitors trials, and by our use of up‐to‐date evidence‐based data. We used a RR per 1‐mmol/L LDL‐C reduction as sensitivity analysis so we could compare and combine our results with those reported in the CTTC, which was not done so far with other meta‐analyses. We also included fibrate and omega‐3 trials to make up for the lack of published analyses of the association between lowering triglyceride and the HS risk. Finally, we reported data with an absolute risk difference to appraise risk/benefit assessment.

What are the clinical implications of our findings? Although the RR of HS increased by 17% with statin, absolute risk of HS remained rare throughout the trials, and the absolute risk difference attributable to statin was low, with an estimated number needed to harm of 3333 for an average treatment length of 6.7 years. The number needed to treat with statin to prevent 1 ischemic event over a period of 5 years is 49, so HS risk should not preclude statin use if clinically indicated. However, direct comparison between these 2 numbers should be approached cautiously because they do not account for disease severity or potential clustering in subgroups. We need more evidence to determine whether HS cluster within a particular patient subpopulation and whether the degree of disability is comparable to ischemic strokes. Many patients or doctors still have safety concerns about using statins, but we should encourage them to balance potential low risk of HS against expected benefits. In patients with acute HS, current guidelines state that the effects of statins on short‐term outcome (ischemic and hemorrhagic) are uncertain, but we could reduce this uncertainty by making individual patient data from LLT trials publicly available so researchers can estimate and stratify risk/benefit by age, sex, and comorbidities.

### Lipid-lowering therapy with statins in high-risk elderly patients: the treatment-risk paradox [^114jzuve]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

The benefits of cardiovascular therapies such as statins for secondary prevention have been well documented, although they may not be optimally used in patients most likely to benefit. Ideally, aggressiveness in the use of these beneficial therapies should correlate with baseline cardiovascular risk.

Objective

To examine the association between physicians' treatment aggressiveness and baseline cardiovascular risk.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Retrospective cohort study incorporating the use of multiple linked health care administrative databases covering more than 1.4 million elderly residents of Ontario. We included 396,077 patients aged 66 years or older who had a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes while undergoing medical treatment and who were alive on April 1, 1998. Baseline cardiovascular risk was derived using a risk-adjustment index in which we modeled probability of death after 3 years of follow-up.

Main Outcome Measure

Likelihood of statin use, stratified by baseline cardiovascular risk, after adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and rural or urban residence.

Results

Only 75,617 patients (19.1%) in this secondary prevention cohort were prescribed statins. In patients 66 to 74 years old, the adjusted probabilities of statin prescription were 37.7%, 26.7%, and 23.4% in the categories of low, intermediate, and high baseline risk, respectively. The likelihood of statin prescription was 6.4% lower (adjusted odds ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.93–0.95) for each year of increase in age and each 1% increase in predicted 3-year mortality risk. The influence of age also interacted synergistically with baseline risk on the prescription of statins (P < .001).

Conclusions

We found that prescription of statins diminished progressively as baseline cardiovascular risk and future probability of death increased. Since the benefits of a therapy are dependent on the baseline risk, the maximum benefits of statins may not be fully realized until implementation of therapy includes patients at highest risk.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^116cqcAK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with heart failure — statin and nonstatin therapy guidance is as follows: For symptomatic heart failure due to ischemic etiology, it is reasonable to consider statins in those expected to live long enough to benefit, with the writing committee stating it is reasonable to consider use when survival is expected for "3–5 years or more". Prior trials used "low-dose rosuvastatin (10 mg daily)" and a pooled analysis showed a "significant 19% reduction in MI rates among patients with ischemic etiology of heart failure". For ASCVD with a history of heart failure and inadequate LDL-C lowering on maximally tolerated statins, "the addition of ezetimibe may be reasonable", supported by IMPROVE-IT which "identified 9 clinical variables, including heart failure". In ACS with New York Heart Association ischemic heart failure, "no recommendation can be made for the use of a PCSK9 mAb at this time". Patients with NYHA class II–IV heart failure or "left ventricular ejection fraction was < 30% have been excluded from studies with inclisiran", and CLEAR Outcomes "also excludes patients with severe heart failure"; thus, decisions about other nonstatins "is a matter of clinical judgment after consideration of the potential net clinical benefit in the context of the patient's projected longevity and other comorbidities".

### Statin therapy for young adults: a long-term investment worth considering [^113wFdxn]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

HMG coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) significantly decrease low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, resulting in stabilization, and in some cases regression, of atherosclerotic plaque with subsequent reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. To date, there remains a paucity of data to guide the use of statins in young adults (20–49 years old). We herein aim to summarize the potential benefits and risks for statin therapy in younger adults, outlining a possible approach to statin use in young adults. Early identification and treatment of young individuals at risk for ASCVD offers the potential to significantly reduce the lifetime risk of ASCVD. However, there is a paucity of data on the potential side effects of long-term statin use over many decades. Comprehensive risk assessment, including calculation of life-time ASCVD risk, as well as incorporating non-traditional risk factors including lipoprotein (a), strong family history of premature ASCVD, familial hypercholesterolemia, LDL-C level and presence of underlying systemic inflammatory disorders can be helpful in identifying young adults who stand to benefit the most from statin therapy. Selective use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) assessment, as well as potentially polygenic risk scores, can be considered in situations where there remains uncertainty regarding risk assessment. Importantly, the decision for statin treatment should occur in the context of a patient centered shared decision-making process.

### Lipid management in the geriatric patient [^117QGk5D]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Elderly individuals are at higher risk for cardiovascular events, and thus this population stands to gain a greater reduction in events from lipid therapy than younger individuals. Multiple primary and secondary prevention trials have demonstrated that the benefits of statins in geriatric patients are equivalent to, or greater than, those seen in younger patients. Combination therapy with non-statin agents should be considered in patients who do not meet cholesterol goals or who have concomitant hypertriglyceridemia or low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although increased side effects may occur with high-dose statin therapy, careful vigilance of drug interactions and limiting polypharmacy can reduce these effects.

### Treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in older adults calls for a patient-centred approach [^114HGzyT]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for patients 1–3

The following treatment recommendations are based on the Dutch addendum 'CVRM in (frail) older adults' (see flowchart presented in figure 3). Except for hypertension and smoking status, patient 2 has the same cardiovascular risk profile as patient 1 (figure 1). This puts patient 2 at higher risk of CVD. This is not reflected in estimated life expectancy (± 10 years in patient 2 versus ± 14 years in patient 1), but in 10-year risk of CVD (26% in patient 2 vs 13% in patient 1). Because the 10-year risk of CVD is < 20% in patient 1, the benefit of lipid-lowering therapy in terms of lifetime absolute risk reduction or gain in CVD-free years would be considered too low to initiate lipid-lowering therapy by most clinicians and patients. Of course, although the > 20% risk is commonly used in guidelines, the threshold for starting treatment is arbitrary. Per patient, an individualised decision must be made. Although patient 2 is expected to live less long than patient 1 (± 14 vs ± 10 years), her 10-year risk of CVD of 26% puts her at high lifetime risk of CVD. Benefit of lipid-lowering therapy is therefore greater in patient 2 compared with patient 1 in terms of lifetime absolute risk reduction and gain in CVD-free survival. Thus, it may be reasonable to initiate a lipid-lowering drug in patient 2, while the benefits in patient 1 do not outweigh potential negative effects of therapy. Patient 3 is currently taking simvastatin 40 mg daily. Despite his high absolute risk of a new cardiovascular event, it may be reasonable to deprescribe his statin, especially in case of side effects. Due to his comorbidities and limited level of cognitive and physical functioning, it is likely that patient 3 will die a non-vascular death within 1–2 years. Benefit of his statin in terms of preventing CVD is thus not very likely. Potential muscle-related side effects of his statin may have a disproportionally negative effect on his physical abilities as he has a poor physical status to start with. As similar patients (eg, limited life expectancy (1–2 years)) are under-represented in the (cohort) studies the competing risk adjusted, older adults-specific risk tool is based on, we do not recommend estimating cardiovascular risk with this tool for this frail patient.

### Benefit versus risk in statin treatment [^11486Fz4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The Statin Safety Assessment Conference of the National Lipid Association (NLA), reported in this supplement to The American Journal of Cardiology, provides a comprehensive evaluation of old and new experience on adverse events associated with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins. To place these in context, one can express both the risk of side effects and the benefits for cardiovascular disease in terms of events per person-year of statin treatment. The mortality risk from fatal rhabdomyolysis is approximately 0.3 per 100,000 person-years, and the risks of nonfatal rhabdomyolysis and of putative statin-attributable peripheral neuropathy are approximately 3 and 12 events, respectively, per 100,000 person-years. Reports of acute liver failure and acute or chronic kidney disease give lower rate estimates that, even when corrected for underreporting, are approximately equal to the background rates of these conditions in the general population, lending scant support for statin-attributable etiology. In contrast, the benefit of statin use is to avert several hundred deaths and several hundred cases each of heart and brain infarction per 100,000 person-years in appropriately treated high-risk patients. Although population estimates such as these are useful, they must be translated repeatedly to individual patient-provider encounters, where clinical skill and art must combine with scientific evidence. The continued publication of individual case reports and small randomized trials among groups of patients with potential side effects should be encouraged. Statins should not be used in situations where minimal benefit is expected, as safety data and risk-benefit analysis must be meshed with guidelines that help the clinician decide whom to treat and how aggressively to treat.

### Determining when to add nonstatin therapy: a quantitative approach [^114hwzF6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Costs and uncertainty about the benefits of nonstatin therapies limit their use.

Objectives

The authors sought to identify patients who might benefit from the addition of a nonstatin to background statin therapy.

Methods

We performed systematic reviews of subgroup analyses from randomized trials and observational studies with statin-treated participants to determine estimated 10-year absolute risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and to define high-risk and very high-risk patients. We used the relative risk reductions for the addition of a nonstatin to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) used to determine the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent 1 ASCVD event over 5 years for each patient group and to allow comparisons with 5-year cost analyses.

Results

The 10-year ASCVD risk is at least 30% (very high risk) for statin-treated participants with clinical ASCVD and comorbidities, and 20% to 29% (high risk) for those with ASCVD without comorbidities or who have heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Adding ezetimibe to reduce low-density LDL-C by 20% would provide a 5-year NNT ≤ 50 for very high-risk patients with LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dl or for high-risk patients with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dl, and an NNT ≤ 30 for very high-risk patients with LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dl. Adding a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody to lower LDL-C by at least 50% would provide an NNT ≤ 50 for very high-risk and high-risk patients with LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dl, and an NNT ≤ 30 for very high-risk and high-risk patients with an LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dl.

Conclusions

Adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies to maximally tolerated statin therapy may be cost effective in very high-risk and high-risk patients, depending on baseline LDL-C levels.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^115rZexD]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association dyslipidemia management — statin therapy counseling and shared decision-making notes that the role of health care providers begins with identifying the patient's problem, assessing the patient's level of understanding, and then providing necessary education including verbal explanations and written materials, and that shared decision-making is integral to the provider-patient encounter. When discussing therapeutic options, the provider will need to specifically relate the reason for prescribing medication to the patient's condition; for example, in a patient with post-MI, the need for a high-intensity statin is paramount and has been shown to reduce subsequent cardiovascular events and mortality. It is important to discuss the potential side effects of prescribed atherogenic cholesterol-lowering therapies, including statin therapy, with all patients, including the potential for muscle aches and how the muscle ache might feel on statins; the provider should reinforce that the provider/office staff needs to be contacted if the patient believes he/she is experiencing an adverse effect, and patients should be assured that safety labs are checked when their lipid panel is checked. The provider should also explain that although statins are 1 "class" of drugs, statins individually are very different drugs from one another — a problem with 1 does not usually mean that all statins need to be avoided. A statin prescription should not be an automatic recommendation for a patient with elevated cholesterol; it is critically important to engage the patient in a discussion, review benefit vs risk of statin therapy, discuss all treatment options, and consider patient preferences.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The STAREE and PREVENTABLE trials will shed light on the benefits of statin initiation in adults over age 70 years. The SITE and STREAM studies will be the first large prospective trials to inform the benefits and risks of discontinuing statins later in life. Future trials should include more diverse study articipants to better represent the diverse patient populations treated with statins in the US and globally. In addition, better risk stratification methods in older individuals using improved risk equations derived from diverse cohorts, new imaging modalities or new biomarkers may further enhance ASCVD prediction allowing better targeting of those at greatest risk. While we await further evidence, in those who do not have a life limiting illness, primary prevention therapy with a statin can be considered as part of shared decision‐making.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for statin-induced myopathy, more specifically with respect to pretreatment assessment, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend to conduct a clinician-patient risk discussion before initiating statin therapy to review net clinical benefit, weighing the potential for ASCVD risk reduction against the potential for statin-associated side effects, drug-drug interactions, and safety while emphasizing that side effects can be addressed successfully.

### The extent to which statins have improved cardiovascular outcomes: lessons from randomized trials and observational studies of "real world" practice in people with diabetes [^115PBRJ8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Statins are the mainstay of therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with diabetes mellitus. It is estimated that there are more than half a billion patients with diabetes mellitus worldwide and the numbers of prevalent cases of diabetes are expected to increase in both developed and developing countries in the next decade. Statins reduce risk of mortality and morbidity mainly by reducing blood low density cholesterol. Statins, along with other medical treatments, are responsible for about half of the decrease in cardiovascular mortality over the past several decades. Multiple clinical trials have found evidence for statin use in patients with diabetes, for both primary prevention and secondary prevention. The benefit of statins in patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes in terms of absolute risk reduction is twice as much as compared to the risk in patients with coronary heart disease but no diabetes. The proportion of patients with diabetes treated with statins has increased steadily over the past few decades with concurrent decrease in cardiovascular deaths in this high-risk population. However, there are significant unmet needs in cardiovascular risk reduction, due to underutilization of statins and due to residual cardiovascular risk despite maximal statin therapy. Future strategies in population risk reduction in diabetics should include maximal statin therapy, additional treatment with nonstatin therapy and new paradigms of prevention with early intervention with shorter, more intensive therapy to potentially "reverse" atherosclerosis with goals of reducing clinical cardiovascular disease later in life.

### Statins for primary prevention in older adults-moving toward evidence-based decision-making [^117UmY1m]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of statins for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events in older adults, especially those aged 80 and older and with multimorbidity.

Methods

The National Institute on Aging and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute convened A multidisciplinary expert panel from July 31 to August 1, 2017, to review existing evidence, identify knowledge gaps, and consider whether statin safety and efficacy data in persons aged 75 and older without ASCVD are sufficient; whether existing data can inform the feasibility, design, and implementation of future statin trials in older adults; and clinical trial options and designs to address knowledge gaps. This article summarizes the presentations and discussions at that workshop.

Results

There is insufficient evidence regarding the benefits and harms of statins in older adults, especially those with concomitant frailty, polypharmacy, comorbidities, and cognitive impairment; a lack of tools to assess ASCVD risk in those aged 80 and older; and a paucity of evidence of the effect of statins on outcomes of importance to older adults, such as statin-associated muscle symptoms, cognitive function, and incident diabetes mellitus. Prospective, traditional, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and pragmatic RCTs seem to be suitable options to address these critical knowledge gaps. Future trials have to consider greater representation of very old adults, women, underrepresented minorities, and individuals of differing health, cognitive, socioeconomic, and educational backgrounds. Feasibility analyses from existing large healthcare networks confirm appropriate power for death and cardiovascular outcomes for future RCTs in this area.

Conclusion

Existing data cannot address uncertainties about the benefits and harms of statins for primary ASCVD prevention in adults aged 75 and older, especially those with comorbidities, frailty, and cognitive impairment. Evidence from 1 or more RCTs could address these important knowledge gaps to inform person-centered decision-making. J Am Geriatr Soc 66:2188–2196, 2018.

### Statins and musculoskeletal diseases… [^114d86KS]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance Musculoskeletal conditions, arthropathies, injuries, and pain are more common among statin users than among similar nonusers. The full spectrum of statins' musculoskeletal adverse events may not be fully explored, and further studies are warranted, especially in physically active individuals. Statins effectively lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, the full spectrum of statin musculoskeletal adverse events is unknown. Statin-associated musculoskeletal AEs include a wide array of clinical presentations, including myalgias, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, rhabdomyolysis, autoimmune muscle disease, and tendinous diseases. 1–10 In contrast, other authors11 have postulated that statins' anti-inflammatory properties may be beneficial in osteoarthritis. Several studies and a meta-analysis have reported that statins may reduce muscle strength and exercise tolerance.

39, 40 However, a randomized clinical trial showed no significant changes in muscle strength or exercise capacity among users of high-dose atorvastatin vs placebo. 41 An observational study that involved almost 2 million individuals reported an association between statin use and myopathy. 42 Time-varying analysis demonstrated that the myopathy risk persisted 3 years after stopping treatment. Pathologic studies also have shown that statin use may be associated with myopathy in the presence of normal creatine kinase levels, even in the absence of symptoms. 8, 53 Statin-associated necrotizing autoimmune myopathy was noted to persist or progress despite cessation of statin therapy. 7, 54–56 In addition, several reports1, 3 have recognized an increased incidence of tendinopathies in relationship to statin use.

Hence, it is conceivable that these effects may result in increased incidence of soft-tissue–related injuries, such as dislocation, sprain, and strain. In conclusion, statin use was associated with an increased likelihood of musculoskeletal condition diagnoses, including injuries and pain. Soft-tissue injuries are a lesser known AE of statins and warrant additional research. Further investigations, including randomized clinical studies and larger-scale prospective studies, particularly in physically active individuals, are necessary to obtain a more complete risk-benefit assessment for statin therapy.

### Treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in older adults calls for a patient-centred approach [^1135hSSu]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Rethinking 10-year risk of CVD

Table 1 gives an overview of the recommendations for managing hypercholesterolaemia in older adults for three major guidelines: the 2014 British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline, the 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelineand the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guideline. They all recommend that hypercholesterolaemia treatment in older adults, in principle, should not differ from those in younger patients, and is based on estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk. As previously experienced, CVD is a major risk factor for the occurrence of new cardiovascular events, all patients with pre-existing CVD are at very high 10-year risk of CVD and therefore eligible for lipid-lowering drugs. For patients without CVD, guidelines recommend estimating 10-year risk with traditional risk tools, which state that the majority of older adults are at (very) high 10-year risk of CVD because of their age (and presence of additional cardiovascular risk factors). As a consequence, almost every older adult — with or without CVD — is eligible for use of a lipid-lowering drug. Traditional risk estimation tools do not adjust for competing risks, and consequently, tend to overestimate an older patient's actual 10-year risk of CVD. Also, as described above, a large number of older adults, especially those with multimorbidity or frailty, will not live as long as 10 years. On a group level, the beneficial effects of lipid-lowering drugs in terms of establishing a clinically relevant difference in preventing CVD occur approximately 2–3 years after initiating treatment. For some older patients, the time-until-benefit of lipid-lowering therapy therefore may exceed their life expectancy. Every guideline acknowledges that evidence on benefits and harms of lipid-lowering drugs in older patients, especially patients without CVD, is limited. They all mention that treatment decisions should be guided by clinical judgement, and recommend to include comorbidity, frailty, adverse effects, adherence and patient preference in the decision to treat or not. Compared to the 2014 NICE and the 2016 ESC guidelines, the 2018 AHA/ACC guideline clarifies in more detail what should be meant by this. Also, the latter guideline is the only guideline addressing when to consider deprescribing a lipid-lowering drug (although only for older patients without pre-existing CVD). An important shortcoming of all guidelines is that they are single-disease based, solely based on data from clinical trials in relatively young and fit adults and give advice on how to treat 'average' patients. Recently, a multidisciplinary addendum 'Cardiovascular Risk Management (CVRM) in (frail) older adults' was published in the Netherlands. Based on current, best-available evidence and expert opinion, it provides advice on starting, continuing or discontinuing lipid-lowering drugs in fit and frail older adults. The recommendations may be seen as progressive, because more attention is paid to frailty status, not initiating and deprescribing lipid-lowering therapy than in standard guidelines. Our recommendations presented below are based on this addendum.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for management of adults with dyslipidemia-2025 update [^116jAhDC]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Targeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with pharmacologic therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention in adults — the algorithm emphasizes lifestyle counseling and risk‑based statin use. Primary prevention begins with counseling to reduce ASCVD risk and risk assessment, recognizes risk enhancers such as "Metabolic syndrome/ MASLD", "CKD, chronic inflammatory diseases", and "Persistent LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L)", and advises to "Consider moderate- to high-intensity statin"; if "If LDL-C above goal on maximally tolerated statin, add ezetimibe". For secondary prevention (clinical ASCVD), it specifies "High-intensity statin", then "If LDL-C above goal or continues to have CV events, add ezetimibe", and to "Consider add-on therapy: bempedoic acid, PCSK9-based therapy, or bile acid resins", with the caveat, "Not all add-on agents have evidence for reducing ASCVD risk. Use shared decision-making to discuss the benefits and harms of the individual therapies". The figure also states, "AACE suggests treating individuals with ASCVD or increased risk of ASCVD to an LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL" and that "Potential impacts from polypharmacy and the increased costs with certain medications should be considered when determining appropriate treatment goals".

### Statins in the elderly: a patient-focused approach [^111WV3E3]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Individuals age > 65 years represent the fastest-growing subpopulation in the United States. Although these individuals with the highest cardiovascular risk profile would be anticipated to be the most aggressively treated, paradoxically, treatment and baseline risk are inversely related. Presumably, the elderly population would benefit from high-intensity statin therapy; however, as per the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, given the scarcity of evidence in patients age > 75, there are only sufficient data from randomized controlled trials to support use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention. Despite evidence demonstrating statins are beneficial in the elderly, the decision to initiate and sustain treatment should be a well-informed and collaborative decision. One must balance the benefits (secondary atherosclerotic cardiovascular prevention, stroke reduction, decreased morbidity and mortality) with the potential risks to the elderly (altered metabolism, comorbidities, polypharmacy and drug-drug interactions, side effects, cognitive limitations, and cost).

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117BD4a7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes — 2020 lipid management states that lifestyle modification is recommended for all patients with diabetes; for patients of all ages with diabetes and ASCVD, high-intensity statin therapy as adjunct to lifestyle is recommended; for ASCVD with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated statin therapy, the ADA suggests consideration of additional LDL-C lowering therapy with either ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor; in diabetes without ASCVD but older than 40 years of age, moderate-intensity statins are recommended with consideration of high-intensity statin treatment for those with multiple ASCVD risk factors or in the age range of 50 to 70 years, and consideration of adding ezetimibe for a 10-year ASCVD risk of 20% or greater; in people older than 75 years not taking a statin, the ADA suggests considering statin treatment after discussion of potential risks/benefits; and for younger adults aged 20–39 years with diabetes, the ADA suggests consideration of statin therapy in those with other ASCVD risk factors.

### An assessment by the statin diabetes safety task force: 2014 update [^117W8o15]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

Statin therapy reduces the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death by 25% to 30% in primary as well as secondary prevention patients. Thus, statins are the pharmacologic therapy of choice for the management of high blood cholesterol levels. Prompted by examination of clinical trial data suggesting a modest, but statistically significant, increase in the incidence of new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus with statin use, the US Food and Drug Administration in 2012 added a statement to the labels of statin medications indicating that increases in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and fasting glucose levels have been reported with statin use. This labeling change has raised questions among clinicians regarding the relative benefits and risks of statin use, both among patients with diabetes mellitus and among those with diabetes risk factors. This 2014 report from the Diabetes Subpanel of the National Lipid Association Expert Panel on Statin Safety reviews the published evidence relating statin use to the hazard for diabetes mellitus or worsening glycemia, examines potential mechanisms that may mediate the relationship between statin use and diabetes mellitus risk, and suggests future research efforts. Given the well-established benefits of statin therapy in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events among those with indications for treatment, no changes to clinical practice are recommended other than the measurement of HbA1C or fasting glucose in those deemed to also be at elevated diabetes risk after initiating statin therapy, and potentially before initiation in selected patients considered to be at elevated risk of developing diabetes. The panel advocates following recommendations from the American Diabetes Association, or other relevant guidelines if outside the United States, for screening and diagnosis as well as lifestyle modification for prevention or delay of diabetes mellitus in those with prediabetes or other risk factors.

### Risks and benefits of continued aggressive statin therapy [^112X4NuX]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, are a well-tolerated, effective class of medications for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol levels. Extensive data from clinical trials demonstrate that these agents reduce fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention patients, including women and the elderly. A threshold value for LDL-C reduction below which there is no further clinical benefit has not yet been identified. In the Heart Protection Study (HPS), significant relative risk reduction occurred even among patients with LDL-C levels < 2.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl). Statin therapy also produced reductions in cardiovascular disease in a wide range of high-risk patients regardless of baseline cholesterol levels. Rhabdomyolysis, typically defined as muscle pain or weakness associated with creatine kinase levels higher than 10 times the upper limit of normal and the presence of myoglobulinuria, is a rare but potentially serious complication of statins. Although dose-dependent transaminase elevations occur in 0.5 to 2% of cases, it has not been determined whether these elevations qualify as true drug-related hepatotoxicity. Management of myopathy and elevated transaminases is addressed in a joint publication from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Because statins have significant potential benefits and a low risk for serious adverse effects, aggressive therapy should be considered in patients at high risk for coronary heart disease.

AACE suggests treating individuals with ASCVD or increased risk of ASCVD to an LDL-C target of less than 70 mg/dL (conditional recommendation, low certainty), and notes that potential impacts from polypharmacy and the increased costs associated with certain medications should be considered when determining appropriate treatment goals for individual patients.

### Shared decisions: a qualitative study on clinician and patient perspectives on statin therapy and statin-associated side effects [^113TePS1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 1, 2 Despite the class I recommendation by evidence‐based guidelines to initiate high‐intensity statins in patients with clinical ASCVD, 3, 4 statin and high‐intensity statin therapy use in this high‐risk population remains suboptimal. 5 There are likely multiple reasons involving both patients and clinicians contributing to this underuse.

Studies have found patient concerns about perceived statin‐associated side effects (SASEs) as a major reason for lower rates of statin use. 6, 7, 8 Even when clinicians attest to the safety and effectiveness of statins, many patients remain apprehensive. Although rates of reported SASEs are low in randomized controlled trials of statin therapy, the frequency of reported SASEs is higher in clinical practice. 8 Although these SASEs may not be causal, 8 lack of clinician‐patient communication about the risks versus benefits of statin therapy, lack of adequate time invested in discussing potential SASEs, and ineffective strategies to manage adverse effects all likely contribute to patients' concerns and suboptimal use of statins. 6, 7 Furthermore, there is a lack of data on clinician versus patient perceptions of SASEs and a lack of objectivity in assessing the adverse effects. A better understanding of patient and clinician perceptions of statin therapy and SASEs, a more thorough assessment of adverse effects, and a method for improving clinician‐patient communication about statin risks and benefits are needed.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^114QX3as]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of CVD is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with CVD. The case for primary prevention was uncertain when the last version of this review was published (2011) and in light of new data an update of this review is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

Search Methods

To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. The searches conducted in 2007 were updated in January 2012. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2022, Issue 4), MEDLINE OVID (1950 to December Week 4 2011) and EMBASE OVID (1980 to 2012 Week 1). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of statins versus placebo or usual care control with minimum treatment duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on total, low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), revascularisation, change in total and LDL cholesterol concentrations, adverse events, quality of life and costs. Odds ratios (OR) and risk ratios (RR) were calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data, pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) were calculated. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data.

Main Results

The latest search found four new trials and updated follow-up data on three trials included in the original review. Eighteen randomised control trials (19 trial arms; 56,934 participants) were included. Fourteen trials recruited patients with specific conditions (raised lipids, diabetes, hypertension, microalbuminuria). All-cause mortality was reduced by statins (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94); as was combined fatal and non-fatal CVD RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.81), combined fatal and non-fatal CHD events RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.80) and combined fatal and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89). Reduction of revascularisation rates (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.72) was also seen. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in all trials but there was evidence of heterogeneity of effects. There was no evidence of any serious harm caused by statin prescription. Evidence available to date showed that primary prevention with statins is likely to be cost-effective and may improve patient quality of life. Recent findings from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists study using individual patient data meta-analysis indicate that these benefits are similar in people at lower (< 1% per year) risk of a major cardiovascular event.

Authors' Conclusions

Reductions in all-cause mortality, major vascular events and revascularisations were found with no excess of adverse events among people without evidence of CVD treated with statins.

American Heart Association scientific statement — statin therapy scope and co-medication considerations state that "Statins reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and in many primary prevention patients", and that "Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend high-intensity statin therapy in patients with ASCVD ≤ 75 years and moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy in patients with ASCVD and age > 75 years, diabetes mellitus, and familial hypercholesterolemia and in primary prevention patients with 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%"; given this role, "combination therapy with statins and other cardiovascular medications is highly likely, and potentially significant DDIs must be considered in patients treated with statins".

### Cardiovascular disease, statins, and HIV [^111Ppnvq]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are at an increased risk of serious, non-AIDS-defining comorbidities, even in the setting of viral suppression with combination antiretroviral therapy. This increased risk is due in part to immune dysfunction and heightened inflammation and immune activation associated with chronic HIV infection. Statins have wide-reaching immunomodulatory effects, and their use in the HIV-infected population may be of particular benefit. In this article, we review the pathogenesis of increased inflammation during HIV infection and how it contributes to the risk of cardiovascular disease among HIV-infected individuals. We then we review the immunomodulatory effects of statins and how they may attenuate the risk of cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities in this unique patient population.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Managing hypercholesterolemia in primary prevention patients older than 75 years — statin decision-making, alternatives, and monitoring are outlined with recommendation classes for patients with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL: use shared decision-making to make patient-centered decisions regarding the use of statin therapy (Class I); validated mortality indexes that include comorbid conditions and functional status are recommended (Class I); if aged 76–80 years old, it is reasonable to measure coronary artery calcium, and if there is uncertainty whether to treat, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy if the CAC score is 0 (Class IIa); consider using models adjusted for competing risks to estimate ASCVD risk and the potential benefit of statin therapy (Class IIb); when shared decision-making supports treatment, initiation of a statin may be reasonable in those without a life limiting illness (Class IIb); when treated with statin therapy, ongoing monitoring of LDL-C every 3 to 12 months as clinically indicated is recommended (Class I); in select adults in whom statin deprescribing is considered, shared decision-making between clinician, patient, and/or caregiver is reasonable (Class IIa); when an alternative to statin therapy is needed, if LDL-C is above desirable levels and additional risk factors are present, consider ezetimibe for reduction of LDL-C and ASCVD risk (Class IIb), and if statin intolerance is present, consider bempedoic acid for reduction of LDL-C and ASCVD risk (Class IIb).

### Association of statin use with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in US veterans 75 and older… [^116AzPAb]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Exposures Any new statin prescription. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes included a composite of ASCVD events. Results. After propensity score overlap weighting was applied, the hazard ratio was 0. 75 for all-cause mortality,
0. 80 for cardiovascular mortality, and 0. 92 for a composite of ASCVD events when comparing statin users with nonusers. Diagnosis codes within CDW and CMS claims were used to identify comorbidities associated with both exposure and outcome.

17 These included hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, liver disease, nonstatin cholesterol-lowering medications, smoking status, anemia, cancer, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, substance abuse, and mental health disorders. The ASCVD composite end point occurred in 123 379 persons, with a total of 24 951 MIs, 35 630 ischemic strokes, and 74 362 revascularization procedures. There were 66. 3 and
70. 4 composite cardiovascular events per 1000 person-years for statin users vs nonusers. Results for all secondary outcomes stratified by age, sex, race, diabetes, dementia, and arthritis are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Third, this study did not specifically address frailty, although variables included in the model such as fatigue, slow walking, and polypharmacy may be proxies for frailty.

Furthermore, individuals with dementia or cancer were not excluded, as has been done in other studies. Fourth, adverse effects of statins such as myalgias, increased risk of diabetes, postulated decline in cognition, 38 drug-drug interactions, and polypharmacy were not assessed in this study. Previous research has shown a slight elevated risk of type 2 diabetes in the VHA with high-potency statin use. 39.

Summary of recommendations for lipid management from the 2015 NLA Expert Panel on older patients — secondary and very high risk prevention (ASCVD or type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus with ≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end organ damage) recommends consideration of moderate or high intensity statin therapy for those individuals age ≥ 65 to ≤ 75 years of age with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus; secondary prevention patients who are > 75 to < 80 years of age may be treated with similar regimens after a careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio; in those ≥ 80 years of age, moderate intensity statin therapy should be considered based upon provider–patient discussion including drug–drug interactions, polypharmacy, concomitant medical conditions including frailty, cost considerations and patient preference; combination therapy evidence from IMPROVE-IT indicates individuals (mean age 64 years) with acute coronary syndrome were more likely to benefit from simvastatin–ezetimibe than simvastatin alone, and in those older than age 65 years the ASCVD event rate was 34.6% vs 39.9% with an absolute risk reduction of 3.5%.

### Lipid-lowering trials are not representative of patients managed in clinical practice: a systematic review and meta-analysis of exclusion criteria [^113gLtyz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

For several common medical conditions, evidence on statin benefits and side effects is low, because patients with specific common conditions such as severe CKD, severe HF, dementia, and mental illness, or even groups of women were commonly excluded. It is not clear why these medical groups were excluded from these trials, and as previously published usually no reason is given for most of the exclusion criteria. In addition, in most of the excluded medical conditions lipid‐lowering drugs are not contraindicated. The reason for excluding common conditions may be to avoid situations that could limit the effectiveness of the medications tested or increase the risk of side effects. As to CKD, most of the lipid‐lowering drugs are not contraindicated. The official guidelines differ for the different drugs. For example, ezetimibe does not need an adjustment in severe renal failure, whereas with most statins it is recommended to start at a low dose and to up‐titrate. Not only are most of the lipid‐lowering drugs not contraindicated in CKD, but it is also essential to include this patient group in RCTs about LLT, because there is an association between decreasing eGFR and CVD risk (independent risk factor), but inconclusive evidence on the benefits of statins for advanced CKD. Because many studies excluded patients with higher‐grade renal insufficiency, it is not possible to assess whether the side effects of statin therapy (eg, interactions with other drugs) or the benefits outweigh the risks. However, in the 4D (Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse Studie) trial comparing atorvastatin versus placebo in patients treated with hemodialysis, there was no statistically significant effect on the composite end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. It may be reasonable not to start statin therapy in multimorbid older patients requiring dialysis or in patients with severe renal insufficiency in the primary prevention, and perhaps it would be reasonable as well to stop statins among those patients, as it is currently explored among multimorbid older adults in primary prevention in a randomized trial.
