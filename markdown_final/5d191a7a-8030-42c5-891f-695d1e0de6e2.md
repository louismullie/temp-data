## Question

Can prazosin be used to treat renal artery stenosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether prazosin (an alpha-1 blocker) can be used to treat renal artery stenosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the high-credibility guidelines list as first-line antihypertensive therapy for renovascular hypertension due to renal artery stenosis. Then, I should verify whether alpha-blockers or prazosin are mentioned at all in renal artery stenosis guidance. Next, I will review the pathophysiological rationale to see whether alpha-blockade aligns with the primary mechanism. After that, I should evaluate evidence for alpha-blockers in resistant hypertension and whether any guidance extrapolates to renal artery stenosis. Finally, I will integrate safety and monitoring considerations and deliver a conclusion [^113u6WRa] [^116s4it7].

> Let me first confirm the standard medical regimen for renal artery stenosis-related hypertension, because I need to ensure I am aligned with the strongest guidance before considering add-on agents. The ESVS 2025 guideline recommends renin-angiotensin system blockade with an ACE inhibitor or ARB as first-line in unilateral renal artery stenosis, with calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics as additional first-line agents for blood pressure control, and it advises cautious, monitored use of ACEi/ARB even in bilateral severe disease or a solitary kidney when tolerated and with close follow-up of renal function and blood pressure [^113u6WRa] [^111qvRAE]. The 2024 ESC peripheral arterial and aortic disease guideline similarly recommends combining ACEi/ARB therapy with diuretics and/or CCBs for hypertension attributable to renal artery stenosis, which reinforces that RAAS blockade plus diuretic and calcium channel blockade is the cornerstone of therapy in this condition [^116s4it7].

> Wait, let me verify whether alpha-blockers or prazosin appear anywhere in these renal artery stenosis documents, because if they do, that could change the hierarchy. I should double-check ESVS 2025 and ESC 2024 text for any alpha-blocker mention in the specific renal artery stenosis sections. On close review, neither guideline lists alpha-blockers, including prazosin, as recommended agents specifically for renal artery stenosis management, and they do not include alpha-blockers among first-line or disease-focused regimens for renovascular hypertension in this context [^113u6WRa] [^116s4it7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to consider the mechanism, because if the pathophysiology is RAAS-driven, RAAS blockade would logically be prioritized over peripheral alpha-1 blockade. Renal artery stenosis reduces renal perfusion, activates the juxtaglomerular apparatus, and increases renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone, driving renovascular hypertension; this is why RAAS inhibition is foundational therapy here, whereas alpha-1 antagonism produces peripheral vasodilation but does not directly suppress the RAAS axis that is central to this disease process [^115xsHGK] [^114v7Yqh]. I should confirm that this mechanistic prioritization aligns with guideline choices, and indeed it does, as the guidelines emphasize RAAS blockade and not alpha-blockade for disease-specific management [^113u6WRa] [^116s4it7].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could alpha-blockers still have a role through the resistant hypertension pathway even if they are not disease-specific recommendations for renal artery stenosis? Next, I should review resistant hypertension guidance. The 2023 ESH guideline allows consideration of alpha-1 blockers such as doxazosin as add-on therapy in hypertension, particularly when combined with thiazide-type diuretics and beta-blockers to mitigate fluid retention and reflex tachycardia; this is a general resistant hypertension framework, not a renal artery stenosis-specific endorsement, and prazosin would be mechanistically similar within the class even though doxazosin is the more commonly referenced agent in contemporary guidelines [^113Nopxh]. I started to think this might imply an explicit recommendation for renal artery stenosis, but let me reconsider; the renal artery stenosis guidelines themselves still do not list alpha-blockers in their disease-focused algorithms, so any use here would be extrapolated for blood pressure control rather than treating the underlying renovascular mechanism [^113u6WRa] [^116s4it7].

> I will now examine whether any evidence bases or consensus documents point to alpha-blockers in chronic kidney disease or sympathetic overactivity states that might overlap with renovascular disease, but I need to be careful not to overgeneralize. Reviews and synopses acknowledge that alpha-blockers can aid blood pressure lowering in CKD due to heightened sympathetic activity, yet these are not trials with hard renal outcomes in renal artery stenosis, and they do not convert alpha-blockers into disease-specific therapy for renovascular hypertension; hence, they remain potential reserve agents for resistant blood pressure rather than primary agents for renal artery stenosis itself [^115YJBye] [^116n8hix]. I should confirm that this interpretation stays consistent with the RAS guidelines, and it does, given their emphasis on RAAS blockade, CCBs, and thiazide diuretics as the principal regimen [^113u6WRa] [^116s4it7].

> But wait, what if revascularization is being considered — does that alter the medication hierarchy or the utility of alpha-blockade? For most stable atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, randomized data such as ASTRAL do not show clinical benefit of stenting over optimized medical therapy, keeping pharmacologic RAAS blockade at the center of care and again not elevating alpha-blockers into guideline-prioritized status for the disease state, although revascularization may be appropriate in selected high-risk phenotypes outside those trial populations [^114bK6ES] [^113u6WRa]. This reinforces that prazosin would not displace RAAS blockers, CCBs, or diuretics when managing renovascular hypertension due to renal artery stenosis [^116s4it7].

> I need to ensure monitoring advice is clear, because introducing or intensifying RAAS blockade in renal artery stenosis requires careful follow-up and sometimes leads clinicians to consider alternative classes. In bilateral severe renal artery stenosis or a solitary kidney, ACEi/ARB can still be considered if tolerated, but renal function and potassium need close monitoring, and modest early creatinine rises with RAAS blockade are often hemodynamic and reversible rather than true kidney injury; this supports optimizing RAAS therapy with surveillance rather than defaulting to alpha-blockers due to fear of creatinine changes [^111qvRAE] [^111NxL9F]. I should double-check that this nuance is explicit in the guidance, and yes, the guidelines stress careful follow-up when using RAAS inhibitors in these anatomies [^111qvRAE].

> Final take-home, summarizing carefully so I do not overstate anything: prazosin is not recommended as a disease-specific treatment for renal artery stenosis, and alpha-blockers are not included in guideline-directed, first-line regimens for renovascular hypertension; instead, ACE inhibitors or ARBs form the cornerstone, with calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics as key additional agents, and revascularization reserved for selected indications, while alpha-blockers may be considered only as general add-on therapy for resistant hypertension when needed and in combination with other classes, not as a targeted therapy for the renovascular mechanism [^113u6WRa] [^116s4it7] [^113Nopxh] [^114bK6ES].

No, prazosin is **not recommended as first-line therapy** for renal artery stenosis (RAS)-related hypertension because it does not address the RAAS-driven pathophysiology of RAS [^113o3gyu]. Current guidelines prioritize **ACE inhibitors or ARBs** [^113u6WRa], with calcium channel blockers or thiazide diuretics as add-on therapy [^116s4it7]. Prazosin may be considered only as a **third-line adjunct** in resistant hypertension [^113Nopxh], with careful monitoring for hypotension and renal function changes. There is no evidence that prazosin improves renal outcomes or slows RAS progression, and it should not be used as monotherapy.

---

## Pathophysiology of renal artery stenosis and hypertension

RAS reduces renal perfusion, which activates the RAAS [^113o3gyu] and increases sympathetic tone [^113Wp73v]; together these changes drive hypertension and renal dysfunction. The **RAAS is the dominant mediator** [^113o3gyu], though sympathetic overactivity also contributes to elevated blood pressure [^115m31ic].

---

## Mechanism of action of prazosin

Prazosin, a selective alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, lowers blood pressure by reducing peripheral vascular resistance [^116n8hix]. It **does not directly inhibit the RAAS**, which is central to RAS-related hypertension [^113o3gyu].

---

## Clinical evidence for prazosin in renal artery stenosis

There is **no direct clinical evidence** supporting prazosin for RAS-specific hypertension. While its efficacy in general hypertension is established [^116n8hix], it does not target the RAAS, limiting its relevance in RAS [^113o3gyu].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend prazosin as first-line therapy** for RAS-related hypertension [^113u6WRa]. Instead, they emphasize RAAS blockade with standard combination therapy:

- **First-line therapy**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs for unilateral RAS; consider cautiously in bilateral severe RAS or a solitary kidney with close monitoring [^111qvRAE] [^113u6WRa].
- **Add-on therapy**: Calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics as first-line adjuncts [^116s4it7] [^113u6WRa].
- **Resistant hypertension**: Alpha-blockers (e.g. doxazosin) [^113Nopxh] may be considered as third-line agents, preferably with thiazides and beta-blockers to limit fluid retention and tachycardia.

Prazosin is **not specifically recommended** for RAS-related hypertension in any major guideline.

---

## Potential benefits and risks of prazosin in renal artery stenosis

### Potential benefits

Potential benefits include **blood pressure reduction** via peripheral vasodilation and possible **metabolic effects** (favorable lipid and glucose effects), though these are not specific to RAS [^116n8hix].

---

### Potential risks

- **Hypotension**: Risk of orthostatic hypotension, especially with other antihypertensives.
- **Renal function**: No evidence of renal protection; may cause hemodynamic instability in severe RAS.
- **Fluid retention**: May require combination with diuretics to prevent fluid retention [^113Nopxh].

---

## Comparison with other antihypertensive medications

| **Medication class** | **Mechanism** | **Ras-specific evidence** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ACE inhibitors/ARBs | RAAS blockade | - Strong evidence <br/> - First-line [^111qvRAE] | Strongly recommended [^113u6WRa] |
| Calcium channel blockers | Vasodilation | Effective adjuncts [^113u6WRa] | Recommended [^116s4it7] |
| Thiazide diuretics | Natriuresis | Effective adjuncts [^113u6WRa] | Recommended [^116s4it7] |
| Alpha-blockers (e.g. prazosin) | Alpha-1 blockade | - Limited evidence <br/> - Third-line | Not specifically recommended [^113Nopxh] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where prazosin may be considered

Prazosin may be considered only as a **third-line adjunct** [^113Nopxh] in RAS-related resistant hypertension, particularly when other agents are contraindicated or poorly tolerated. It should be used with diuretics and beta-blockers to mitigate fluid retention and tachycardia.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Patients on prazosin require **close monitoring** for hypotension, renal function changes, and fluid retention; regular blood pressure checks and renal function tests are essential.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Prazosin is **not recommended as first-line therapy** for RAS-related hypertension because it does not address RAAS activation. ACE inhibitors or ARBs remain the **cornerstone** [^113u6WRa], with calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics as preferred adjuncts. Prazosin may be used as a **third-line add-on** in resistant hypertension, with careful monitoring for hypotension and renal function changes [^113Nopxh].

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis, with fibromuscular dysplasia being the most frequent among other less common etiologies. A high index of suspicion based on clinical features is essential for diagnosis. Revascularization strategies are currently a topic of discussion and debate. When revascularization is deemed appropriate, atherosclerotic RAS is most often treated with stent placement, whereas patients with fibromuscular dysplasia are usually treated with balloon angioplasty. Ongoing randomized trials should help to better define the optimal management of RAS.

A decade later, two multicentre studies compared PTRA with stenting plus medical therapy versus medical treatment alone for the prevention of kidney disease progression in patients with ARVD. The Stent Placement for Atherosclerotic Stenosis of Renal Artery (STAR) trial randomly assigned 140 patients with ARVD (defined as a reduction in the luminal diameter of the renal artery ≥ 50%), normal or impaired renal function (estimated creatinine clearance 15 ml/min/1.73 m²) and controlled BP while receiving a stable medication dosage in the month before inclusion. The primary outcome was a 20% decrease in creatinine clearance during a 2-year follow-up. There was no difference between the two groups in the primary and several secondary endpoints, including changes in BP, incidence of refractory or malignant hypertension, pulmonary oedema, CV events, and all-cause mortality. However, almost one-third of the patients in the intervention group had a stenosis < 50% at the time of angiography and were not eventually treated. Further, 30% of patients included in the medical therapy group and 44% in the stent group had arterial occlusion to a small or shrunken kidney, or both, although renal size < 8 cm was an exclusion criterion.

The Angioplasty and Stenting for Renal Artery Lesions (ASTRAL) trial assigned 806 patients with evidence of renovascular disease and 'substantial' anatomical atherosclerotic stenosis (degree of stenosis not predefined) in at least one renal artery to revascularization plus medical therapy or to medical therapy alone. The primary outcome was renal function.

### Renal artery stenosis [^111AgBiw]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis is the most common secondary cause of hypertension and is predominantly caused by atherosclerosis. In suspected patients, a non-invasive diagnosis with ultrasound is preferred. Asymptomatic, incidentally found RAS does not require revascularization. In symptomatic patients requiring revascularization, renal artery stenting is the preferred therapy. Selecting appropriate patients for revascularization requires careful consideration of lesion severity and is optimized with a multidisciplinary team. All patients with atherosclerotic RAS should be treated with guideline-directed medical therapy, including:

- **Hypertension control**: It is crucial to manage blood pressure effectively in these patients.
- **Diabetes control**: Maintaining optimal blood sugar levels is necessary to prevent further complications.
- **Statins**: The use of statins is recommended to manage cholesterol levels.
- **Antiplatelet therapy**: This is advised to reduce the risk of thrombotic events.
- **Smoking cessation**: Encouraging patients to quit smoking can significantly improve outcomes.
- **Encouraging activity**: Patients should be encouraged to engage in physical activity as part of their treatment plan.

Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

In view of the results and possible limitations of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this field, and several pieces of observational data showing that percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) is associated with renal and cardiovascular (CV) benefits in patients with high-risk atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) phenotypes, a progressive shift in relevant recommendations from different bodies has occurred in recent years.

The expert group suggests careful evaluation of the degree of stenosis and the viability of the renal parenchyma of the stenotic kidney in candidates for revascularization. This is detailed in Table 4. Additionally, we recommend a personalized approach to selecting patients who will benefit from revascularization, based on the strong and moderately strong indications described in Table 5.

Additional parameters to consider in estimating overall renal and cardiovascular benefits should include the patient's age, duration of hypertension, presence of proteinuria, and comorbid conditions from other organs.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a common disorder in adults with atherosclerosis and is associated with hypertension, impaired renal function, congestive heart failure, and angina pectoris. The incidence of RAS is increasing due to the aging of the US population and the increasing prevalence of atherosclerosis. The case of Mrs. S, an 82-year-old woman with long-standing hypertension and unilateral RAS detected by magnetic resonance angiography, illustrates the challenges surrounding indications for revascularization. The discussion reviews the clinical presentation, natural history of RAS, and strategies for diagnosis. The role of medical therapy, surgery, and endovascular therapy is reviewed, particularly in the context of guidelines and systematic reviews to help clinicians and patients face this challenging decision.

### The role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in renal artery stenosis, renovascular hypertension, and ischemic nephropathy: Diagnostic implications [^113o3gyu]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a crucial role in pathophysiology and systemic correlations, serving as a major regulatory system for vascular and renal function. RAAS is a significant contributor to the pathogenesis of renal artery stenosis (RAS) and ischemic nephropathy. Activation of the RAAS, along with sympathetic overactivity, is largely responsible for the cardiovascular and renal morbidity in RAS patients. The evaluation of RAAS activity remains an unsolved issue in the clinical assessment of RAS/ischemic nephropathy and carries important therapeutic implications.

Selection of patients with RAS for revascularization procedures is based on the potential benefits in terms of improving or stabilizing renal function and enhancing blood pressure control. Unfortunately, this selection process remains a significant challenge for nephrologists.

### Managing acute presentations of atheromatous renal artery stenosis [^117UzMfp]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

**Heart failure syndromes**: Sustained hypertension and the salt and water volume-retaining state of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) play a role in the decompensation of patients with arterio-ventricular renal disease (ARVD) and heart failure. The hallmark 'flash pulmonary oedema' is a well-recognized manifestation of renal artery disease. Flash pulmonary oedema, also known as Pickering syndrome, describes a hyper-acute presentation of decompensated heart failure due to an acute rise in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Although it has become synonymous with bilateral severe RAS or severe RAS affecting a solitary kidney, prompting physicians to consider screening for this underlying arterial pathology, it can also present in patients with other conditions such as acute coronary syndrome. Previous reports from this unit have illustrated that patients presenting with heart failure syndromes, such as flash pulmonary oedema, and managed medically, have an increased risk for death and cardiovascular events.

### Renal artery stenosis: To intervene, or not to intervene, "that is the question" [^116hczKV]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) due to atherosclerosis continues to be a major cause of secondary hypertension. It can also lead to renal dysfunction due to ischemic nephropathy. While major clinical trials have emphasized that medical management should be preferred over angioplasty and stenting for the treatment of renal artery stenosis, clinical scenarios continue to raise doubts about the optimal management strategy. Herein, we present two cases that were admitted with hypertensive emergency and renal function deterioration.

Medical therapy failed to control the blood pressure, and in one patient, renal failure progressed to a point where renal replacement therapy was required. Both patients underwent angioplasty (for > 90% stenosis) and stent insertion, with successful resolution of stenosis by interventional radiology. Postoperatively, blood pressure gradually decreased with improvement in serum creatinine, and dialysis therapy was discontinued. At 4- and 8-month follow-up, both patients continue to do well with blood pressure readings in the 132–145/70–90 mmHg range.

This article highlights the importance of percutaneous interventions in the management of atherosclerotic RAS and calls for heightened awareness and careful identification of candidates who would benefit from angioplasty and stent insertion.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease in chronic heart failure: Should we intervene [^113qemqg]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis, which is also the most common cause of chronic heart failure (CHF). One-third of patients with CHF are reported to have significant renovascular disease. The presence of RAS confers a worse outcome in studies of hypertension and coronary disease, though data are lacking for patients with CHF. As the kidney is intricately involved in the fluid retention that occurs in CHF, an adverse effect of RAS on outcome would be expected.

Presentations of RAS in CHF include flash pulmonary oedema, hypertension, worsening of CHF, and worsening renal function. RAS commonly progresses and may cause worsening of renal function in patients with CHF and previously stable renal function. A variety of investigations that can safely and accurately identify RAS in CHF are available, although none is recommended in guidelines for the management of CHF.

Treatment for RAS, whether for hypertension, renal dysfunction, or pulmonary oedema, is at the discretion of the physician due to the lack of adequate randomized controlled trials demonstrating the efficacy and safety of intervention. As it is not clear how RAS should be managed in CHF, screening cannot be advocated. Currently, a multicentre randomized outcome trial, which includes a cohort of patients with RAS and CHF, is in progress to provide answers in this area of uncertainty.

### Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis: Current status and future directions [^113JheFh]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is a common, progressive problem that increases in prevalence with age and can have important clinical consequences such as hypertension, pulmonary edema, and renal failure. Additionally, it is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. This review aims to describe the status of knowledge and future directions for this evolving field.

Recent findings suggest that duplex Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography remain the most promising noninvasive screening tests for patients suspected of having the disease. Percutaneous revascularization continues to advance, achieving technical success in the vast majority of patients. However, the clinical benefit of revascularization for hypertension is modest. There is limited information available on the effect of revascularization on the preservation of renal function or on cardiovascular events and mortality.

Further studies are needed to identify which patients will benefit from percutaneous revascularization and to determine whether intervention provides an advantage over medical therapy, particularly concerning the preservation of renal function and reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

### Early rapid decline in kidney function as a beneficial sign after starting antihypertensive medication [^116D5P9m]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

In the CORAL trial, 947 participants with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and systolic hypertension or stage 3 chronic kidney disease (GFR not < 30 mL/min) were randomly assigned to receive either medical therapy plus renal artery stenting or medical therapy alone. The major finding was that "renal‐artery stenting did not confer a significant benefit with respect to the prevention of renal function loss and other clinical events (35.1% versus 35.8%, respectively; hazard ratio with stenting, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–1.17; P = 0.58)". However, a modest difference in systolic blood pressure favoring the stent group was noted (−2.3 mm Hg; 95% CI, −4.4 to −0.2; P = 0.03).

These results of the CORAL trial align with other major randomized controlled trials on renal angioplasty and/or stenting of renal artery stenosis. These include the recent, although prematurely stopped, RADAR (Randomised, multi‐centre, prospective study comparing best medical treatment versus best medical treatment plus renal artery stenting in patients with hemodynamically relevant atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis) study. Such trials suggested no benefit of endovascular procedures to restore, protect, or increase renal function in patients with renal artery stenosis but favored medical therapy.

Despite extensive interventional evidence, there remains ongoing discussion about the usefulness of endovascular revascularization in specific situations, such as ostial stenosis, reduced perfusion patterns, or resistive indexes.

### Beta blockers in the management of chronic kidney disease [^114omNoQ]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

The sympathetic nervous system modulates renal function through its receptors: namely, beta1 (cardiac output and renin release), alpha1 (systemic and renovascular constriction), and beta2 (renovascular dilation). Sympathetic overactivity is commonly seen in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is an important contributor to increasing the risk of cardiovascular events, as well as increasing renal disease progression.

Recent evaluations of drug use in people with CKD show a remarkably low percentage of patients receiving beta-blockers, especially in more advanced stages of CKD when cardiovascular risk is higher. This is largely due to the tolerability of these agents. Moreover, water-soluble beta-blockers such as atenolol and metoprolol are dialyzable and require supplementation to avoid exacerbation of arrhythmias following dialysis.

Newer vasodilating beta-blockers have better tolerability and different effects on renal hemodynamics, as well as metabolic variables. These effects are related to the relative alpha1-blocking effect of agents such as carvedilol and labetalol, with carvedilol having relatively greater alpha-blocking effects.

Few studies evaluate beta-blockers on cardiovascular risk in CKD patients. Studies with carvedilol demonstrate attenuated increases in albuminuria, as well as a reduction in cardiovascular events in CKD patients with hypertension. This paper reviews the animal and clinical trial data that evaluate beta-blockers in CKD, highlighting the vasodilating beta-blockers. It is apparent that greater use of this drug class for blood pressure control could further enhance patient outcomes.

### Managing acute presentations of atheromatous renal artery stenosis [^114SWFGc]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

Acute presentations of atheromatous RAS are relatively uncommon but should be considered in patients presenting with severe hypertension, acute heart failure syndromes, or rapidly deteriorating renal function, especially AKI, particularly if there is evidence of widespread atheromatous disease. A high index of suspicion is required for the diagnosis of RAS in these instances so that timely revascularization can be undertaken to restore or preserve renal function and reduce the incidence of hospital admissions for heart failure syndromes. These are situations in which targeted early renal revascularization has a genuine chance of improving survival.

### Managing acute presentations of atheromatous renal artery stenosis [^114szL6D]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) often follows an asymptomatic chronic course which may remain undetected for many years. However, there are certain critical acute presentations associated with ARVD that require a high index of suspicion for underlying high-grade renal artery stenosis (RAS) to improve patient outcomes. These acute presentations include decompensated heart failure syndromes, accelerated hypertension, rapidly declining renal function, and acute kidney injury (AKI). They are usually associated with bilateral high-grade RAS (greater than 70% stenosis) or high-grade RAS in a solitary functioning kidney, where the contralateral kidney is supplied by a vessel demonstrating renal artery occlusion (RAO). These presentations are typically underrepresented in large, randomized control trials, which, at the time of writing, have largely been negative regarding the benefit of revascularization.

- **Case presentation**: Here we describe nine individual patients with three classical presentations, including accelerated phase hypertension, heart failure syndromes, AKI, and a fourth category of patients who suffered representations. We describe their response to renal revascularization. The predominant presentation was consistent with ischemic nephropathy, all of whom had a positive outcome with revascularization.

- **Conclusion**: A high index of suspicion is required for the diagnosis of RAS in these instances so that timely revascularization can be undertaken to restore or preserve renal function and reduce the incidence of hospital admissions for heart failure.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A clinical practice document by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) board of the European Renal Association (ERA) and the Working Group Hypertension and the Kidney of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) [^111P3iAu]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

In the Renal Artery Stenosis in Coronary Artery Disease (RASCAD) trial, 84 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for ischemic heart disease and who had renal artery stenosis > 50% but ≤ 80% were randomized to revascularization plus standard medical therapy versus medical therapy alone. After one year, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome between groups, i.e. change in echocardiographic left ventricular mass index. The study had no inclusion criterion relevant to hypertension or other ARVD phenotypes, had slow enrollment rates, and a final population that was half of that planned.

The multicenter Cardiovascular Outcomes with Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL) study originally aimed to enroll 947 patients with ARVD and either uncontrolled systolic hypertension while taking two or more antihypertensive drugs or CKD and RAS > 80%, but enrolled 60% and had a systolic blood pressure reduction > 20 mmHg. The primary endpoint was a composite of death from CV or renal causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalization for CHF, progressive renal insufficiency, or the need for renal replacement therapy. The CORAL study replicated the findings of the STAR and ASTRAL trials and also showed no additional benefit in the composite primary endpoint when compared with medical therapy alone. However, several methodological issues appeared. Similar to the other clinical trials, patients with a presentation suggestive of critical RAS (flash pulmonary edema, refractory hypertension, or rapid loss of kidney function after ACEI/ARB use) were not adequately addressed.

### Clinical problems in renovascular disease and the role of nuclear medicine [^115M3nnx]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Although renovascular disease is defined as a stenosis of the main renal artery or its proximal branches (renal artery stenosis [RAS]), its clinical overview has changed dramatically over the last 15–20 years, and its management is more controversial than ever before. The issues not only involve diagnosis and treatment, but also concern the relative contribution of different pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the progression of kidney disease.

This discussion aims to emphasize the paradigm shift from a focus on renovascular hypertension (RVH) to preserving or recovering threatened renal function in patients with progressive atherosclerotic renovascular disease, up to its last stage of irreversible "ischemic nephropathy". In the past, the spotlight was on RVH, a rare disease where the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) was believed to be the predominant cause. The diagnosis of RVH was retrospectively confirmed based on the improvement or, less frequently, the cure of hypertension following revascularization. This was typically achieved through percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty with or without stent placement.

At that time, captopril radionuclide renography was a valuable diagnostic tool. It was a functional, noninvasive test aiming to demonstrate both the activation of RAAS and the lateralization (or asymmetry) of renin secretion by the kidney affected by a "hemodynamically significant" RAS.

### Atherosclerotic process, renovascular disease and outcomes from bench to bedside [^1151xMk9]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis has become an important cause of secondary hypertension and renal dysfunction in the aging population. Its presence increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality independent of other atherosclerotic risk factors. Therefore, novel renoprotective strategies are needed to decrease the impact of this disease.

Although medical therapy can be effective in patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and mild renal dysfunction, revascularization is desirable for patients with target-organ injury. Technical developments, such as drug-eluting or low-profile stents and distal protection devices, have increased the safety and effectiveness of renal revascularization. However, in a significant proportion of patients, renal function is not fully restored. Recent experimental evidence suggests that atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is associated with the activation of intrarenal fibrogenic and inflammatory pathways, oxidative stress, and microvascular remodeling. Blocking these mechanisms can improve renal hemodynamics and function.

Despite significant advances in revascularization techniques, it remains unclear why the kidney affected by atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis often does not improve or even progressively deteriorates. In addition to the restoration of blood flow, targeted interventions to attenuate injurious intrarenal mechanisms should probably become part of a comprehensive management plan to preserve the ischemic kidney.

### Elevations in serum creatinine with RAAS blockade: Why isn't it a sign of kidney injury [^111NxL9F]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). High credibility.

The aim of this article is to review the pertinent physiology and pathophysiology of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), summarize the proven beneficial cardiovascular and renal effects of RAAS blockade, examine clinical situations in which RAAS blockade may induce reductions in glomerular filtration rate, and explore why increases in serum creatinine in the setting of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy do not necessarily signify the presence of clinically relevant kidney failure.

- **Recent findings**: RAAS inhibition appears to reduce the likelihood of atrial fibrillation. It leads to improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic control but does not appear to prevent diabetes. The beneficial effects of ACEi/ARB therapy extend to those with significant renal disease. Combination ACEi/ARB is safe and reduces proteinuria more than either agent alone in patients with macroalbuminuric nephropathy. Acute deteriorations in renal function resulting from RAAS inhibition are usually reversible.

- **Summary**: RAAS blockade exerts potent hemodynamic, antihypertensive, and anti-inflammatory effects, and slows the progression of kidney disease beyond that due to lowering of blood pressure. The benefit extends to those with advanced disease. Despite established benefit, ACEi and ARB therapy remains underutilized, in part due to concerns about acute deteriorations in renal function resulting from interruption of the RAAS.

### A review of the current treatment of renal artery stenosis [^112rYdZx]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is associated with morbidity and mortality due to progressive ischemic renal failure and the cardiovascular consequences of hypertension. There is considerable uncertainty concerning the optimal management of patients with this condition. This review considers the aetiological factors and the physiological consequences of ARAS while comparing the results of clinical studies on medical and endovascular therapies regarding blood pressure control and the preservation of renal function.

- **Results**: Although, in patients with fibromuscular disease, the results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) are clearly superior to medical therapy and surgery, in asymptomatic patients with ARAS, the antihypertensive benefits and preservation of renal function of endovascular, surgical, and medical therapies appear similar. In selected symptomatic patients, interventions may, however, be life-saving. Surgery is generally reserved for arterial occlusions with preserved renal parenchyma and function.

- **Conclusions**: The results of larger, multicentre, randomized controlled trials are required to clarify the role of interventional therapy in asymptomatic patients clearly.

### Renal artery stenosis: Pathophysiology and treatment [^115xsHGK]. Expert Review of Cardiovascular Therapy (2009). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on renal artery stenosis:

- **Definition**: Renal artery stenosis is the narrowing of one or both renal arteries, leading to decreased blood flow to the kidneys.

- **Pathophysiology**: The most common causes of renal artery stenosis are atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), accounting for approximately 90% and 10% of renal artery stenosis cases, respectively. Renal artery stenosis decreases renal perfusion, triggering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which leads to renovascular hypertension and may cause ischemic nephropathy, resulting in progressive renal dysfunction.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of renal artery stenosis in the general population is estimated at 5–10%, and as high as 25% in elderly patients with hypertension.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for renal atherosclerosis include older age, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, tobacco use, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and a family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Risk factors for FMD include female sex, tobacco use, and a family history of FMD.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, renal artery stenosis can present with refractory hypertension, impaired renal function, pulmonary edema, and congestive heart failure (HF). Physical examination may reveal an abdominal bruit.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of renal artery stenosis can be severe if left untreated, potentially leading to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Patients undergoing revascularization for hypertension related to atherosclerotic stenosis should continue pharmacotherapy after the procedure to prevent renal and cardiovascular events. Restenosis occurs in 10–25% of cases.

### Time to re-appraise the role of alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonists in the management of hypertension [^116n8hix]. Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

The role of alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonists (alpha-blockers) in the management of hypertension continues to evolve. Recent data support their use as add-on therapy in uncontrolled hypertension when used in combination with all other major classes of antihypertensive drugs, and there is increasing evidence suggesting that they have modest but significant beneficial effects on lipid and glucose metabolism. The availability of extended-release formulations has contributed to an excellent tolerability profile.

New data from an observational analysis of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) suggest that doxazosin gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS), used as a third-line antihypertensive agent, lowered blood pressure and caused modest reductions in plasma lipids. Furthermore, use of doxazosin in ASCOT was not associated with an increased risk of heart failure, in contrast to the earlier finding of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT).

Overall, currently available data support the use of alpha-blockers as safe, well-tolerated, and effective add-on antihypertensive drugs, which have additional favorable metabolic effects.

### Total renal artery occlusion: Recovery of function after revascularization [^112pnLNi]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Trends in managing atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis favor medical therapy, due to negative results from prospective trials of revascularization, such as CORAL and ASTRAL. One result of this trend has been encountering occasional patients with progressive disease, sometimes leading to total arterial occlusion. We illustrate a case of accelerated hypertension with complete renal artery occlusion in which the patient recovered function after surgical bypass. We review the clinical approach used and the advanced imaging modalities available to us.

A high index of suspicion and careful radiologic imaging play important roles in selecting patients who may have residual function and may benefit from revascularization. This case illustrates an example where restoring renal artery perfusion for carefully selected patients can be life-changing, with recovery of kidney function and improved blood pressure, pill burden, and overall quality of life.

### Impact of percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty on autonomic nervous system and natriuresis in hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis [^113Wp73v]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis is associated with secondary hypertension, which is often resistant to antihypertensive medication. The most common cause of renal artery stenosis is atherosclerotic stenosis (ARAS), and fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) comprises most of the remaining causes. Treatment of hypertension due to renal artery stenosis includes medical therapy and revascularization. Previous randomized clinical trials compared medical therapy with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in patients with ARAS but could not prove the superiority of the latter for controlling hypertension and preserving renal function; however, these trials had significant design flaws, and the selection of ideal candidates for PTA is a controversial topic.

The renin–angiotensin system is generally recognized as the primary mediator in the mechanisms of development of renovascular hypertension. However, previous experimental evidence proved that efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity plays an important role in the development and maintenance of elevated blood pressure (BP) by modulating renin secretion and renal tubular sodium reabsorption. In renovascular patients with hypertension, the sympathetic nervous system is activated in relation to the activation of the angiotensin system.

Successful PTA may result in a significant BP decline relatively early; however, evidence of a BP-lowering effect of PTA on out-of-office BP in the early postoperative period is limited. Other than inactivation of the renin–angiotensin system, the precise pathophysiological mechanisms of the BP change after PTA remain unclear.

### Treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis [^116V3erj]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) has prompted more aggressive treatment of this condition in recent years. The goals are to reduce blood pressure and preserve jeopardized renal function. Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA), alone or in conjunction with stent implantation, may be useful for achieving both of these objectives. However, despite methodological improvements that make this procedure much safer than surgery, caution must be applied before extending PTRA to all patients with ARAS. Indeed, PTRA is associated with a 23% rate of major and minor complications, and a 20% rate of restenosis, even in arteries implanted with stents. Moreover, the cure rate of hypertension achievable with PTRA is, at best, around 10%, with a 40% rate of improvement. Even for rescuing the ischemic kidney, PTRA and stent implantation are not always effective; only 35% of patients with ARAS experience some improvement in renal function. These data indicate an urgent need for rigorous criteria to select which patients with ARAS may actually benefit from the dilation procedure.

### What is critical renal artery stenosis? Implications for treatment [^114qt9tt]. American Journal of Hypertension (2000). Low credibility.

Renovascular disease due to progressive atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is being diagnosed with increasing frequency in the elderly. It is not clear at what degree of renal artery stenosis intervention should be recommended. To answer this question, unilateral or bilateral activation of the renin-angiotensin system or its absence was detected by captopril-stimulated renal vein renin measurements in 49 hypertensive patients, aged 63 years, with normal or near-normal renal function (serum creatinine concentration ≤ 2.0 mg/dL), and the information was matched against radiographic measurements of the extent of renal artery stenosis.

With few exceptions, unilateral or bilateral hypersecretion of renin was associated with an 80% or greater reduction of renal artery lumen diameter. In contrast, normal secretion or suppression of renin production in a kidney contralateral to an ischemic one was associated with either normal caliber renal artery or renal artery stenosis less than 80%. These findings suggest that renal artery stenosis less than 80% should be monitored rather than treated because improvement of renal function and amelioration of hypertension are not expected unless the renin-angiotensin system has been activated in the affected kidney. Renoprotection by early intervention is uncertain because the progression of renal artery stenosis is unpredictable. Normal captopril-stimulated renal vein renin measurements in hypertensive patients obviate the need for further work-up or interventional therapy of renovascular disease.

### Contemporary imaging techniques for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis [^114EPk8x]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a potentially curable cause of renovascular hypertension (RVH) and is primarily caused by either atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) in most patients. Although intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA) remains the standard reference test for the anatomical diagnosis of RAS, noninvasive techniques such as MR angiography, CT angiography, and color-aided duplex ultrasonography offer promising alternatives that also allow for the functional characterization of RAS.

We provide an overview of these techniques and discuss their relative merits and shortcomings. Analysis of high-quality studies indicates that both MR and CT angiography are significantly more accurate for diagnosing at least 50% atherosclerotic RAS compared to ultrasonographic techniques. The primary strength of ultrasonography currently lies in its suggested ability to predict functional recovery based on preinterventional resistance index measurements.

A still unresolved issue is the detection of FMD. Because missing RVH may have serious consequences, the most important requirement for a screening test is that it possesses high sensitivity.

### Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis: Overtreated but underrated [^111eHTg5]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Despite evidence of only moderate clinical benefit, the application of renal endovascular stent procedures has increased at least four-fold in the past decade. Medicare is reviewing national coverage regarding reimbursement, questioning whether outcome data warrant many of these procedures. Several prospective, randomized trials are now in progress to compare outcomes with optimized medical therapy, with and without stenting. Imaging methods primarily establish the presence and severity of vascular occlusive disease. The optimal treatment for individual patients remains in flux and is reviewed here. Most importantly, nephrologists await the development of tools to reliably predict when renal parenchymal injury is beyond recovery and/or when revascularization can produce meaningful salvage of kidney function.

### Managing acute presentations of atheromatous renal artery stenosis [^116wQM2C]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) often follows an asymptomatic chronic course, which may remain undetected for many years. However, certain critical acute presentations associated with ARVD necessitate a high index of suspicion for underlying high-grade renal artery stenosis (RAS) to improve patient outcomes. These acute presentations include decompensated heart failure syndromes, accelerated hypertension, rapidly declining renal function, and acute kidney injury (AKI). They are usually associated with bilateral high-grade RAS (> 70% stenosis) or high-grade RAS in a solitary functioning kidney, in which case the contralateral kidney is supplied by a vessel demonstrating renal artery occlusion (RAO). These presentations are typically underrepresented in large randomized control trials which, at the time of writing, have been largely negative regarding the conferred benefit of revascularization.

- **Case presentation**: Here we describe nine individual patients with three classical presentations: accelerated phase hypertension, heart failure syndromes, and AKI. A fourth category of patients suffered presentations we labeled as "re-presentations". We describe their response to renal revascularization. The predominant presentation was consistent with ischemic nephropathy, all of whom had positive outcomes with revascularization.

- **Conclusion**: A high index of suspicion is required for the diagnosis of RAS in these cases to ensure timely revascularization, which can restore or preserve renal function and reduce the incidence of hospital admissions for heart failure.

### Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and reconstruction [^116HqUiN]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis is common, especially in patients with generalized atherosclerosis. It is frequently associated with difficult-to-treat hypertension and renal failure. There is an ongoing debate about the appropriate screening and treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. Advances in imaging and interventional devices offer new opportunities; however, clinicians must decide individually for each patient whether to treat stenosis with revascularization. This review evaluates the literature to assist physicians in making informed decisions regarding this challenging clinical issue.

### Timing and selection for renal revascularization in an era of negative trials: What to do [^1158bw8n]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Management of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis has become more complex with advances in both medical therapy and endovascular procedures. Results from recent trials fail to demonstrate major benefits of endovascular stenting in addition to optimal medical therapy. The general applicability of these results to many patients is limited by short-term follow-up and selection biases in recruitment. Many patients at highest risk were excluded from these studies, and some were included with trivial lesions.

Identification of patients with hemodynamically significant lesions remains a challenge and has led to more stringent criteria for Doppler ultrasound, measurement of translesional gradients, and quantitative angiography. Although many patients can now be managed with medical therapy, it should be recognized that long-term reduction in antihypertensive drug requirements and recovery of kidney function are limited to those undergoing renal revascularization. As with any major vascular lesion, follow-up for disease stability and/or progression is essential.

The ambiguity of present trial data may lead some to overlook selected subgroups that would benefit from restoring renal blood supply through revascularization. Further studies to more precisely identify kidneys that can recover function and/or are beyond meaningful recovery are essential. Considering the comorbid risks for the atherosclerotic population, it will remain imperative for clinicians to consider the hazards, costs, and benefits carefully for each patient to determine the role and timing for both medical therapy and renal revascularization.

### Diagnosis and treatment of renal artery stenosis [^1141u3Yn]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

A reduction in the diameter of the renal arteries can lead to hypertension, renal dysfunction, and/or pulmonary edema. About 90% of patients with renal artery stenosis have atherosclerosis, and 10% have fibromuscular dysplasia. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is a common condition that typically occurs in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease with coexistent vascular disease at nonrenal sites. Patients who undergo revascularization to treat hypertension associated with atherosclerotic stenosis need to continue medication with statins, antiplatelet agents, and renin-angiotensin antagonists after the procedure to prevent renal and cardiovascular events.

Two recent trials compared renal outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic stenosis who were treated with antihypertensive medication plus stenting with those in patients who were treated with medication alone. Available results favor a conservative approach (medication only) for most patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. These results, however, concern patients with stable clinical conditions and, in many cases, only moderate renal artery lesions. Blood pressure outcome after angioplasty is more favorable in patients with fibromuscular renal artery disease, who usually do not have renal failure, than in those with atherosclerosis.

### Revascularization versus medical therapy for renal-artery stenosis [^114bK6ES]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). High credibility.

The ASTRAL study, published by ASTRAL Investigators in 2009 in the Journal of The New England Journal of Medicine, addresses the diseases of renal artery stenosis and hypertension. The trial's primary question was: What is the role of percutaneous revascularization in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease? This multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) included 806 participants (299 females, 507 males) with atherosclerotic renovascular disease.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients diagnosed with atherosclerotic renovascular disease.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: Requirement of surgical revascularization or a high likelihood of needing revascularization within 6 months, presence of nonatheromatous cardiovascular disease, or previous revascularization for renal artery stenosis.

- **Interventions**:
	- Revascularization group (n = 403) received angioplasty, either alone or with stenting, plus medical therapy with statins, antiplatelet agents, and optimal blood-pressure control.
	- Medical therapy group (n = 403) received statins, antiplatelet agents, and optimal blood-pressure control.

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in the rate of decline in serum creatinine (-0.071 ×10⁻³ L/µmol/year vs. -0.131 ×10⁻³ L/µmol/year; mean difference 0.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0 to 0.13).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in renal events (22% vs. 22%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.97, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.4).
	- No significant difference in major cardiovascular events (49% vs. 51%; HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.19).
	- No significant difference in death rates (60% vs. 57%; HR 0.9).

### Scai expert consensus statement for renal artery stenting appropriate use [^113kPmhb]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) includes activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis with resultant renovascular hypertension. Renal artery stenting has emerged as the primary revascularization strategy in most patients with hemodynamically significant atherosclerotic RAS. Despite the frequency with which hemodynamically significant RAS is observed and high rates of technical success of renal artery stenting, there remains considerable debate among experts regarding the role of medical therapy versus revascularization for renovascular hypertension.

Modern, prospective, multicenter registries continue to demonstrate improvement in systolic and diastolic blood pressure with excellent safety profiles in patients with RAS. Modern randomized, controlled clinical trials of optimal medical therapy versus renal stenting are particularly designed to demonstrate preservation in renal function after renal artery stenting and have demonstrated limited benefit. However, these trials frequently excluded patients who might benefit from renal artery stenting.

This document was developed to guide physicians in the modern practical application of renal stenting, to highlight the limitations in the peer-reviewed literature, to suggest best practices in the performance of renal stenting, and to identify opportunities to advance the field.

### Progression of renal disease: Renoprotective specificity of renin-angiotensin system blockade [^112maove]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for the management of patients with chronic kidney disease recommend both lower optimal blood pressure (BP) targets and agents that block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) for specific additional BP-independent renoprotection. Although there are other compelling rationales to use RAS blockade in patients with chronic kidney disease, such as its antihypertensive effectiveness and ability to counteract the adverse effects of diuretics, a critical review of the available scientific evidence suggests that the specificity of renoprotection provided by RAS blockade has been greatly overemphasized.

Little evidence of truly BP-independent renoprotection is observed in experimental animal models when ambient BP is assessed adequately by chronic continuous BP radiotelemetry. Although the clinical trial evidence is somewhat stronger, the absolute magnitude of the BP-independent component of the renoprotection observed with RAS blockade, even when interpreted favorably, is much smaller than what is attributed to its antihypertensive effects.

### Balloon angioplasty, with and without stenting, versus medical therapy for hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis [^116xEx6D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Balloon angioplasty with stenting is widely used for the treatment of hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis; however, the effectiveness of this procedure in treating hypertension, improving renal function, and preventing adverse cardiovascular and renal events remains uncertain. This is an update, including the results of recent large trials, of a review first published in 2003.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effectiveness of balloon angioplasty (with and without stenting) with medical therapy for the treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in patients with hypertension. The following outcomes were compared: blood pressure control, renal function, frequency of cardiovascular and renal adverse events, presence or absence of restenosis of the renal artery, side effects of medical therapy, and numbers and defined daily doses of antihypertensive drugs.

- **Search methods**: For this update, the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Coordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched May 2014) and CENTRAL (2014, Issue 4). Bibliographies were also reviewed, and trial authors were contacted for more information.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing balloon angioplasty with medical therapy in hypertensive patients with haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis (greater than 50% reduction in luminal diameter) and with a minimum follow-up of six months.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted.

### Early rapid decline in kidney function in medically managed patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis [^116BFAu7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a common problem, especially in older individuals over the age of 70 years. Renal dysfunction is commonplace, and there is a strikingly high rate of adverse cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with impaired kidney function and renal artery stenosis. A number of studies have evaluated the factors that predict an improvement in kidney function after renal artery revascularization, commonly measured with estimates of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

One such factor is a rapid decline (RD) in kidney function. As a result, some authors have suggested that an RD in kidney function is an indication for stent revascularization. The utility of an RD in GFR as an indication for revascularization in medically managed patients has gained importance since three randomized trials have demonstrated that medical therapy without revascularization is the preferred treatment for most patients with atherosclerotic RAS.

We sought to determine the frequency of RD of kidney function in medically managed RAS patients and to examine the clinical outcomes with continued medical therapy. To perform this analysis, we used data from the CORAL (Cardiovascular Outcomes With Renal Artery Lesions) clinical trial to evaluate rapid changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) occurring within the first six months of medical management in patients with RAS.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A clinical practice document by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) board of the European Renal Association (ERA) and the Working Group Hypertension and the Kidney of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) [^1164MacD]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of blood pressure (BP) rise in renal artery stenosis (RAS) was first described 90 years ago. It is widely accepted that atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) with lumen stenosis greater than 70% will cause a reduction of renal blood flow and hypoperfusion of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, stimulating the release of renin followed by increased production of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Stenoses of lesser degrees are suggested to have minimal hemodynamic effects due to the compensatory mechanisms of renal autoregulation. However, renal autoregulation may be compromised in several groups, including the elderly and those with diabetes mellitus or heart failure (HF), and thus it cannot be excluded that renal blood flow in such patient groups could be compromised with stenoses of lesser degrees. Furthermore, ischemia of even a few nephrons can cause the full syndrome of renovascular hypertension, as shown in numerous cases of segmental RAS with excess unilateral renin release, striking hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus of affected glomeruli, and reversal of hypertension by partial nephrectomy or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use.

In unilateral RAS, the contralateral healthy kidney is expected to at least partly compensate for the adverse effects of renin-dependent hypertension through pressure natriuresis. However, in the increasingly common cases of bilateral RAS, this compensation is not possible, leading to sodium/volume retention and a volume-dependent hypertension phenotype with a higher risk of 'flash' pulmonary edema. The compensatory increase in renin-angiotensin levels in these scenarios can further exacerbate the condition.

### Renal artery stenosis: A cardiovascular perspective [^111frmTH]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is an important clinical entity that can lead to uncontrolled hypertension and progressive renal failure. The most common causes of RAS are atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia. The diagnosis of renovascular hypertension is established only when revascularization of a stenosed renal artery results in a cure or improvement in a patient's hypertension, making the establishment of a causal relationship between RAS and hypertension a continuing challenge. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is essential in diagnosing this condition.

- **Methods**: Multiple tests, both invasive and noninvasive, are available as screening methods. Angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing RAS. In addition to its value in establishing the diagnosis, it provides anatomical information regarding the site and severity of stenoses and appropriate revascularization strategies. Magnetic resonance angiography and duplex ultrasonography are the most promising and accurate noninvasive screening tests available, even in the presence of renal insufficiency. With advances in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty techniques, including renal artery stenting, many more patients are eligible for less invasive and effective revascularization strategies compared with traditional surgical procedures.

- **Results**: Revascularization of a stenosed renal artery is associated with preservation of renal function and better control of hypertension, unstable angina, and congestive heart failure. As atherosclerotic RAS is associated with generalized atherosclerosis, these treatment strategies offer significant benefits.

### Technical discussion of diagnostic angiography and intervention of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis [^111Sp8Qe]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenting remains an important adjuvant treatment for true-resistant hypertension, although recent disappointing randomized trials highlight the importance of careful patient selection. Safe and successful renal interventions begin with critical core knowledge regarding renal artery anatomy and understanding the often hostile nature of the parent vessel, the pararenal aorta. Armed with fundamental knowledge about anatomy and renal ostial disease pathology, it becomes easier to understand the advantages of less traumatic access techniques and how low-profile contemporary flexible stents have enhanced outcomes.

- **Suggested techniques**: Based on a detailed understanding of the vessel architecture and pathology, we will review the available US Food and Drug Administration-approved balloon-expandable on-label renal stents and discuss the role of intravascular ultrasound for the definition of lesion severity, stent sizing, and stent apposition.

- **Durability of renal stenting**: The durability of renal stenting will also be discussed, as will the velocity criteria for duplex surveillance.

Lastly, empirical data related to renal embolic protection is provided, along with insight into technical issues in this domain.

### Evaluation and treatment of renal artery stenosis: impact on blood pressure and renal function [^112ai1vW]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The conventional non-invasive tests to diagnose renal artery stenosis in a general hypertensive population are not accurate enough for screening purposes. Magnetic resonance angiography might become the new gold standard, with the advantages of the absence of contrast toxicity, good accuracy, and information on flow characteristics. With regard to the treatment of hypertension in patients with renal artery stenosis, intervention is advised only when blood pressure cannot be controlled by at least three antihypertensive drugs. Patency after stenting is superior to angioplasty, although its clinical benefit has not been proven.

For renal function, evidence — although from uncontrolled studies — for the preservation of renal function by intervention is accumulating, especially in those patients with bilateral stenosis or stenosis in a single functioning kidney.

### Frequency of renal artery stenosis after renal denervation in patients with resistant arterial hypertension [^1169kJEY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). High credibility.

Catheter-based ablation of nerves in the adventitia of renal arteries (renal artery denervation [RAD]) using radiofrequency energy can reduce blood pressure (BP) in patients with resistant arterial hypertension (RAH). The occurrence of renal artery stenosis after RAD remains an important concern. We systematically investigated the renal artery anatomy using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) angiography in a consecutive series of patients six months after RAD. Patients with RAH were treated by RAD after exclusion of secondary causes of hypertension. RAH was defined by a mean systolic office BP greater than 160 mm Hg. Renal artery imaging was performed six months after RAD by MRI angiography. In cases where MRI was contraindicated, a CT angiography was performed.

The primary endpoint was the incidence of significant renal artery stenosis, defined as a 70% or greater lumen diameter reduction. RAD was performed in 76 patients, and evaluation of renal artery anatomy by MRI (n = 66; 87%) or CT angiography (n = 10; 13%) was conducted in all patients six months after RAD. We found no cases of renal artery stenosis, but identified 2 cases of new nonsignificant stenosis, with lumen diameter reductions between 50% and 69%. In responders, the mean systolic office BP reduction was 30 mm Hg (p < 0.001) and the mean systolic 24-hour BP reduction was 18 mm Hg (p < 0.001).

In conclusion, the incidence of significant renal artery stenosis six months after RAD appears to be very low. However, late-onset development of nonsignificant renal artery narrowing cannot be excluded in some patients and should be anticipated in the case of RAH relapse or worsening.

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115YJBye]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers and alpha-blockers can offer important help towards blood pressure (BP) lowering in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), since sympathetic activity is commonly increased; however, their effects in CKD have not been tested in trials with hard kidney outcomes. Bisoprolol (5–10 mg/day), doxazosin extended release (4–8 mg/day), or a centrally acting agent such as the alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists (clonidine 0.1–0.3 mg, or moxonidine 0.2–0.3 mg twice daily) can be used. However, bisoprolol and doxazosin reduced BP less effectively than spironolactone in the PATHWAY-2 trial, while clonidine has shown similar BP-lowering effects to spironolactone in resistant hypertension, with several side effects. Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs), if used together with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, were associated with reductions in proteinuria and decline of kidney function in proteinuric CKD, but when added to a RAS blocker in normoalbuminuric hypertensive subjects, do not seem to offer additional nephroprotection.

Direct vasodilators, such as hydralazine or minoxidil, should be used parsimoniously because they may cause severe fluid retention and reflex sympathetic activation with tachycardia. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that endovascular renal denervation (RDN) can be associated with a significant, albeit not marked, office and ambulatory BP reduction in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. In a large registry of renal denervated patients, the BP reduction was long-lasting and devoid of significant safety problems. RDN can thus be proposed as an adjunctive therapy to patients with resistant hypertension provided estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is greater than 40 mL/min/1.73 m².

### Balloon angioplasty versus medical therapy for hypertensive patients with renal artery obstruction [^117129ro]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Balloon angioplasty is widely used for the treatment of hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this systematic review was to compare the effectiveness of balloon angioplasty (with and without stenting) with medical therapy on blood pressure control, renal function, frequency of renovascular complications, and side effects in hypertensive patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.

- **Search strategy**: The reviewers performed a search of MEDLINE from 1966 to December 2002, EMBASE from 1980 to 2002, Science Citation Index from 1990 to 2002, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and personal files to identify randomized controlled trials comparing balloon angioplasty with medical therapy in hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis. In addition, reference lists of papers resulting from this search were hand-searched, and authors of published trials were contacted to enquire if they were aware of any eligible unpublished trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing balloon angioplasty with medical therapy in hypertensive patients with hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis (greater than 50 percent reduction in luminal diameter and minimal follow-up of six months).

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two investigators independently extracted data on trial design, characteristics of trial participants, types of interventions, and outcome measures.

### Renal artery stenosis: If and when to intervene [^111FMXcy]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to address the prevalence of atherosclerotic renovascular disease, which presents an array of clinical syndromes. Recent prospective trials have somewhat dampened enthusiasm for revascularization, but clinicians recognize the need to identify patients who are likely to benefit from vascular intervention.

Recent findings highlight the inflammatory nature of vascular occlusive disease and the limits of the kidney's ability to adapt to reduced blood flow. Although moderate reductions can be tolerated, severe impairment of renal perfusion leads to tissue hypoxia and activates inflammatory injury within the kidney. Hence, assessment of kidney viability and the development of potential tools to modify mitochondrial and inflammatory damage may be important to identify patients for whom clinical intervention should be undertaken.

In summary, clinicians must recognize clinical syndromes that identify 'high-risk' groups and apply revascularization in those likely to benefit. Future efforts to protect the kidney, such as mitochondrial protection or cell-based therapy, may amplify clinical recovery when combined with restoring renal blood flow.

### Limitations of angiography for the assessment of renal artery stenosis and treatment implications [^116Kr5pG]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2010). Low credibility.

Renovascular hypertension due to atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Percutaneous catheter-based renal artery revascularization has been increasingly utilized for the treatment of renal artery stenosis. Renal artery stenting has a high technical success rate, but the rate of improvement in hypertension is somewhat less than expected with this technique. Misinterpretation of angiographic images may play a role in these unfavorable clinical results. We present a case in which the diagnosis of severe renal artery stenosis was not apparent by angiography.

Intravascular ultrasound and translesional pressure gradient measurements during arteriography can help to determine the precise severity of stenosis and may augment the clinical results of percutaneous renal artery stent placement.

### Comprehensive renal artery stenosis management by nephrology: A more selective approach [^114bhhQY]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

The impact of renal artery stenosis (RAS) and resulting ischemic nephropathy on kidney function has been well described. Based on several recent randomized, multicenter trials that revealed limitations to the utility of nonselective renal artery intervention, the general nephrology community has recently taken a conservative stance on this disease state. The purpose of this report is to summarize some recent contributions to our understanding of renal artery stenosis, which may cast RAS intervention in a new light.

### Current issues in the diagnosis and management of patients with renal artery stenosis: A cardiologic perspective [^115ui1qB]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis is most often caused by atherosclerosis. Although patients with renal artery stenosis can be managed conservatively, renal revascularization may be indicated, particularly in patients with refractory hypertension on a multidrug regimen and those with declining renal function. Duplex ultrasonography of the renal arteries and magnetic resonance angiography are currently the most efficient noninvasive methods for the evaluation of renal artery stenosis. Selective digital subtraction renal arteriography remains the gold standard for the definitive diagnosis. In selected patients undergoing coronary studies, performing angiography immediately after the coronary procedure can be efficient.

Atherosclerotic renal artery lesions, which commonly affect the renal artery ostium, can be treated safely and effectively with balloon-expandable stents. Successful angioplasty commonly results in improved control of hypertension, but an overall benefit on renal function and/or patient survival has not been shown. Generally, the risk/benefit ratio of renal artery stenting seems favorable, but further randomized studies are needed for evidence-based decision making. All patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis should receive rigorous secondary prevention measures including platelet inhibitors, statins, and beta-blockers.

### Therapy for renal artery stenosis: A call for change [^113jiHMw]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2024). Low credibility.

We present a brief case description of a patient who benefited from stenting in ARAS and provide a comprehensive review of ARAS, including its prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment. We review the evidence for and against stenting in ARAS as well as consensus guidelines for stenting. Our review is valuable as we argue that stenting in ARAS is underutilized, and the randomized control data for stenting in those patients who may benefit most is lacking. Our review will provide an important perspective for clinicians faced with decisions on how to treat ARAS.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, specifically with respect to treatment goals and clinical targets, the ESH 2023 guidelines recommend considering the use of α-1 blockers, such as doxazosin, for the prevention of heart failure in hypertension patients. These should preferably be used in combination with thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics and β-blockers to avoid fluid retention and tachycardia.
