## Question

Is some amount of hypothyroid symptoms expect in 1 month postpartum patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether some amount of hypothyroid symptoms is expected in 1-month postpartum patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the timing of postpartum thyroiditis phases. Then, I should verify how often symptoms occur in the early postpartum period. Next, I will consider overlapping non-thyroid causes of fatigue and mood changes at 1 month. After that, I should review guideline positions on screening and when to test. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with caveats and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the timing of postpartum thyroiditis, because if the hypothyroid phase typically starts later, symptoms at 1 month would be less likely to be thyroid-related. The classic course is a thyrotoxic phase around 1–6 months postpartum, often followed by a hypothyroid phase around 3–12 months, so a purely hypothyroid presentation at 1 month is not the expected pattern, although isolated hypothyroidism without a preceding thyrotoxic phase can occur in a subset of cases [^0bfb213f] [^410268a5] [^95fb2218].

> Wait, let me verify symptom prevalence in the early postpartum window. Most women with postpartum thyroiditis are asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic during the initial thyrotoxic phase, and the hypothyroid phase — when symptoms like fatigue, cold intolerance, dry skin, impaired concentration, and paresthesias are more common — tends to emerge after the first month, so at 1 month the likelihood of overt hypothyroid symptoms from PPT is low but not zero [^23e0a5bc] [^0bfb213f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any fatigue or mood change at 1 month being thyroid disease. I need to check for more common explanations: sleep deprivation, anemia, lactation demands, and postpartum adjustment are prevalent at 1 month and can mimic hypothyroid symptoms, so thyroid dysfunction should be considered alongside these non-thyroid causes rather than assumed to be the primary driver.

> I should confirm guideline positions on screening, because that informs how often we should attribute symptoms to thyroid disease at 1 month. Major guidelines do not recommend universal postpartum thyroid screening; instead, they advise case-finding in symptomatic women or those with risk factors, and they emphasize that most early postpartum thyroid dysfunction is transient and often mild, reinforcing that routine hypothyroid symptoms at 1 month are not expected in the general population [^42a41406] [^fddba247] [^410268a5].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk or already on levothyroxine from pregnancy? I need to ensure I address that nuance. Women with thyroid autoantibodies, type 1 diabetes, prior PPT, or those on LT4 during pregnancy have a higher risk of postpartum thyroid dysfunction; in these scenarios, symptoms at 1 month may warrant earlier evaluation, and guidelines support targeted testing rather than universal screening, with postpartum TSH checks around 6 weeks if LT4 was used in pregnancy [^d01d9dd6] [^1d3d87ee] [^26d4c594].

> Let me synthesize and be precise. No, some amount of hypothyroid symptoms is not expected at 1 month postpartum in the general population; most PPT-related hypothyroidism emerges after the first month, and early postpartum complaints are usually due to non-thyroid causes. However, a minority of women, particularly those with thyroid autoimmunity or prior thyroid disease, can develop PPT earlier or present with isolated hypothyroidism, so symptoms at 1 month should be contextualized and tested selectively rather than assumed to be thyroid-related [^0bfb213f] [^410268a5] [^23e0a5bc].

> I should double-check practical next steps. If symptoms are present at 1 month, assess for common postpartum etiologies and consider TSH (with reflex FT4) if symptoms are persistent, atypical, or risk factors exist; if TSH is abnormal, repeat testing in 4–8 weeks to confirm the trajectory, and if hypothyroidism is confirmed, treat symptomatic women or those who are breastfeeding or attempting pregnancy, recognizing that many cases are transient and may resolve, though a meaningful fraction progress to permanent hypothyroidism over time [^b9b61597] [^b9b61597] [^87298def].

It is **not expected** for women to have hypothyroid symptoms at 1 month postpartum. Postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) — the main cause of new hypothyroidism after delivery — typically presents with a **thyrotoxic phase at 1–3 months** and a **hypothyroid phase at 3–12 months** [^0bfb213f] [^e6f3d2b6]. Thus, hypothyroid symptoms at 1 month are uncommon and should prompt evaluation for other causes or early/atypical PPT. If symptoms persist or risk factors exist (e.g. TPOAb positivity, type 1 diabetes), check TSH and free T4; treat if symptomatic or TSH > 10 mIU/L, and monitor for progression to permanent hypothyroidism [^b9b61597] [^87298def].

---

## Normal postpartum thyroid function changes

Pregnancy causes **physiological changes** in thyroid function, including increased thyroid hormone production and altered thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. After delivery, these changes reverse, and thyroid function generally returns to pre-pregnancy baseline within a few weeks to months [^f625cedc]. However, some women may experience transient thyroid dysfunction during this period, known as postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) [^0bfb213f].

---

## Timing and clinical course of postpartum thyroiditis

PPT is an autoimmune thyroid disorder that occurs within the first year after childbirth, with a prevalence of approximately 5–10% [^e6f3d2b6]. The clinical course of PPT typically follows a **triphasic pattern**:

- **Thyrotoxic phase**: Occurs between 1 and 3 months postpartum, characterized by transient hyperthyroidism due to release of preformed thyroid hormones from damaged thyroid follicles [^410268a5].
- **Hypothyroid phase**: Occurs between 3 and 12 months postpartum, characterized by hypothyroidism due to depleted thyroid hormone stores and impaired synthesis [^0bfb213f].
- **Recovery phase**: Most women return to euthyroidism within 12 months postpartum, but approximately 10–20% develop permanent hypothyroidism [^87298def].

Given this timeline, **hypothyroid symptoms at 1 month postpartum are not typical** and may indicate early or atypical PPT or another thyroid disorder.

---

## Prevalence of hypothyroid symptoms at 1 month postpartum

There is limited data specifically addressing the prevalence of hypothyroid symptoms at 1 month postpartum. However, given the typical course of PPT, hypothyroid symptoms are **unlikely to manifest at 1 month postpartum**. Most women who develop PPT experience the hypothyroid phase later, typically between 3 and 12 months postpartum [^0bfb213f]. Therefore, hypothyroid symptoms at 1 month postpartum are uncommon and should prompt further evaluation.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) provide the following recommendations regarding postpartum thyroid function:

- **Routine screening**: Routine screening for thyroid dysfunction at 1 month postpartum is not recommended. Screening is generally reserved for women with symptoms, risk factors, or a history of thyroid disease [^fb372761] [^fddba247].
- **Symptomatic women**: Women experiencing symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, or depression, should undergo thyroid function testing (TSH and free T4) [^c7c2271e].
- **Risk factors**: Women with risk factors for PPT, such as positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb), type 1 diabetes mellitus, or a history of PPT, should be monitored closely for thyroid dysfunction [^d01d9dd6].

---

## Clinical implications and management

If hypothyroid symptoms are present at 1 month postpartum, clinicians should:

- **Evaluate thyroid function**: Measure TSH and free T4 levels to assess for hypothyroidism or other thyroid disorders [^c7c2271e].
- **Consider alternative diagnoses**: Evaluate for other common postpartum conditions that may cause similar symptoms, such as anemia, postpartum depression, or nutritional deficiencies [^notfound].
- **Monitor progression**: If PPT is diagnosed, monitor thyroid function every 4–8 weeks until normalization, as some women may progress to permanent hypothyroidism [^c7c2271e] [^87298def].

---

## Conclusion

In summary, it is **not expected** for women to experience hypothyroid symptoms at 1 month postpartum. The hypothyroid phase of PPT typically occurs later, between 3 and 12 months postpartum. If hypothyroid symptoms are present at 1 month, further evaluation is warranted to rule out early or atypical PPT or other underlying conditions.

American Thyroid Association — postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) definition and clinical course: PPT is the occurrence of thyroid dysfunction, excluding GD, in the first postpartum year in women who were euthyroid prior to pregnancy. The clinical course varies with approximately one quarter classical (transient thyrotoxicosis then hypothyroidism), one quarter isolated thyrotoxicosis, and one half isolated hypothyroidism. The thyrotoxic phase typically occurs between 2 and 6 months postpartum (reported as late as 1 year) and all episodes resolve spontaneously. The hypothyroid phase occurs from 3 to 12 months postpartum with 10%–20% resulting in permanent hypothyroidism, though a prospective study reported that 50% of women with PPT remained hypothyroid at the end of the first postpartum year.

Postpartum thyroiditis — diagnosis and treatment: Postpartum thyroiditis is defined as thyroid dysfunction within 12 months of delivery and occurs in approximately 5–10% of women during the first year after childbirth; the propensity is directly related to increasing serum levels of thyroid autoantibodies. Two clinical phases may occur in succession and are confirmed by new-onset abnormal levels of TSH and free T4; the first is destruction-induced thyrotoxicosis that usually lasts only a few months, for which thioamides are generally ineffective but a β-blocking drug may be helpful if symptoms are severe, and the second is overt hypothyroidism between 4 and 8 months postpartum. In cases of postpartum depression, a screening TSH to rule out thyroid dysfunction is reasonable. Although most cases resolve spontaneously, approximately one third eventually develop permanent, overt hypothyroidism and the annual progression rate is 3.6%; the American Thyroid Association recommends periodic thyroid testing to evaluate for overt hypothyroidism. Risk of postpartum thyroiditis and permanent hypothyroidism is increased in women with thyroid autoantibodies, particularly with higher antibody titers.

Recommendation 96 — Evaluation of postpartum thyrotoxicosis: In women developing thyrotoxicosis after delivery, diagnostic studies should be performed to distinguish postpartum destructive thyroiditis from postpartum GD. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Postpartum thyroid dysfunction occurs in up to 10% of pregnancies in the United States with a classic triphasic pattern of thyrotoxicosis at 1–6 months postpartum followed by hypothyroidism and return to euthyroidism at 9–12 months postpartum. Among 371 cases in 13 studies, 25% had a triphasic pattern, 43% had hypothyroidism without preceding thyrotoxicosis, and 32% had thyrotoxicosis without subsequent hypothyroidism. Those with positive anti–thyroid peroxidase antibodies in the first trimester were 27 times more likely to develop postpartum thyroiditis than those with negative serology. The postpartum surge in thyroid autoimmunity is associated with a 3- to 4-fold increase in the incidence of GD that peaks 3–12 months after delivery, and in a Japanese hospital study all patients who developed overt thyrotoxicosis within the first 3 months after delivery suffered from destructive thyroiditis.

### Approach to the patient with postpartum thyroiditis [^95fb2218]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) is the occurrence of de novo autoimmune thyroid disease, excluding Graves' disease, in the first year postpartum. The incidence of PPT is 5.4% in the general population, and it is increased in individuals with other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes mellitus. The classic presentation of PPT of hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism is seen in 22% of cases. The majority of women with PPT experience an isolated hypothyroid phase (48%), with the remainder experiencing isolated thyrotoxicosis (30%). Up to 50% of women who are thyroid antibody positive (thyroid peroxidase antibody and/or thyroglobulin antibody) in the first trimester will develop PPT. Symptoms are more common in the hypothyroid phase of PPT and include fatigue, dry skin, and impaired memory. Despite multiple studies exploring the relationship between PPT and postpartum depression, or postpartum depression in thyroid antibody-positive euthyroid women, the data are conflicting, and no firm conclusions can be reached. Long-term follow-up of women who had an episode of PPT reveals a 20–40% incidence of permanent primary hypothyroidism. In a single study, selenium administration significantly decreased the incidence of PPT, but replication of the findings is needed before the recommendation can be made that all pregnant thyroid peroxidase antibody-positive women receive selenium. The indication for treating the hyperthyroid phase of PPT is control of symptoms, whereas treatment of the hypothyroid phase of PPT is indicated for symptomatic relief as well as in women who are either breastfeeding or attempting to conceive.

Thyroid autoimmunity and prevalence considerations informing screening: Overt hypothyroidism is prevalent in 0.3%–0.5% of pregnant women and is asymptomatic in about 70% of patients. Anti-TPO positivity occurs in up to 17% of reproductive age women and identifies women at risk for developing hypothyroidism during gestation (20%) and postpartum thyroiditis (30–50%). Screening programs described elsewhere often have initial evaluation between 10 and 15 weeks of gestation, and no data support an anti-TPO–based universal testing algorithm at present.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction before or during pregnancy: Whether to universally screen for thyroid disease either before or during pregnancy remains controversial. Untreated overt hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are associated with adverse obstetrical and fetal outcomes. However, overt thyroid dysfunction is less common than subclinical dysfunction and is frequently identified by clinical assessment at the time of presentation. Thus, the most notable impact of a universal screening mandate for thyroid dysfunction would be the identification of the large proportion of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (mild elevations in serum TSH with normal thyroid hormone levels).

### Management of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy and postpartum: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^c9ff53e6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to update the guidelines for the management of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy and postpartum published previously in 2007. A summary of changes between the 2007 and 2012 version is identified in the Supplemental Data (published on The Endocrine Society's Journals Online web site at http://jcem.endojournals.org).

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed according to the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force, grading items level A, B, C, D, or I, on the basis of the strength of evidence and magnitude of net benefit (benefits minus harms) as well as the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

The guideline was developed through a series of e-mails, conference calls, and one face-to-face meeting. An initial draft was prepared by the Task Force, with the help of a medical writer, and reviewed and commented on by members of The Endocrine Society, Asia and Oceania Thyroid Association, and the Latin American Thyroid Society. A second draft was reviewed and approved by The Endocrine Society Council. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated substantive changes.

Conclusions

Practice guidelines are presented for diagnosis and treatment of patients with thyroid-related medical issues just before and during pregnancy and in the postpartum interval. These include evidence-based approaches to assessing the cause of the condition, treating it, and managing hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, gestational hyperthyroidism, thyroid autoimmunity, thyroid tumors, iodine nutrition, postpartum thyroiditis, and screening for thyroid disease. Indications and side effects of therapeutic agents used in treatment are also presented.

Postpartum thyrotoxicosis — postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) is the most common cause in the postpartum period, with a thyrotoxicosis prevalence of 4%, and the majority of women return to euthyroidism by 1 year post partum. The postpartum increase in thyroid autoimmunity is also associated with a 3- to 4-fold increase in the incidence of new Graves' disease (GD), and in one study the overall relapse rate of GD following a pregnancy was 84%, as compared to a relapse rate of 56% in women who did not become pregnant.

### Postpartum thyroid dysfunction and postpartum depression: are they two linked disorders? [^02b51e14]. Clinical Endocrinology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Postpartum has been considered as a period of risk for developing postpartum depression (PD) by some but not all authors, and this PD has been linked with postpartum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD). The major aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between the presence of PPTD and PD.

Design and Patients

Six hundred and forty-one healthy Caucasian women recruited between their 36th week of pregnancy and fourth day postpartum underwent clinical and laboratory evaluation and were checked again at 1 (n = 605), 3 (n = 552), 6 (n = 574), 9 (n = 431), and 12 (n = 444) months postpartum.

Measurements

At baseline and at each clinical evaluation, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to screen PD. The definitive diagnoses of PD was performed by a psychiatrist according to the DSM-III-R criteria. At each visit, we determined serum free T4 and TSH concentrations. Thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies were determined only in patients with abnormal hormone concentrations. Postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) was considered to be present in women with overt or subclinical transient hyperthyroidism between 1 and 3 months postpartum and/or overt or subclinical hypothyroidism between 3 and 6 months postpartum.

Results

Fifty-six women developed postpartum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD), corresponding to an incidence rate of 11%: 45 with PPT [incidence rate 7.8%; confidence interval (CI) 5.6–10%], eight with Graves' disease (incidence rate 1.5%; CI 0.5–2.5%) and three with nonpalpable toxic thyroid adenoma (incidence rate 0.5%; CI 0–1.5%). Five hundred and eighty of the evaluated women (incidence rate 90.5%; CI 95% 88.2–92.8) presented BDI scores below 21 and therefore the PD diagnoses was excluded. In 50 cases (incidence rate 7.8%; Cl 95% 5.7–9.8), we detected a BDI score over 21 in some evaluations, but the PD diagnosis was not confirmed. Another 11 (incidence rate 1.7%; CI 95% 0.7–2.7) were diagnosed as having PD and required psychiatric treatment. None of the PPTD was diagnosed as having PD. The BDI scores frequency over 21 was similar between healthy women and those with PPTD. Patients with a previous history of depression developed PD more often (P < 0.0001). One hundred and ninety women breast fed their babies for more than 2 months, without observing a higher PD rate or BDI scores over 21 (P = 0.5).

Conclusions

We found a general PD incidence rate of 1.7% in our group of patients. This figure is not higher in women with hormone abnormalities caused by PPTD. Women with a past history of depression present a higher risk of PD while those who breast fed did not have an increased risk.

### The biochemical and clinical course of postpartum thyroid dysfunction: the treatment decision [^f9f80596]. Clinical Endocrinology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To follow the clinical and biochemical course of a cohort of women who had postpartum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD) at 6 months postpartum and to examine the treatment practices of general practitioners and endocrinologists in the setting of PPTD.

Design

Prospective longitudinal study.

Setting

Metropolitan, Perth, Australia.

Participants

Eighty-six Caucasian women who were identified to have PPTD at 6 months postpartum in a cross-sectional study of 748 women.

Main Outcome Measures

Characteristics of the clinical and biochemical course of PPTD and documentation of the treatment practices and factors influencing treatment of PPTD by general practitioners and endocrinologists.

Results

Sixteen of 86 women (19%) were receiving treatment at 9 months postpartum and by 30 months postpartum 27% of women had received treatment for PPTD. Fifty-one percent of those not treated were biochemically euthyroid at 9 months, although, for those with hypothyroid biochemistry at 6 months, the median TSH at 18 months was at the upper limit of the reference range. Thyroid peroxidase antibody titre fell over the 2 years of follow-up. There was no significant change in clinical parameters over the study. Forty-nine percent of endocrinologists and 73% of general practitioners reported that they required clinical signs or symptoms before initiating treatment for hypothyroid PPTD.

Conclusions

In a cohort of women with postpartum thyroid dysfunction, a quarter received treatment. Elevated TSH in untreated women does not completely return to the normal median. The role of clinical assessment in treatment decision-making differs between primary care physicians and endocrinologists. A case is made for the early Institution of permanent thyroxine replacement in women with postpartum thyroid dysfunction, elevated TSH and positive thyroid antibodies.

Because high-risk patients were treated in both arms, the study is often viewed as insufficient to warrant a universal screening mandate.

### Thyroiditis: evaluation and treatment [^b4a42fed]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Thyroiditis is a general term for inflammation of the thyroid gland. The most common forms of thyroiditis encountered by family physicians include Hashimoto, postpartum, and subacute. Most forms of thyroiditis result in a triphasic disease pattern of thyroid dysfunction. Patients will have an initial phase of hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis) attributed to the release of preformed thyroid hormone from damaged thyroid cells. This is followed by hypothyroidism, when the thyroid stores are depleted, and then eventual restoration of normal thyroid function. Some patients may develop permanent hypothyroidism. Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder that presents with or without signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism, often with a painless goiter, and is associated with elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis and overt hypothyroidism are generally treated with lifelong thyroid hormone therapy. Postpartum thyroiditis occurs within one year of delivery, miscarriage, or medical abortion. Subacute thyroiditis is a self-limited inflammatory disease characterized by anterior neck pain. Treatment of subacute thyroiditis should focus on symptoms. In the hyperthyroid phase, beta blockers can treat adrenergic symptoms. In the hypothyroid phase, treatment is generally not necessary but may be used in patients with signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism or permanent hypothyroidism. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids are indicated for the treatment of thyroid pain. Certain drugs may induce thyroiditis, such as amiodarone, immune checkpoint inhibitors, interleukin-2, interferon-alfa, lithium, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In all cases of thyroiditis, surveillance and clinical follow-up are recommended to monitor for changes in thyroid function.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^08e8fbd1]. Thyroid (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid disease in pregnancy is a common clinical problem. Since the guidelines for the management of these disorders by the American Thyroid Association (ATA) were first published in 2011, significant clinical and scientific advances have occurred in the field. The aim of these guidelines is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on published evidence relating to the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease in women during pregnancy, preconception, and the postpartum period.

Methods

The specific clinical questions addressed in these guidelines were based on prior versions of the guidelines, stakeholder input, and input of task force members. Task force panel members were educated on knowledge synthesis methods, including electronic database searching, review and selection of relevant citations, and critical appraisal of selected studies. Published English language articles were eligible for inclusion. The American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System was used for critical appraisal of evidence and grading strength of recommendations. The guideline task force had complete editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of guideline task force members were regularly updated, managed, and communicated to the ATA and task force members.

Results

The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid disease in pregnancy include recommendations regarding the interpretation of thyroid function tests in pregnancy, iodine nutrition, thyroid autoantibodies and pregnancy complications, thyroid considerations in infertile women, hypothyroidism in pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy, thyroid nodules and cancer in pregnant women, fetal and neonatal considerations, thyroid disease and lactation, screening for thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy, and directions for future research.

Conclusions

We have developed evidence-based recommendations to inform clinical decision-making in the management of thyroid disease in pregnant and postpartum women. While all care must be individualized, such recommendations provide, in our opinion, optimal care paradigms for patients with these disorders.

Painless thyroiditis — clinical features and management emphasize that the postpartum period is the most common time, it can occur in nonpregnant patients and men, and it has been described with drug-induced thyroid dysfunction including lithium or cytokine therapy; the latter includes IFN-α or interleukin-2 but not IFN-β therapy. Beta-adrenergic blockers can be used to treat thyrotoxic symptoms, antithyroid drugs have no utility, corticosteroids have been used rarely but should be reserved only for more severe cases, and some patients may have recurrent episodes separated by years.

### Postpartum thyroid dysfunction… [^410268a5]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Until recently, postpartum thyroid dysfunction generally referred to secondary hypothyroidism due to pituitary failure. Although cases of postpartum primary hypothyroidism have been previously reported, 1 the pioneering work of Amino and colleagues2-4 in Osaka, Japan, followed by three series from Canada, 5 England, 6 and the United States, 7 has led to recognition of the syndrome of postpartum thyroid dysfunction. What is postpartum thyroid dysfunction. This usually refers to postpartum silent thyroiditis, a syndrome of transient low radioactive iodine uptake thyrotoxicosis followed by hypothyroidism, usually followed by a return to a euthyroid state. The thyrotoxic phase usually occurs between one to three months post partum and lasts for one to two months, while the hypothyroid phase usually occurs between three to six months post partum and lasts for three to five months.

This syndrome appears to be the same as the syndrome of silent thyroiditis. Goldman JM. Postpartum Thyroid Dysfunction.

Postpartum thyrotoxicosis — In women with symptomatic postpartum thyrotoxicosis, the judicious use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents is recommended. 1/++0 Treatment for postpartum thyroiditis is generally supportive in nature, with beta-adrenergic blockers such as propranolol (lowest level in breast milk) or metoprolol to control pulse rate and hyperadrenergic symptoms during the thyrotoxic state; levothyroxine therapy may be beneficial, at least transiently, for women with symptomatic hypothyroidism, and because beta blockers are secreted into breast milk in very low levels, no special monitoring is needed for breastfed infants of mothers on these medications.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^91827266]. Thyroid (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association pregnancy thyroid disease guideline — diagnostic interventions recommendation strength specifies that a strong recommendation with high- or moderate-quality evidence implies the test can be offered to most patients in most applicable circumstances without reservation, while with low-quality evidence it implies the test can be offered to most patients in most applicable circumstances, but the utilization of the test may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available. For a weak recommendation, with high-quality evidence the degree to which the diagnostic test is seriously considered may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values, with moderate-quality evidence it may differ depending on individual patients'/ practice circumstances or patients' or societal values, and with low-quality evidence alternative options may be equally reasonable. An insufficient rating notes evidence may be of such poor quality, conflicting, lacking (i.e., studies not done), or not externally generalizable to the target clinical population such that the estimate of the true effect of the test is uncertain and does not permit a reasonable conclusion to be made, concluding insufficient evidence exists to recommend for or against routinely offering the diagnostic test.

### Maternal cognitive function during pregnancy in relation to hypo-and hyperthyroxinemia [^b302bad1]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

What might be the clinical relevance of the current findings? It is beyond the scope to participate in the discussion whether all pregnant women should be screened on thyroid dysfunction during early pregnancy. The international guidelines promote case finding in women possibly at risk for thyroid dysfunction including those with symptoms 'typically related to thyroid dysfunction'. 11 The current study shows evidence that women with high levels of cognitive dysfunction symptoms are at risk for poor thyroid hormone status. Assessing cognitive function by simple questionnaires during early gestation might help to detect women at risk for thyroid dysfunction. It is remarkable that until now all randomized clinical trials in which women with suboptimal thyroid function (subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia) were supplemented with T4 only used obstetric and neurodevelopmental offspring's outcome as end‐point. General well‐being of the pregnant woman was not taken into account. It would be interesting to include in future RCT general well‐being during gestation also as end‐point, including cognitive function. Although cognitive dysfunction in the perinatal period is generally believed to be self‐limiting, there might be subgroups of women (those with hypothyroxinemia and elevated TPO‐Ab titres?) who will report persistently high cognitive dysfunction symptom scores, like Hashimoto‐treated patients. Longitudinal follow‐up studies — preferentially starting before conception and lasting up to 12 months postpartum — could possible discriminate between self‐limiting and persistent cognitive dysfunction. Is it possible that maternal cognitive dysfunction might affect offspring's cognitive development? So far, the only link would be by maternal depression. Cognitive dysfunction is highly related to depression (also in the current study), and the negative impact of maternal depression on infant outcome (including cognitive development) is well documented. 40

In conclusion, apart from depression and sleeping problems, women with low levels of thyroid hormone during early gestation are at risk for poor cognitive function throughout gestation, possibly related to the presence of elevated TPO‐Ab titres.

### Thyroid dysfunction and women's reproductive health [^aa95dcdc]. Thyroid (2004). Low credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction is extremely common in women and has unique consequences related to menstrual cyclicity and reproduction. Even minimal hypothyroidism can increase rates of miscarriage and fetal death and may also have adverse effects on later cognitive development of the offspring. Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy may also have adverse consequences. Accordingly, thyrotropin (TSH) determination is warranted for all women planning pregnancy or those already pregnant. Replacement doses should be carefully monitored throughout pregnancy because the increased renal iodine loss and estrogen-induced rise in thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) often result in a higher dose requirement. Although thyroid abnormalities are part of the standard differential diagnosis of menstrual disorders, recent studies indicate that these are relatively infrequent causes. Nonetheless, TSH is still required as part of the laboratory evaluation of women with abnormal cycles. The incidence of postpartum thyroiditis is high — 6%-8% in various studies. A TSH should be performed in all postpartum patients who are depressed, who complain of unusual fatigue or anxiety or have any of the classical symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Practitioners providing health care for women should be alert to thyroid disorders as possible etiological factors in nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and depression. However, most women with these symptoms are euthyroid; replacement therapy for them is not indicated. The long-standing dogma of thyroidology that replacement with levothyroxine alone is satisfactory for all hypothyroid patients has recently been questioned but results of trials are inconclusive. Nonetheless, satisfactory regimens can be found for the vast majority of patients.

American Thyroid Association pregnancy guidelines — infertility and thyroid autoimmunity: Limited evidence links thyroid autoimmunity to infertility, including higher thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) positivity in female-factor infertility and associations in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), with antithyroid antibodies tied to reduced follicular response to clomiphene. Evaluation of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is recommended for all women seeking infertility care (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). LT4 treatment is recommended for overt hypothyroidism once pregnancy is confirmed (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). For subclinically hypothyroid, thyroid autoantibody–negative women attempting natural conception and not undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART), administration of LT4 may be considered to prevent progression to more significant hypothyroidism and low dose LT4 therapy (25–50 μg/d) carries minimal risk (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). For nonpregnant, thyroid autoantibody–positive euthyroid women attempting natural conception (not undergoing ART), insufficient evidence exists and no recommendation can be made (no recommendation, insufficient evidence).

### Assessment and treatment of thyroid disorders in pregnancy and the postpartum period [^1438fc60]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Thyroid disorders are prevalent in pregnant women. Furthermore, thyroid hormone has a critical role in fetal development and thyroid dysfunction can adversely affect obstetric outcomes. Thus, the appropriate management of hyperthyroidism, most commonly caused by Graves disease, and hypothyroidism, which in iodine sufficient regions is most commonly caused by Hashimoto thyroiditis, in pregnancy is important for the health of both pregnant women and their offspring. Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis can also occur during pregnancy and should be differentiated from Graves disease. Effects of thyroid autoimmunity and subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy remain controversial. Iodine deficiency is the leading cause of hypothyroidism worldwide. Despite global efforts to eradicate iodine deficiency disorders, pregnant women remain at risk of iodine deficiency due to increased iodine requirements during gestation. The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing worldwide, including in young adults. As such, the diagnosis of thyroid nodules or thyroid cancer during pregnancy is becoming more frequent. The evaluation and management of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer in pregnancy pose a particular challenge. Postpartum thyroiditis can occur up to 1 year after delivery and must be differentiated from other forms of thyroid dysfunction, as treatment differs. This Review provides current evidence and recommendations for the evaluation and management of thyroid disorders in pregnancy and in the postpartum period.

Postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) — prevalence and risk groups: "The prevalence of PPT is approximately 5%, although it has varied markedly in different studies, with frequencies reported from 1.1% to 16.7%". Risk is higher with autoimmunity, including "3–4 times higher in women with diabetes mellitus type 1", and frequencies of "25% in women with chronic viral hepatitis", "14% in women with systemic lupus erythematosus", "44% in women with a prior history of GD", and "27% in patients with antipituitary antibodies". Recurrence is common, as "Individuals who have recovered fully from PPT have a 70% chance of developing PPT in each subsequent pregnancy". Additional notes include that "Women on LT4 therapy secondary to Hashimoto's thyroiditis may develop PPT if their thyroid gland is not completely atrophic", and that after pregnancy loss, "the prevalence of PPT… is unknown".

### Postpartum thyroid function following LT4 treatment from infertility treatment to delivery in women with subclinical hypothyroidism or high-normal TSH: a retrospective study [^9a9224e4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

The significant decrease in postpartum TSH levels may be attributed to physiological changes in the thyroid during pregnancy, such as stimulation by human chorionic gonadotropin. In a prospective study of 118 healthy pregnant women in iodine-sufficient Slovenia, thyroid volume increased during pregnancy (first trimester: 8.7 ± 2.5 mL; third trimester: 11.3 ± 3.1 mL) and then decreased postpartum (4 months: 8.6 ± 2.5 mL; 14 months: 7.8 ± 2.4 mL). Using the 14-month postpartum volume as a nonpregnant reference suggests that the thyroid gland enlarges during pregnancy to meet elevated hormone demands and remains enlarged until at least 4 months postpartum. These findings imply that thyroid hormone secretion may stay elevated even after delivery.

A systematic review by Nicholson et al. reported that PPT prevalence ranges from 0.9 to 11.7% (average 8.1%) in the general population, and as high as 33–50% in antibody-positive women. In our study, PPT occurred in 6.3% of all participants and in 12.5% of antibody-positive patients evaluated at 2–3 months postpartum, supporting the rationale for discontinuing LT4 immediately after delivery.

Regarding long-term thyroid function, among 68 of the 155 patients evaluated at least one year postpartum in a non-pregnant state, TSH remained significantly lower than pre-treatment levels. Specifically, the median baseline TSH was 4.22 mIU/L (3.39–4.88), while the median TSH at ≥ 1 year postpartum was 3.07 mIU/L (2.33–4.52) (p < 0.001). Only two patients (both antibody-positive) required resumption of LT4 due to TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L. Although baseline and 2-month postpartum TSH levels were not particularly distinctive (4.92 and 8.03 mIU/L at baseline; 3.05 and 5.24 mIU/L at 2–2.5 months postpartum), both individuals exhibited TSH elevations above 10 mIU/L (18.66 and 13.37 mIU/L) at least one year postpartum, requiring LT4 resumption. Due to the small sample size (n = 2), no definitive factors could be identified, though autoantibody positivity may be a contributing factor.

### Clark T. sawin historical vignette: what do criminology, harry houdini, and king george V have in common with postpartum thyroid dysfunction? [^0c0bc80e]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

The history of postpartum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD) dates back almost two millennia, when Soranus of Ephesus, who practiced obstetrics and neonatology, observed swelling in the necks (presumably goiters) of women after pregnancy. The next reference to PPTD appeared in artwork more than 1000 years later, with many portraits illustrating women with goiter while holding infants. In the early to mid-19th century, Caleb Hillier Parry and Armand Trousseau described postpartum hyperthyroidism, while in the late 1800s, Sir Horatio Bryan Donkin reported the first patient with postpartum hypothyroidism. The modern era of PPTD began with the description in the late 1940s by H.E.W. Roberton of women after delivery reporting hypothyroid symptoms and responding to thyroid extract. The immunologic influence on PPTD was recognized initially by Parker and Beierwaltes in the early 1960s, and the clinical variability and natural history were carefully documented by numerous investigators in the 1970s-1980s. The past two decades have seen further refinements in understanding the prevalence, etiology, and treatment of PPTD. Yet to be determined is the role of screening as a cost-effective measure.

To estimate the effect of antenatal treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism on maternal depressive symptoms.

Methods

We conducted an ancillary study to a multicenter trial in women with singleton pregnancies diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism randomized to antenatal thyroxine therapy or placebo. Treatment was discontinued at the end of pregnancy. Women with overt thyroid disease, diabetes, autoimmune disease, and those diagnosed with depression were excluded. Participants were assessed for depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D) before starting the study drug (between 11 and 20 weeks of gestation), between 32 and 38 weeks of gestation, and at 1 year postpartum. The primary outcome was maternal depressive symptoms score as assessed using the CES-D. Secondary outcome was the percentage of women who scored 16 or higher on the CES-D, as such a score is considered screen-positive for depression.

Results

Two hundred forty-five (36.2% of parent trial) women with subclinical hypothyroidism were allocated to thyroxine (n = 124) or placebo (n = 121). Median CES-D scores and the proportion of participants with positive scores were similar at baseline between the two groups. Treatment with thyroxine was not associated with differences in CES-D scores (10 [5–15] vs 10 [5–17]; P = 0.46) or in odds of screening positive in the third trimester compared with placebo, even after adjusting for baseline scores (24.3% vs 30.1%, adjusted odds ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.31–1.28, P = 0.20). At 1 year postpartum, CES-D scores were not different (6 [3–11] vs 6 [3–12]; P = 0.79), nor was the frequency of screen-positive CES-D scores in the treated compared with the placebo group (9.7% vs 15.8%; P = 0.19). Treatment with thyroxine during pregnancy was also not associated with differences in odds of screening positive at the postpartum visit compared with placebo even after adjusting for baseline scores. Sensitivity analysis including women who were diagnosed with depression by the postpartum visit did not change the results.

Conclusions

This study did not achieve its planned sample size, thus our conclusions may be limited, but in this cohort of pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism, antenatal thyroxine replacement did not improve maternal depressive symptoms.

Overt thyroid dysfunction and infertility — associations and treatment rationale are described. In hyperthyroidism, menstrual irregularities were present in 22% of patients versus 8% of age- and weight-matched euthyroid controls, and among hypothyroid women with TSH concentrations > 15 mIU/L, 68% reported irregular menses compared with 12% of euthyroid controls. In infertile populations, 5% had serum TSH levels > 4.5 mIU/L in one cross-sectional study, and among women aged 18–50 years the prevalence of infertility was 5.2% in women with GD and 4% among women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Thyroid dysfunction is also reversible, and treatment is generally safe and may exert a positive effect on fertility; therefore, it is reasonable to treat overt thyroid dysfunction in infertile women, with the goal of normalizing thyroid function.

2.2. Measures

Outcome was determined according to EPDS scores at 6 months postpartum; a score of 0–11 was deemed to be indicative of symptom remission while a score from 12 to 30 was interpreted as persistence of symptoms. EPDS at 6 months postpartum (outcome) were missing in 102 (15.6%) cases. Missing values were imputed multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE). At 6 months postpartum, 342 (59.2%) women scored below 12 points and 236 (40.8%) scored ≥ 12. LTPDS were defined as having an EPDS score of 12–30 at both 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. A total of 43 variables (covariates) were included in the study (Table 1). The variables were either collected as self-reports in online questionnaires within the BASIC study or were retrieved from medical records. For this substudy, a predefined protocol on variables was utilized to monitor medical records from delivery to 9 months postpartum. Data extraction from the medical records (retrospectively) was made by the first author (K.G.), a medical student, and four research assistants from 1 March 2020 through 15 December 2021. Stressful events were defined as entries in the patient records during the first 6 months postpartum, regarding death or serious illness within the family or other severe events with consequences that affect life in a significant way. Pregnancy complications were defined as late-pregnancy bleeding episodes, painful Braxton Hick's contractions, pelvic girdle pain, gestational diabetes, hypothyroidism, hypertonia, and preeclampsia. Infant issues were self-reported and included colic, rashes, breathing difficulties due to prematurity, eczema, skin boil, infection with RS virus, and jaundice. Somatic diseases were defined as any somatic disease registered in the medical record during the pregnancy or 6 months postpartum, and included asthma, migraine, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, epilepsy, skin conditions, skeletal conditions, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, earlier gastric bypass surgery, connective tissue diseases, fibromyalgia, endometriosis, kidney diseases, repeated urinary tract infections, hypertension, hearing difficulties, immunological diseases, and heart conditions.

Recommendation 40 — first-trimester suppressed TSH: When a suppressed serum TSH is detected in the first trimester (TSH less than the reference range), a medical history, physical examination, and measurement of maternal serum FT4 or TT4 concentrations should be performed, and measurement of TRAb and maternal TT3 may prove helpful in clarifying the etiology of thyrotoxicosis; this carries a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence.

### The role of iodine for thyroid function in lactating women and infants [^42a41406]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Lactating women

Abnormal thyroid function is common during the postpartum period and the incidence of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism increase markedly compared to before and during pregnancy. Thyroid dysfunction detected during the first year after birth in women with no previous history of thyroid disease is generally classified as postpartum thyroiditis, except if the diagnosis is Graves disease. Postpartum thyroiditis is an inflammatory subclinical autoimmune thyroid disorder associated with postpartum immune rebound as well as the presence of TPO antibodies during pregnancy. Postpartum autoimmune thyroiditis typically occurs 1 to 4 months after delivery with a prevalence of 5% and often develops from a previous subclinical thyroiditis that is exacerbated after delivery. In the classic form, transient thyrotoxicosis is followed by transient hypothyroidism returning to euthyroidism by the end of the initial postpartum year. Inflammatory processes in the thyroid gland result in release of T 4 and T 3 from the follicular cells, and synthesis of the thyroid hormones resumes when the inflammation subsides.

Iodine deficiency is a well-recognized risk factor for thyroid disorders in adults. The incidence of postpartum thyroiditis has not directly been demonstrated to be associated with iodine status. However, some studies, but not all, observed an increased risk for TPO antibody positivity in iodine excess, which in turn is associated with postpartum thyroiditis. Three small randomized studies have examined the effects of prenatal iodine supplementation on postpartum thyroiditis, but none of the studies observed a difference in frequency or severity of the condition. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of iodine supplementation (200 µg/day) to pregnant women in 2 mildly iodine-deficient populations observed no differences in maternal thyroid function tests, thyroid volume, or thyroid antibodies between groups during pregnancy or at 6 weeks post partum. Adequately powered studies are needed to exclude iodine deficiency as a risk factor for postpartum thyroiditis. A recent study in women with pregestational Hashimoto thyroiditis suggests that maternal thyroid status in early pregnancy predicts postpartum thyroiditis and that euthyroidism is associated with a higher rate of postpartum thyroiditis than hypothyroidism.

Abnormal maternal thyroid hormone concentrations can negatively affect the ability to successfully breastfeed. Women at particular risk of postpartum thyroiditis may be screened, but universal thyroid function screening post partum is not recommended.

Postpartum thyroiditis — management and breastfeeding precautions (Recommendation 97): Treatment for postpartum thyroiditis is generally supportive, with β-adrenergic blockers such as propranolol or metoprolol to control pulse rate and hyperadrenergic symptoms during the thyrotoxic stage; the selective β1-adrenergic receptor–blocking agent atenolol should not be used in breastfeeding mothers because it may lead to symptoms consistent with β-adrenergic blockade in neonates. Levothyroxine therapy may be beneficial, at least transiently, for women with symptomatic hypothyroidism or those having TSH levels > 10 mU/L, and because propranolol and metoprolol are secreted into breast milk in only very low amounts, no special monitoring is needed for breastfed infants of mothers on these medications. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### High rate of persistent hypothyroidism in a large-scale prospective study of postpartum thyroiditis in Southern Italy [^6c31ea9a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

The incidence of postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) varies widely in the literature. Limited data exist concerning the hormonal status of women with PPT at the end of the first postpartum year.

Objective

Our aim was to conduct a large prospective study of the incidence and clinical course of PPT.

Design

A total of 4394 women were screened for thyroid function and thyroid autoantibodies at 6 and 12 months postpartum. Women were classified as being at high or low risk of having thyroid disease before any thyroid testing.

Setting

The study was conducted at two ambulatory clinics in southern Italy, an area of mild iodine deficiency.

Patients

A total of 4394 pregnant women were studied.

Intervention

There was no intervention.

Main Outcome Measures

We measured incidence, clinical presentation, and course of postpartum thyroiditis.

Results

The incidence of postpartum thyroiditis was 3.9% (169 of 4384). Women classified as being at high risk for thyroid disease had a higher incidence of PPT than women classified as low risk (11.1 vs. 1.9%; odds ratio, 6.69; 95% confidence interval, 4.63, 9.68). Eighty-two percent of the 169 women with PPT had a hypothyroid phase during the first postpartum year. At the end of the first postpartum year, 54% of the 169 women had persistent hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

One of every 25 women in southern Italy developed PPT. Women at high risk for thyroid disease have an increased rate of PPT. The high rate of permanent hypothyroidism at 1 yr should result in a reevaluation of the widely held belief that most women with PPT are euthyroid at the end of the first postpartum year.

### Diary… [^a58657b9]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Monday Fatigue is a nonspecific symptom but a common complaint of many patients. Deidre knew something was not right, yet she wasn't one to seek medical attention lightly. Ten months postpartum, she had lost 70 lb of her pregnancy weight and was hoping to lose more, having gained more than 100 lb. Her weight loss had plateaued, she was sleeping nine to 10 hours daily, and she still felt tired. Taking care of a 10-month-old and a toddler is demanding work, but she didn't think this was the cause of her lack of energy. Physically, she appeared well, and I could not elicit a reason for her fatigue on my examination. Anemia was high on the differential because she had stopped taking her prenatal vitamins. She also was in the usual time frame for the hypothyroid phase of postpartum thyroiditis.

The hyperthyroid state can begin from one to four months postpartum, followed by hypothyroidism with an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level, decreased serum thyroxine level, and high titers of antithyroid antibodies. The complete blood count showed no anemia, but Deidre's antithyroid antibodies were markedly elevated. She did have postpartum thyroiditis, and treatment would be based on her symptoms. Explaining the prognosis of the disease and the appropriate treatment with levothyroxine would go a long way toward helping her regain her energy. He had done an electrocardiogram, but no blood work, and had told Howard that he could do nothing for him. I could offer him the basic fatigue workup, a complete blood count, a basic metabolic profile, liver function tests, and TSH level. I offered Howard some multivitamins, but told him we would have to wait on the blood test results to determine the cause of his "unbalanced anatomy.

" We parted on a friendly note, something I hadn't anticipated when the encounter began. After discussing the case with J. S. I suggested self-politzerization several times a day as adjunctive therapy. I certainly did not doubt her evaluation, but I was intrigued enough to go and look at the "bubbles" for myself. What I found was a normal looking tympanic membrane and no hearing loss.

The following constitutes key background information on thyroid disease in pregnancy:

- **Definition**: Thyroid disease in pregnancy refers to a spectrum of thyroid dysfunctions occurring before or during pregnancy that may affect maternal and fetal outcomes. These include overt hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, isolated hypothyroxinaemia, gestational transient thyrotoxicosis and other forms of thyrotoxicosis, overt hyperthyroidism, such as Graves disease and toxic nodular hyperthyroidism, and subclinical hyperthyroidism.
- **Pathophysiology**: Pregnancy induces complex physiological changes in thyroid function to meet the increased metabolic demands of both mother and fetus. Maternal thyroid hormone production rises by approximately 50%, driven by elevated estrogen and hCG levels. Estrogen increases TBG, raising total T4 and T3 concentrations, while hCG transiently stimulates the thyroid, particularly in the first trimester, leading to temporary increases in free T4 and T3 and suppression of TSH. As pregnancy advances, free thyroid hormone levels gradually decline, and TSH levels rise slightly. These shifts require sufficient iodine intake, as pregnancy increases iodine demand due to greater hormone synthesis, enhanced renal clearance, and fetal use. The fetal thyroid begins concentrating iodine at 10–12 weeks and produces its own hormone from 18–22 weeks; however, fetal neurodevelopment during early gestation depends entirely on the transplacental passage of maternal T4. Maternal thyroid volume increases by 10–30% during the third trimester due to expanded extracellular fluid and blood volume. In hypothyroidism, inadequate hormone production may impair placental and fetal development, especially during the first trimester. In hyperthyroidism, commonly caused by Graves disease, excess hormone increases maternal metabolic activity and can adversely affect placental function and fetal outcomes.
- **Epidemiology**: Thyroid dysfunction affects approximately 2 to 3 percent of pregnancies, with hypothyroidism being more common than hyperthyroidism. Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis occurs in 1–5% of pregnancies in Europe and is typically benign and self-limiting. Overt hyperthyroidism is less common and most often due to Graves disease, with a prevalence of 0.5–1.3% for pre-existing Graves disease, 0.05% for new-onset Graves, and 0.1% for toxic nodular disease. Worldwide, iodine deficiency remains the leading cause of preventable neurodevelopmental impairment and is associated with increased risks of goiter, hypothyroidism, miscarriage, and impaired cognitive outcomes. In areas of severe iodine deficiency, thyroid nodules have been reported in up to 30% of pregnant women. In iodine-replete or mildly deficient regions, autoimmune thyroid disease is the most common cause of dysfunction during pregnancy. The prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies in pregnancy ranges from 5–31%, depending on the population studied.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include a personal or family history of thyroid disease, autoimmune conditions such as Hashimoto thyroiditis or Graves disease, prior head or neck irradiation, iodine imbalance, and advanced maternal age. Women with T1DM or other autoimmune disorders are at particularly increased risk.
- **Disease course**: Thyroid disease may be pre-existing or first diagnosed during pregnancy. Hypothyroidism often presents with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance, while hyperthyroidism may cause palpitations, heat intolerance, tremors, and weight loss. Uncontrolled hypothyroidism increases the risk of miscarriage, preeclampsia, placental abruption, and impaired fetal neurodevelopment. Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism is associated with fetal loss, low birth weight, and preterm delivery.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: With adequate treatment, most individuals with thyroid disease can achieve favorable pregnancy outcomes. However, insufficient control, especially during early gestation, increases the risk of serious maternal and fetal complications. Thyroid function should be closely monitored throughout pregnancy. Ongoing postpartum monitoring is often necessary in individuals with persistent thyroid dysfunction or autoimmune thyroid disease.

Risk for hypothyroidism in previously euthyroid women — antibody positivity and prior thyroid therapy: In a prospective study in 87 thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb)-positive euthyroid women, Twenty percent developed a TSH > 4 mIU/L during gestation; another prospective study showed TSH rose from a mean of 1.7 mIU/L (12th week) to 3.5 mIU/L (term), with 19% having a supranormal TSH concentration at delivery. Euthyroid patients who are antithyroid antibody positive, post-hemithyroidectomy, or treated with radioactive iodine have an increased propensity for hypothyroidism in gestation and should be monitored regularly.

Fig. 1
Changes in thyroid function. FT4 (black circle), FT3 (white circle), and TSH (black square) were monitored in the patient diagnosed with RTHβ and autoimmune thyroiditis. The thyrotoxic phase of postpartum thyroiditis occurred 6 months after delivery (solid black arrow), followed by a hypothyroid phase at 9 months (white arrow), and the return to status quo ante at 11 months postpartum. Hypofunctioning thyroid from Hashimoto's thyroiditis occurred at 18 months postpartum, followed by spontaneous recovery after 1 month. * Indicates TSH values exceeding the instrument's upper limit: TSH > 100 mIU/L. Abbreviations: LT3, levotriiodothyronine therapy; FT4, free thyroxine; FT3, free triiodothyronine; TSH, thyrotropin

At 6 months postpartum, the patient showed marked suppression of TSH compared with baseline (0.59 mIU/L vs. 8.63 mIU/L) with elevated FT3 (6.70 pmol/L) and FT4 (24.94 pmol/L), but remained clinically euthyroid. HOMA-IR was 7.97 with fasting glucose at 10.12 mmol/L. Suppressed TSH in RTH followed by exceedingly elevated TSH (> 100 mU/L) at 9 months postpartum indicated the occurrence of PPT, which recovered at 11 months postpartum (Fig. 1). Fasting glucose and insulin varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L and 17.5–21.8 mIU/L, respectively. HOMA-IR during the hypothyroid phase could not be calculated from medical charts. Glycemia was managed with diet and exercise, though controlled less ideally compared to prepregnancy.

At 18 months postpartum, the patient was asymptomatic apart from discomfort due to a III degree goiter. TSH were again elevated, but recovered spontaneously after 1 month suggesting an episode of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. No medication was prescribed for this period.

The index member's biological mother had a history of poorly-controlled Graves' disease, and diabetes mellitus. She was later found to carry the same THRB mutation. THRB gene sequencing of the index case's spouse and father were negative for mutation. Second-degree relatives reported no symptoms related to thyroid dysfunction, and thyroid function screening was normal without inappropriate TSH secretion, however, they declined gene sequencing.

Newborn thyroid dysfunction screening — scope, methods, and timing: Congenital hypothyroidism screening is performed routinely in all 50 states of the United States and programs are also being introduced in many developing countries, accounting overall for approximately one third of the world's population. Blood spot specimens eluted from filter paper are utilized, and the optimal timing of measurement is at 2–5 days of age to avoid confounding by the physiologic surge in neonatal TSH. Some programs employ primary T4 screening with TSH measurement when specimens demonstrate a value below a specified cutoff, whereas others use a primary TSH determination with reflex FT4 strategy. Newborn screening for hypothyroidism should be performed routinely on all infants, with blood spot analysis typically 2–5 days after birth. Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence.

### Management of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy and postpartum: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^d9cfe6bb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective is to provide clinical guidelines for the management of thyroid problems present during pregnancy and in the postpartum.

Participants

The Chair was selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) of The Endocrine Society. The Chair requested participation by the Latin American Thyroid Society, the Asia and Oceania Thyroid Society, the American Thyroid Association, the European Thyroid Association, and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, and each organization appointed a member to the task force. Two members of The Endocrine Society were also asked to participate. The group worked on the guidelines for 2 yr and held two meetings. There was no corporate funding, and no members received remuneration.

Evidence

Applicable published and peer-reviewed literature of the last two decades was reviewed, with a concentration on original investigations. The grading of evidence was done using the United States Preventive Services Task Force system and, where possible, the GRADE system.

Consensus Process

Consensus was achieved through conference calls, two group meetings, and exchange of many drafts by E-mail. The manuscript was reviewed concurrently by the Society's CGS, Clinical Affairs Committee, members of The Endocrine Society, and members of each of the collaborating societies. Many valuable suggestions were received and incorporated into the final document. Each of the societies endorsed the guidelines.

Conclusions

Management of thyroid diseases during pregnancy requires special considerations because pregnancy induces major changes in thyroid function, and maternal thyroid disease can have adverse effects on the pregnancy and the fetus. Care requires coordination among several healthcare professionals. Avoiding maternal (and fetal) hypothyroidism is of major importance because of potential damage to fetal neural development, an increased incidence of miscarriage, and preterm delivery. Maternal hyperthyroidism and its treatment may be accompanied by coincident problems in fetal thyroid function. Autoimmune thyroid disease is associated with both increased rates of miscarriage, for which the appropriate medical response is uncertain at this time, and postpartum thyroiditis. Fine-needle aspiration cytology should be performed for dominant thyroid nodules discovered in pregnancy. Radioactive isotopes must be avoided during pregnancy and lactation. Universal screening of pregnant women for thyroid disease is not yet supported by adequate studies, but case finding targeted to specific groups of patients who are at increased risk is strongly supported.

Suppressed TSH in the first trimester — initial evaluation: During normal early pregnancy, serum TSH may fall due to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation, with a peak hCG "between 7 and 11 weeks gestation". A "serum TSH below 0.1 mU/L… may be present in approximately 5% of women by week 11 of pregnancy". An "abnormal serum TSH value should be evaluated in conjunction with serum TT4 (total T4) (or FT4 [free T4]) and T3 values".
