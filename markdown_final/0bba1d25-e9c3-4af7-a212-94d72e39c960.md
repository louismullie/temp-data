## Question

What to expect post cleft lip and cleft palate repair

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to expect after cleft lip and/or cleft palate repair. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immediate postoperative recovery period and what's normal in the first hours to weeks. Then, I should verify short-term functional outcomes like feeding, pain control, and wound care. Next, I will review early complications such as wound dehiscence, fistula, infection, and airway issues. After that, I need to assess medium-term speech, hearing, and growth effects, including timing controversies. Then, I should consider the long-term burden of secondary procedures and orthodontics. Finally, I will integrate psychosocial expectations, center-specific outcomes, and provide a concise, realistic summary of expectations for families.

> Let me first confirm the immediate recovery expectations in the first 24–48 hours. I should double-check airway and monitoring needs, as infants with clefts have a higher ICU admission rate and require vigilant observation for airway obstruction or bleeding; contemporary series show ICU admission around 6% in some centers, which aligns with the anatomic vulnerability of these patients [^113XSfR8]. I need to ensure I note feeding transitions, since most infants can resume feeding within 1 day after palatoplasty, and breastfeeding is often permissible the day after surgery in many protocols, though some teams still use alternative feeding for a brief period for comfort and safety [^115ihcKw]. Hold on, I should verify analgesia strategies; standardized multimodal nonopioid regimens and local anesthesia infiltration are commonly recommended to minimize crying and wound stress while preserving safe feeding, which fits with ERAS-style approaches being piloted in cleft centers [^114iBZTH] [^111nZNPB].

> Next, I should review short-term functional recovery over the first 1–2 weeks. Let me think about feeding trajectory: while some programs allow breastfeeding to resume within 24 hours, families should expect potential short-term inefficiency and the need for close weight monitoring and lactation support, as many infants with CP/CLP require alternative feeding methods until oral-motor patterns normalize after repair [^115ihcKw]. I need to check pain control and activity guidance; nonopioid regimens and gentle oral hygiene are standard, with avoidance of pacifiers or fingers in the mouth for a short period to protect sutures, and families should be prepared for irritability and sleep disruption during this window [^114iBZTH]. Wait, let me verify wound care expectations; most centers use absorbable sutures, so families will not need suture removal, but they should watch for signs of dehiscence or infection and keep the surgical site clean and dry [^116zM1ii].

> I will now examine early complications that commonly emerge in the first month. Fistula formation is a key concern; contemporary series from high-volume centers report fistula rates roughly 3–4% after primary palatoplasty, though rates vary by cleft severity and technique, and bilateral or Veau IV clefts carry higher risk, which I should explicitly counsel families about [^111WjSir]. Hold on, I should verify dehiscence and infection risks; wound dehiscence occurs in a minority of cases and is more likely with complete clefts and less experienced surgeons, while infection is uncommon but possible, and both are mitigated by meticulous technique and perioperative optimization [^111L2HcY] [^113CBYVL]. I need to ensure I mention airway events; unplanned intraoperative extubation is rare and not associated with major postoperative complications, but families should still expect close airway monitoring in the immediate postoperative period [^1114pQbu].

> Let me consider medium-term outcomes over the first 1–5 years, especially speech and hearing. I should confirm timing data: the TOPS randomized trial showed that palate repair at 6 months reduced VPI at age 5 compared with 12 months, supporting earlier palatoplasty when medically feasible, though this pertains to isolated cleft palate and may not generalize to all phenotypes [^112SoLX4]. But wait, what if timing is too early? Observational multicenter data suggest that repair before 9 months may increase hazards of secondary surgery in some settings, so timing must balance speech benefits against growth and technical risks, and families should be counseled that VPI rates after primary repair commonly range from about 5–30% depending on cohort and technique [^114JsndP] [^111YqQmd]. I should double-check hearing outcomes; persistent Eustachian tube dysfunction is common, and many children require tympanostomy tubes and ongoing audiology, with ENT procedures often comprising a large share of the early operative burden in CLP cohorts [^113j7pvx].

> Next, I should review long-term expectations and the burden of secondary procedures. Let me verify typical operative counts; in a contemporary audit, children with non-syndromic CLP averaged about four operations by age 8, including primary repairs, ENT procedures, and dental care, which sets a realistic expectation for families about staged care [^113j7pvx]. I need to check alveolar bone grafting timing; grafting is generally performed in the mixed dentition, and outcomes are better when performed before age 9, with success rates around 85–90% in experienced hands, which families should plan for orthodontically and dentally [^111ssGm4]. Hold on, I should verify secondary palatal surgery needs; across centers, secondary speech-correcting surgery and fistula repair occur in a meaningful minority, with center-level variation in secondary surgery hazard, underscoring the importance of team experience and protocolized care [^114JsndP] [^116VkASn].

> I should confirm growth and facial development considerations. There is an ongoing debate about early hard palate repair and potential midface growth restriction; preclinical models suggest suture disruption and scarring can impair maxillary growth, and some centers delay hard palate closure to mitigate this risk, though high-quality clinical consensus remains limited and must be individualized [^114eRoFL]. Let me reconsider the practical counseling: families should expect that some children will manifest maxillary hypoplasia requiring orthognathic surgery in adolescence, and orthodontic treatment is nearly universal, so dental and skeletal surveillance is part of routine long-term care [^111QNNp4].

> Now, I need to address psychosocial and appearance outcomes. I should double-check satisfaction data. Adults with repaired UCLP frequently report residual appearance concerns despite multiple revisions, and dissatisfaction correlates with desire to change appearance, highlighting the need for realistic expectations and access to counseling and timely revision when indicated [^112b8J1G]. Wait, let me verify the revision burden. Secondary lip and nasal procedures are common, with rhinoplasty rates around 78% in some long-term cohorts, and families should be prepared for staged nasal and lip refinements through childhood and adolescence as growth evolves [^1151z8aV]. I need to ensure I emphasize team-based psychosocial support and patient-reported outcome tracking to align care with what matters most to patients and families [^115vpH1u].

> But wait, what about center-specific outcomes and safety initiatives that families might encounter. Transition from short-term missions to permanent center-based care is associated with lower complication rates, and implementation of WHO-based surgical safety programs such as Clean Cleft has reduced infections and wound complications in LMIC settings, which families can view as quality signals when choosing care pathways [^1131idNT] [^111ePb15]. I should confirm that large-scale epidemiology also informs expectations; nationwide data show higher hospitalization risks for airway infections in children with clefts, especially before repair, reinforcing the value of timely, multidisciplinary care and vigilant respiratory surveillance in the early years [^114f7Pxe].

> Let me synthesize a concise, realistic expectation for families. Immediately after surgery, expect 1–2 days of hospitalization with close airway and feeding monitoring, transition to feeding within 24 hours in many programs, and several days of irritability managed with nonopioid pain regimens and gentle oral care. Over the first month, watch for rare wound dehiscence, infection, or fistula, and attend scheduled early follow-up for wound checks and feeding support. Across early childhood, anticipate ongoing speech therapy, periodic ENT care for ears and possible tubes, and orthodontic planning, with an average of about four operations by age 8 in CLP. Long term, many children will need alveolar bone grafting around age 8–10, possible secondary speech surgery, and nasal or lip revisions, with a subset requiring orthognathic surgery in adolescence; throughout, psychosocial support and patient-reported outcome tracking help align care with evolving needs and expectations [^113j7pvx] [^111ssGm4] [^113cPnXm] [^115vpH1u].

After cleft lip and palate repair, families should expect a structured recovery with **early feeding support** and **speech therapy** to optimize function, while monitoring for complications such as fistula, infection, or airway issues [^1176Y3qC] [^115oGAop]. Most children require **additional procedures** (e.g. alveolar bone graft, orthodontics, secondary speech surgery) and ongoing multidisciplinary care to address growth, dental, and speech needs [^112LrngP] [^111ssGm4]. Long-term outcomes are generally favorable, but persistent speech, dental, or facial asymmetry may persist and require further treatment [^111Ew29B] [^114TRoaJ].

---

## Immediate postoperative expectations

### Hospital stay and monitoring

- **Length of stay**: Typically 1–3 days, depending on the procedure and the child's condition [^114RJY1m].
- **Monitoring**: Close observation for airway obstruction, bleeding, and feeding difficulties [^1165Ba7h].
- **Pain management**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen; opioids are rarely needed [^notfound].

---

### Feeding and nutrition

For feeding and nutrition, **initial feeding** is with a syringe or specialized bottle for 1–2 weeks to protect the repair; breastfeeding can often resume within 1–2 days after lip repair and 1–2 weeks after palate repair [^115ihcKw]. Nutritional support emphasizes **adequate intake** to support healing and growth, with a dietitian providing guidance [^115oGAop].

---

## Short-term postoperative expectations (weeks to months)

### Wound healing and complications

- **Wound care**: Gentle cleaning and avoidance of trauma to the repair site [^notfound].
- **Common complications**: Fistula formation (4–20%), wound infection (1–5%), and dehiscence (3–7%) [^115F9bPY] [^111L2HcY] [^114bHBSW] [^113Vjn7z].
- **Signs of concern**: Persistent leakage, foul odor, fever, or feeding difficulties warrant prompt evaluation [^notfound].

---

### Speech and language development

For speech and language development, **early speech therapy** should begin within weeks to months to promote normal speech development and prevent compensatory articulations [^notfound]. Expected progress includes gradual improvement in resonance and articulation over 6–12 months, though some **residual hypernasality** may persist [^notfound].

---

### Hearing and ear health

For hearing and ear health, **middle ear effusion** is common due to Eustachian tube dysfunction; tympanostomy tubes are often placed during palate repair or shortly thereafter [^113j7pvx]. Audiologic follow-up should include **regular hearing assessments** to detect and manage conductive hearing loss [^notfound].

---

## Long-term expectations (years)

### Facial growth and dental development

Facial growth may show **midface hypoplasia** requiring orthodontic treatment and, in some cases, orthognathic surgery [^111QNNp4]. Dental development commonly features **malocclusion**, missing or malformed teeth, and the need for orthodontic treatment and restorative dentistry [^112LrngP].

---

### Speech outcomes

Speech outcomes generally improve to **near-normal** intelligibility, though some patients may have residual hypernasality or articulation errors [^113HRLUd]. Secondary speech surgery — such as a **pharyngeal flap or sphincteroplasty** — is sometimes needed for persistent velopharyngeal insufficiency [^114a4x5Q].

---

### Psychosocial and quality of life

Psychosocial support is important to address **self-esteem, social integration, and coping with ongoing treatments** [^112aqSYj]. Quality of life typically improves substantially, though some patients may continue to experience psychosocial challenges [^114TRoaJ].

---

## Additional surgical procedures and interventions

| **Procedure** | **Typical timing** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Alveolar bone grafting | 6–9 years | - Fill alveolar defect <br/> - Support tooth eruption [^111ssGm4] |
| Orthodontic treatment | 7–18 years | Correct malocclusion and align teeth [^notfound] |
| Secondary speech surgery | 4–12 years | Persistent velopharyngeal insufficiency [^114a4x5Q] |
| Rhinoplasty | Adolescence | Nasal deformity correction [^1166Am9s] |
| Orthognathic surgery | Late adolescence | Severe maxillary hypoplasia [^notfound] |

---

## Factors influencing outcomes

Several factors influence outcomes: **earlier palate repair** (around 6 months) reduces velopharyngeal insufficiency and improves speech [^112SoLX4], whereas surgical technique and surgeon experience also significantly affect fistula and speech outcomes [^115k3uh2]. Severe clefts and associated syndromes increase complication risk and may require additional interventions [^113Vjn7z]. Consistent, multidisciplinary follow-up is essential for optimal results [^11739gJE].

---

## Parental and caregiver guidance

- **Feeding support**: Use specialized bottles and feeding techniques; monitor growth [^115ihcKw].
- **Speech therapy**: Early and consistent therapy is critical [^notfound].
- **Dental care**: Regular dental visits and orthodontic evaluation [^112LrngP].
- **Emotional support**: Address self-esteem and social integration issues [^11739gJE].
- **Recognition of complications**: Watch for fistula, infection, or persistent speech issues [^1176Y3qC].

---

## Summary of expectations

Parents can expect a structured recovery with early feeding support and speech therapy, while monitoring for complications such as **fistula**, infection, or airway issues [^1176Y3qC]. Most children require additional procedures (e.g. alveolar bone graft, orthodontics, secondary speech surgery) and ongoing multidisciplinary care to address growth, dental, and speech needs [^112LrngP]. Long-term outcomes are generally favorable, but persistent speech, dental, or **facial asymmetry** may persist and require further treatment [^111Ew29B].

### Patient reported outcome following the skoog unilateral cleft lip repair among adults-a long-term cohort study and comparison to a non-cleft population [^114TRoaJ]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Satisfaction with the appearance is an essential outcome in cleft care and is regarded as crucial for self-confidence, self-esteem, and healthy psychosocial development. – In people with repaired cleft-, lip, and palate (CLP), facial aesthetics play a vital role in their quality of life. With the lips being centrally located on the face, subtle differences can attract attention. As such, the primary objective of surgical treatment in people with CLP-related facial differences is to normalize the facial appearance by minimizing asymmetry and scarring. Many adults treated for CLP, however, still show some stigmata following cleft lip repair, which affect the facial appearance and attract greater attention than a face without cleft. –

There are many surgical techniques for lip repair. – While each technique has certain purported advantages and disadvantages, few studies have evaluated the long-term outcomes of these techniques. – Despite advances in treatment, patients treated for CLP express concerns regarding the function, shape, and appearance of the lip as well as the nose. –

Skoog lip repair has been the technique of choice at our institution for the last 60 years. The Skoog lip repair experience in Uppsala for UCLP deformity has previously been published by Falk-Delgado et al. The study by Falk-Delgado and co-workers reported complications after lip surgery and the incidence and indication for lip revision. Other studies that report outcomes of this technique focus mainly on the nasal or nasolabial appearance. No previous research has looked at patient-reported satisfaction with lip appearance among adults treated with Skoog's lip repair in infancy.

The current study aimed to assess patient-reported satisfaction with lip appearance in adults treated for UCLP with Skoog's lip technique and compare their self-assessment of lip appearance with that of a matched non-cleft population. The secondary aim was to assess whether satisfaction with lip appearance and the desire to change lip/face appearance correlated with the number of secondary lip revisions performed.

### Surgical mission (not) impossible – now what? [^117NZbU2]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

International surgical missions, particularly those that address patients with clefts of the lip and palate, have become increasingly common. Numerous groups have been organized to provide these services. A plastic surgeon participating in these endeavors should have full knowledge of the details involved not just for himself but to maximize safety and optimize outcomes for these patients. An understanding of the issues surrounding trip preparation, the in-country logistics, proper preoperative patient selection, and intraoperative and postoperative issues are all essential to a successful experience. In this article, the authors review and discuss lessons learned from a combined total of more than 100 international trips. Relevant literature is reviewed, and additional pearls from this body of knowledge are presented.

### Long-term follow-up of bilateral cleft lip and palate: incidence of speech-correcting surgeries and fistula formation [^112k8mXF]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The deviant and unique anatomy of bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP) contributes to obvious surgical challenges during primary cleft repair. Dehiscence, such as palatal fistulas, is a well-known and often challenging complication following primary repair. Especially patients with BCLP are prone to develop fistulas due to the extensive nature of the cleft and the inevitable tension occurring at repair. A short palate, characteristic of patients with corrected cleft palates, may further predispose to speech-related problems and velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). These undesirable factors might have a detrimental impact on the surgical results and the growing child, often requiring secondary operations.

As the optimal surgical treatment protocol regarding timing and technique utilized for cleft palate repair remains open, the techniques have evolved by small modifications to existing methods and variations in the timing of repair. Although the general surgical principles and techniques for BCLP are similar to those applied in the repair of unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP), the optimal surgical protocol for BCLP is unclear. Given the scarcity of this cleft type, few, if any, institutions have sufficiently large caseloads to enable studies to investigate this properly, necessitating large multicenter studies. Thus, no universal standardized treatment protocols exist and great diversity among treatment protocols is present between centers.

In the literature, the surgical burden of care and long-term outcomes are often underreported, while the surgical outcomes in cleft populations are typically measured by speech-related outcomes and fistula prevalence. In this study, we aimed to investigate the long-term burden of care in terms of secondary surgeries, defined as speech-correcting surgeries (SCS) and fistula repair rates, as a quality measurement of primary surgery in a non-syndromic BCLP population at a single cleft center. Our secondary outcome was to examine the impact of two surgical protocols utilized over the years on the secondary surgery outcomes.

### Long-term follow-up of bilateral cleft lip and palate: incidence of speech-correcting surgeries and fistula formation [^115XGGcN]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here, we report the long-term need for secondary surgeries, defined as SCS and fistula repair, in a non-syndromic BCLP population treated at a single cleft center. We also compare two surgical protocols utilized over the years by assessing complication rates, defined as a quality measurement of the primary repair.

In general, little has been reported regarding the surgical management of BCLP and its long-term outcomes, with the literature tending to focus on the more common cleft types. However, when reported, BCLP is often associated with poorer speech outcomes and higher complication rates than the other less extensive cleft types. – Comparing our outcomes with two earlier studies by the same cleft center, reporting long-term surgical outcomes in isolated cleft palatesand UCLP, as expected, the same trend of poorer outcomes in BCLP was evident. Our results showed somewhat higher rates for SCS and fistula repair than previous reports on VPI, fistula occurrence, and secondary repair rates in BCLP. This may partly be explained by the much shorter follow-up in the majority of earlier studies. Particularly notable was the significantly high rates of fistula repair at ABG. Similar observations in BCLP are in line with Shankar et al.reporting late fistula rates at ABG as high as 76% while David et al.reported 79%, since a large proportion of fistulas remain undiagnosed prior to the intraoperative examination at ABG.

### Cleft lip and palate surgery: an update of clinical outcomes for primary repair [^115m3qWJ]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The comprehensive management of cleft lip and palate has received significant attention in the surgical literature over the last half century. It is the most common congenital facial malformation and has a significant developmental, physical, and psychological impact on those with the deformity and their families. In the United States, current estimates place the prevalence of cleft lip and palate or isolated cleft lip at approximately 1 in 600. There is significant phenotypic variation in the specific presentation of facial clefts. Understanding outcome data is important when making clinical decisions for patients with clefts. This article provides an update on current primary cleft lip and palate outcome data.

### Early surgical complications after primary cleft lip repair: a report of 3108 consecutive cases [^111L2HcY]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze short term surgical complications after primary cleft lip repair.

Patients and Design

A total of 3108 consecutive lip repairs with 2062 follow-ups were reviewed retrospectively through medical records. Patients were aged 3 months to 75 years at the time of surgery, with a median of 7 years.

Setting

Guwahati Comprehensive Cleft Care Center, Assam, India.

Intervention

Primary cleft lip repair.

Main Outcome Measures

Documented complications in terms of dehiscence, necrosis, infection, and suture granuloma were compiled. Logistic regression was used with dehiscence (yes/no) or infection (yes/no) as binary dependant variables. Age, cleft type, and surgeon (visiting/long term) were used as covariates.

Results

Among the 2062 patients who returned for early follow-up, 90 (4.4%) had one or more complications. Dehiscence (3.2%) and infection (1.1%) were the most common types of complication. Visiting surgeon, complete cleft, and bilateral cleft were significantly associated with wound dehiscence, and complete cleft was associated with wound infection according to the logistic regression analysis. Of patients with bilateral complete clefts, 6.9% suffered from some degree of wound dehiscence.

Conclusion

In a setting where presurgical molding is unavailable and patients present at all ages, lip wound dehiscence is a relatively common complication in patients with bilateral complete clefts. The risk of dehiscence, however, is reduced when these cases are assigned to surgeons with experience with these types of clefts. We also found that the incidence of wound infection can be kept relatively low, even without the use of postoperative antibiotics.

### Inter-centre comparison of data on surgery and speech outcomes at 5 years of age based on the Swedish quality registry for patients born with cleft palate with or without cleft lip [^111f9Asm]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The results indicated a risk of a negative speech result if the last primary palatal surgery was performed after 25 months of age. Whether the cleft in the palate was closed in one or two stages did not affect speech outcome. The Swedish CLP registry is useful for the open comparison of treatment results, to provide a basis for the improvement of treatment methods. If deviating negative results are seen consistently at a centre, one should act on this information by further investigation and analysis and making changes to the treatment protocol as needed.

### Optimizing perioperative anesthesia protocols for global delivery of safe cleft surgery [^114iBZTH]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The purpose of this article is to highlight the nuances in the perioperative anesthetic management of a patient with a cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) through underscoring the importance of nutrition and fasting guidelines in the preoperative period, airway and pain management intraoperatively, and feeding and pain management in the immediate postoperative period.

Methods

The authors outline key concepts in the perioperative anesthetic management of patients with CL/P through a literature review and the senior author's (Z.G.) experience providing anesthetic care in a low- or middle-income country.

Results

A comprehensive preoperative examination is required to identify concurrent morbidities or anomalies and implement appropriate treatment before surgical repair. Patient optimization is critical for favorable outcomes after CL/P repair and begins in the preoperative period and ends after patient stabilization postoperatively. Anesthesia providers contribute to perioperative management through the assessment, monitoring, and treatment of malnutrition; safe feeding and fasting times preoperatively and postoperatively; using reliable pain scales and regimens intraoperatively and postoperatively; and being in clear and constant communication with all members of the cleft care team to maintain patient safety.

Conclusions

A patient with a CL/P undergoing surgical repair requires a thorough preoperative history and physical examination, nutritional assessment, and a nil per os protocol that mitigates prolonged fasting. Intraoperatively, intubation and extubation with the assistance of a video laryngoscope and adherence to a throat pack protocol are essential. Postoperatively, a standardized pain management protocol with nonopioid medications and early reinitiation of feeding are integral for optimizing outcomes.

### Hospitalization trends for airway infections and in-hospital complications in cleft lip and palate [^112owGXq]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Subgroup and Sensitivity Analyses

Patients with a planned cleft lip repair had a notable increase in the incident rate for hospitalizations due to airway infections prior to surgery compared with controls (IRR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.20–2.81]). However, after surgery, the incidence rate did not significantly differ from that of the control group (IRR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.70–1.98]). Conversely, the incidence rate for hospitalizations of any cause significantly increased after lip repair (IRR, 6.78 [95% CI, 6.00–7.67]) compared with the presurgery group (IRR, 3.42 [95% CI, 2.97–3.94]) (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1). When compared with controls, patients with a cleft lip showed no significant difference in the odds of requiring intubation, resuscitation, or respiratory support, either before or after lip repair surgery (eFigure 5 in Supplement 1).

### Special considerations for international weight standards for cleft surgery: presurgical optimisation in a patient with femoral-facial syndrome [^114Buurb]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

The patient was seen for follow-up at regular intervals and developed no immediate or delayed postsurgical complications, including infection, dehiscence or fistula. On resumption of age-appropriate regular diet, the patient's nutritional status steadily improved to 75% of age expectation (without accounting for limb difference) at the 6-month postoperative clinic visit. With support from speech therapy, which was offered as a component of the treating centre's multidisciplinary care model, there were significant improvements in the language milestones as well.

### Cleft lip and palate [^11739gJE]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Clefts of the lip and palate are generally divided into two groups, isolated cleft palate and cleft lip with or without cleft palate, representing a heterogeneous group of disorders affecting the lips and oral cavity. These defects arise in about 1.7 per 1000 liveborn babies, with ethnic and geographic variation. Effects on speech, hearing, appearance, and psychology can lead to longlasting adverse outcomes for health and social integration. Typically, children with these disorders need multidisciplinary care from birth to adulthood and have higher morbidity and mortality throughout life than do unaffected individuals. This Seminar describes embryological developmental processes, epidemiology, known environmental and genetic risk factors, and their interaction. Although access to care has increased in recent years, especially in developing countries, quality of care still varies substantially. Prevention is the ultimate objective for clefts of the lip and palate, and a prerequisite of this aim is to elucidate causes of the disorders. Technological advances and international collaborations have yielded some successes.

### Predictors of complication following cleft lip and palate surgery in a low-resource setting: a prospective outcomes study in Nicaragua [^114bHBSW]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Higher rates of postoperative complication following cleft lip or palate repair have been documented in low resource settings, but their causes remain unclear. This study sought to delineate patient, surgeon, and care environment factors in cleft complications in a low-income country.

Design

Prospective outcomes study.

Setting

Comprehensive Cleft Care Center.

Patients

Candidate patients presenting for cleft lip or palate repair or revision.

Interventions

Patient anthropometric, nutritional, environmental and peri- and post-operative care factors were collected. Post-operative evaluation occurred at standard 1-week and 2-month postoperative intervals.

Main Outcome Measures

Complication was defined as fistula, dehiscence and/or infection.

Results

Among 408 patients enrolled, 380 (93%) underwent surgery, of which 208 (55%) underwent lip repair (124) or revision (84), and 178 (47%) underwent palate repair (96) or revision (82). 322 (85%) were evaluated 1 week and 166 (44%) 2 months postoperatively. 50(16%) complications were identified, including: 25(8%) fistulas, 24(7%) dehiscences, 17(5%) infections. Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) ≤ 12.5cm was associated with dehiscence after primary lip repair (OR = 28, p = 0.02). Leukocytosis ≥ 11,500 on pre-operative evaluation was associated with dehiscence (OR = 2.51, p = 0.04) or palate revision fistula (OR = 64, p < 0.001). Surgeons who performed fewer previous-year palate repairs had higher likelihood of palate complications, (OR = 3.03, p = 0.01) although there was no difference in complication rate with years of surgeon experience or duration of surgery.

Conclusions

Multiple patient, surgeon, and perioperative factors are associated with higher rates of complication in a low-resource setting, and are potentially modifiable to reduce complications following cleft surgery.

### The lima surgical protocol for cleft palate repair [^113iTQPr]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

A cleft team experience addressing non-syndromic cleft palate and cleft lip and palate is presented. The purpose of the present study is to compare surgical outcomes using 2 different protocols for cleft palate repair provided by a cleft team in Lima, Perú.

Methods

This is a comparative study between 2 groups of patients with non-syndromic cleft palate who were operated using different surgical protocols from 1999 to 2014. One hundred twenty-four children with non-syndromic isolated cleft palate and cleft lip and palate treated from 2007 to 2014 using a surgical protocol developed by our cleft team in Lima, Perú were compared with 145 children with cleft palate and cleft lip and palate treated by the same team using different protocol from 1999 to 2007. Data collection was accomplished by evaluation of symptomatic oronasal fistulas, presence of velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) and postoperative complications.

Results

Statistical significant differences were observed between the 2 groups regarding the development of flap necrosis in favor of the Lima protocol. No significant difference in palatal fistula and VPI rate between the 2 protocols was found.

Conclusions

The Lima Surgical Protocol for cleft palate repair is an alternative strategy which uses the strengths of different surgical techniques based on the severity of the cleft. We observed better surgical outcomes using the Lima protocol with regards to postoperative complications in patients with non-syndromic cleft palate.

### Cleft lip / cleft palate | Birth defects… [^111Ew29B]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Cleft palate The roof of the mouth is formed between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancy. A cleft palate happens if the tissue that makes up the palate doesn't join together completely. For some babies, both the front and back parts of the palate are open. For other babies, only part of the palate is open. Together, these birth defects are called "orofacial clefts". If the orofacial clefts are not surgically repaired, children with these conditions have problems with feeding and speaking clearly. They may also more often have ear infections and hearing problems, or problems with their teeth. Diagnosis Orofacial clefts, especially cleft lip, can be diagnosed during pregnancy by a routine ultrasound. They can also be diagnosed after the baby is born. Certain types of cleft palate might not be diagnosed until later in life.

Treatment Services and treatment for children with orofacial clefts can vary depending on:

- The severity of the cleft
- The child's age and needs
- The presence of associated syndromes or other birth defects Surgery to repair a cleft lip usually occurs in the first few months of life. It is recommended within the first 12 months of life. Surgery to repair a cleft palate is recommended within the first 18 months of life, or earlier if possible. Many children will need additional surgical procedures as they get older. Surgical repair can help restore function to the lips and mouth. It may help improve breathing, hearing, and speech and language development. Children born with orofacial clefts may also need special dental or orthodontic care or speech therapy. With treatment, most children with orofacial clefts do well and lead a healthy life. Some children may have issues with self-esteem if they are concerned with visible differences between themselves and other children.

### Evaluation of postoperative outcomes following early and late palate repair: a preclinical study [^114eRoFL]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients born with cleft lip and palate, surgical repairs are typically undertaken in the first years of life. This approach is guided by clinical data demonstrating that early closure of the lip and soft palate improves feeding and speech development. There is, however, no consensus on the optimal timing for closure of the hard palate because, in this anatomical location, surgical repair in a skeletally immature patient is associated with midfacial growth arrest. – This growth arrest increases the likelihood that subsequent maxillary advancement surgeries will be required to correct skeletal deformities.

Skeletal growth arrest is directly attributable to the surgical intervention as children who undergo similar repairs after midfacial skeletal maturity has been reachedrarely exhibit midfacial growth truncations. – If we understood exactly what aspects of the surgery led to craniomaxillofacial (CMF) growth arrest in younger patients, then we would be in a better position to develop new techniques and strategies that significantly improve overall functional outcomes. At present, there is a limited understanding of why hard palate repair procedures in skeletally immature patients cause surgically induced midfacial growth arrest. The surgical correction of cleft palate defects typically involves the vomero-premaxillary, mid-palatal, and transverse palatal sutures, all of which act as growth sites in the CMF skeleton. – Indirect evidence suggests that disturbances in suture dynamics contribute to midfacial growth arrest. – General disruptions at the vomero-premaxillary and transverse palatal sutures, scarring in soft tissues, and/or resorption/remodeling of hard tissues are contributing factors – but at present, these data are insufficient to guide surgical improvements.

Thus, the purpose of this work was to develop and characterize a preclinical animal model in which a surgical intervention before skeletal maturity reliably produced midfacial growth arrest. Skeletally immature mice at 2 developmental stages were subjected to a surgical procedure that mimicked aspects of a typical cleft repair surgery, for example, mucoperiosteal denudation with elevation and reposition of a palatal flap. – Skeletally mature mice served as controls. Micro–computed tomography (μCT) imaging analyses were conducted to assess the degree of midfacial growth arrest in test and control groups. Histological analyses were also undertaken to evaluate soft and hard tissue repair and were coupled with immunohistochemical analyses to understand aspects of soft tissue scarring.

### Long-term speech outcomes in unilateral cleft lip and palate: a comparative study of early and delayed hard palate closure [^1146mCMU]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Protocol overview

This study aims to evaluate and compare speech outcomes, the frequency of speech-enhancing surgeries, and the presence of oronasal fistulas in separate cross-sectional cohorts of UCLP patients assessed at 5, 12, or 22 years of age. Specifically, it examines the impact of the timing of hard palate closure on both clinical and patient-reported speech outcomes. The findings will contribute to the body of evidence on the role of timing of hard palate closure in speech outcomes and support the pursuit of optimal surgical protocols to improve treatment for UCLP patients.

### Primary cleft palate repair [^114s2unB]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

There are several factors to consider when planning cleft palate repair. It is important to review the patient's associated comorbidities, as they impact decisions on perioperative management and family counseling. Many comorbidities change the risk of postoperative airway obstruction, velopharyngeal insufficiency, or fistula formation. It is also critical to determine the type of cleft palate to be addressed, as this influences the decision on which technique is most appropriate for optimal patient outcome. Common surgical techniques for palatoplasty are reviewed in detail and outcomes are discussed as it relates to various techniques. Intraoperative photographs are included to detail the procedures.

### Hospitalization for airway infections and complications in cleft lip and palate… [^112YNT7W]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Additionally, data on the association of corrective surgery with hospitalization risk and in-hospital resource use are scarce. 12 The type of cleft dictates the method and timing of corrective surgery, 13, 14 with guidelines typically adhering to the Rule of 10s for lip repair: age at least 10 weeks, weight of 10. To assess potential differences in outcomes associated with corrective surgery, we defined 2 timeframes for patients with a cleft lip or palate and a documented corrective surgery. Hospitalizations from controls were allocated to a timeframe based on their age in reference to the mean age at which patients with clefts underwent their initial surgery. Characteristics at birth for children who did not receive cleft repair surgery are shown in eTable 3 in Supplement 1.

The most common cleft repair procedures were primary plastic reconstruction on the soft palate and cheiloplasty for a congenital cleft lip. The mean age at the time of the first surgery was 236 days for any corrective surgery, 313 days for palate repair, and 181 days for lip repair, with significant differences in distribution observed between the types of surgery. Nonetheless, children who underwent corrective surgery within this timeframe continued to have a higher risk of airway infection–related hospitalizations, especially before the cleft repair, although this risk persisted to a certain extent after surgery as well. Notably, when stratifying between surgical modalities, the increased hospitalization rates for airway infections remained high after palate repair but normalized after lip repair.

This aligns with the varying severity of cleft types and their corresponding surgical interventions.
17. The optimal timing for cleft repair surgery has been debated for years. 14, 26, 27 Findings reported by Gamble et al13 in 2023 have shown that corrective surgery performed at age 6 months is safer and yields better outcomes for velopharyngeal insufficiency compared with surgery at age 12 months. In line with our results, this evidence further supports the benefits of an earlier surgical correction. Furthermore, this study represents the first of its kind, focusing on hospitalizations due to airway infections in patients with a cleft lip or palate within such a comprehensive study population.

### Hospitalization trends for airway infections and in-hospital complications in cleft lip and palate [^111o3uew]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study of 857 806 newborns in Swiss hospitals from 2012 to 2021, 3 key findings emerged. First, children with cleft lip or palate were more likely to have concomitant congenital issues and birth complications. Second, a significant proportion of these children received cleft repair surgery, primarily soft palate reconstruction and cheiloplasty for cleft lips, within the first 2 years of life. Third, these children exhibited higher hospitalization rates for airway infections and other causes, both before and after surgery. Additionally, compared with children without these conditions, children with cleft lip or palate had increased risks of in-hospital complications and mortality, and greater resource use.

Our study highlights that children born with a cleft lip or palate had a higher relative risk of hospitalization due to airway infections, supporting the findings from a 2020 analysis that identified cleft lip or palate as a risk factor for bronchiolitis. In our cohort, children with a cleft lip or palate who had not yet undergone corrective surgery were particularly prone to hospitalizations for airway infections. This risk may be linked to a higher prevalence of congenital malformations and neonatological complications, often rendering these children ineligible for early surgery according to the historical Rule of 10s. Therefore, it is plausible to suggest a reversed association: the severity of the patients' conditions and their propensity for hospitalizations might delay their eligibility for corrective surgery within the first 2 years of life.

Nonetheless, children who underwent corrective surgery within this timeframe continued to have a higher risk of airway infection–related hospitalizations, especially before the cleft repair, although this risk persisted to a certain extent after surgery as well. Notably, when stratifying between surgical modalities, the increased hospitalization rates for airway infections remained high after palate repair but normalized after lip repair. This aligns with the varying severity of cleft types and their corresponding surgical interventions.

Regarding the overall increased risk of a rehospitalization, it is plausible to suggest that patients with a cleft lip or palate may not necessarily experience more severe airway infections but are more likely to be hospitalized due to increased vigilance by parents and health care practitioners. This greater awareness could be linked to feeding difficulties observed in these children, which is consistent with reduced fluid intake as a criterion for hospitalization in children with airway infections. However, our study also identified an elevated relative risk for in-hospital complications, greater resource utilization, higher mortality, indicating that these patients indeed suffer from more severe illness.

### Hospitalization trends for airway infections and in-hospital complications in cleft lip and palate [^115SnhuN]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study including 857 806 newborns, we observed an association of the presence of cleft lip and/or palate with higher hospitalization rates for airway infections and all-cause rehospitalizations. This association was particularly pronounced among individuals who had not undergone corrective surgery. Furthermore, children with cleft lip or palate exhibited more unfavorable in-hospital outcomes and greater resource utilization compared with their counterparts without these conditions.

### Cleft lip and cleft palate surgery: malpractice litigation outcomes [^1127FAhe]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

This study examined malpractice claims related to cleft lip and cleft palate surgery to identify common allegations and injuries and reviewed financial outcomes.

Design

The WestlawNext legal database was analyzed for all malpractice lawsuits and settlements related to the surgical repair of cleft lip and palate.

Main Outcomes Measures

Inclusion criteria included patients undergoing surgical repair of a primary cleft lip or palate or revision for complications of previous surgery. Data evaluated included patient demographics, type of operation performed, plaintiff allegation, nature of injury, and litigation outcomes.

Results

A total of 36 cases were identified, with 12 unique cases from 1981 to 2006 meeting the inclusion criteria. Six cases (50%) were decided by a jury and six by settlement. Five cases involved complications related to the specific surgery, and the other seven were associated with any surgery and perioperative care of children and adults. Cleft palate repair (50%) was the most frequently litigated surgery. Postoperative negligent supervision was the most common allegation (42%) and resulted in a payout in each case (mean = $3,126,032). Death (42%) and brain injury (25%) were the most frequent injuries reported. Financial awards were made in nine cases (after adjusting for inflation, mean = $2,470,552, range = $0 to $7,704,585). The awards were significantly larger for brain injury than other outcomes ($4,675,395 versus $1,368,131 after adjusting for inflation, P = .0101).

Conclusion

Malpractice litigation regarding cleft lip and palate surgery is uncommon. However, significant financial awards involving perioperative brain injury have been reported.

### Secondary alveolar bone grafting in patients with unilateral and bilateral complete cleft lip and palate: a single-institution outcomes evaluation using three-dimensional cone beam computed tomography [^111ssGm4]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Secondary alveolar bone grafting of autologous bone from the iliac crest is a widely accepted modality for repair of residual alveolar cleft in patients with mixed dentition with previously repaired complete cleft lip and palate. There remains debate regarding surgical timing and preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative management of these cases.

Methods

This retrospective study reviewed patient demographic information in addition to preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative course to evaluate how patient and practice factors impact graft outcomes as assessed by three-dimensional cone beam computed tomographic evaluation at the 6-month postoperative visit.

Results

On univariate analysis, age at operation older than 9 years, history of oronasal fistula, history of cleft lip or palate revision, and history of international adoption were all found to significantly increase likelihood of graft failure (p < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, age older than 9 years was found to be the single most significant predictor of graft failure (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in graft outcomes between patients with unilateral or bilateral cleft lip and palate, and no single variable was found to significantly correlate to increased complication rates. The graft success rate overall of the authors' practice was 86.2 percent, with a complication rate of 7.7 percent.

Conclusions

Secondary alveolar bone grafting is an integral part of the cleft lip and palate surgical treatment series; this study identified several outcome predictors for both graft failure and adverse events, the most significant of which was age at operation. Although the mixed dentition phase often extends to 12 years of age, it is recommended that bone grafting be performed before 9 years of age to optimize outcomes.

### The early operative burden for children born with cleft lip and palate [^113j7pvx]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

to audit the surgical management of infants born with non-syndromic cleft lip and palate (CLP) at an Australian cleft unit in a large tertiary paediatric hospital.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

A tertiary Cleft centre.

Patients

193 infants born with non-syndromic CLP were referred to the centre and underwent primary repair of their CLP between 2009 and 2020. Main Outcome Measures: (1) The timing and surgical repairs performed; (2) the frequency of postoperative complications; (3) the frequency of secondary Cleft surgery; and (4) the total Cleft-related operations performed for infants born with CLP.

Results

Four different surgical repair techniques were performed by six surgeons, and postoperative complications were uncommon (n = 14). Rates of oronasal fistula surgery (10.5% at five years of age; 14.3% at eight years of age) and velopharyngeal insufficiency surgery (8.7% at five years of age; 14.3% at eight years of age) were not significantly different across the surgical repair groups (p-value > 0.05) and were comparable to international Cleft centres. Children underwent an average of four operative procedures in this audit period, including primary Cleft repair, ear, nose and throat surgery, and dental care. Surgery for managing Eustachian tube dysfunction was the most common surgical intervention following primary Cleft repair.

Conclusions

Children born with non-syndromic CLP have a high early operative burden, with outcomes similar across the spectrum of techniques and surgeons.

### Patient reported outcome following the skoog unilateral cleft lip repair among adults-a long-term cohort study and comparison to a non-cleft population [^112b8J1G]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Dissatisfaction with lip appearance was correlated to a higher desire to change the lip and facial appearance. Despite this, the number of secondary lip corrections did not correlate to the satisfaction of lip and facial appearance. These findings are in accordance with results in previous studies in patients with varying clefts. Surprisingly, the results of this study showed that despite numerous surgical lip revisions, patients still expressed a greater desire to change the appearance of the lip and face. Indicating that patients still felt compromised by their appearance despite the number of lip revisions. However, caution should be used when drawing conclusions because it's hard to tell if the desire to improve the lip and face appearance or other consequences, such as initial expectations, cause more lip revisions.

Various factors may limit the accuracy of self-assessment of appearance and satisfaction with the outcome after cleft lip and palate treatment. A previous study reported that patients feel grateful to their cleft surgeon and may not discuss dissatisfaction with facial features related to the CLP. This may lead to an under-reporting of cleft-related appearance concerns. An important factor influencing patient satisfaction is their expectations. Satisfaction is related to how the perception of treatment meets patients' expectations. Subjects with lower expectations tend to be more satisfied. Unrealistic expectations regarding the outcome of surgical treatment may anticipate poor psychosocial outcomes. Realistic and honest information about what can and cannot be achieved in cleft care may help to generate more realistic expectations, resulting in less unhappiness with one's appearance.

### Cleft palate fistula repair… [^111oJe47]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The treatment of cleft palate fistulas is currently unstandardized, and the outcome is often unsuccessful. Conventional surgical techniques for the repair of such fistulas involving bony defects have essentially been abandoned by the author. Current protocol calls for their repair in early adolescence following completion of any required orthodontic expansion of the maxillary dental arch. At the time of fistula repair, all scar tissue is excised between the maxillary segments. Both palatal and gingival soft-tissue flaps are developed to cover either free cancellous bone grafts or free periosteal grafts used to bridge the maxillary defect. This change in technique has resulted in osteogenic filling of the maxillary bony defect and has markedly improved the success rate of fistula repair. Furthermore, it has enhanced the aesthetic correction of the nasal alar base cleft stigmas. Schultz RC.

### Hospitalization trends for airway infections and in-hospital complications in cleft lip and palate [^114f7Pxe]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Hospitalizations Due to Airway Infections or Any Cause

During the 2-year follow-up, hospitalization rates for airway infections (IRR, 2.33 [95% CI, 1.98–2.73]) and for any cause (IRR, 3.72 [95% CI, 3.49–3.97]) were higher in children with a cleft lip or palate compared with controls. The highest rates for both outcomes were observed in children with uncorrected clefts, followed by those who had undergone palate repair, lip repair, and lastly, controls (Figure 3). Incidence rates for airway infections were higher for children before cleft repair surgery (IRR, 2.38 [95% CI, 1.82–3.11]) compared with after surgery (IRR, 1.87 [95% CI, 1.33–2.64]). However, incidence rates for hospitalizations due to any cause were lower before cleft repair (IRR, 4.06 [95% CI, 3.68 to 4.47]) compared with after surgery (IRR, 6.55 [95% CI, 5.90 to 7.28]) compared with children without a cleft (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1).

Figure 3.
Incidence Rates of Hospitalizations Due to Airway Infections or Any Cause by Age

In-Hospital Outcomes

Compared with children without a cleft lip or palate, those born with these conditions had increased odds of in-hospital complications and higher resource use. Moreover, these patients experienced relatively longer hospital LOS for airway infections (β = 2.25 [95% CI, 1.71–2.78]) and for any causes of hospitalization (β = 5.75 [95% CI, 5.04–6.46]) than their counterparts without any clefts. Analyzing the data by classifying patients into before and after cleft repair surgery groups, the trends remained similar in the presurgery group, except for the need for resuscitation. In contrast, in the postsurgery group, there were no significant differences in odds compared with the control group (Figure 4).

### Cleft lip and palate [^1158mzYi]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

The most common congenital deformity of the head and neck, cleft lip and palate, presents the surgeon with a unique esthetic and reconstructive challenge. The complexity of these deformities demands the skills of a multidisciplinary team of professionals to optimize surgical outcome. This article discusses the embryology, epidemiology, and genetics of cleft lip and palate and details the history and modern methods of their surgical correction, the proper goal of which is restoration of normal facial form and velopharyngeal function.

### Hospitalization trends for airway infections and in-hospital complications in cleft lip and palate [^11374jLy]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

While we observed decreasing hospitalization rates for airway infections after corrective surgery, the hospitalization rates for any cause were increased compared with controls even after corrective surgery. This phenomenon could be explained by the fact that the first corrective surgery is used as a reference point, especially since nearly half of our population had both a cleft lip and palate, necessitating multiple corrective procedures. Moreover, given that the presence of a cleft lip or palate often coexists with a larger syndrome, the elevated hospitalization rates may be attributed to a higher prevalence of comorbidities. These patients also experienced a longer hospital LOS, further supporting the notion that their medical condition was more severe. Importantly, the risk of airway infection, complications, and hospital LOS all showed a reduction after corrective surgery.

The optimal timing for cleft repair surgery has been debated for years. Findings reported by Gamble et alin 2023 have shown that corrective surgery performed at age 6 months is safer and yields better outcomes for velopharyngeal insufficiency compared with surgery at age 12 months. In line with our results, this evidence further supports the benefits of an earlier surgical correction.

Within our cohort, only 62.2% of infants with a cleft underwent a cleft repair within the first 2 years of their lives. Factors for a delayed surgical intervention have been a focus of study for years. While most research has focused on ethical and socioeconomic factors, the baseline characteristics for the infants not receiving any cleft repair surgery in this cohort suggest birth complications and comorbidities were relevant factors in delayed or missing cleft repair.,

Our analysis has several strengths, with the most significant being the large patient cohort and near-comprehensive nationwide records. This is particularly bolstered by the fact that newborn assessments in hospitals routinely include lip and palate examinations, thus leading to a high detection rate during birth hospitalizations, which can be assumed to closely approximate the actual prevalence. Consequently, our findings demonstrate high external validity, particularly among countries sharing a similar economic status, health care system, and genetic makeup of the population. Furthermore, this study represents the first of its kind, focusing on hospitalizations due to airway infections in patients with a cleft lip or palate within such a comprehensive study population.

### A survey on enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) elements in cleft palate repair [^111nZNPB]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

This survey is a first step in developing an ERAS protocol specific to cleft palate repair. As mentioned previously, a cleft palate repair poses a unique opportunity for further optimization. While many procedures benefit from a standardized enhanced recovery program, reducing crying and strain on a fresh cleft palate repair make this procedure a particularly powerful context in which to consider application of a standardized ERAS protocol. Primary palatoplasty has a perioperative complication rate of 2.8%, 30-day fistula rate of 0.5%, and readmission rate of 1.9%. While these are relatively low complication rates, we hypothesize that perioperative optimization could improve longer-term speech outcomes in the setting of cleft palate repair. Our findings provide a starting point for pilot studies examining enhanced recovery from cleft palate repair. We used these results to formalize an ERAS protocol for cleft palate repairs at our children's hospital. This was designed in consultation with our anesthesia and nursing colleagues to ensure smooth implementation during the entire perioperative period. Our protocol includes the 9 elements designated by a majority of respondents as a valuable addition to their practice as well as the use of TXA and DEX (Table 5). We are prospectively studying perioperative and future speech outcomes in this cohort. To date, 24 patients have undergone palatoplasty in compliance with our ERAS protocol; none had a short-term symptom or complication related to use of TXA or DEX.

### Long-term follow-up of unilateral cleft lip and palate: incidence of speech-correcting surgeries and fistula formation [^111dYrFy]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Various surgical protocols of single- and 2-stage approaches with large differences in the timing of surgery for cleft repair have been described in the literature, yet no consensus exists regarding whether 1 protocol is more favorable than another (Shaw et al. 2001;). Many centers have well-defined standard protocols, it is not uncommon that surgeons apply a technique by experience, adapting it accordingly to the nature of the cleft. This, in turn, leads to modified techniques, hindering comparisons of particular surgical techniques.

A recent meta-analysis by) reported that single-stage repair is associated with a more favorable outcome concerning VPI and fistula formation relative to a 2-stage repair, which entails early soft palate closure and delayed hard palate closure. Similarly, andfound superior surgical outcomes regarding VPI and fistulae with the single-stage procedure compared to the 2-stage approach with early vomer flap repair. In this study, we did not find any significant differences between the 2-stage and single-stage procedures at the long-term follow-up. Our outcomes are in line with an earlier study at our center, which assessed velopharyngeal function at 3 and 5 years following primary repair in individuals with UCLP treated with the same protocols. However, although no statistical significance was found, we observed less need for SCS in the single-stage protocol compared with the 2-stage protocols prior to ABG. Such a trend of superior speech outcomes in a single-stage protocol compared to a 2-stage approach is consistent with findings of,… Particularly, patients operated with the 2-flap (Bardach) technique required a low need for SCS and compared with the 2-stage protocols this difference was significantly lower prior to ABG. On the contrary, we observed a high need for fistula repair at ABG in the single-stage approach, particularly in patients that had received primary repair with the V–W–K technique. However, when compared with the other single-stage techniques, as well as with the 2-stage protocols, this finding was not significantly significant. One can speculate whether the repaired palate receives a greater retroposition with the single-stage procedure than with the 2-stage approach, resulting in improved velopharyngeal function with less need for SCS. This supposition is consistent with the findings ofwho found shorter palatal length in the early vomer flap population compared to the single-stage population, reasoning that an early vomer flap causes scar contracture in the palate.

### Cleft lip and / or palate: one organization's experience with more than a quarter million surgeries during the past decade [^115xTNMV]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A charitable surgical relief organization (Smile Train) enables local physicians in developing countries to provide surgical treatment of cleft lip and/or palate. The following study reviews the epidemiological data from more than 260,000 surgeries performed in India through this organization from 2000 until January 1, 2012.

Methods

Demographic and clinical patient data were collected from the participating surgeons, recorded in Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA), and analyzed using Software Package for the Social Sciences (IBM, Armonk, NY).

Results

The distribution of clefts treated was 20.2% of cleft lip, 13.9% of cleft palate (CP), and 65.9% of cleft lip and palate. The overall unilateral-bilateral ratio was 2.49:1 with a left-right ratio of 2.03:1. The male-female ratio was 1.58:1. Of the total patients, 2.67% had associated anomalies. The most frequently performed surgeries included primary repair of a unilateral cleft lip (41.62%), followed by primary repair of a CP (31.15%). The mean age at surgery was 7.91 years. The reported complication rate was 0.88%.

Conclusions

The data collected are from the largest reported cohort of orofacial cleft patients in India. The cleft type, sex distribution, and overall male predominance resemble previously reported distributions; however, fewer CP patients and greater cleft lip and palate patients presented than would be expected. The frequency of associated anomalies was lower than in previous reports. Although there is significant selection bias to milder cases from lower socioeconomic groups in this study, the large sample size is unique, and the data collected can provide a valuable framework to further study the epidemiology of cleft lip and/or palate in India.

### Cleft lip and palate [^116Lw6ix]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Patients who have cleft lip or palate face significant lifelong communicative and aesthetic challenges and difficulties with deglutition. Management of patients who have orofacial clefting requires an understanding of the anatomy and pathophysiology associated with clefting and the developmental difficulties encountered by these patients. This article describes current surgical concepts and principles of cleft care. Advances in the embryology and genetics of orofacial clefting are also discussed. It is expected that the care of patients who have clefts will continue to evolve because of advances in the fields of tissue engineering, genetics, and fetal surgery.

### Impact of geopolitical unrest on surgical delays and outcomes in immigrant populations with cleft lip and palate [^113SR5gu]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East have led to mass migrations, with Turkey becoming a major host country. This influx has strained the health care system, particularly regarding specialized care for conditions like cleft lip and palate (CLP). Timely intervention is crucial for optimal outcomes, but cultural, socioeconomic, and logistical barriers often cause delays, impacting physical, functional, and psychosocial development.

Methods

This retrospective study analyzed 72 immigrant pediatric CLP patients treated in Turkey between 2012 and 2022. Data on demographics, medical history, surgical interventions, complications, and treatment delays were collected. Surgical timing was compared with American Cleft Palate Craniofacial Association guidelines, and the impact of socioeconomic status on delays was assessed.

Results

Seventy-two patients underwent a total of 91 surgical interventions, including 29 cleft lip repairs, 22 cleft palate repairs, 6 pharyngeal flaps, 15 fistula closures, 8 corrections of secondary lip scars and whistling deformities, and 11 alveolar bone graftings. A majority (73.6%) had poor socioeconomic status. The average delays for cleft lip, cleft palate, and alveolar bone grafting surgeries were 5.3 ± 4, 7.3 ± 6.1, and 34.1 ± 23.5 months, respectively, and were significantly longer for patients with poor socioeconomic status (P = 0.00502, 0.030741, and 0.041878). The average delay for pharyngeal flap surgery, performed in patients with poor socioeconomic status (except for one), was 43.7 ± 14.1 months.

Conclusions

This study highlights the challenges and disparities in CLP care for immigrant children in Turkey due to geopolitical conflict. While surgical complication rates are similar to established data, delays in treatment, especially among those with lower socioeconomic status, are a significant concern. The findings emphasize the need for comprehensive, culturally sensitive care and systemic interventions to improve access and outcomes for this vulnerable population.

Cleft lip and cleft palate — evaluation and timing of repair are described as follows: "it is essential that health professionals check for palatal clefting (both overt and submucosal) on initial presentation, by visually inspecting and palpating the palate". "This should be done using a tongue depressor and flashlight to allow for inspection of the entire palate, including the uvula". "An oral examination is of relevance if an infant is presenting with feeding difficulties or not gaining weight". For surgical timing, "The primary repair(s) are generally completed within 18 months of life, with the lip being repaired before the palate at 3–9 months of age".

### Early cleft lip repair: demonstrating efficacy in the first 100 patients [^111qtQkK]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cleft lip and/or palate affects approximately one in 700 live births. Optimal timing for repair of cleft lip has yet to be objectively validated. Earlier repair takes advantage of a high degree of plasticity within the nasal cartilage and maxilla. The authors present patients enrolled in an early cleft lip repair protocol facilitating effective repair of the cleft lip and nostril.

Methods

American Society of Anesthesiologists class I to II patients with unilateral cleft lip and/or palate undergoing repair before 3 months of age were enrolled over 5 years. Perioperative data, surgical and anesthetic complications, preoperative and postoperative nostril breadth, nostril width, nasal angle, lip length, frontal nasal breadth, and commissure length measured as ratios between the cleft and noncleft sides were abstracted. Early cleft lip repair and nasoalveolar molding patients were matched for cleft lip severity using the cleft width ratios and compared.

Results

The surgical and anesthetic complication rate for 100 early cleft lip repair patients was 2 percent. Operative and anesthetic times were 123 ± 37 minutes and 177 ± 34 minutes, respectively. Hospital length of stay was 1 ± 0 day. Age at repair between early cleft lip repair and nasoalveolar molding was 33 ± 15 days and 118 ± 33 days, respectively. After early cleft lip repair, preoperative to postoperative distance from symmetry for all anthropomorphic measurements improved (p < 0.001). Comparing severity-matched early cleft lip repair to nasoalveolar molding patients, similar improvements were observed, suggesting equivalent results (p > 0.05).

Conclusion

Early cleft lip repair provides an efficacious method for correcting the cleft lip and nasal deformity that simulates nasoalveolar molding.

### Evidence-based practices in cleft palate surgery [^1176Y3qC]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: (1) Understand the embryologic origins, cause, and incidence of cleft palate. (2) Review the anatomy and common classifications of cleft palate and associated defects. (3) Describe surgical techniques for palatoplasty and understand their respective indications. (4) Gain an awareness of general perioperative care considerations, timing of repair, and risk factors for and operative mitigation of complications.

Summary

Cleft palate affects 0.1 to 1.1 per 1000 births, with a higher incidence in certain ethnic groups but affecting both sexes equally. Cleft palate may occur in isolation or in combination with cleft lip or in association with other congenital anomalies including various syndromes. The goals of cleft palate repair are to anatomically separate the oral and nasal cavities for normal feeding and improved speech and minimize the risk of oronasal fistulas, velopharyngeal dysfunction, and disruption of facial growth. This review discusses the incidence, causes, and classification of cleft palate; surgical techniques for palatoplasty and perioperative patient management; and complications of palatoplasty.

### Evidence-based medicine: cleft palate [^1119XrFX]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Describe the incidence of cleft palate and risk factors associated with development of an orofacial cleft. 2. Understand differences among several techniques to repair clefts of both the hard and soft palates. 3. Discuss risk factors for development of postoperative fistulas, velopharyngeal insufficiency, and facial growth problems. 4. Establish a treatment plan for individualized care of a cleft palate patient.

Summary

Orofacial clefts are the most common congenital malformations of the head and neck region, and approximately three-quarters of these patients have some form of cleft palate deformity. Cleft palate repair is generally performed in children between 6 and 12 months of age. The goals of palate repair are to minimize the occurrence of fistulas, establish a normal velopharyngeal mechanism, and optimize facial growth. This Maintenance of Certification review discusses the incidence and epidemiology associated with cleft palate deformity and specifics associated with patient care, including analgesia, surgical repair techniques, and complications associated with repair of the cleft palate.

### Ten-year experience of more than 35, 000 orofacial clefts in Africa [^114oFZuV]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical correction of orofacial clefts greatly mitigates negative outcomes. However, access to reconstructive surgery is limited in developing countries. The present study reviews epidemiological data from a single charitable organization, Smile Train, with a database of surgical cases from 33 African countries from 2001–2011.

Methods

Demographic and clinical patient data were collected from questionnaires completed by the participating surgeons. These data were recorded in Excel, analyzed using SPSS and compared with previously reported data.

Results

Questionnaires were completed for 36,384 patients by 389 African surgeons. The distribution of clefts was: 34.44% clefts of the lip (CL), 58.87% clefts of the lip and palate (CLP), and 6.69% clefts of the palate only (CP). The male to female ratio was 1.46:1, and the unilateral: bilateral ratio 2.93:1, with left-sided predominance 1.69:1. Associated anomalies were found in 4.18% of patients. The most frequent surgeries included primary lip/nose repairs, unilateral (68.36%) and bilateral (11.84%). There was seasonal variation in the frequency of oral cleft births with the highest in January and lowest by December. The average age at surgery was 9.34 years and increased in countries with lower gross domestic products. The average hospital stay was 4.5 days. The reported complication rate was 1.92%.

Conclusions

With the exception of cleft palates, results follow trends of worldwide epidemiologic reports of 25% CL, 50% CLP, and 25% CP, 2:1 unilateral:bilateral and left:right ratios, and male predominance. Fewer than expected patients, especially females, presented with isolated cleft palates, suggesting that limitations in economic resources and cultural aesthetics of the obvious lip deformity may outweigh functional concerns and access to treatment for females. A fewer than expected associated anomalies suggests either true ethnic variation, or that more severely-affected patients are not presenting for treatment. The epidemiology of orofacial clefting in Africa has been difficult to assess due to the diversity of the continent and the considerable variation among study designs. The large sample size of the data collected provides a basis for further study of the epidemiology of orofacial clefting in Africa.

### Ten-year experience of more than 35, 000 orofacial clefts in Africa [^11473eKH]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The current cohort of 36,384 patients, across 33 different countries, in mostly rural and economically disadvantaged areas, does provide a substantial contribution to our current understanding of cleft care in Africa. Important findings include smaller than expected percentages and bias for certain types of patients. There were fewer patients with isolated clefts of the palate, associated anomalies, and complications than expected. It is possible that rather than genetic and environmental variation, patients with isolated cleft palates have a higher mortality rate, are being underreported, have diminished access to care, or have greater cultural concerns about the visible versus functional defects. Patients with associated anomalies may also be underrepresented, which could be due to incomplete screening or that patients too severely affected are not brought for treatment. The fact that the age at time of surgery has not yet decreased may indicate increasing awareness is bringing forward cleft patients of all ages, including the backlog of previously untreated cases, for surgical care. These results highlight vulnerable patient populations for consideration in the management of future large-scale treatment efforts.

### Long-term follow-up of unilateral cleft lip and palate: incidence of speech-correcting surgeries and fistula formation [^1145DTvu]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Surgical Protocol

Within the last few decades, both single-stage and 2-stage approaches have been performed at the cleft center. The majority (64.1%; n = 186) of patients have received primary closure in a single-stage procedure, with a median age of lip repair at 3.9 months and palatoplasty at 10.9 months. Forty-eight patients of the 1-stage protocol were originally included in the Scandcleft study (Arm C, Trial 2) (see Table 1) and had received 1-stage closure by a common technique at our center. Single-stage repair was performed by various techniques employed at the cleft center over the years (Table 2).

Table 2.
Incidence for SCSs and Fistula Repair at ABG and Post ABG.

The 2-stage protocols varied in the timing of hard palate and soft palate closure. Early soft palate repair in combination with chileoplasty, median 3.9 (3.7–4.2) months, with late hard palate repair, median 12.1 (11.6–12.6) months, represented 21.7% (n = 63) of the total population. Thirty-nine patients of the 2-stage protocol were originally included in the Scandcleft study (Arm A, Trial 2).

As the most recent introduced protocol at the center, 14.1% (n = 41) received early hard palate repair with a vomer flap, median 4.0 (3.6–4.3) months, combined with delayed soft palate repair, median 10.1 (9.3–11.4) months. As cohorts of the most recent protocol, these patients had significantly shorter total follow-up time (post ABG) (median 10.5 years) than the patients of the older protocols (H[2] = 75.677, P ≤ .001) (Table 1).

Over the past few decades, several cleft surgeons have practiced at the cleft center. In this study, the primary repairs were performed by 7 surgeons, 2 of whom performed 81.7% (n = 237) of the surgeries (48%, n = 140 and 33%, n = 97).

### Hospitalization trends for airway infections and in-hospital complications in cleft lip and palate [^116AmowN]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

We calculated baseline characteristics of the eligible newborns using analysis of variance or Pearson χ 2 test and indicated them as mean and SD or number and percentage. We determined the distribution of patients according to the modality of corrective surgery on a monthly basis for the first 2 years of life. Initially, all newborns were categorized as either control (without cleft) or cleft without surgery and were reassessed monthly. Patients underwent reclassification into the lip repair group following their lip repair surgery and were later moved to the palate repair group in case they underwent any subsequent palate repair, regardless of any previous lip repair.

To visualize the incidence rates of hospitalization due to respiratory infection or any cause, we used locally weighted scatterplot smoothing, stratified by the modality of corrective surgery performed. The age at first surgery was displayed as a smoothed histogram, and the difference in distribution was assessed using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

To assess potential differences in outcomes associated with corrective surgery, we defined 2 timeframes (before and after surgery) for patients with a cleft lip or palate and a documented corrective surgery. Hospitalizations from controls were allocated to a timeframe based on their age in reference to the mean age at which patients with clefts underwent their initial surgery. Controls who died before reaching the mean age of surgery were not included in the postsurgical cohort. For both the presurgical and postsurgical periods, we calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) using Poisson regression models to compare incidence rates between individuals with and without clefts. Differences in in-hospital complications and resource use were analyzed using logistic and linear regression models. Subgroup analyses were specifically conducted for cleft lip repair only and cleft palate repair only. To test the robustness of our findings, a sensitivity analysis was performed comparing hospitalizations involving airway infections at any position (primary and secondary diagnosis) vs those where it was at the primary position (primary diagnosis only).

All P values are 2-sided and have not been adjusted for multiple testing. Results were considered statistically significant at P < .05. All statistical analyses were executed with Stata software version 17.0 (StataCorp). Data were analyzed from Data were analyzed from March to November 2023.

### Primary cleft rhinoplasty: surgical outcomes and complications using three techniques for unilateral cleft lip nose repair [^1166Am9s]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This study represents a single surgeon's 10 years of experience addressing unilateral cleft lip and palate nose deformity. The purpose was to compare surgical outcomes and related complications using 3 different techniques to improve nasal shape in primary unilateral cleft rhinoplasty.

Methods

This retrospective study with Institutional Ethical Committee approval compares 3 groups of patients with unilateral cleft lip nose and palate who were operated on using different techniques from 2007 to 2017. Surgical outcomes were analyzed by physical examination at least 1 year after primary rhinoplasty. Anthropometric measurements were obtained for the cleft and noncleft sides of the nose.

Results

Approach with general analysis indicated differences among the 3 techniques. The author's comparative study revealed differences in nose symmetry and related complications, including increased recurrence of nose deformity using the modified McComb technique. Better short-term nose symmetry was observed using Potter technique and the V-Y-Z rhinoplasty.

Conclusions

Potter approach and the V-Y-Z techniques achieve better short-term nose symmetry than the McComb method. Complications were less common in the group of patients operated on using the modified McComb technique. Additional studies are required to evaluate functional and long-term outcomes after primary rhinoplasty using the proposed methods.

### Early complications after cleft palate repair: a multivariate statistical analysis of 709 patients [^111WjSir]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

This study presents a large consecutive institutional experience with primary cleft palate repairs. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of early complications after cleft palate surgery in a series of nonsyndromic children treated at the authors' comprehensive cleft center. This retrospective analysis includes 709 consecutive patients with cleft palate treated by 6 different staff surgeons at Guwahati Comprehensive Cleft Care Center between April 2011 and December 2012. Secondary cases were excluded from this study. The patients were initially followed up between 1 week and 1 month after surgery. The overall incidence of early complications was determined, and the effect of the extent of clefting, the type of repair, the age at repair, and the operating surgeon were analyzed. Early complications in this study include dehiscence of the wound, fistula formation, hanging palate, and total or partial flap necrosis. There was a 2.4% rate (17/709) of take-back to the operating room in the immediate postoperative period for control of bleeding, although no blood transfusions were required. The incidence of postoperative fistulas in this series was 3.9% (20/512). There was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of cleft palatal fistula for Veau IV clefts, but there were no significant differences with respect to operating surgeon, patient sex, patient age, and type of palatoplasty. The complication and fistula rate is consistent with other published reports from developed countries and provides evidence for the value of this model for surgical delivery in the developing world.

### Hospitalization outcomes of cleft lip repair in neonates across the United States [^114RJY1m]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Cleft lip repair surgeries in neonates have shown to be effective and safe, resulting in less scarring and excellent aesthetic outcomes. However, existing studies are based on single-center experiences with limited numbers of patients and surgeons. Complication rates and hospital outcomes of neonatal lip repair have not yet been established at the national level. The objective of this study was to examine the association between age at cleft lip repair and hospital outcomes.

Design

Retrospective analysis of hospital discharge database.

Setting

Nationwide Inpatient Sample for years 2004 through 2010.

Patients

Patients under 12 months of age diagnosed with cleft lip with or without cleft palate.

Interventions

Surgical repair for cleft lip.

Main Outcome Measures

Occurrence of complications.

Results

There were 10 132 cleft lip repair procedures in 2004–2010 in the United States. Mean age was 144 days with 2.1 days of hospital stay and $22 037 charges. Less than 2% were performed in neonates (0–28 days). The overall complication rate was 2.1%. Compared to 2–4 months, cleft lip procedures in neonates were associated with longer length of stay (P = .001) and hospital charges (P = .03). Cleft lip repair among neonates were 15 times more likely to develop complications (P = .0004) even after adjusting for confounding factors.

Conclusions

Cleft lip repair in neonates is associated with significantly higher complication rates as well as longer length of stay and more hospital charges. Purported benefits of neonatal cleft lip repair may not outweigh significant safety issues and hospitalization outcomes.

### Analysis of complications in primary cleft lips and palates surgery [^1165Ba7h]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

A series of retrospectively recorded patients with cleft lip and palate was uniquely investigated to demonstrate and analyze the complications after cleft repairing operations in a selected Chinese population.

Material and Methods

From January 2005 to January 2012, a selected group of 2100 patients with cleft lip and/or palate who have complete records were chosen from a large sample in the units. Complete data were retrieved, including sex, age, clinical classification, surgical modality, complications, and follow-up results. The complications were classified into 2 categories: early and long-term complications. After surgery, most patients with cleft lip remained in the hospital for 7 days and cleft palate repairs for 10 days. A standard regimen of antibiotics was administered for 3 to 5 days clinically.

Results

Of the 2100 patients, there were 1360 males and 760 females who had congenital cleft deformity with complete clinical records in the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery. The age distribution was as follows: 1600 patients in the group of 3 months to 2 years, 320 patients in the group of 2 to 10 years, 130 patients in the group of 11 to 19 years, and 50 patients in the group of older than 20 years. As to the treatment modality, cleft lips were repaired by rotation advancement method with various minor modifications or Tennison modality. The cleft palates were closed using the von Langenbeck, Veau/Wardill/Kilner, or Furlow technique. The overall complication rate was 16.8% of the patients. Of the early complications, there were 6 cases of asphyxia, 17 cases of pyrexia, 5 cases of edema of the respiratory tract, 8 cases of upper respiratory tract infection, 6 cases of bronchiolitis, 7 cases of pneumonia, 9 cases of diarrhea and vomiting, 6 cases of hemorrhage, 5 patients of odontoptosis, 11 cases of erosion of the corner of mouth, 5 cases of drowsiness, 11 cases of incision dehiscence, 9 cases of wound infection, 6 cases of palatal dehiscence/fistula, 3 cases of nostril floor breakdown, 7 cases of conjunctivitis, as well as 3 cases of mortality. The long-term complications included 30 cases of secondary lip/nasal deformity, 10 cases of dehiscence of lip, 14 cases of palatal fistula/decencies, 18 cases of hearing problem/otitis media, 21 cases of poor ventilation/snoring, 66 cases of velopharyngeal incompetence, and 58 cases of voice disorder.

Conclusions

Complications after cleft surgery are unavoidable clinically. More attention should be paid to the etiologic factors to minimize the prevalence of complications. Mortality can be found in patients with cleft, which is a deadly complication. Problems of respiratory tract and hemorrhage should be emphasized and treated seriously.

### Systematic review of postoperative velopharyngeal insufficiency: incidence and association with palatoplasty timing and technique [^113HRLUd]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

The authors would recommend future studies on cleft palate repair include the following: (1) a thorough description of the surgical technique either through diagrams or narratives; (2) a standardized assessment of resonance and articulation after the Universal Parameters for Reporting Speech Outcomes completed by blinded speech language pathologists; and (3) a mean age of the study population stratified by surgical technique and cleft phenotype. Few included studies incorporated all these elements. Further recommendations include improved data collection methods facilitated by (1) standardized metrics of evaluation; (2) national audits completed by blinded speech language pathologists to report on speech outcome of each cleft center for further comparison between international centers; and (3) central and shared databases. In addition, the tendency for surgeons to only learn one palatoplasty technique is a limiting factor for comparison of surgical techniques as surgeon skill is a confounding factor for outcomes. In one study of this review, surgeons were taught a second technique to serve as a control against themselves. Despite the intention, there will still be a bias towards the technique the surgeon has more initial experience with, making this confounding factor difficult to account for. As technology evolves, opportunities to utilize artificial intelligence to help us more readily obtain results and impact treatment algorithms are an option but need to be well organized. Organizations such as Operation Smile have started to explore ways to evaluate speech through artificial intelligence to increase access to care low-resource settings. Further research on this topic is required".

Velopharyngeal insufficiency is a complication that causes substantial morbidity and developmental delay as the child's ability to communicate in both social and educational settings is impaired. This systematic review highlights the lack of high-powered, well-designed studies in primary cleft palate repair which limits our ability to understand optimal timing and techniques that would limit VPI occurrence. Furthermore, low-income and middle-income countries (86% of the world's population) are highly under-represented in the literature. These gaps in the literature should be seen as an opportunity to answer an important question that could substantially reduce morbidity and improve quality of life. This paper should be viewed as a call-to-action to generate: (1) high-quality research from thoughtfully designed studies; (2) greater global representation; and (3) global consensus once the high-quality evidence has been reviewed. This consensus can only be encouraged through collaboration and working towards a common goal of ensuring best outcomes for patients requiring primary palatoplasty.

### Improved early cleft lip and palate complications at a surgery specialty center in the developing world [^1131idNT]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate complication rates following cleft lip and cleft palate repairs during the transition from mission-based care to center-based care in a developing region.

Patients and Design

We performed a retrospective review of 3419 patients who underwent cleft lip repair and 1728 patients who underwent cleft palate repair in Guwahati, India between December 2010 and February 2014. Of those who underwent cleft lip repair, 654 were treated during a surgical mission and 2765 were treated at a permanent center. Of those who underwent cleft palate repair, 236 were treated during a surgical mission and 1491 were treated at a permanent center.

Setting

Two large surgical missions to Guwahati, India, and the Guwahati Comprehensive Cleft Care Center (GCCCC) in Assam, India.

Main Outcome Measure

Overall complication rates following cleft lip and cleft palate repair.

Results

Overall complication rates following cleft lip repair were 13.2% for the first mission, 6.7% for the second mission, and 4.0% at GCCCC. Overall complication rates following cleft palate repair were 28.0% for the first mission, 30.0% for the second mission, and 15.8% at GCCCC. Complication rates following cleft palate repair by the subset of surgeons permanently based at GCCCC (7.2%) were lower than visiting surgeons (P < .05).

Conclusions

Our findings support the notion that transitioning from a mission-based model to a permanent facility-based model of cleft care delivery in the developing world can lead to decreased complication rates.

### Predictors of adverse events following cleft palate repair [^113Vjn7z]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cleft palate repair has rare, but potentially life-threatening risks. Understanding the risk factors for adverse events following cleft palate repair can guide surgeons in risk stratification and parental counseling.

Methods

Patients under 2 years of age in National Surgical Quality Improvement Project Pediatric Database (NSQIP-P) from 2012 to 2016 who underwent primary cleft palate repair were identified. Risk factors for adverse events after cleft palate repair were identified.

Results

Outcomes for 4989 patients were reviewed. Mean age was 1.0 ± 0.3 years and 53.5% were males. Adverse events occurred in 6.4% (320) of patients. The wound dehiscence rate was 3.1%, and the reoperation rate was 0.9%. On multivariate analysis, perioperative blood transfusion (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 30.2), bronchopulmonary dysplasia/chronic lung disease (aOR 2.2), and prolonged length of stay (LOS) (aOR 1.1) were significantly associated with an adverse event. When subdivided by type of adverse event, reoperation was associated with perioperative blood transfusion (aOR 286.5), cerebral palsy (aOR 11.3), and prolonged LOS (aOR 1.1). Thirty-day readmission was associated with American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification class III (aOR 2.0) and IV (aOR 4.8), bronchopulmonary dysplasia/chronic lung disease (aOR 2.5), cerebral palsy (aOR 5.7), and prolonged LOS (aOR 1.1). Finally, wound dehiscence was significantly associated with perioperative blood transfusion only (aOR 8.2).

Conclusions

Although adverse events following cleft palate surgery are rare, systemic disease remains the greatest predictor for readmission and reoperation. Neurologic and pulmonary diseases are the greatest systemic risk factors. Intraoperative adverse events requiring blood transfusion are the greatest surgical risk factor for post-surgical complications.

### Different surgical approaches to the treatment of cleft palate fistulae as perceived by cleft surgeons [^115F9bPY]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cleft lip and palate is a common congenital malformation, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 700 live births. After surgical repair, the development of palatal fistulae shows a wide range of incidence rates, varying from 4.9% to 31.3%. Additionally, surgical treatment of fistulas is complicated by a high recurrence rate of up to 33%. Factors contributing to fistula formation are multifactorial and often difficult to determine but may include the width of the cleft, the ratio of cleft width to available surrounding palatal tissues for reconstruction and the surgeon's level of skills, scarring from previous surgery, surgical factors (eg, excessive tension on the suture line, injudicious use of electrocautery on the medial edges, too tight knots) and patient factors (finger sucking postoperatively, nutritional deficiency postoperatively, compliance).

Patients suffering from palatal fistulae can either be asymptomatic or they experience speech problems, nasal regurgitation of fluids, and difficulty in maintaining oral hygiene. Fistulae can be classified based on anatomical description, using the Pittsburgh classification or the Pakistan Comprehensive fistula classification. The most prevalent anatomical location for fistulae is at the junction of the hard and soft palate, followed by fistulae located in the hard palate (2) and fistulae in the soft palate (3). Various surgical approaches are described which enable the repair of palatal fistulae, e.g. oral mucoperiosteal flap, buccal flap, facial artery musculomucosal (FAMM) flap, Furlow palatoplasty. The debate continues on whether oronasal fistulae occur more frequently after a two-stage palate repair compared to the single-stage repair. This comparison remains challenging due to the substantial impact of confounders such as surgeon experience, cleft phenotype and patient characteristics. To determine the most appropriate surgical approach, it is essential to consider multiple factors, including size, shape and location of the fistula, as well as whether it is a primary or a recurrent fistula. It is important to note that there is a lack of consensus and limited literature that focuses on managing fistulas following primary surgery. While categorization and the relationship of fistulas associated with primary repair requires further study, the focus of this study is on how to address a fistula once it is present.

The aim of this cross-sectional study is to summarize the clinical surgical strategies of cleft surgeons from around the world on palatal fistula repair per anatomical location. A secondary objective is to investigate the influence of a digital webinar on the preferred choice for closing palatal fistulas.

### In utero surgery for cleft lip / palate: minimizing the "Ripple effect" of scarring [^1156NKVD]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Surgical intervention is currently performed on highly selected fetuses with anatomical deformities that have a high mortality or severe morbidity when treated postnatally. In the future, in utero surgical intervention for non-life-threatening disease may become possible as fetal surgery becomes safer for the mother and fetus. Fetal cleft repair is an attractive intervention for plastic surgeons because it affords the potential to provide a scarless repair and correct the primary deformity. Furthermore, scarless fetal lip and palate repairs may prevent the ripple effect of postnatal scarring with its resultant secondary dentoalveolar and midface growth deformities. These potential benefits can dramatically reduce the number of postnatal reconstructive procedures in children with facial clefts. The rationale for a prenatal treatment approach to the patient with cleft lip/palate and the experimental evidence to support in utero intervention are discussed in this article.

### A closer look at delayed primary cleft surgery and unrepaired cleft lip and / or palate in 5 UK cleft centers [^113hNqQh]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There may be many reasons for delays to primary cleft surgery. Our aim was to investigate the age of children undergoing primary cleft lip or primary cleft palate repair in 5 cleft centers within the United Kingdom. Identify the reasons for delayed primary cleft lip repair (beyond 6 months) and delayed primary palate repair (beyond 13 months). Identify children who had a cleft lip and/or palate (CL ± P) that was intentionally unrepaired and the reasons for this.

Methods

A retrospective, multicenter review of patients born with a CL ± P between December 1, 2012, and December 31, 2016. Three regional cleft centers, comprising of 5 cleft administrative units in the United Kingdom participated.

Results

In all, 1826 patients with CL ± P were identified. Of them, 120 patients had delayed lip repair, outside the expected standard of 183 days. And, 178 patients in total had delayed palate repair, outside the expected standard of 396 days. Twenty (1%) patients had an unrepaired cleft palate.

Conclusions

This large retrospective review highlights variations between centers regarding the timing of lip and palate surgery and details the reasons stated for delayed primary surgery. A small number of patients with an unrepaired cleft palate were identified. All had complex medical problems or comorbidities listed as a reason for the decision not to operate and 50% had a syndromic diagnosis. The number of patients receiving delayed surgery due to comorbidities, being underweight or prematurity, highlights the importance of the cleft specialist nurse and pediatrician within the cleft multidisciplinary team.

### A longitudinal investigation of nasolabial changes with and without revision surgery in patients with non-syndromic unilateral cleft lip and palate [^112rYiLS]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cleft lip and/or palate is the most common congenital craniofacial anomaly, with an incidence ranging from 1:500 to 1:700 live births, internationally. Patients with clefts present with an array of facial abnormalities including facial asymmetry due to deviation of nasal tip, nasal flattening, premaxilla prominence in addition to a short columella, wide philtrum, and a deformed orbicularis oris ending at the cleft margins. Surgical correction is the primary treatment for patients with clefts. Lip repair is normally performed when the child is 3–6 months old aligning with the "rule of tens": 10 weeks old, 10lbs and a hemoglobin of 10 mg/dL. The primary goal of surgical repair is to reinstate facial movement and establish normal aesthetics of the deformed lip and nose, however, the final aesthetic outcome is usually not determined until patients are in their twenties due to the physical changes that occur with growth. As a result, secondary surgeries are often required to correct for these changes with estimates of 30–40% of patients requiring revision surgeries. Despite the high prevalence of revision, there is a lack of consensus regarding the utility and timing of these surgeries. There are also few studies reporting changes in aesthetic outcomes following these secondary surgeries. In order to evaluate the potential benefits of lip/nose revision surgery, it is necessary to understand the natural changes in lip/nose appearance that occur with growth in the absence of revision. Accordingly, the purpose of this investigation is twofold: (1) to determine a baseline of anticipated change in nasolabial appearance without revision; and (2) to evaluate the degree to which revision surgery improves nasolabial appearance.

### Inter-centre comparison of data on surgery and speech outcomes at 5 years of age based on the Swedish quality registry for patients born with cleft palate with or without cleft lip [^115k3uh2]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

According to the surgical protocols at all six Swedish CLP centres, the last primary palatal surgery should be performed at 24 months of age at the latest. Sometimes, surgery is delayed due to the child's health condition, or organisational reasons, such as a lack of operating rooms, anaesthesiologists and surgical nurses. In centre 4, a delay was also related to more complications that required additional secondary surgical treatment associated with the new method of soft palate closure that was introduced in 2008. However, this method was also abandoned in 2014. Nevertheless, the results of the present and previous studies are important when decisions are made to delay the primary palate surgery in children with cleft palate and when prioritising among patients awaiting surgery. Delaying palatal closure may require more healthcare resources in the long-term. In the present study, the centre with the highest proportion of children who underwent the last primary palatal surgery after 25 months of age, had a higher proportion of children who underwent secondary palatal surgery before the age of 5. As previously mentioned, this was due to a new modified method of palate repair with a high frequency of complications leading to poor velopharyngeal function. In addition, this centre also had a higher proportion of children who underwent speech-language therapy before 5 years of age.

As in previously published studies comparing speech outcome after one and two stage primary palatal surgery, the results of the present study indicated that whether the cleft in the palate is closed in one or two stages does not affect speech outcome. At two centres (5, 6) out of the five centres with no deviating negative speech results at 5 years of age, the palate was closed in one stage. At the other three (1, 2, 3) the palate was closed in two stages in 40.6 to 53.6% of the cases, and in one stage in the remaining cases. At centre 4, where the children were more likely to have negative speech results at 5 years of age, primary palatal surgery was performed in two stages in 61.5% of the cases and in three stages in 16.7% of the cases. Furthermore, as described above, at centre 4 the last primary palatal surgery was performed at a later age than at the other centres. It cannot be ruled out that both the later timing of the last primary palatal surgery and complications regarding the surgical technique, resulting in up to three stages of primary palatal closure, had a negative effect on speech.

### Long-term treatment outcomes from the perspective of a patient with unilateral cleft lip and palate [^113yrZYZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

The management of patients with orofacial cleft (OFC) often extends from diagnosis or birth well into adulthood and requires many different specialists within multidisciplinary teams (MDT). The aims of treatment are to restore form and function relating to hearing, speech, occlusion and facial aesthetics. People with OFCs that include the lip, alveolus and palate (cleft lip and palate (CLP)) require several different staged and coordinated surgical and non-surgical interventions, and the treatment pathway is associated with a heavy burden of care. Due to the extensive nature of the interaction with these patients, MDT members have opportunities to provide enhanced patient-centred care and support. This case report provides an overview of the current knowledge of the aetiology of OFC and the management of these patients. It provides a unique perspective from one of the coauthors who has a unilateral CLP (UCLP) and reports on his treatment experiences and long-term treatment outcomes. By having a better understanding of the impact of UCLP and treatment provided, MDT members can not only provide improved clinical treatment but also offer improved patient experiences for those with craniofacial anomalies, in particular, an increased awareness of the psychosocial challenges, they endure throughout their treatment pathway and beyond.

### Management of cleft lip and palate and cleft orthognathic considerations [^111QNNp4]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Cleft lip and palate are among the most common congenital anomalies in humans. The treatment of this group of patients is best conducted by a multidisciplinary team approach. This article discusses the accepted treatment algorithm and timeline, as well as special considerations for this patient group when performing orthognathic surgery. Patients with cleft lip and palate often present with significantly more technical and challenging procedures, so clinicians should familiarize themselves with these special considerations before attempting to care for these individuals.

### Surgical complications in 1408 primary cleft palate repairs operated at a single center in guwahati, assam, India [^113CBYVL]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze surgical complications after primary cleft palate repair in a setting with limited resources.

Patients and Design

A total of 1608 consecutive cleft palate repairs with 1408 follow-ups, operated upon between 2011 and 2013, were reviewed retrospectively through medical records. Patients were 10 months to 50 years old at the time of surgery, with a median age of 9 years.

Setting

Guwahati Comprehensive Cleft Care Center, Guwahati, India.

Intervention

Primary cleft palate repair.

Main Outcome Measures

Postoperative complications in terms of necrosis, dehiscence, fistula, infection, and "hanging palate" were assessed, as was perioperative bleeding. Logistic regression was used with complication (yes/no) as the binary dependent variable and with age, cleft type, and surgeon (visiting/long-term) as covariates.

Results

The overall incidence of postoperative complications was 16.9% with a fistula rate of 13.6%. The incidence of perioperative bleeding was 1.8%. Logistic regression analysis identified cleft severity (P ≤ .001) and visiting surgeon (P ≤ .01) as factors related to the incidence of postoperative complications. Age at surgery was related to both the incidence of postoperative complications (P ≤ .001) and perioperative bleeding (P < .05).

Conclusion

Due to increased risks of surgical complications, older patients with complete clefts should only be operated upon after careful consideration. In addition, these patients should be assigned to surgeons experienced with this cleft type.

### Optimal outcomes reporting (OOR): a new value-based metric for outcome reporting following cleft palate repair [^113hvYmJ]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The primary goal of cleft palate repair is to establish adequate palatal and velar structure and function for the subsequent production of normal speech. Institutional and national database reviews over the last few decades have demonstrated surgical success based largely on (1) postoperative speech evaluations and (2) the absence of clinically relevant fistulae. However, current outcome studies vary significantly in inclusion criteria (ie, age range, types and severity of clefts, fistulas, syndromes, etc) and methods (ie, surgical techniques, speech assessment protocols, and use of patient-reported outcome measure). Most concerning is that there is substantial variation in what is considered a successful speech outcome. Although most clinicians agree that normal speech is the ultimate goal, a subjective judgment of "acceptable", intelligible", and even "improved" speech is considered a successful outcome in many centers. Lastly, burden of care related to the number of surgical procedures needed to achieve the ultimate speech outcome is not uniformly reported. The diversity in cleft palate outcomes reporting makes comparisons difficult and quality benchmarking impossible.

A shared concept of "success" that remains constant, despite variations in clinical care, would provide useful information to patients with clefts and their providers. Common quality metrics can facilitate a shared language for value-based health care discussions and can ultimately lead to improved processes that benefit our patients. Michael Porter, from the Harvard Business School, has been a proponent of measuring outcomes that matter to the patient by creating simple, understandable metrics that demonstrate care quality and drive competition and improvement. From the patient and family perspective, the singular goal of the cleft palate repair — the optimal outcome — is to have one palate procedure, resulting in normal velar function and no fistula. Because this is what all families and patients want, this should be the goal of every cleft center.

### An overview of timeline of interventions in the continuum of cleft lip and palate care [^112LrngP]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

This article provides an overview of timeline of interventions and the critical role different providers have in the continuum of cleft lip and palate care. The earliest intervention is the presurgical infant orthopedic treatment, which is initiated in the first few weeks of life. This is followed by several interventions done in a phased manner. These include: lip repair, palate repair, velopharyngeal surgery, maxillary expansion, maxillary bone grafting, limited phase of orthodontic treatment, comprehensive phase of orthodontic treatment (with/without orthognathic surgery), and restorative dentistry.

### Primary cleft lip and palate repair in assam, India: does preoperative anthropometric analysis help identify patients with increased surgical risk in a clinically prescreened population? [^116at64Y]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare anthropometric z-scores with incidence of post-operative complications for patients undergoing primary cleft lip or palate repair.

Design

This was a retrospective observational analysis of patients from a surgical center in Assam, India, and includes a cohort from a single surgical mission completed before the opening of the center.

Setting

Patients included in the study underwent surgery during an Operation Smile mission before the opening of Operation Smile's Guwahati Comprehensive Cleft Care Center in Guwahati, India. The remaining cohort received treatment at the center. All patients received preoperative assessment and screening; surgery; and postoperative care, education, and follow-up.

Patients, Participants

Our sample size included 1941 patients and consisted of all patients with complete information in the database who returned for follow-up after receiving primary cleft lip repair or primary cleft palate repair between January 2011 and April 2013.

Interventions

Preoperative anthropometric measurements.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Postoperative complications.

Results

Anthropometric z-scores were not a significant predictor of adverse surgical outcomes in the group analyzed. Palate surgery had increased risk of complication versus lip repair, with an overall odds ratio of 5.66 (P < .001) for all patients aged 3 to 228 months.

Conclusions

Anthropometric z-scores were not correlated with increased risk of surgical complications, possibly because patients were well screened for malnutrition before surgery at this center. Primary palate repair is associated with an approximate fivefold increased risk of developing postoperative complication(s) compared with primary lip repair.

### Long-term follow-up of unilateral cleft lip and palate: incidence of speech-correcting surgeries and fistula formation [^114A5EXn]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Classification of Primary Surgery

While primary nasal repair has for decades generally been performed alongside lip repair via the principles described by, the protocol for primary lip and palate surgery (both age at surgery and surgical technique) have changed over the last 3 decades within our cleft center. This has been influenced by a number of factors including the unit's participation in the Scandcleft randomized control trials.

Early in the 1990s, cleft lip and palate was repaired by lip adhesion at 2 months of age, followed by cheiloplasty and anterior vomerplasty at 6 months, with complete cleft closure at 12 months of age according to the Veau–Wardill–Kilner (V–W–K) technique, which had been the standard technique for decades.

Lip adhesion was later considered unnecessary; it was therefore discarded, as was anterior vomerplasty. Simultaneously, lip closure was altered to an age of 3 to 4 months and performed by the chileoplasty technique described by, which has since retained its place as the standard technique. In 1992, the standard technique became the 2-flap approach described by, where the palate closure took place at 9 months of age in combination with a vomer flap. As of 1994, the 2-flap approach was the standard procedure for particularly wide and challenging clefts, while the minimal incision technique, outlined bywas employed for muscle reconstruction of narrower clefts; if tension occurred, lateral relaxing incisions were made according to the von Langenbeck technique.

In 1996, slightly prior to the recruitment of patients for the Scandcleft randomized trials of primary surgery for UCLP, the 2-stage closure was introduced at our center, where lip and soft palate repair occurred at 4 months combined with delayed hard palate closure at 12 months. The hard palate was closed using a vomer flap, while the muscle repair was performed according to the principles described by. When the Scandcleft Trail2 (1997–2006) began, half the patients received the 2-stage procedure just described and the other half of the patients received a single-stage palatoplasty at 12 months by a common technique, such as the 2-flap, minimal incision, or Langenbeck's technique, in combination with a vomer flap. In 2008, the 2-stage protocol was further altered into combined lip and early hard palate closure, with a vomer flap, at 4 months with delayed soft palate closure at ∼10 months. This procedure has since remained as the main protocol at our center.

### Hospitalization trends for airway infections and in-hospital complications in cleft lip and palate [^114iE1yr]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Surgical Interventions

Within the first 2 years of life, 744 children with a cleft (62.2%) underwent a cleft repair surgery. Of those, 211 children (28.4%) had a lip repair only, 291 children (39.1%) had a palate repair only, and 242 children (32.5%) underwent both lip and palate repair surgery (Figure 2; eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Characteristics at birth for children who did not receive cleft repair surgery are shown in eTable 3 in Supplement 1. The most common cleft repair procedures were primary plastic reconstruction on the soft palate (417 children) and cheiloplasty for a congenital cleft lip (398 children) (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). The mean age at the time of the first surgery was 236 (95% CI, 226.94–244.71) days for any corrective surgery, 313 (95% CI, 300.96–324.72) days for palate repair, and 181 (95% CI, 174.24–187.82) days for lip repair, with significant differences in distribution observed between the types of surgery (P < .001) (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1).

### Evidence-based medicine: the bilateral cleft lip repair [^1132HeYt]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After reading this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand the epidemiology, abnormal embryology, anatomy, and etiopathogenesis of cleft lip. 2. Be able to classify and describe bilateral cleft lip. 3. Recognize the importance of preoperative management of bilateral cleft lip. 4. Recognize the large breadth of differing management options. 5. Describe key steps and tenets of the surgical repair.

Summary

This fourth Maintenance of Certification/Continuing Medical Education article on cleft lip focuses on the topic of bilateral cleft lip. Previous articles placed an emphasis on the unilateral cleft lip, velopharyngeal insufficiency, or cleft lip and palate management. The authors focus on summarizing key points from previous articles and describing the importance of preoperative management and surgical repair of the bilateral cleft lip.

### Long-term follow-up of unilateral cleft lip and palate: incidence of speech-correcting surgeries and fistula formation [^116SfWqa]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study has shown that secondary palatal operations are common in children with previously repaired UCLP. Overall, outcome disparities between surgical protocols and techniques are small and derived from multiple minor factors. Despite the common challenges regarding cleft care; well-designed, prospective controlled studies with long-term follow-up are essential when assessing surgical techniques. In addition, standardized protocols for outcome measures would aid the quality of comparison between studies. Here, although no protocol proved superior to another from a long-term perspective, favorable outcomes emerged for the single-stage protocol, particularly Bardach's 2-flap technique, with low SCS and fistula repair rates prior to ABG.

### Long-term follow-up of unilateral cleft lip and palate: incidence of speech-correcting surgeries and fistula formation [^114a4x5Q]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Protocols of care for the management of individuals affected by cleft lip and palate include both nonsurgical and surgical interventions. The goal of primary cleft surgery is to achieve a normal appearance, hearing, and velopharyngeal function allowing normal development of speech, without restricting the growth of the maxilla. As such, numerous surgical protocols and surgical techniques have been outlined in the literature. However, while there is still no single accepted protocol for the surgical treatment for patients with cleft lip and palate in terms of both the type of surgical procedure conducted and the timing of that procedure, the vast majority of primary cleft surgery is typically completed by the first year of age. The need for secondary surgeries of the palate is generally considered a quality measurement of the primary surgery.

Postoperative velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) is common in children with a cleft and VPI might result in detrimental outcomes for the child, often requiring speech-correcting surgeries (SCSs) (VPI surgery) if conservative management, in terms of speech therapy, is inadequate. However, several factors may influence the rate of SCS. Such as the severity of the VPI, the family's wishes, associated anomalies, airway obstruction, the speech-language pathologist's recommendations, but also the surgeon's experience and threshold to perform secondary surgery have a major role. Development of palatal fistulae, caused by improper healing of the palate, is another well-known and undesired complication following primary repair. Symptomatic palatal fistulae may cause nasal regurgitation and have an adverse effect on speech, necessitating surgical intervention.

The success of primary surgery is commonly measured by speech-related outcomes and fistula occurrence following cleft repair, while the definite operative burden often remains unclear. This study aimed to report the surgical burden of care in terms of secondary surgeries, defined as SCS and fistula closure, on a long-term perspective, up to alveolar bone grafting (ABG) and beyond, in patients with complete unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) treated at a single institution. Our secondary aim was to assess the surgical protocols and techniques utilized over the years within the unit to examine their impact on secondary surgery rates.

### Hospitalization trends for airway infections and in-hospital complications in cleft lip and palate [^113LivG6]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In Switzerland, all newborns undergo a systematic screening for lip and palate defects, if these are not seen during prenatal ultrasonographic examination. Cleft lip or palate is among the most prevalent birth defects, with an incidence of approximately 1 to 2 per 1000 newborns and may be an early indication of a congenital malformation or associated syndromes. Nonetheless, 45% of cleft palates and 60% of cleft lips are diagnosed without any associated syndrome. Beyond feeding complications, long-term speech issues, sleep apnea, and hearing problems, cleft lip or palate has been identified as a risk factor for bronchiolitis. However, the link between these defects and other airway infections remains poorly explored. Furthermore, an association of the severity of cleft lip or palate with the need for hospitalization remains unexplored and may be an important factor for ambulatory pediatricians and family doctors to decide on a referral to the emergency department. Additionally, data on the association of corrective surgery with hospitalization risk and in-hospital resource use are scarce. The type of cleft dictates the method and timing of corrective surgery, with guidelines typically adhering to the Rule of 10s for lip repair: age at least 10 weeks, weight of 10 pounds, hemoglobin greater than 10 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10), and white blood cell count exceeding 10 000 μL (to convert to ×10 9 /L, multiply by 0.001). However, this rule does not account for the overall disease burden of cleft lip or palate and associated risks. Since hospitalizations for newborns or young children with cleft lip or palate typically require urgent care and a thorough interdisciplinary in-hospital work-up to prevent severe complications, understanding epidemiological trends and potential in-hospital adverse outcomes is therefore crucial. Hence, in this nationwide cohort study, our primary goal was to examine the incidence rates of hospitalizations due to respiratory infections or any cause during the first 2 years of life, considering the necessity and timing of corrective surgery. Our secondary aim was to assess clinical outcomes of newborns and young children with cleft lip or palate compared with those without clefts. Thus, this analysis aims to enhance our comprehension of the disease burden among hospitalized patients with cleft lip or palate.

### Impact of short-term reconstructive surgical missions: a systematic review [^116Suqhy]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Table 3
(A) Overall outcomes on basic characteristics of missions

Regarding patient safety, nine studies (22%) did not report on complications. Twelve studies (29%) only reported a complication rate without reporting on follow-up length or rate. The overall complication rate in these 12 studies was 1.2%. Ten studies (24%) reported a follow-up length shorter than 180 days, with a mean follow-up rate of 81.3% and a complication rate of 7.1%. Ten studies (24%) provided a follow-up length longer than 180 days, reporting a mean follow-up rate of 56.0% and a 22.3% complication rate (table 3). Mortality after cleft surgery was reported in three studies, totalling 3 out of 14 551 patients included in these studies. For general reconstructive surgical missions — not specified for a single disease — one single study reported one deathand no mortality was reported in contracture and noma missions.

Twelve studies (29%) reported on health gains of the mission, reporting heterogeneous methods and outcomes (table 1). Methods used in cleft studies included photographic assessment of aesthetic outcomes, speech evaluationor DALYs averted. Three cleft studies evaluated speech functionality postoperatively, either by questionnairesor speech tests. Study methods were clear and showed overall improvements of speech. Four cleft studies reported on DALYs averted by cleft lip and palate repair surgery. DALYs averted per patient were 3.9,6.0and 10.1 per patient. In three noma missions, a surgeon-reported outcome scale was used to score aesthetic and functional outcome. Overall findings showed that high-complex surgery is associated with greater risks of unsatisfactory results. Three studies used PROMs. One contracture study reported improvements in quality of life and disability by using validated questionnaires, and reported overall positive outcomes. Two cleft studies used self-developed questionnaires to assess PROMs, reporting positive results. None of the studies reported on patient-reported outcomes on the quality of the care provided.

### An international surgical exchange program for children with cleft lip / cleft palate in manaus, Brazil: patient and family expectations of outcome [^111A43fv]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Increasingly, surgeons are traveling from the developed to the developing world to volunteer their services. They can often make an enormous difference in the lives of patients they serve, but they must understand that these patients exist in a sociocultural matrix in which the meaning of the condition they have and the future they face are determined by a host of factors over and above the specific surgery itself. This means that programs in which teams quickly go in and out of a country must take into account and plan for longer term follow-up by colleagues within that country as well as develop and target rehabilitation services and educational messages to ensure maximum benefits from the intervention performed. This study examines the long-term implications of a short-term surgical team intervention for pediatric patients with cleft lip/cleft palate and their families in the Amazon region of Brazil.

### Cleft repair in adults: a report on a case series [^111LH2Gb]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Speech defects and facial appearance due to untreated cleft lip and/or palate in the elderly population have associated life-long impacts on the quality of life for these patients. Treatment and rehabilitation in this patient group can be extensive and the problems not easily corrected. We report the outcomes of surgical repair of cleft in a series of elderly patients with unrepaired cleft lip and/or palate. Our results confirm an improvement in speech, quality of life and aesthetic outcomes after surgical repair in these patients. With this in mind, we advise cleft teams to consider surgical repair of untreated cleft lip and/or palate in the elderly population.

### Impact of WHO's surgical safety checklist-based program on cleft-lip and palate repair outcomes in LMICs-the CLEAN CLEFT program [^111ePb15]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

"Clean Cleft" (CC) is an adaptation of the Lifebox Clean Cut program, designed to reduce surgical site infections (SSIs) in cleft lip and palate repairs. It focuses on 6 key processes: hand and site decontamination, surgical linen integrity, instrument sterility, timely antibiotic use, gauze counting, and WHO Surgical Safety Checklist compliance. The study explores CC's effectiveness in reducing infections, other complications, and enhancing early recovery.

Methods

CC was piloted in 2 Ethiopian hospitals and 1 in Côte d'Ivoire, the primary public cleft care centers in each country. Baseline data were collected through direct observation in the operating room, with patients monitored postoperatively for infections and complications through daily ward visits and follow-up calls or clinic visits at 30 days. Post-intervention data were collected for 5 months. Data was captured in DHIS2 software and analyzed using SPSS version 26.

Results

The program enrolled 275 patients, with 156 during baseline and 119 post-implementation. Complications significantly dropped from 21.7% to 8.7% (P = .008), a 60% decrease. SSI rates fell from 18.1% to 8.0% (P = .03), while palatal fistulas decreased from 13.0% to 6.1% (P = .1) and wound dehiscence from 18.0% to 8.0% (P = .03). Adherence to perioperative standards improved, except for hand and skin preparation while pain management remained effective throughout the program.

Conclusion

CC improved perioperative practices, significantly reducing infections, palatal fistulas, and wound dehiscence, supporting the broader program expansion to any subspecialty.

### Optimal outcomes reporting (OOR): a new value-based metric for outcome reporting following cleft palate repair [^113Kxb63]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

We have proposed the use of a simple, understandable metric for assessing surgical outcomes after cleft palate repair. Using this metric, the percentage of patients who obtain the optimal outcome can be determined for individual surgeons, for various cleft palate centers, and even for various surgical procedures. This percentage can then be compared with others for the purpose of benchmarking and performance improvement. This metric can also be used for improved communication with families and patients. Benchmarking will increase our value to patients and families by driving improvements in speech outcomes, while at the same time, reducing the number of procedures to achieve the optimal outcome and, therefore, the cost. Payers (government, private sector, or self-pay) must be able to make informed health care purchasing decisions based on an overall value framework that includes outcomes that matter to the patient and the cost to deliver those outcomes.

### Feeding infants with cleft and the postoperative cleft management [^115oGAop]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Cleft lip and palate malformations affect the ability of infants to adequately feed. Choosing the appropriate feeding technique must allow functioning of the suck-swallow-breathing mechanism and development of oral-motor function. Feeding in the postsurgical setting should be returned to normal as soon as possible to maintain adequate nutritional intake and good wound healing, an essential component to cleft repair. This article outlines the complex mechanism of wound healing, gives options to augment the process of aesthetic scar healing, and presents feeding modifications.

### A challenging period after repair: etiology and follow-up rates of the patients with cleft lip and palate in intensive care unit [^113XSfR8]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The perioperative period is quite challenging because of the featured anatomical and clinical properties of the babies with cleft lip and palate (CLP). Therefore follow-up in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a crucial parameter for managing these patients. Although various studies in cleft literature, limited studies have analyzed the ICU admission rate and its etiology in the cleft population. At this point, the present study aims to reveal the etiology and rate of ICU admission of babies with an orofacial cleft to contribute to taking preventive precautions. The rate of primary CLP patients was 69.5% (937 of 1348 patients). Intensive care unit admission rate of primary CLP patients was 6.2% (n = 58). The expected and unexpected ICU admission rate was 4.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Of the patients admitted to the ICU, 53.4% (n = 31) were boys and 46.6% (n = 27) were girls. There was no statistically significant association between gender and ICU admission (P = 0.896). However, the association between cleft type and ICU follow-up was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The findings of the present study reveal the high ICU admission rate of cleft patients within all patients admitted to ICU. Due to many unique statuses of cleft babies, attentive assessment in the preoperative period and determining the postoperative need for ICU follow-up would contribute to preventing postoperative complications.

### Combined primary cleft lip and palate repair: is It safe? [^115yxWq6]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Single-stage primary cleft lip and palate (PCLP) repair is controversial in the United States, and most patients are treated with a staged approach. In this study, early postoperative complications of the single-stage approach as compared to primary cleft lip (PCL) or primary cleft palate (PCP) alone were evaluated. This study represents the largest cohort of patients undergoing combined cleft lip and palate repair.

Methods

The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric database was used to identify patients undergoing single-stage PCLP, PCL, or PCP repairs. Preoperative factors and postoperative outcomes were compared between the 3 groups, as well as within the PCLP group between patients with and without complications. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.

Results

A TOTAL OF:: 181 patients were included in the single-stage PCLP group, 1007 in the PCP group and 783 in the PCL group. There was no difference in the rates of early complications between the 3 groups. Within the PCLP group, cardiac risk factors (β = 35.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.88–75.21; P = 0.04) and complications (β = 77.31; 95% CI 35.82–118.79; P < 0.001) were significant risk factors for longer operative time.

Conclusion

Analysis of a national database showed that single-stage PCLP repair is not associated with increased risk of early postoperative complications as compared to primary lip or palate repair alone. In-depth long-term analyses of craniofacial morphology, fistulae rate, speech, and dental outcomes are essential for a comprehensive assessment of the effects of combined cleft lip and palate repair.

### Hospitalization trends for airway infections and in-hospital complications in cleft lip and palate [^1149PiQF]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome of this study was the rate of hospitalizations due to airway infections. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization rates for any cause after birth, all-cause mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), and hospitalization-associated complications. These complications were defined as the need for respiratory support, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, resuscitation, intubation, admission to the intensive care unit, or in-hospital mortality. Hospitalizations specifically for cleft repair were excluded from the analysis because postsurgical care may often include respiratory support, intensive care unit stay, and intubation.

### Variation among cleft centres in the use of secondary surgery for children with cleft palate: a retrospective cohort study [^114JsndP]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This large retrospective multicentre study demonstrated substantial variation in the hazard of secondary palate surgery for children with cleft lip and palate. Performing primary palate repair before 9 months of age substantially increases the hazard of secondary surgery, and choosing to perform palate repair after this age may be one approach to lowering rates of secondary surgery. Additional research is needed to identify other factors contributing to variation in palate surgery outcomes, along with testing of evidence-based interventions to decrease rates of secondary surgery. At present, these results suggest that cleft centres may be able to improve outcomes for their patients by adopting treatment practices from the best-performing centres. Performing cleft palate repair before 9 months of age may increase the risk of secondary procedures, unless the surgeon and centre have demonstrated successful long-terms outcomes.

### A survey on enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) elements in cleft palate repair [^116wfQw6]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Many respondents report using interventions which are consistent with an ERAS approach to perioperative care, and the majority would be willing to implement a standardized ERAS protocol for cleft palate repair. Use of TXA and DEX was uncommon and unlikely to be quickly adopted. Prospective studies are underway to evaluate perioperative and speech outcomes after interdisciplinary adoption of an ERAS protocol for cleft palate repair.

### Variation among cleft centres in the use of secondary surgery for children with cleft palate: a retrospective cohort study [^116VkASn]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cleft palate occurs in approximately 1 of every 1000 births, making it one of the world's most common congenital anomalies. Children undergo cleft palate repair early in life, with the goals of closing the abnormal connection between the mouth and nose and obtaining normal speech. Failure to achieve either goal substantially impacts a child's quality of life by leaving a fistula that allows liquids and food to exit their nose while eating or by making their speech unintelligible. Either complication may lead children to undergo secondary palate surgery. Secondary surgery requires a major operation, several weeks recovery and medical costs similar to the primary repair.

Patients with cleft palate are principally cared for in cleft centres, which are multidisciplinary teams typically associated with a single hospital and multiple cleft surgeons. Cleft centres exhibit broad variation in both their treatment approachand their complication rates after palate repair. Fistula incidence ranges from 0% to 35%. Speech problems attributable to abnormal palate function range from 10% to 56%. This variation in both fistulae and speech problems may lead to differences in rates of secondary palate surgery.

Understanding the variation in secondary surgery along with causative factors for this variation may impact how, where and by whom treatment is delivered. There are many controversial elements of cleft palate care, including use of postoperative antibioticsand the importance of hospital volume and provider volume. Timing of primary cleft palate closure is also controversial: some providers advocate performing repair before 9 months of age to improve speech outcomes, while others delay palate repair until 12 or 18 months of age when the palate has grown larger and the risk of harming future facial growth may be reduced.

Previous comparisons of secondary palate surgery among cleft centres in England, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands identified significant differences in outcomes among centres, and these findings led to government-mandated changes in cleft surgery delivery. A study of four centres in the USA and Canada found the hazard of secondary palate surgery varied sixfold across teams, although these differences were not statistically significant (95% CI 0.76 to 45.65, p = 0.057). Thus, it remains unknown whether variability in secondary palate surgery seen in Western Europe generalises to cleft centres around the globe.

### Hospitalization trends for airway infections and in-hospital complications in cleft lip and palate [^113FJiMf]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Do children born with a cleft lip and/or palate experience a higher rate of airway infections and in-hospital complications than those without cleft lip or palate?

Findings

In this cohort study of 857 806 newborns, hospitalization rates for airway infections were higher among children with a cleft lip and/or palate compared with those without. Similarly, rates of in-hospital complications and mortality were increased in children with cleft lip or palate.

Meaning

These findings suggest that children with a cleft lip and/or palate had a higher risk of severe airway infections requiring hospitalization than their counterparts without a cleft.

### Variation among cleft centres in the use of secondary surgery for children with cleft palate: a retrospective cohort study [^112Uz9Jj]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Age at cleft palate repair

While there is universal agreement that 'primary palatal repair should be done at the age that allows optimal speech development and facial growth', there is little agreement about precisely what that age should be. Currently, the debate is between primary repair at 6 versus 12 months of age. Dorf and Curtinshowed that children who undergo palate repair after 12 months of age exhibit more compensatory articulations, which require speech therapy to correct. This result has been confirmed by several others, yet none of these studies examined rates of secondary surgery for both speech and fistulae. Our results show the hazard of secondary surgery is initially 6.7-fold higher for children who have palate repair before 9 months of age and that this increased hazard persists for 5 years after surgery. We do not believe this increased hazard with early palate repair is due to underlying patient differences, as complicating medical or socioeconomic conditions lead to repair at older rather than younger ages in our experience. The Timing of Primary Surgery for Cleft Palate trial is an ongoing randomised control trial comparing palate repair at 6 and 12 months of age and results should be available by 2021. Until then, our study suggest that surgeons and hospitals should be cautious to recommend cleft palate repair before 9 months of age and do so only after reviewing their own results.

The volume–outcome relationship

Our study failed to show an association between hospital volume and surgeon volume of cleft palate repairs and time until secondary palate surgery. A previous study of cleft palate surgery volume found surgeons who performed ≥ 3 palate repairs per year achieved superior speech outcomes to surgeons performing < 3 repairs per year. While three repairs per year may be an important threshold, in the present study, only 6% of repairs were performed by surgeons below that threshold. We chose to set the threshold for low volume surgeons at < 10 repairs per year and found that performing 10 or more palate repairs per year did not improve surgical outcomes. This is consistent with prior studies in paediatric surgery that suggested the effects of increased volume are dependent on the specific procedure, outcome and method of characterising volume.

### Primary repair in patients with unilateral complete cleft of lip and primary palate: assessment of outcomes [^11227u3J]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymmetry of median facial structures is a major concern for patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate, and the principal goal of its treatment is to restore symmetry. Unilateral complete cleft of lip and primary palate (UCCLPP) is an uncommon subgroup and rarely reported. Patients with UCCLPP have protruding and deviating premaxilla, rendering a primary repair difficult. This study evaluated consecutive patients with UCCLPP and presented their treatment outcome.

Methods

We assessed 36 patients with UCCLPP and collected clinical information. Surgical repair was performed at 3 months of age by using a modified rotation-advancement method and primary nasal reconstruction. A single surgeon performed all surgical procedures. A postoperative nasal stent was used for 6 months. Follow-up standardized photographs were collected. Landmarks were identified, and nose and lip dimensions measured. The ratios of the corresponding parameters (cleft vs noncleft side) were obtained for evaluating nose and lip symmetry.

Results

No surgical complication was noted in any patient. The overall lip and nose outcome after the primary repair were adequate, and all ratios were close to 1. The nostril width was slightly wider on the cleft side, but the alar width and height were acceptable. The lip heights were balanced between the 2 sides. Patients who received presurgical nasoalveolar molding did not show more favorable lip and nose dimensions, except for the medial philtral height.

Conclusion

Even in the presence of protruding and deviating premaxilla, our patients with UCCLPP obtained adequate lip and nose outcome after undergoing primary lip repair and nasal reconstruction.

### Systematic review of postoperative velopharyngeal insufficiency: incidence and association with palatoplasty timing and technique [^111YqQmd]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Orofacial clefts are among the most common congenital anomalies worldwide. The global prevalence of cleft palate globally ranges from 1.4 per 10,000 births in Cuba to 25.3 per 10,000 births in Canada. This congenital anomaly is correctable through cost-effective surgical interventions. – One study estimated that the repair of cleft lip or palate has the same cost effectiveness of vaccines in low-income and- middle-income countries. Cleft-related speech impairment can be profound for the patient, impacting ability to seek gainful employment and ultimately resulting in significant economic impact for households and communities.

The primary goals of the cleft palate repair are to restore functional anatomy, to close the defect, and restore normal speech. Unfortunately, maxillary growth deficiency, palatal fistulae, and inadequate speech are still common complications. Delayed surgery, improper surgical technique, and scarring can produce sub-optimal surgical outcomes, which may result in velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). Velopharyngeal insufficiency occurs as a result of a short, immobile soft palate that does not close adequately against the back of the throat, resulting in hypernasal or unintelligible speech. The rate of VPI after primary palatoplasty varies between 5% and 30% – in the literature, which may be attributed to differences in study size, cleft severity, surgical technique, and operative age of the study populations.

There is still no international consensus on the appropriate timing of cleft palate repair and technique preferences are still debated. Most literature suggests primary palatoplasty performed after 18 months leads to worse speech and a higher risk of developing VPI.– However, some centers still advocate for delayed palatoplasty to limit midface hypoplasia. Cleft palate can present in varying degrees of severity with or without cleft lip involvement, which makes it difficult for one singular surgical technique to repair all presentations. Surgeons are often taught one cleft palate repair technique through mentorship and utilize or modify that one technique for the entirety of their careers. The reluctance to change from a technique one gains proficiency in and undertake a new learning curve discourages change in a surgeon's approach. Furthermore, technique variations and modifications make comparing surgical outcomes challenging. Surgeon skill itself is another major factor pivotal to postoperative outcomes.

### Impact of short-term reconstructive surgical missions: a systematic review [^111TVZwr]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Some authors argue that longer-term specialty surgical hospitals may be provide more effective care than short-term missions. Specialty hospitals provide continuous care all year round in a LMIC. The cleft care centre of Operation Smile in India, or Smile Train's model are examples of this approach.

Both organisations report lower complication rates than those reported in short-term missions. The centre of Operation Smile reports a short-term complication rate of 4.0% (cleft lip repair) and 15.8% (cleft palate repair), which is lower than the rates of their counterpart short-term missions. Smile Train studies report lower rates, between 0.88% and 3%. However, they note that there might be a risk of under-reporting or selection bias due to a dependence of Smile Train surgeons on payment-per-patient (risking fewer referrals when higher complication rates are reported) and a limited capacity of surgeons to treat complex cases. Furthermore, with only one Smile Train study reporting on follow-up lengths, these complication rates should be interpreted with caution. To be able to compare the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches of providing surgical care in a LMIC, there is a need for more high-quality studies. Apart from registrations of complications, such studies should assess long-term outcome using validated outcome measures and PROMs. Specialty hospitals, which provide services all year round, could provide good conditions for longer-term outcome research.

Several studies in this review consistently report on follow-up, showing that substantial efforts are being made to improve the data output of missions. Ten studies reported significant follow-up lengths of more than 6 months and high numbers of patients returning for follow-up were shown. The majority of these missions were engaged in long-term partnerships. This included training of local healthcare personnel, which was likely to improve the feasibility of organising follow-up. Several strategies were implemented to ensure the quality of follow-up. Some missions deployed medical students to assess palate fistulasor sent a speech pathologist in-country to review outcomes. Others trained local surgeons on follow-up and revision surgery. The relatively high number of complications seen in noma missions could be partly explained by a stringent follow-up, done by an independent researcher who consistently reported on follow-up. All the studies mentioned above provide examples of how to ensure patient safety during and after missions.

### An analysis of unplanned intraoperative extubation in cleft lip and palate repair [^1114pQbu]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective: To characterize pediatric patients experiencing unplanned intraoperative extubation (UIE) during cleft lip (CL) and cleft palate (CP) repair and assess postoperative outcomes. Design: Retrospective cohort study using the 2019–2023 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric database. Setting: Multicenter surgical registry of pediatric operations. Patients: Children undergoing CL repair (< 1 year) or CP repair (< 3 years). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure(s): Incidence of UIE, demographic and operative characteristics, and 30-day postoperative complications. Results: Among 17 047 cases, UIE occurred in 0.37% of CL repairs and 0.20% of CP repairs. Patients who experienced UIE had similar baseline characteristics to those without UIE but demonstrated significantly longer operative and anesthesia times for both procedures. Despite these intraoperative events, no cases of death, pneumonia, or unplanned reintubation occurred postoperatively, and overall 30-day complication rates remained low. Conclusions: UIE during CL and CP repair is rare and not associated with major postoperative complications.

### A standard set of outcome measures for the comprehensive appraisal of cleft care [^115vpH1u]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Care of the patient with cleft lip and/or palate remains complex. Prior attempts at aggregating data to study the effectiveness of specific interventions or overall treatment protocols have been hindered by a lack of data standards. There exists a critical need to better define the outcomes-particularly those that matter most to patients and their families-and to standardize the methods by which these outcomes will be measured. This report summarizes the recommendations of an international, multidisciplinary working group with regard to which outcomes a typical cleft team could track, how those outcomes could be measured and recorded, and what strategies may be employed to sustainably implement a system for prospective data collection. It is only by agreeing on a common, standard set of outcome measures for the comprehensive appraisal of cleft care that intercenter comparisons can become possible. This is important for quality-improvement endeavors, comparative effectiveness research, and value-based health-care reform.

### ABM clinical protocol # 17: guidelines for breastfeeding infants with cleft lip, cleft palate, or cleft lip and palate-revised 2019 [^115ihcKw]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Breastfeeding feasibility and postoperative initiation — cleft lip (CL), cleft palate (CP), and cleft lip and palate (CLP) are contrasted as follows: There is moderate evidence to suggest that infants with CL may be able to generate sufficient suction (level 4), and descriptive reports suggest that these infants are often able to breastfeed successfully (levels 4–5). There is moderate evidence that infants with CP or CLP have difficulty generating sufficient intraoral suction (level 2) and may have inefficient sucking patterns (level 3) compared with noncleft infants, and overall, infants with CP or CLP are observed to have lower success rates for breastfeeding than infants with CL or no cleft; this applies even after surgical repair (level 3). Evidence suggests that breastfeeding can commence/recommence immediately after CL repair (levels 2–3), and breastfeeding can commence/recommence 1 day after CP repair without complication to the wound; in a survey of surgeons regarding postoperative care after palatoplasty, two-thirds of surgeons allowed mothers to breastfeed immediately after surgery (level 4). Therefore, parents should be counseled that alternative means of feeding may still be required postsurgically to meet growth and nutritional goals, and personal and social supports are also important during this time.

### Primary cleft palate management and repair [^114TstCY]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

There are many techniques from which to choose in cleft palate repair. The decision of which to use varies from surgeon to surgeon and may be tailored based on the type of cleft palate and surgeon training or preference. The goal of cleft palate repair is to improve speech resonance, while minimizing complications. Repair techniques are ever evolving to reduce complications and improve success rates as measured by fistula formation and velopharyngeal insufficiency.

### Analysis and reporting of randomized trials in cleft palate surgery: learning from the timing of primary surgery (TOPS) trial [^113XYdYy]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Overview

The Timing of Primary Surgery (TOPS) trial was reported by Gamble et al.on 31 st August 2023 in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and is a milestone achievement for a study focused on cleft palate. TOPS was an international (5 countries), multi-site (23 clinical sites), parallel-arm randomised trial and was a unique international collaborative effort involving multiple disciplines and many years of planning and execution. The trial was notable in the field of cleft due to the large number of participants (558), impressive retention rate at 5-year follow-up (approximately 85% for viable speech outcomes), cross linguistic analysis and the considerable efforts taken to strive for standardised surgical intervention and speech data collection. Given the enormity of the TOPS endeavour, the largest cleft trial to date, there was considerable expectation for the delivery of a definitive conclusion.

The aim of the trial was to determine whether it is better to perform cleft palate reconstruction at 6 or 12 months of age, by randomly assigning patients to initial surgery at each age, and assessing outcomes in speech, hearing, dentofacial development and safety (peri-operative adverse events and post-operative complications). The prespecified primary endpoint was velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) at 5 years of age, which was defined as a velopharyngeal composite summary (VPC-Sum) score of at least 4. The headline finding was a reduced prevalence of VPI at 5 years of age of 9% in the 6-month group compared to 15% in the 12-month group (risk ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.36–0.99; p = 0.04). This was the basis of the authors' conclusion that infants undergoing surgery at 6 months of age were less likely to have VPI at age 5 than infants undergoing surgery at 12 months of age.

### Treatment needs of adult patients with cleft lip and palate [^112aqSYj]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

After completing care within a cleft/craniofacial team, most young adults have achieved the dental care, psychologic support, speech services, and surgical repairs that are designed to optimize their long-term outcomes. Some patients, however, continue to have ongoing health needs. These can be in the same realms as were present during their childhood years and may be difficult to address outside of a multidisciplinary team. In addition, new challenges can arise when entering the workplace or starting a family. This article explores the potential ongoing treatment needs that may exist and recommends strategies to address these.

### One-stage cleft lip and palate repair in an older population [^112fvdoK]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In underdeveloped countries one-stage definitive repair of cleft lip and palate is considered for late-presenting patients.

Materials and Methods

A total of 25 patients with unoperated cleft lip and palate more than 2 years of age were enrolled in this study for one-stage simultaneous repair of cleft lip and palate. According to Veau-Wardill-Kilner push-back technique, 2 flap palatoplasties were performed for palatal repairs; all of the lips were repaired with the Millard II rotation-advancement technique.

Results

The authors experienced no perioperative or postoperative life-threatening complications. With respect to the registered operation periods, longer times were required to perform these double operations, but this elongation is shorter than the sum of the periods if the 2 operations had been performed separately. Although the authors were unable to evaluate the late postoperative results because the authors could not follow-up the patients after they were discharged the day after surgery, the early results related to the success of the operation without any surgical complication were prone to meet the parents' and patients' expectations.

Discussion

The authors presented their experiences with many volunteer cleft lip and palate trips to third world countries; however the structure of this article is not a new hypothesis and data based to support a scientific study, but observations are objective to get a conclusion. To perform one-stage definitive repair of the cleft lip and palate in late-presented patients was the reality that they had only 1 chance to undergo these operations. According to the terms and conditions of this challenging operation, one-stage simultaneous repair of cleft lip and palate is a more demanding and time-consuming procedure than is isolated cleft lip repair or cleft palate repair. Although technically challenging, single-stage repair of the whole deformity in late-presenting patients is a feasible, reliable, successful, and safe procedure in authors' experience.

### Hospitalization trends for airway infections and in-hospital complications in cleft lip and palate [^111dASSQ]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Children with a cleft palate showed a higher incidence rate for hospitalizations due to airway infections both before (IRR, 2.56 [95% CI, 1.92–3.43]) and after (IRR, 2.93 [95% CI, 2.02–4.24]) palate repair surgery compared with controls. The incident rate for hospitalizations for any cause were also higher before (IRR, 6.19 [95% CI, 5.67–6.76]) and after (IRR, 5.47 [95% CI, 4.69–6.37]) surgery compared with controls (eFigure 6 in Supplement 1). Before undergoing cleft palate repair, patients showed increased odds for in-hospital complications compared with controls, including the need for intubation (odds ratio [OR], 2.37 [95% CI, 1.95–2.87]), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR, 2.89 [95% CI, 1.81–4.63]), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OR, 3.25 [95% CI, 2.21–4.78]), and respiratory support (OR, 1.94 [95% CI, 1.64–2.29]). Furthermore, children with cleft lip or palate had a substantial increase in odds of mortality (OR, 17.97 [95% CI, 11.84–27.29]). This difference in odds was no longer significant after the corrective surgery (eFigure 7 in Supplement 1). In a sensitivity analysis considering hospitalizations with any diagnosis of airway infection (primary or secondary diagnosis), the results remained consistent (eTable 4 and eFigure 8 in Supplement 1).

### Timing of primary surgery for cleft palate [^112SoLX4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Among infants with isolated cleft palate, whether primary surgery at 6 months of age is more beneficial than surgery at 12 months of age with respect to speech outcomes, hearing outcomes, dentofacial development, and safety is unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned infants with nonsyndromic isolated cleft palate, in a 1:1 ratio, to undergo standardized primary surgery at 6 months of age (6-month group) or at 12 months of age (12-month group) for closure of the cleft. Standardized assessments of quality-checked video and audio recordings at 1, 3, and 5 years of age were performed independently by speech and language therapists who were unaware of the trial-group assignments. The primary outcome was velopharyngeal insufficiency at 5 years of age, defined as a velopharyngeal composite summary score of at least 4 (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater severity). Secondary outcomes included speech development, postoperative complications, hearing sensitivity, dentofacial development, and growth.

Results

We randomly assigned 558 infants at 23 centers across Europe and South America to undergo surgery at 6 months of age (281 infants) or at 12 months of age (277 infants). Speech recordings from 235 infants (83.6%) in the 6-month group and 226 (81.6%) in the 12-month group were analyzable. Insufficient velopharyngeal function at 5 years of age was observed in 21 of 235 infants (8.9%) in the 6-month group as compared with 34 of 226 (15.0%) in the 12-month group (risk ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.99; P = 0.04). Postoperative complications were infrequent and similar in the 6-month and 12-month groups. Four serious adverse events were reported (three in the 6-month group and one in the 12-month group) and had resolved at follow-up.

Conclusions

Medically fit infants who underwent primary surgery for isolated cleft palate in adequately resourced settings at 6 months of age were less likely to have velopharyngeal insufficiency at the age of 5 years than those who had surgery at 12 months of age.

### Reoperations in cleft lip and cleft palate treatment [^115ruFBR]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The surgical management of cleft lip and palate is a difficult and complex endeavor. Several surgical techniques for the treatment of this deformity have been described around the world; each one, when properly done by expert surgeons, renders good and predictable results most of the times. However, the fact that there are so many techniques means that there is no universal procedure that will always deliver great esthetic and functional results. This article discusses the causes of inadequate results in primary cleft lip and palate surgery and describes the various secondary surgical techniques to correct the same.

### Single-stage primary cleft lip and palate repair: a review of the literature [^1117aY2f]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Single-stage cleft lip and palate repair is a debated surgical approach. While some studies have described favorable outcomes, concerns include the effect on craniomaxillofacial growth and increased risk of complications. To this date, there has not been a comprehensive appraisal of available data following combined cleft lip and palate repair.

Methods

An extensive literature review was performed to identify all relevant articles. The level of evidence of these articles was graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence Scale.

Results

A total of 22 relevant articles were identified, all of which were retrospective in nature. Patient age at the time of surgery ranged from 1 month to 10 years, the longest duration of follow-up was 18 years, and the largest study included 106 patients. Review of the literature shows that overall surgical outcomes following combined cleft lip and palate repair are encouraging. An increased rate of postoperative fistulas with associated speech abnormalities in some studies is noteworthy. Importantly, there is no evidence to suggest an impact on craniomaxillofacial growth, and psychosocial outcomes and parental satisfaction seem to be improved with single-stage surgery as compared with the staged approach.

Conclusions

Our review shows overall favorable outcomes associated with combined cleft lip and palate repair. The limited follow-up time or nature of evaluated outcomes in some studies may underrepresent the true rate of adverse events, and highlights the need for additional long-term studies with standardized follow-up. To our knowledge, our review is the first to evaluate existing data regarding outcomes following combined cleft lip and palate repair.

### CIRPLAST: cleft lip and palate missions in Peru [^116zM1ii]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The author presents a 20-year experience leading cleft lip and palate surgical volunteer missions in Peru for CIRPLAST, a nonprofit volunteer plastic surgery goodwill program that has provided free surgery for patients with cleft lip and palate deformities in remote areas of Peru. Surgical procedures were performed by the author, together with a group of experienced plastic surgeons, under the auspices of the Peruvian Plastic Surgery Society, and local health authorities.

Methods

CIRPLAST missions are scheduled annually in different locations around Peru. Selected patients for surgery after adequate screening are photographed, and their cleft deformity is recorded. Scheduled patients or their parents, when they are minors, sign an informed consent form. Patients operated on in any given day are examined and photographed 1 day after surgery, before discharge. Between 30 and 35 patients are operated on at each mission site. About 2 weeks after the mission, patients are checked and photographed, and the outcome of surgery is recorded. Complications that may occur are recorded and treated by the CIRPLAST team as soon as possible. Almost all operations are performed under general endotracheal anesthesia coupled by local anesthesia containing a vasoconstrictor, to reduce bleeding and facilitate tissue dissection. All wounds of the lip and palate are closed with absorbable sutures, to avoid the need for suture removal. After cleft lip surgery, patients go to the recovery room for monitoring by nurses until they recover completely.

Results

A total of 6108 cleft lip and palate repairs, primary and secondary, were performed by CIRPLAST in 141 missions, between May 12, 1994, and October 15, 2014. The medical records of the 5162 patients (84.5%) who returned for follow-up (ranging from 12 days to 9 years) were reviewed retrospectively. Between 45% and 70% of the patients operated on a mission have returned for early follow-up and some the following year. There were 3176 males (51.9%) and 2932 females (48.1%). The incidence of isolated lip clefts was 1546 patients (25.3%); of isolated palate clefts, 2223 patients (36.4%); and combined defects, 2339 patients (38.3%). Of the 5162 patients who returned for follow-up, 377 patients (7.3%) had complications. Lip wound dehiscence was present in 58 patients (15.4). Palate fistula formation in 33 patients (8.8%): 24 (6.4%) after primary palate closure, and 9 (2.4%) after previous fistula closure. Infection occurred in 37 cleft lip patients (9.8%). Hypertrophic lip scars were seen in 56 patients (14.9%). Bleeding occurred in the recovery room after palatoplasty in 48 patients (12.7%), and in most cases, it was contained by applying pressure. No blood transfusions were used. Residual deformities of varying degree of the nose and/or lip occurred in 145 patients (38.5%). All required reoperation for correction. There were no intraoperative deaths in this series.

Conclusions

During the past 20 years, the CIRPLAST team has offered free surgery with good outcomes and few complications, to more than 6000 cleft lip and/or palate patients in remote areas of Peru.
