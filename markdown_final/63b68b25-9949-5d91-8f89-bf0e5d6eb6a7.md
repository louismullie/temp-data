## Question

40 yo F with new-onset psychiatric symptoms (disorientation, agitation, visual hallucinations), fever (38.5°C), tachycardia, and mild hypertension. No significant past medical history, no substance abuse. Urine tox negative. CSF with mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, MRI unremarkable. Diagnosis is presumed autoimmune (anti-NMDA receptor) encephalitis. The neurology team recommends starting IV methylprednisolone 1 g daily; the patient also takes oral olanzapine 20 mg daily started in the ED for agitation. Intern is about to order the steroid — continue olanzapine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to continue olanzapine 20 mg daily in a patient with presumed anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis who is about to start high-dose IV methylprednisolone, and what the safest, evidence-based approach is for managing agitation and psychosis in this context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of anti-NMDAR encephalitis and how that alters antipsychotic risk. Then, I should verify what expert guidelines say about antipsychotic selection and seizure risk. Next, I will review data on olanzapine-specific risks, including neuroleptic malignant syndrome and extrapyramidal effects. After that, I should consider the immediate need for symptom control and safer alternatives. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with monitoring and escalation plans, and I will double-check for any exceptions or caveats that might change management in this case.

> Let me first confirm the disease mechanism and why antipsychotics can be problematic. Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is driven by IgG antibodies against the NR1 subunit that internalize NMDA receptors, causing glutamatergic hypofunction and a characteristic neuropsychiatric syndrome; importantly, patients can exhibit heightened sensitivity to dopamine blockade, with increased risks of extrapyramidal symptoms, catatonia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, so I need to be cautious about antipsychotic choice and dose [^5908e452] [^d1d5d146].

> Wait, let me verify the specific risk with olanzapine. Although olanzapine is a second-generation antipsychotic, it still lowers seizure threshold and has been associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome in susceptible populations; in anti-NMDAR encephalitis, case series and expert reviews document antipsychotic intolerance and NMS-like presentations, with fever, rigidity, and autonomic instability occurring after antipsychotic exposure, so continuing a high-dose antipsychotic like 20 mg olanzapine adds avoidable risk here [^d1d5d146] [^104dc2eb] [^869455e0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review guideline-level recommendations. Expert recommendations advise avoiding agents that lower seizure threshold in patients with seizures or increased seizure risk, and in NMDAR encephalitis specifically, they recommend preferring antipsychotics with the least potential for inducing seizures and extrapyramidal side effects, such as quetiapine, while using the lowest effective dose and reassessing frequently; olanzapine is not categorically contraindicated, but it is not preferred in this population, especially at higher doses [^d1d5d146] [^8223635c].

> I need to check the immediate clinical need. Agitation and psychosis are common and often require pharmacologic control to prevent injury and facilitate care, but benzodiazepines are frequently effective and safer in this context; high-dose benzodiazepines can both sedate and mitigate catatonic features, and they do not carry the same NMS or EPS risks as antipsychotics, so a lorazepam-based regimen is reasonable while immunotherapy takes effect [^d1d5d146] [^8223635c].

> Let me consider the steroid interaction. High-dose methylprednisolone can acutely worsen agitation, insomnia, and even precipitate steroid-induced psychosis, so layering a high-dose antipsychotic on top of that may compound neuropsychiatric symptoms and obscure the clinical course; this strengthens the case for minimizing or discontinuing olanzapine and relying on benzodiazepines for acute behavioral control while immunotherapy is initiated [^d1d5d146].

> But wait, what if olanzapine is already helping and the patient is stable on 20 mg? I should double-check the risk-benefit balance. Even if symptoms seem controlled, the pathophysiologic vulnerability to NMS and EPS in anti-NMDAR encephalitis remains, and the benefit of continuing a high-dose antipsychotic is outweighed by the potential for serious complications; if an antipsychotic is absolutely necessary, switching to quetiapine at a low dose and titrating cautiously is the more defensible approach, with close monitoring for rigidity, fever, and autonomic changes [^d1d5d146] [^8223635c].

> I will now examine a practical, stepwise plan. First, taper and discontinue olanzapine as soon as feasible, ideally over a few days to avoid rebound agitation, while initiating a benzodiazepine protocol such as lorazepam 1–2 mg every 4–6 hours with PRN dosing, with the understanding that much higher total daily doses may be required in severe cases. Second, initiate first-line immunotherapy without delay, typically IV methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3–5 days, and consider adding IVIG or plasma exchange early if disease is severe or rapidly progressive. Third, if antipsychotic therapy is still required after benzodiazepine optimization, switch to quetiapine and start low, for example 12.5–25 mg at bedtime, titrating slowly while watching for EPS, NMS, and autonomic instability. Fourth, implement safety measures for agitation, including 1:1 observation, environmental modifications, and soft restraints as needed, and monitor vitals closely for autonomic fluctuations [^d1d5d146] [^0f29fc84] [^8223635c].

> Hold on, I should verify escalation contingencies. If malignant catatonia emerges or benzodiazepines fail, electroconvulsive therapy is an evidence-supported rescue therapy in anti-NMDAR encephalitis and should be considered early, given its efficacy and safety in this context. This aligns with catatonia guidelines and case series in NMDAR encephalitis, and it provides a path to symptom control without exposing the patient to ongoing antipsychotic risks [^498db820] [^154dc644] [^0272ff55].

> In summary, I need to ensure the recommendation is clear and actionable. Yes, discontinue olanzapine 20 mg daily in this presumed anti-NMDAR encephalitis case and transition to benzodiazepine-based sedation while promptly initiating immunotherapy. If an antipsychotic is still required, switch to quetiapine at the lowest effective dose with vigilant monitoring, and escalate to ECT if catatonia or refractory agitation persists. This approach balances the need for acute behavioral control with the unique neurobiological vulnerabilities of anti-NMDAR encephalitis and minimizes the risk of antipsychotic-related complications [^d1d5d146] [^52f8a7f4] [^498db820].

Do not continue **olanzapine 20 mg daily** in suspected anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. High-dose antipsychotics, especially olanzapine, can **worsen movement disorders**, lower seizure threshold, and precipitate neuroleptic malignant syndrome in this population [^d1d5d146] [^869455e0]. If antipsychotic coverage is still needed, switch to a lower-risk agent such as **quetiapine** and use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring [^d1d5d146] [^8223635c]. Prioritize **benzodiazepines** for agitation and continue immunotherapy as planned [^d1d5d146] [^0f29fc84].

## Risks associated with olanzapine in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis

Patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis are uniquely vulnerable to antipsychotic side effects, particularly with agents like olanzapine, because of underlying **NMDA receptor dysfunction** and neurotransmitter imbalance [^5908e452]. Key risks include:

- **Extrapyramidal symptoms and movement disorders**: Olanzapine can exacerbate dyskinesias, dystonia, and other movement disorders common in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis [^d1d5d146].

- **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)**: There is a heightened risk of NMS, a potentially fatal condition characterized by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability, and altered mental status [^104dc2eb].

- **Seizure threshold**: Olanzapine lowers seizure threshold, which is particularly concerning given the increased seizure risk in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis [^d1d5d146].

- **Autonomic instability**: Olanzapine may worsen autonomic dysfunction, including tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia, which are already present in this condition [^d1d5d146].

---

## Clinical evidence and expert recommendations

Clinical literature and expert guidelines consistently advise **caution or avoidance** of high-dose antipsychotics, including olanzapine, in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis:

- **Neuroleptic intolerance**: A study by Kuppili et al. (2016) reported a high incidence of neuroleptic intolerance, including NMS, in patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis treated with antipsychotics [^104dc2eb].

- **Guideline recommendations**: The Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021) recommends avoiding antipsychotics that lower seizure threshold or have high extrapyramidal side effects, favoring agents like quetiapine if antipsychotics are necessary [^d1d5d146].

- **Case reports**: Multiple case reports document worsening symptoms, prolonged recovery, and adverse outcomes associated with antipsychotic use in this population [^1e27bf82].

---

## Alternative pharmacological strategies

Given the risks, **alternative strategies** should be considered for managing agitation and psychosis:

- **Benzodiazepines**: High-dose benzodiazepines (e.g. lorazepam) are recommended as first-line agents for agitation and catatonia, with careful monitoring for respiratory depression and sedation [^d1d5d146] [^52f8a7f4].

- **Quetiapine**: If antipsychotic therapy is absolutely necessary, quetiapine is preferred due to its lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and seizure threshold lowering. Doses should be minimized and titrated cautiously [^d1d5d146] [^8223635c].

- **Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)**: ECT is an effective treatment for severe catatonia and refractory psychosis in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, particularly when pharmacological interventions fail or are contraindicated [^498db820] [^154dc644].

---

## Clinical monitoring and safety considerations

If antipsychotics are continued despite risks, **close monitoring is essential**:

- **Vital signs**: Continuous monitoring of temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate.

- **Neurological status**: Frequent assessment for rigidity, tremor, dyskinesias, and altered mental status.

- **Laboratory tests**: Regular checks of creatine kinase (CK), liver function tests, and electrolytes to detect early signs of NMS or metabolic disturbances.

- **Seizure monitoring**: Continuous EEG monitoring if seizures are suspected or if antipsychotics are continued [^6591f0f8].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the significant risks associated with olanzapine in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, it is **strongly recommended to discontinue olanzapine 20 mg daily**. If antipsychotic therapy is still deemed necessary, switch to a lower-risk agent such as quetiapine at the lowest effective dose, with close monitoring for adverse effects. Benzodiazepines should be the primary pharmacological intervention for agitation and psychosis in this patient population [^d1d5d146] [^52f8a7f4].

Management of psychosis

Often benzodiazepines are required in large doses for adequate sedation. Many patients with AE will need antipsychotics to control agitation and psychosis. One option is to avoid agents that lower seizure threshold (eg, clozapine and olanzapine)in patients with seizures or who are at increased seizure risk (eg, patients with limbic or cortical encephalitis or who have lateralised periodic discharges (LPDs) on electroencephalogram (EEG)). Antipsychotics that prolong the QT interval (eg, ziprasidone and IV haloperidol) should be used with caution or avoided in dysautonomic patients with symptomatic bradycardia or heart block. If an antipsychotic results in worsening of agitation or involuntary movements after initiation, it should be stopped and substituted with an alternative agent. In NMDAR-antibody encephalitis (see online supplemental appendix 1 for full names of neuronal autoantibodies (NAAs)), patients may be particularly sensitive to the extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics and may experience worsening of catatonia and other involuntary movement or even develop neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Second generation antipsychotics with the least potential for inducing seizures and extrapyramidal side effects (eg, quetiapine) may be preferred in patients with AE. Patients with manic symptoms in the setting of AE may be treated with mood stabilisers such as valproic acid especially in case of comorbid seizures. Elimination or dose reduction of certain medications may also improve behavioural symptoms in some patients (eg, steroids, benzodiazepines). It is important to instate safety measures (eg, padding, soft restraints, etc) for agitated patients to prevent self-injury and harm to others.

We present the case of a 30-year-old woman who presented with sexual disinhibition and altered behaviour following an episode of optic neuritis. Her only history was of anxiety disorder. Her differential diagnosis was neurological versus psychiatric. Routine blood tests were unremarkable at this stage. MRI revealed non-specific change and lumbar puncture revealed a slight lymphocytosis and elevated protein and glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). PCR on the CSF was negative for viruses: Adenovirus, varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, enterovirus and parechovirus. She was initially treated with intravenous acyclovir to little effect. Antipsychotics olanzapine and haloperidol were also trialled and continued for 3weeks in total. Once again these medications failed to affect the patient's behaviour but she did begin to show the side effects associated with these medications. Further test results became available at this point-she was anti-N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibody positive. A diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis was made. The patient was started on cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone to good effect.

The standard first treatment for autoimmune encephalitis is high-dose steroids over a 3 to 5-day course, sometimes in combination with administration of intravenous immunoglobulins or plasmapheresis (Fig. 2). In case of the need for second line or escalation therapies, treatment with rituximab can be employed. In refractory cases, immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate can be used to achieve an effective response. If there is no response to above line of therapy, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor and immunosuppressant bortezomib can be attempted.

Immunosuppression by corticosteroid therapy (1 g methylprednisolone/day for 5 days), intravenous human immunoglobulin (IVIg) administration (0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days) or immunoadsorption or plasmapheresis for rapid removal of pathogenic autoantibodies should be first-line therapy in patients with definite autoimmune encephalitis. If therapy fails, treatment should be extended within a few days, preferably with rituximab (2 × 1000 mg i.v. or s.c. at 2 to 4-week intervals). In refractory cases, combination treatment with cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m² body surface area every 4 weeks), mycophenolate mofetil, or methotrexate may also be required to achieve a clinical response. Bortezomib can be used for escalation therapy (1–6 cycles of 1.3 mg/m² body surface area for 21 days each cycle). In addition, antipsychotics with low extrapyramidal side effects (quetiapine, clozapine) should be prescribed for symptomatic pharmacotherapy of psychotic symptoms to reduce the risk of neuroleptic-induced dyskinesia or malignant neuroleptic syndrome. Short-acting benzodiazepines can be used for anxiolysis, sedation and to treat catatonic symptoms.

### Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis [^2f243e1d]. Journal of Child Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Anti- N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis has been shown to be a treatable form of autoimmune encephalitis, but there remains no standardized approach to immunotherapy. We designed an anonymous survey sent to members of the Child Neurology Society to identify the current practices among child neurologists. A total of 151 pediatric neurologists responded to the survey. With these responses we were able to highlight areas of practice uniformity, including first-line treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and intravenous methylprednisone and initiation of disease-modifying therapy with rituximab alone. The survey also identifies existing gaps in knowledge, specifically, when to add disease-modifying therapy and how long to continue therapy. We propose that the areas of agreement can be used as a step toward establishing standard treatment guidelines and research protocols directed at evidence-based clinical trials.

### Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (anti-NMDA) receptor encephalitis: rapid and sustained clinical improvement with steroid therapy starting in the late phase [^7b370354]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate (anti-NMDA) receptor encephalitis is an autoimmune/paraneoplastic encephalitis, with neurologic and psychiatric symptoms. Early and aggressive therapy has been shown to improve prognosis although problems with executive functions and memory have continued for several years. A 15-year-old girl had a history of initial symptoms including behavioral difficulties, poor attention, and frequent seizures progressing to a catatonia-like state, 2.5 months after onset of initial symptoms. Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies were detected in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Subsequent to treatment with methylprednisolone starting 3 months after onset, motor skills, responsiveness, self-care, and speech improved rapidly. Her neuropsychologica profile assessed after 2 months showed global difficulties predominantly in attention, executive functions, memory, and visual perception, which moderately recovered in the 7th and 24th months, respectively. Contrary to current literature supporting the positive impact of early immunomodulatory therapy, a dramatic resolution of major neurologic and psychiatric symptoms was detected with steroid treatment given in the late phase.

If patients reported clinical worsening or possible relapse, an extra visit was scheduled within 72 hours. The investigators identified relapses which were subsequently confirmed by the central review committee. Relapse was defined as new onset or worsening of symptoms occurring after initial improvement or stabilisation of at least 2 months with elevated CSF/serum Ab titres at relapse. Thorough clinical and laboratory examinations were conducted to rule out other aetiologies and to validate the diagnosis of relapse. The patients were assessed using a relapse questionnaire designed for this study. The relapse questionnaire included the frequency of relapses, number of events, time to relapse, clinical symptoms, NMDAR-IgG positivity and titre in CSF and serum and treatment. Relapses or clinical worsening could be treated with rescue therapy at the investigators' discretion. Rescue therapy was defined as due to lack of improvement/worsening of the disease, clinicians increased or failed to taper the oral corticosteroids dose according to the tapering schedule or changed to another immunosuppressant (such as rituximab, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine) in patients with NMDARE. Any increase in the dose of symptomatic medications (including antiepileptic drugs, antipsychotics and analgesics) during the study period will not be considered as rescue therapy. Follow-up visits were conducted in person to check for drug tolerability and the occurrence of AEs (Protocol: pp. 15–18).

Background

Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor autoimmune encephalitis is a newly identified form of encephalitis whose incidence is on the rise. Awareness of this condition and symptom recognition are key to early diagnosis and prompt treatment, which may alter the course of the disease.

Case Report

A 35-year-old woman presented to our Emergency Department (ED) with lethargy, bizarre behavior, agitation, confusion, memory deficits, and word-finding difficulties. Her symptoms and evaluation were potentially consistent with a primary psychiatric disorder, but the absence of frank psychosis and presence of neurologic features related to memory and cognition prompted other considerations. In the ED we performed a lumbar puncture, and in addition to routine studies, ordered anti-NMDAR antibody screening. The screening studies returned positive, leading to treatment with glucocorticoids and intravenous immune globulin and resulting in improvement to near baseline function. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Although anti-NMDAR encephalitis is relatively uncommon, reports of this previously unrecognized condition are increasing, with an unclear true incidence of disease. Emergency providers should consider this diagnosis in their differential for patients presenting with new neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly in young women. Prompt treatment leads to near complete neurologic recovery in 75% of patients, whereas delays in diagnosis and treatment may be associated with worse outcomes including death.

### Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. the disorder, the diagnosis and the immunobiology [^bbf0a795]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is a newly characterized syndrome with a progressive, predictable clinical course and the possibility of effective treatment. Accurate and timely diagnosis is critical to selection and implementation of treatments, and optimal patient outcomes. Outcomes are improved with early diagnosis via indirect immunofluorescence or cell-based assays, and the rapid and appropriate administration of immunosuppressant and anti-psychotic therapies. Three possible scenarios accounting for the immunopathogenesis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis are presented, with the most probable one being that of paraneoplastic autoimmunity. Future efforts in this disorder should focus on elucidating the mechanisms that contribute to initiation of this antibody response, as well as exploring the role of tumors, infectious triggers and immune-reactivation. Finally, accessible tools need to be developed that allow for reliable identification of specific antibody markers against synaptic proteins.

### Antibody-mediated encephalitis [^5908e452]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on antibody-mediated encephalitis:

- **Definition**: Antibody-mediated encephalitis comprises immune-driven disorders in which pathogenic autoantibodies target neuronal surface or synaptic antigens, producing subacute neuropsychiatric dysfunction. NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis is the most common form in children and young adults and is defined by IgG antibodies to the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor together with a characteristic syndrome of psychiatric disturbance, movement disorder, seizures, language dysfunction, and autonomic instability. Most cases are idiopathic, though some follow herpes simplex encephalitis or, rarely in pediatric patients, arise in association with ovarian teratomas.
- **Pathophysiology**: The central mechanism is antibody-mediated crosslinking and internalization of target receptors, leading to reversible synaptic dysfunction rather than neuronal loss. In NMDA receptor encephalitis, NR1 antibody-induced receptor hypofunction disrupts glutamatergic signaling across corticolimbic networks, generating excitatory-inhibitory imbalance and the disorder's polysymptomatic phenotype. CSF antibodies correlate more consistently with disease activity than serum antibodies, yet titers do not reliably predict individual trajectory. Persistent intrathecal inflammation evidenced by pleocytosis, oligoclonal bands, elevated IgG index, or increased neopterin may indicate ongoing immune activation. Following herpes simplex encephalitis, viral injury and antigen exposure likely trigger secondary loss of tolerance to neuronal epitopes.
- **Disease course**: The illness evolves over days to weeks, usually beginning with behavioral or psychiatric change and progressing to seizures, movement abnormalities, language regression, altered consciousness, and autonomic dysfunction. Early clinical worsening or minimal improvement over the first weeks is typical even with appropriate therapy. Recovery is slow and often extends for many months, with meaningful gains continuing up to two years. Relapse occurs in roughly fifteen percent of patients and necessitates more aggressive and prolonged immunotherapy. In post-herpes simplex cases, acyclovir is required until viral recurrence is excluded, after which treatment aligns with idiopathic disease. Symptom control is essential but difficult; antipsychotics may aggravate dyskinesias or precipitate neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Mortality is around 5%, and functional outcomes are generally favorable when immunotherapy is initiated promptly. Nevertheless, cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral sequelae are common, particularly deficits in executive function and fatigue. Early initiation of corticosteroids and timely escalation to rituximab in nonresponders improves outcomes and reduces relapse risk. Long-term immunosuppression beyond six months is usually unnecessary unless disease severity, slow recovery, or recurrent episodes justify extended therapy. Tumor-associated cases improve with early tumor identification and resection. Rehabilitation in specialized pediatric brain injury programs is crucial, as neurologic recovery frequently continues for up to twenty-four months.

### Development of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in a patient with multiple sclerosis [^e1a01ff1]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (anti-NMDA) receptor encephalitis is a rare subtype of autoimmune encephalitis, often presenting with early-onset, disease-specific neuropsychiatric symptoms. This case report describes a female patient with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who developed anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis while receiving disease-modifying treatment. She exhibited neurocognitive symptoms and atypical magnetic resonance findings. Clinical and laboratory findings, including lumbar puncture, confirmed the presence of IgG antibodies against the GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor, establishing the diagnosis. First-line therapy with methylprednisolone and plasma exchange proved refractory, and immunoglobulin therapy yielded only a suboptimal response. Rituximab achieved the optimal therapeutic effect; however, therapy was followed by recurrent COVID-19 infection in this previously unvaccinated patient. This report highlights the complexities of diagnosis, differential considerations, therapeutic strategies and the detrimental impact of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and RRMS on the patient's quality of life.

### Psychiatric management of anti-NMDAR encephalitis: a cohort analysis [^934392b0]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is an immune-mediated disorder which requires multi-disciplinary treatment including immunomodulation therapy. First presentation is most commonly to psychiatric services and continuing psychiatric care is required to treat disabling symptoms, such as behaviour disturbance, psychosis and catatonia. There is minimal available evidence to guide symptomatic treatment and concern for increased sensitivity to antipsychotics complicates traditional approaches.

Methods

All cases of cerebrospinal fluid positive anti-NMDAR encephalitis tested in Queensland, Australia were identified. Demographic, clinical and therapeutic data were collected and reviewed by two independent clinicians. Pre-specified variables reflecting possible treatment side effects were compared.

Results

The majority of the 30 cases (83%) had early psychiatric symptoms and were treated with antipsychotics (67%), average daily olanzapine equivalence dose of 11.5 mg, prior to immunomodulation therapy. Although there was an 88% reduction in cases with aggression, there was little improvement in psychosis, affective symptoms or catatonia with antipsychotics alone. In the cases with psychiatric symptoms, there was no significant difference in the rate of occurrence of neurological and autonomic symptoms between cases prescribed and not prescribed antipsychotics.

Conclusions

Psychiatric input is imperative for both acute and longer-term management of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Primary symptomatic treatment should remain immunotherapy and surgery. Antipsychotic medications have particular value in managing agitation and aggression. Potential side effects from antipsychotic treatment are difficult to differentiate from progression of anti-NMDAR encephalitis but there was no evidence in this cohort of increased antipsychotic sensitivity. Treatment with psychotropic medication should be individualised and adjusted during the course of the illness.

### Autoimmune neurology: the need for comprehensive care [^17cf2570]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute Prognosis and Treatment

Patients with AE need specialized care. Most cases are likely to require advanced diagnostic imaging and treatment by specially trained clinicians with AE experience. Complex patients may require intensive care unit (ICU) management for complications including hypoventilation, bradycardia, severe blood pressure changes, encephalopathy (with failure to protect the airway), seizures (with or without status epilepticus), and severe movement disorders, including potential neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Patients with NMDAR encephalitis are at an especially high risk of autonomic dysfunction, requiring close monitoring (figure 1). Patients with AE have also been reported to have a higher rate of severe sepsis and shock when compared with the general ICU population.

Providers with experience in managing AE can offer important guidance to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment, thereby avoiding the risk for complications. For example, differentiating seizure-related activity from dyskinetic or stereotypic movements is essential, as unnecessary administration of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) could prolong recovery. Likewise, an understanding of the time to efficacy of commonly administered immunomodulatory treatments can prevent side effects associated with excessive immunosuppression. Recommendations governing the acute treatment in AE are derived from expert opinion, case series, and case reports. Current data suggest that early initiation of commonly available therapies — namely, high-dose steroids and IV immunoglobulin or plasma exchange — and timely escalation to second-line immunotherapy may lead to improved clinical outcomes, although randomized controlled trials are needed to inform optimal treatment approaches.

Detailed knowledge of individual prognostic factors is essential to accurately inform decision making. Consultation with a neurologist with experience in AE can help outline the typical timeline and prognosis for recovery, which can provide context for families and caregivers alike. A multicenter AE ICU cohort study conducted in Germany illustrated that despite the severity of the disease, the majority experienced significant recovery before discharge. Thus, it is imperative that clinicians are patient in the course of AE recovery, as improvement can be delayed and may not directly correlate with laboratory or imaging findings.

Discussion

Since its discovery in 2007, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is being recognized more frequently, especially in adolescents and young adults. As demonstrated by this case, the presentation of this autoimmune encephalitis may closely mimic primary psychiatric syndromes, but the disease process is unresponsive, or possibly exacerbated by psychotropic interventions.

Diagnosing anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is often challenging given the wide range of clinical presentation, and may be further complicated by its overlap of symptoms, brain MRI changes, CSF findings with other entities affecting the brain. The differential diagnosis includes viral infections (e.g. HSV-1), other auto-immune processes (e.g. acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis or Hashimoto's encephalitis), primary central nervous system vasculitis, or other described encephalitides. Even though the diagnosis can be made by identifying antibodies in immune-mediated encephalitis, the diagnosis may be delayed by weeks to months. One retrospective study found the median time from presentation to diagnosis to be 47 days for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, and even longer in other auto-immune encephalitides. Delay in immune suppressive therapy is associated with adverse outcomes. Conventional clinical neurological assessment and standard diagnostic tests (MRI, EEG, and CSF studies) are reasonable approaches to decide early treatment of probable anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis since antibody testing or response to immunosuppression are late diagnostic criteria.

Immune suppressive therapies improve the prognosis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. First-line treatment, including high-dose corticosteroids combined with either IVIG or PLEX or both, results in improvement of one-half of patients at 3–4 weeks. Second-line therapy (rituximab and/or cyclophosphamide) is efficacious in many patients with persistent symptoms after failing first-line treatment. The choice and escalation of immune suppressive therapies depend on the severity of clinical symptoms and clinical response. In our case, early intense first-line treatment (high dose corticosteroids and PLEX) was started due to the severe clinical condition. Ten days later, after antibody confirmation of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and the failure to improve on first-line treatment, rituximab and IVIG were added. Even with the prompt initiation of first and second-line immunosuppression, the patient continued to suffer from malignant catatonia which required initiation of anti-catatonic treatments.

### Neuroleptic intolerance in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^869455e0]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Interestingly, hypofunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission has been proposed in the etiology of NMS, although amantadine, a weak NMDA receptor antagonist, improves NMS symptoms in a Parkinson disease model. Beyond the apparent contradiction of glutamatergic functioning, the pathophysiologic interplay between the NMDAR and dopaminergic receptors, and more generally monoamine signaling, emerges as a core mechanism in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Any alteration in NMDAR signaling at the neuronal surface (as reported in anti-NMDAR encephalitis,) can modify the trafficking and thus signaling of dopamine receptors, through direct interactions between receptors or intracellular signaling cascades. Thus, antipsychotic drugs could either alleviate or worsen NMDAR-based symptoms based on their range of action on the monoamine systems and our results suggest extreme caution in the use of antipsychotic drugs in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Clearly, suspicion of antipsychotic intolerance is a very important alarm to suspect anti-NMDAR encephalitis and may lead psychiatrists to investigate such a diagnosis.

Some limitations of the present study must be discussed. As a retrospective cohort study, selection bias and information bias may limit the strength of our results. Furthermore, physicians may have changed since 2007 and probably discuss more frequently the diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis in front of acute psychiatric symptoms. Our main result concerning neuroleptic intolerance is limited by the lack of more specific clinical and paraclinical details. Similarly, presence or absence of discreet neurologic or psychiatric signs and symptoms must be considered with caution due to possible variability in detailed examinations among patients.

### Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis preceded by meningitis lasting up to 60 days [^81024b59]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Long-lasting meningitis complicated by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis has not been discussed widely in the literature. Herein, we present two cases of anti-NMDAR encephalitis preceded by meningitis. The patients had 60- and 22-day periods of preceding meningitis, which improved with intravenous methylprednisolone and plasmapheresis. No tumors were detected in either of the patients. Although meningitis preceding anti-NMDAR encephalitis is not rare, our patients, especially those who had it for a duration of 60 days, had longer durations of meningitis. This manuscript foregrounds that anti-NMDAR encephalitis might be included in the differential diagnosis of long-lasting meningitis.

### Case of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in a female adolescent with favourable response to second-line treatment with cyclophosphamide [^e1723159]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

We report the case of a female adolescent who presented with behavioural changes. She was admitted to our institution due to worsening psychiatric and neurological symptoms, subsequently diagnosed with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis. Additional workup was facilitated to rule out a possible underlying teratoma, but all tests turned out unremarkable. First-line treatment with methylprednisolone pulse therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin was started, to which she showed marked improvement from baseline. One month after discharge, a decision for readmission was made because of persistent episodes of hallucinations, agitation and dyskinesias. In this case report, we highlight the use of cyclophosphamide over rituximab as second-line treatment in a resource-limited setting, owing to its greater availability and lesser cost. Cyclophosphamide treatment was given resulting in a more sustained clinical improvement with return to baseline function.

### Autoimmune encephalitis: clinical spectrum and management [^0f29fc84]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

There are several options for acute and long-term immunotherapies in both the inpatient and outpatient settings (table 2). Initial inpatient therapy often involves corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins and/or plasma exchange. While awaiting autoantibody results, we start first-line immunotherapy when we are clinically confident of the diagnosis. Second-line therapies include rituximab, cyclophosphamide and other corticosteroid-sparing agents. Choice of initial therapy should balance the risk profile of the intervention and the severity/trajectory of the individual patient's disease course.

Table 2
Immunotherapeutic options for treatment of autoimmune encephalitis

In our experience, intravenous corticosteroids are generically highly effective agents, so relative contraindications (eg, pre-existing diabetes or psychiatric diseases) are often carefully managed in the acute phase but rarely considered absolute contraindications. We also find plasma exchange to be very effective, often used if patients show a limited or inadequate response to corticosteroids, or for patients with a rapid deterioration whose trajectory may otherwise be intensive care unit admission. While intravenous immunoglobulin is the only immunotherapy with randomised data to support its use, in practice it appears the least effective of the three conventional first-line interventions. This observation is supported by the minimal effect size observed in this inaugural randomised control trial.

Below, we discuss our more specific management approaches to the two most common autoantibody-mediated syndromes.

NMDAR-antibody encephalitis

Due to its associated high-morbidity and mortality, potential for months of hospitalisation and high rate of relapses, we favour early aggressive therapy in patients with NMDAR-antibody encephalitis. Teratoma removal and first-line immunotherapies are routine interventions: typically, 3–5 days of 1 g intravenous methylprednisolone daily, plus plasma exchange. Second-line immunotherapies reduce the relapse risk and, from our clinical observations, expedite recoveries and time to discharge. Our threshold to escalate to second-line therapy is increasingly low, with > 70% of our patients receiving cyclophosphamide or rituximab if awareness and behaviour have not improved within 2 weeks. As outpatients, we tend not to employ a prolonged course of oral corticosteroids, especially if second-line therapy or tumour removal appears to be having the desired effect. This approach appears to associate with a < 5% rate of relapses, to date. If second-line immunotherapy is not administered during initial episode, it should be strongly considered in relapses.

### Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis with initial negative markers: diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of a refractory case with 9-month-long follow-up [^484fd4c3]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Anti- N -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is a progressively debilitating, frequently fatal disease caused by autoantibodies against the NMDA receptor. Risk of delayed treatment is high due to variable presentations, lack of awareness and potential false negative diagnostic studies. In this case report, a woman in her 20s presented with psychiatric manifestations and rapidly declined. Dyskinetic movements and dysautonomia were observed. Initial cerebrospinal fluid and serum anti-NMDA receptor antibodies were negative. MRI was inconclusive. Electroencephalography demonstrated extreme delta brush. Pelvic CT revealed an adnexal teratoma. She remained refractory to treatment until day 126 when, after two cycles of cyclophosphamide, she started to improve. She participated in rehabilitation with eventual discharge home on day 269. Recognising the variable presentations of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is important in avoiding misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. If clinical suspicion remains high despite negative results, repeat testing should be pursued. Clinical response should guide treatment decisions in refractory cases.

### Autoimmune encephalitis: the clinical evolution as a key to the diagnosis [^5e20d35f]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Anti-N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a devastating disease, that despite being increasingly diagnosed, there are no consensus guidelines for the optimal management. A previously healthy 3-year-old-boy brought to the emergency department due to seizures. Neurological examination was normal, and electroencephalogram (EEG) suggested focal epilepsy. Anticonvulsive medication was initiated. He progressively lost age-appropriate language skills, presented behavioural changes and psychiatric symptoms. Neurological examination at that time revealed symmetric gross motor weakness of the lower limbs. Brain and spinal cord MRI and cerebrospinal fluid were normal. Repeated EEG showed global lentification. Steroid therapy was initiated for the suspicion of autoimmune encephalitis, later confirmed as NMDAR encephalitis. He became clinically improved after 10 days of treatment but only returned to his baseline after 3months of disease onset. The authors emphasised the variable course of the disease and possible late response to treatment.

### Pediatric anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis with catatonia: treatment with electroconvulsive therapy [^0272ff55]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Early in her course, the NMS symptoms improved and she was extubated successfully. Observed generalized tonic-clonic seizures led to initiating levetiracetam. CSF results and her behavioral changes at presentation were suspicious for autoimmune encephalitis, therefore 5 days of methylprednisolone (dose 1 g/day) followed by 30 mg Q 12 h and PLEX (one cycle every other day for a total of 5 cycles) were begun empirically. Despite initial treatment, she remained emotionally labile, mute, intermittently agitated, rigid, and restless consistent with catatonia. Her catatonia remained refractory despite trials of lorazepam up to 18 mg/day and zolpidem up to 40 mg/day. On hospital day 9, serum and CSF samples confirmed anti-NMDA receptor autoimmune encephalitis. First-line treatment was intensified with IVIG (70 g every 2 weeks for 5 doses, then monthly for 3 extra doses). A rituximab course (1000 mg biweekly for 2 doses) was started as second-line immunosuppression with a second course of 1 g methylprednisolone daily for 3 days. In spite of these treatments, episodes of agitation, rigidity, sleep disturbance, mutism, facial twitching, drooling, and autonomic instability (heart rate 130–170; blood pressure 132–158/58–102) persisted leading to the diagnosis of malignant catatonia. Her Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) was 27 (normal is 0). Based on the recommendation of two independent psychiatrists and with family consent, ECT was begun to treat the malignant catatonia. ECT began on day 14 of her hospitalization with bitemporal electrode placement. A total of eight ECT treatments were given thrice weekly. Use of maximal device energies and the addition of flumazenil to reverse BZDs were necessary to achieve adequate seizure durations. Her heart rate and blood pressure improved after the fourth ECT and normalized after the seventh. Over the course of her ECT treatments, her BFCRS improved from 27 to 2 (Fig. 1). We also evaluated her mental status using the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) prior to ECT #3, ECT #5, and the day after ECT #8 (Fig. 2), showing marked improvement in visuospatial, motoric, and cognitive functioning. The patient's mother noted after the course of ECT that the patient displayed more of her typical personality and mannerisms. Despite the improvement in physical strength, she continued to be mute at the termination of treatment. She was discharged home on melatonin 10 mg each night, levetiracetam, tapering doses of prednisone and lorazepam, and additional IVIG treatments as described above. She received intensive out-patient rehabilitation including speech, physical and occupational therapy. At her clinic visit two weeks post-hospital discharge, she was slow to respond verbally but had had obvious clinical improvement with the ability to talk in complete sentences and respond appropriately. Her verbal abilities and communication skills appeared normal at her 6-week post-ECT clinic appointment.

In the patient who has failed to improve a year or more after treatment, it is sometimes difficult to determine residual sequelae from ongoing inflammation. In this situation, CSF re-examination for ongoing neuroinflammation (i.e. persistent pleocytosis, intrathecal oligoclonal bands, elevated immunoglobulin G [IgG] index, or CSF neopterin)may help with decision making and the risk vs benefit consideration of an empiric retrial or immunotherapy (pulsed corticosteroid for 3 months, IVIg monthly, rituximab reinduction, or tocilizumab). CSF NMDAR antibody titers seem to correlate better with disease course compared with serum antibodies, but there is not a strong correlation between titer and clinical course in the individual patient, and antibodies can persist long after recovery.e1, e2 Although all stages of management of NMDARE may be challenging even for experienced physicians, this is especially true when dealing with a severe patient failing to improve, and a second opinion may be useful and help the clinician make further therapeutic decisions. Organizations such as the Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance, the Encephalitis Society, and the Anti NMDA Receptor Encephalitis Foundation Inc. may help connect with experts.

3.3 Treatment and outcome

Seven patients were prescribed 1 g methylprednisolone followed by 60 mg prednisolone with weekly tapering according to clinical response. One patient was managed with an additional 5 day course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) following a failure to improve with 6 weeks of high dose corticosteroid therapy. Due to the lack of diagnostic facility at the time of enrolment, one patient did not receive any corticosteroid during their admission, and another received 16 mg dexamethasone for 7 days. Convulsions and rigidity were managed with phenobarbitol and diazepam as first-line agents.

Eight patients had survived to discharge at the time of writing; a final patient remained in hospital. Three required further admission to a rehabilitation facility prior to discharge home. Seven patients have been followed up at 8 months: relatives reported that all patients exhibited behavioural disturbance and/or cognitive deficit for many weeks following their discharge from hospital. However at 8 months, four patients had returned to work/school, and the remainder were able to perform activities of daily living, although two had residual cognitive deficits and required prompting to initiate these tasks.

Clinical characteristics of the 21 patients in whom neuroleptic malignant syndrome was suspected

For the remaining 5 patients (11%), the reasons for transfer were an abnormal brain MRI with nonspecific fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hypersignals for 2 cases, with one performed prior to a planned course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and the other to explore the reasons behind self-mutilation. In another case, an EEG proved abnormal. Of the last 2 patients, one had tachycardia, with a suspicion of pulmonary embolism, while the other patient was transferred due to parental demand.

Duration of psychiatric hospitalization.

Hospitalization in psychiatry lasted from 6 hours to several months. The duration was precisely known for all the patients (median duration 9 days, range 0.25–239 days). Nine patients were hospitalized more than 4 weeks (30, 35, 35, 60, 74, 87, 90, and 239 days, respectively, and 1 patient had several hospitalizations and admission to day hospital in a total period of 13 months). Interestingly, one of these patients, hospitalized for 90 days, had a medical history of unspecified encephalitis, but the case notes indicated that the attending physicians did not consider a diagnosis other than depression. This patient presented with a severe major depressive disorder, which was resistant to psychotropic or antidepressant drugs. A transfer was finally organized 2 months later after an abnormal brain MRI was performed prior to a planned course of ECT.

Treatment and outcome.

After the diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, all of the patients were treated with immunomodulators (combination of steroids, immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide, or rituximab). We studied the outcome of the 109 patients, with a median follow-up time longer than 2 years (figure 2). The median time to total recovery (modified Rankin Scale score 1 or 0) was 9 months, and the total recovery rate was 90% at 24 months. We observed no differences in the recovery rate between patients who were first hospitalized in psychiatric institutions vs other medical departments or in the recovery rates of patients with or without antipsychotic drug intolerance.

### Psychosis in the ED: a case of NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis [^7b79e6d1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate antibody receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a newly recognized disease increasing in diagnostic frequency. A 27-year-old female presented with symptoms of oral dyskinesia, tachycardia, and altered mental status following a three-month history of depression, lethargy, catatonia, and auditory hallucinations. We utilized our facilities neurology and psychiatry consult services, performed a lumbar puncture (LP), and requested NMDAR antibody titers. Following admission the Anti-NMDAR antibody titer was elevated warranting treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), corticosteroids, and later rituximab. Organic causes of psychosis are often overlooked in the emergency department, particularly in patients with a history of psychiatric illness. An understanding and awareness of NMDAR encephalitis allows for timely diagnosis, prompting quicker treatment. Emergency physicians should maintain an index of clinical suspicion for NMDAR encephalitis when encountering patients with progressive symptoms of catatonia and psychosis of unclear etiology.

### Long-term maintenance of mycophenolate mofetil in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (LEARN): a multicentre, open-label, blinded-endpoint, randomised controlled trial [^0801cdd9]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARE) is the most prevalent and severe type of autoimmune encephalitis, with substantial morbidity and mortality rates, characterised by relapse rates of 25∼30%, often necessitating intensive care unit (ICU) admission in more than 50% of cases. It affects 1.5 per million individuals yearly and imposes a heavy economic and social burden on people and the healthcare system. The disorder most commonly manifests by psychosis, cognitive impairments, epileptic seizures, movement disorders, autonomic dysfunction, coma or even death.

In NMDARE, the highly specific pathogenic autoantibodies (Abs) bind to neuronal surface-expressed NMDARs and induce the reduction of synaptic NMDAR currents and impaired long-term potentiation. This process involves the dysregulation of autoreactive T and B lymphocytes. Therefore, current first-line treatment for patients with NMDARE includes intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), high-dose glucocorticoids or plasma exchange (PLEX), but these treatments have several disadvantages. The most important problem with first-line immune treatment is the heterogeneity of responses, with approximately 20–35% or even 50% of patients having a relapse at some point after immunotherapies have been reduced or stopped. Given that relapses pose a risk of permanent and severe neurological disability, it is essential that a patient's maintenance therapy remains highly effective, safe and tolerable for long-term use.

Although mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is widely used in autoimmune diseases due to its immunosuppressive properties and selective inhibition of lymphocytes, its specific action in neurological immune disorders remains a subject of interest. Despite its potential efficacy in refractory cases, including those with neuronal surface antigen-mediated encephalitis, there is a lack of definitive randomised controlled trials assessing its role in the treatment of such conditions. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of MMF maintenance therapy in new-onset patients with NMDARE to address this gap in clinical evidence. The hypothesis of our study posits that adding long-term MMF to first-line treatment is a more effective treatment strategy than using first-line treatment alone in patients with NMDARE.

Clinical management

Symptomatic considerations

In addition to treatment of the underlying immunological process, it is often necessary to consider management of seizures, movement disorders, behaviour, pain, sleep and autonomic disturbance, and mood disorders. We do not discuss this substantial topic comprehensively here but rather we focus on special considerations relevant to the two most common forms of autoimmune encephalitis: NMDAR-antibody and LGI1-antibody encephalitis.

The overlap in clinical features between NMDAR-antibody encephalitis and neuroleptic malignant syndrome has led some to hypothesise that patients with NMDAR-antibody encephalitis have hypersensitivity to neuroleptic agents, with an increased risk of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Hence, we judiciously use antipsychotic medications for behavioural symptom management, injury prevention and to facilitate care, often once daily olanzapine 10 mg. Alternatively, we find benzodiazepines are effective, although often at high doses (sometimes up to 180 mg/day of diazepam), for treating both behavioural symptoms and some dyskinesias. We frequently liaise closely with neuropsychiatry colleagues to manage behavioural features.

As discussed earlier, seizures are a common presenting feature among the autoimmune encephalitis syndromes. However, from 103 patients with LGI1-antibody encephalitis, antiseizure medications alone stopped faciobrachial dystonic seizures in only 10%. By contrast, faciobrachial dystonic seizures stopped within 30 days of starting immunotherapy in 51%, rising to 88% by 90 days. The same principle appears increasingly true for seizures associated with multiple forms of autoimmune encephalitis. Thus, it is imperative for appropriate and timely treatment to recognise an underlying autoimmune encephalitis syndrome. Furthermore, patients with LGI1-antibody disease are at higher risk of cutaneous reactions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome with antiseizure medications. Therefore, not only is antiseizure medication use likely to be ineffective but may also result in iatrogenic adverse events. Whenever possible, we prioritise optimisation of immunotherapy in these patients and increasingly reserve antiseizure medications only for generalised convulsions or instances where the seizure semiology is likely to cause injury.

### Challenges in providing critical care for patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis [^60d1e296]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARE) is characterized by a constellation of psychiatric, neurologic, autonomic, and cardiopulmonary manifestations. Although patients typically recover with appropriate treatment, they commonly require weeks to months of inpatient care, including prolonged stays in critical care units. This case series not only advocates for consideration of the disease in the appropriate context but also specifically highlights the distinct challenges intensivists encounter caring for patients with NMDARE. With a greater knowledge of the nuances and sequelae of NMDARE, critical care specialists will be better equipped to anticipate and manage the potentially life-threatening complications of the disease.

The initial treatment included high-dose intravenous corticosteroids and IVIG for all eight patients, with treatment initiation occurring between hospital days 2 to 11. Two of these patients underwent a second course of IVIG during their hospitalisations. In addition, three patients underwent PLEX, and one patient received cyclophosphamide. Longer-term immunotherapy with rituximab was given to seven patients, and one patient also received tocilizumab. Three patients received long-term oral corticosteroids. Three patients were found to have ovarian teratomas, which were resected between hospital days 3 and 14; no other tumour type was found in this patient cohort. Details of case presentations and immunotherapy are outlined in table 2.

Table 2
Detailed case presentations

All patients in this series developed malignant catatonia during their admission, with autonomic instability. Their mean initial BFCRS score was 22.1 (median 22.5). BZDs were challenged and continued if patients had any clinical response; lorazepam was used as the initial treatment, ranging from 24 mg to 156 mg daily dose at the peak dose. Patients received an average of 29.9 ECT treatments in total (including index and maintenance treatments). Details of ECT treatment are outlined in table 3. Seven of eight patients started ECT in the ICU setting, with all non-ICU treatments occurring in a dedicated ECT suite. None of the patients were admitted to a psychiatric unit at any point during their treatment course.

Statistical analysis

The estimated proportion of relapse patients at 24 months with first-line treatments only was found to be 25–35%, according to a literature review. However, we lack prior knowledge about the relapse rate with MMF. A retrospective study reported that the relapse rate for corticosteroids plus MMF in patients with neuronal surface Ab-mediated encephalitis was approximately 9.1% at 24 months. Assuming a 1:1 randomisation, we calculated that 118 patients with 20 relapse events would provide 80% power to determine the prespecified between-group difference on the basis of a two-sided log-rank test with a probability of type I error of 5%, assuming a 10% dropout rate. Enrolment was planned to stop when 118 participants had been randomly allocated and at least 20 relapse events had occurred. The sample size was calculated using PASS software.

Categorical variables were summarised using frequency and percentage, while continuous variables were presented as mean (SD), median values and IQRs or n (%). Baseline demographic characteristics, disease symptoms, treatment modalities and examination factors were compared using Fisher's exact test for categorical outcomes and Student's t-test for continuous variables, as appropriate. The primary analyses of efficacy and safety outcomes were conducted using an intention-to-treat approach which included all participants who were randomly assigned to treatment groups. The primary outcome analysis used Kaplan-Meier plots, with statistical significance assessed using the log-rank test. Prespecified sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy outcome included variables such as age (< 30 vs ≥ 30 years), sex, clinical severity (mRS = 5, CASE score ≥ 20), acute manifestations (ICU admission), auxiliary examinations and baseline treatments. All secondary outcomes were evaluated under the intention-to-treat protocol. The relative treatment effect size is expressed as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% CIs. Repeatedly measured continuous variables were analysed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Changes in scores relative to baseline are reported as mean (SE). All statistical analyses were conducted using R software, V.4.3.1 (R Group for Statistical Computing). Detailed statistical procedures can be found in Protocol (pp. 21–22).

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^498db820]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Since RCTs are unavailable, treatment recommendations for malignant catatonia are based on case reports or case series. Five international guidelines for the management of schizophrenia specifically address the treatment of malignant catatonia, although they are based on low levels of evidence. Each of the guidelines recommends ECT either as the initial treatment or as second line after a failed benzodiazepine trial. Although the benefits of benzodiazepines in malignant catatonia are less consistent than in non-malignant catatonia, a review of 44 cases found that there was clear benefit in about a third, transient or partial improvement in a third and no benefit in the remainder, so a benzodiazepine trial seems reasonable. Doses as high as 24 mg of lorazepam per day may be required. However, if benzodiazepines are not rapidly effective, ECT should be started within 48–72 h following the onset of malignant catatonia.

ECT appears to be a safe and effective treatment for malignant catatonia occurring in association with a psychiatric disorder. Among 68 patients reported in five series, 51 of 54 treated with ECT survived, whereas only 6 of 14 who received antipsychotics and supportive care recovered. Still, ECT appears effective only if initiated before severe progression of malignant catatonia. In another series, although 16 of 19 patients receiving ECT within 5 days of malignant catatonia onset survived, none of 14 patients starting ECT beyond that 5-day point recovered. In view of the life-threatening potential of malignant catatonia, bilateral treatments daily or twice daily for 3–5 days are often required to achieve a rapid result, followed by ECT at conventional frequencies until complete resolution. In addition, ECT has been effective as a symptomatic measure in malignant catatonia complicating a diversity of medical conditions, such as anti-NMDAR encephalitis, permitting resolution of the underlying condition.

### Neuropsychological assessment as an objective tool to monitor treatment response in anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis [^ce2bba91]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

We report a 1-year follow-up of a young woman with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis. Management of autoimmune encephalitis remains challenging as objective and clinically relevant biomarkers are sought, which allow for the monitoring of treatment response. While further investigation is required, we believe that this case highlights the importance of following a comprehensive neuropsychological profile as a clinically relevant biomarker to guide therapeutic decision-making. By relying on the neuropsychological assessment of the patient, treatment with more toxic medications was avoided and her antiepileptic drug regimen was simplified.

### Case report: anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis and its anesthetic implications [^c1c6996e]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

We describe the anesthetic management and implications of 2 patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis. Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is a neurological disorder caused by production of antibodies to the NMDA receptor. The NMDA receptor is the target of many drugs used in anesthesia. It is important to understand the pharmacologic interactions these anesthetics have with a disabled NMDA receptor while preparing an anesthetic plan for patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Symptoms of the disease such as psychosis, paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity, and central hypoventilation pose risks to the induction and maintenance of anesthesia in these patients.

### A pounding problem: a case of recurrent headache caused by anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis [^fe9ef2a5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (Anti-NMDAR) encephalitis is a serious autoimmune disease in which antibody production against the NMDA receptor results in profound neurotransmitter dysregulation. Patients may present with a wide variety of symptoms, including psychosis, orofacial dyskinesias, dysautonomia, hallucinations, mental status changes, seizures, and headaches.

Case Report

A previously healthy 25-year-old woman presented on several occasions to the Emergency Department with a severe pounding headache that initially responded well to treatment. She later developed signs consistent with meningoencephalitis along with altered mental status and neuropsychiatric changes. She was diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis after hospitalization. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is an under-recognized condition with diverse presentations. Recurrent headaches that improve with treatment may be an early sign of this disorder. Anti-NMDAR encephalitis should be considered in patients with recurrent undifferentiated headaches, and an appropriate work-up should be performed. Early recognition and diagnosis of this condition is critical to optimize favorable patient outcomes, as delays to diagnosis may lead to fatalities and long-term neurologic sequelae.

### Neuroleptic intolerance in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^8ddb30fc]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Encephalitis with anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antibodies (anti-NMDAR encephalitis) was first described in 2007 as a paraneoplastic syndrome in young women with ovarian teratoma, and it is now a widely recognized autoimmune synaptic disease. Anti-NMDAR encephalitis contributes to the novel links between immunology and psychiatry, especially in the developing area of autoimmune factors in classically conceived psychiatric diseases.

Since 2007, several studies have extensively described the clinical and neuropsychiatric presentations of the disease. It affects children and young adults, especially women, and is generally characterized by an association of psychotic symptoms, epilepsy, abnormal movements, and amnesia. Its psychiatric presentation generally precedes neurologic signs and symptoms, which explains why patients are often first hospitalized in psychiatric departments before being transferred to medical care units. Many publications even suggest the presence of an isolated psychiatric presentation, which may reduce the chances of a correct diagnosis and specific treatment. The prognosis seems to depend on the rapidity of the initiation of an immunomodulatory treatment. Thus, a more precise description of initial psychiatric symptoms may help physicians to consider this diagnosis, and look for anti-NMDAR antibodies. Thus, in order to improve early identification of anti-NMDAR encephalitis when patients have an initial psychiatric presentation, the aim of this retrospective study was to precisely describe the initial clinical signs and symptoms that led to hospitalization in a psychiatric department and the reasons underlying the exploration of anti-NMDAR encephalitis hypothesis.

### A patient with encephalitis associated with NMDA receptor antibodies [^d0fca6a6]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2007). Medium credibility.

Background

A 34-year-old woman presented with headache, feverish sensation and anxiety, rapidly followed by homicidal ideation, aggressive agitation, seizures, hypoventilation, hyperthermia and prominent autonomic instability requiring intubation and sedation. She developed episodes of hypotension and bradycardia with periods of asystole lasting up to 15 seconds. Upon weaning off sedation, her eyes opened but she was unresponsive to stimuli. There was muscle rigidity, frequent facial grimacing, rhythmic abdominal contractions, kicking motions of the legs, and intermittent dystonic postures of the right arm.

Investigations

Routine laboratory testing, toxicology screening, studies for autoimmune and infectious etiologies, brain MRI scan, lumbar puncture, electroencephalogram, whole-body CT scan, abdominal ultrasound, paraneoplastic and voltage-gated potassium channel antibody serologies, analysis of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies.

Diagnosis

Paraneoplastic encephalitis associated with immature teratoma of the ovary and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies.

Management

Intensive care, mechanical ventilation, antiepileptics, laparotomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy, corticosteroids, plasma exchange, intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide, physical therapy, and chemotherapy.

Conclusion

Malignant catatonia is a severe and life-threatening neuropsychiatric complication of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis that usually requires targeted treatment in addition to immune suppressive therapies. ECT was an effective and well-tolerated treatment of malignant catatonia in our patient and its use should be considered in children and adolescents with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis whose catatonia does not respond to immunosuppression and benzodiazepines.

### State of the art: acute encephalitis [^62e02a6c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Encephalitis is a devastating neurologic disease often complicated by prolonged neurologic deficits. Best practices for the management of adult patients include universal testing for a core group of etiologies, including herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, varicella zoster virus (VZV), enteroviruses, West Nile virus, and anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) antibody encephalitis. Empiric acyclovir therapy should be started at presentation and in selected cases continued until a second HSV-1 polymerase chain reaction test is negative. Acyclovir dose can be increased for VZV encephalitis. Supportive care is necessary for other viral etiologies. Patients in whom no cause for encephalitis is identified represent a particular challenge. Management includes repeat brain magnetic resonance imaging, imaging for occult malignancy, and empiric immunomodulatory treatment for autoimmune conditions. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) or brain biopsy should be considered. The rapid pace of discovery regarding autoimmune encephalitis and the development of advanced molecular tests such as NGS have improved diagnosis and outcomes. Research priorities include development of novel therapeutics.

### Use and safety of immunotherapeutic management of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibody encephalitis: a meta-analysis [^8e303a7f]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

This comprehensive and focused literature review on immunotherapy in NMDARE establishes a clear role for early immunotherapy and timely escalation to second-line treatment, particularly with rituximab. Importantly, we found that clinical factors that are associated with functional outcome often are not associated with relapsing disease biology. This should prompt important reevaluation of pragmatic treatment paradigms and physician preference to treat more severely affected patients more aggressively. Additionally, this synthesis of real-world data is an important means to direct relevant clinical and research questions, serving as the basis for the development of evidence-based optimal management and treatment guidelines of NMDARE.

### Critical care management of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis [^f300841d]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis is considered an immune-mediated form of encephalitis with paraneoplastic and nonparaneoplastic forms. Delay in recognition is common and patients typically present to the ICU without a diagnosis or with complications following a delayed diagnosis. The aim of this review is to provide a focused overview for the ICU clinician regarding presentation, diagnosis, and critical care management.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

PubMed database search with manual review of articles involving anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis.

Data Synthesis

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis is increasingly encountered in the ICU. The cascade of events initiating anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibody formation may involve an infectious trigger particularly in the setting of teratoma. Following a prodrome, most patients develop psychiatric symptoms followed by movement disorder. Classical, psychiatric, and catatonic phenotypes may be distinguished based on the presence and severity of symptoms. Early immunotherapy and low initial cerebrospinal fluid inflammation are independent predictors of positive outcomes in ICU patients. Concomitant organ failure, status epilepticus, and the identification of a tumor did not influence outcome in critically ill patients. Supportive care in the ICU includes management of various manifestations of dyskinesia, status epilepticus, autonomic disorders, and the need for general sedation. Common treatment strategies and limitations are discussed including the emerging role of bortezomib.

Conclusions

Intensivists should be familiar with the presentation and management of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis. Early diagnosis and immediate implementation of steroids, immunoglobulins, and/or plasmapheresis and immune therapy are associated with a good neurologic outcome although response may be delayed. The selection and timing of second-line immune therapy requires further study.

### International consensus recommendations for the treatment of pediatric NMDAR antibody encephalitis [^f63ff304]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

One of the greatest challenges is deciding the timing of escalation after 1 second-line therapy. There was consensus that in the patient failing to improve 1–3 months (generally > 6 weeks) following initiation of the first second-line immunotherapy, another second-line therapy such as cyclophosphamide if rituximab was used first can be considered.

In the patient who fails rituximab, cyclophosphamide is generally recommended as an escalation agent, although some members of the Panel have increasing interest in tocilizumab as an alternative escalation therapy due to a more favorable perceived safety profile. Other escalation treatments have been reported in the literature, such as IV/intrathecal methotrexate with intrathecal corticosteroids and subcutaneous/IV bortezomib; these have more limited evidence, but can be used according to the local treating center's expertise.

The patient who has severe disease and is failing to improve remains a major challenge. The clinician needs to balance the risk of severe disease (such as being on the intensive care unit) with the risk of treatment side effects, in the knowledge that NMDARE symptoms may take many weeks or months to improve. Indeed, unlike in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, when treatment often results in rapid improvements within days, in NMDARE, the improvements are slow and continue for ≥ 24 months after the acute phase. Therefore, allowing treatments to have their effect, including their combined actions, is important to avoid hasty therapeutic decisions. In general, second-line agents such as rituximab or cyclophosphamide should be given 1–3 months before making judgment on effect, with 6 weeks being a broadly accepted guideline. The timing of escalation is very challenging and influenced by severity, age, risk-benefit ratio, treating center's experience, and access to treatments. Overall, for patients in the intensive care unit, where there may be multiple additional risk factors, earlier escalation seems reasonable. Anecdotal reports from our expert group of benefit of treatment with rituximab or tocilizumab years after onset suggest that in the patient who continues to have major impairments, further immunotherapies are warranted within reason, although there are likely to be diminishing returns when treatment is used later in the disease course.

### Autoimmune encephalitis: proposed best practice recommendations for diagnosis and acute management [^3cf88906]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

When a second-line agent is used in the acute setting, it also serves as a bridging therapy to prevent early relapses that might happen if immunosuppression is abruptly discontinued. Prognostication and clinical severity tools are being developed to help select patients who would benefit from conventional and non-conventional second-line agents such as the anti-NMDAR Encephalitis 1-year Functional Status score and the Clinical Assessment Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis.

On the AEACN survey, 50% of responders indicated they would consider adding a second-line agent in the acute setting only if there was no response to more than one first-line agent, 32% indicated adding a second-line agent if there was no response to one first-line agent, while only 15% indicated using a second-line agent in the acute setting on all patients regardless of the response to first-line therapy. As for the preferred second-line agent, 80% of responders chose rituximab while only 10% chose cyclophosphamide in a clinical scenario with unknown antibodies and no clinical clues for aetiology.

Outcomes measures

The primary endpoint was the number of patients with relapse and the difference in the time to relapse, assessed in the intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary endpoints were as follows: (1) response rates, defined as the proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 1 point improvement in the mRS score within 4 weeks after randomisation; (2) the proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 2 point improvement in the mRS score within 4 weeks after randomisation; (3) the median time to achieve a 1-point improvement in the mRS score after randomisation; (4) the proportion of patients who reached a favourable outcome during 24 months of follow-up. A favourable functional outcome was defined as an mRS score of ≤ 2 and a poor functional outcome as an mRS score of > 2 at the last follow-up; (5) the duration of prednisone tapering; (6) the extent of NMDAR1-IgG reduction; (7) the proportion of patients need for rescue therapies; (8) the longitudinal profile of disease outcomes (change in scores of mRS, CASE, MFIS, MOCA and BD-II scale score at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24 months); (9) the proportion of patients achieving seizure freedom during the follow-up period.

Safety was assessed based on AEs reported by study participants or investigators. Safety outcomes comprised assessment of serious AEs — defined as hospitalisation for any reason — and AEs. The severity of AEs was evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (V.5.0). Serious AEs were adjudicated by the Event Committee. We also assessed the causal relation between AEs and the use of MMF or the study procedures. Relapses were considered severe AEs if they led to hospital admission for reasons beyond routine NMDARE treatment, such as requiring an extended treatment course or prolonged hospital stay.

### International consensus recommendations for the treatment of pediatric NMDAR antibody encephalitis [^7ac95f22]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To create an international consensus treatment recommendation for pediatric NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis (NMDARE).

Methods

After selection of a panel of 27 experts with representation from all continents, a 2-step Delphi method was adopted to develop consensus on relevant treatment regimens and statements, along with key definitions in pediatric NMDARE (disease severity, failure to improve, and relapse). Finally, an online face-to-face meeting was held to reach consensus (defined as ≥ 75% agreement).

Results

Corticosteroids are recommended in all children with NMDARE (pulsed IV preferred), with additional IV immunoglobulin or plasma exchange in severe patients. Prolonged first-line immunotherapy can be offered for up to 3–12 months (oral corticosteroids or monthly IV corticosteroids/immunoglobulin), dependent on disease severity. Second-line treatments are recommended for cases refractory to first-line therapies (rituximab preferred over cyclophosphamide) and should be considered about 2 weeks after first-line initiation. Further immunotherapies for refractory disease 1–3 months after second-line initiation include another second-line treatment (such as cyclophosphamide) and escalation to tocilizumab. Maintenance immune suppression beyond 6 months (such as rituximab redosing or mycophenolate mofetil) is generally not required, except for patients with a more severe course or prolonged impairments and hospitalization. For patients with relapsing disease, second-line and prolonged maintenance therapy should be considered. The treatment of NMDARE following herpes simplex encephalitis should be similar to idiopathic NMDARE. Broad guidance is provided for the total treatment duration (first line, second line, and maintenance), which is dictated by the severity and clinical course (i.e. median 3, 9 and 18 months in the best, average, and worst responders, respectively). Recommendations on the timing of oncologic searches are provided.

Conclusion

These international consensus recommendations for the management of pediatric NMDARE aim to standardize the treatment and provide practical guidance for clinicians, rather than absolute rules. A similar recommendation could be applicable to adult patients.

### Management of psychiatric symptoms in anti-NMDAR encephalitis: a case series, literature review and future directions [^6a770b07]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, formally recognized in 2007, has been increasingly identified as a significant cause of autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitis. Approximately 80% of the patients are females. The characteristic syndrome evolves in several stages, with approximately 70% of the patients presenting with a prodromal phase of fever, malaise, headache, upper respiratory tract symptoms, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Next, typically within two weeks, patients develop psychiatric symptoms including insomnia, delusions, hyperreligiosity, paranoia, hallucinations, apathy and depression. Catatonic symptoms, seizures, abnormal movements, autonomic instability, memory deficits may also develop during the course of the disease. Presence of antibodies against the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR in the CSF and serum confirm the diagnosis of NMDAR encephalitis, which also should prompt a thorough search for an underlying tumor. Age, gender, and ethnicity may all play a role, as black females older than 18 years of age have an increased likelihood of an underlying tumor. Treatment is focused on tumor resection and first-line immunotherapy [corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulin]. In non-responders, second- line immunotherapy [rituximab or cyclophosphamide or combined] is required. More than 75% of the patients recover completely or have mild sequelae, while the remaining patients end up demonstrating persistent severe disability or death. There is a paucity of literature on the management of psychiatric symptoms in this population. Given the neuropsychiatric symptoms in the relatively early phase of the illness, approximately 77% of the patients are first evaluated by a psychiatrist. Earlier recognition of this illness is of paramount importance as prompt diagnosis and treatment can potentially improve prognosis. We describe two patients diagnosed with NMDAR encephalitis presenting with two different psychiatric manifestations. The first patient presented with psychotic mania and catatonic symptoms, while the second suffered from depression with psychotic and catatonic features refractory to psychotropic medications. We review of the use of psychotropic medications and ECT to address insomnia, agitation, psychosis, mood dysregulation and catatonia in NMDAR encephalitis.

### Potential side effect of propofol and sevoflurane for anesthesia of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis [^8aff04c9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Many anesthetic drugs interact with the NMDA receptor and may therefore alter the clinical presentation of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis.

Case presentation

A 24-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for decreased consciousness and hyperthermia. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis, and elevated protein. Cultures were negative. Patient state worsened with agitation, facial dyskinesia, ocular deviation, and limb dystonia. Diagnosis of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis was evidenced by specific antibodies. High doses of methylprednisolone were administered. CT scan disclosed an ovarian teratoma and tumor resection was scheduled under anesthesia with propofol, sufentanil, atracurium and sevoflurane. Sedation after surgery was maintained with propofol. Rapidly after surgery, patient's condition deteriorated with increase of dyskinesias, and two tonic-clonic generalized seizure events.

Conclusion

In patients with anti-NMDA-R encephalitis, anesthesia using benzodiazepines, opiates and curares, which fail to interfere with the NMDA pathway, should be preferred.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^6591f0f8]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

In terms of neurophysiology, there is a clear case for an electroencephalogram (EEG) in the context of possible non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), which can present as catatonia. Red flags for NCSE include subtle ictal phenomena (such as twitching of the face or extremities), comorbid neurological disease and a change in medications that affect seizure threshold. Another quite specific EEG finding of relevance to catatonia is the extreme delta brush, which occurs in some patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. The literature on the value of 'encephalopathic' findings on EEGs suggests that this is not entirely specific for a medical disorder underlying catatonia.

Any hospital work-up must weigh the potential risks and benefits of detailed investigation. Hospital investigations may contribute to anxiety. Given that several studies have associated catatonia with intense anxiety, prolonged uncertainty amid medical testing may be expected to worsen this in some patients. In addition, the costs and potential harms of investigation (e.g. radiation exposure with computed tomography (CT) imaging, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in patients who are unable to communicate whether they have any metallic implants) must be considered.

Recommendations on the use of investigations in catatonia

Investigations, such as blood tests, urine drug screen, lumbar puncture, electroencephalography and neuroimaging, should be considered based on history and examination findings, taking into account the possible diagnoses that may mimic catatonia and the possible underlying aetiology of the catatonia. (D)
In patients experiencing a first episode of catatonia or where the diagnosis underlying catatonia is unclear, consider a CT or MRI scan of the brain. (C)
In patients experiencing a first episode of catatonia or where the diagnosis underlying catatonia is unclear, consider assessing for the presence of antibodies to the NMDA receptor and other relevant autoantibodies in serum and CSF. (D)
In patients with risk factors for seizures, possible evidence of a seizure or possible encephalitis, consider performing an EEG (with continuous monitoring if available). (C)

### Clinical case of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis in an 8-month-old patient with hyperkinetic movement disorder [^2c905d85]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

This article describes an 8-month-old boy with the full clinical spectrum anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis. He was admitted to the hospital with involuntary orofacial head movements, behavioral changes, and fluctuation in consciousness. His examination showed tongue thrusting, decreased responsiveness, and hypotonia without fever. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed increased protein levels (62 mg/dL). The next day he developed oral dyskinesia and choreoathetosis. Video-electroencephalogram polygraphy showed coreo-dystonic movements without electrographic correlation. A putative diagnosis of autoimmune encephalopathy was made, and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone was started, with improvement in the abnormal movements. Antibodies to the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor were identified in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood. He began receiving immunoglobulin once a month for a year. Two months after the treatment had started, the involuntary movement disappeared and his development has been normal. N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis is a recently identified disorder. This is the youngest case reported. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important to obtain full recovery.

### Treatment and prognostic factors for long-term outcome in patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis: an observational cohort study [^ec2cc09b]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is an autoimmune disorder in which the use of immunotherapy and the long-term outcome have not been defined. We aimed to assess the presentation of the disease, the spectrum of symptoms, immunotherapies used, timing of improvement, and long-term outcome.

Methods

In this multi-institutional observational study, we tested for the presence of NMDAR antibodies in serum or CSF samples of patients with encephalitis between Jan 1, 2007, and Jan 1, 2012. All patients who tested positive for NMDAR antibodies were included in the study; patients were assessed at symptom onset and at months 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24, by use of the modified Rankin scale (mRS). Treatment included first-line immunotherapy (steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis), second-line immunotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide), and tumour removal. Predictors of outcome were determined at the Universities of Pennsylvania (PA, USA) and Barcelona (Spain) by use of a generalised linear mixed model with binary distribution.

Results

We enrolled 577 patients (median age 21 years, range 8 months to 85 years), 211 of whom were children (< 18 years). Treatment effects and outcome were assessable in 501 (median follow-up 24 months, range 4–186): 472 (94%) underwent first-line immunotherapy or tumour removal, resulting in improvement within 4 weeks in 251 (53%). Of 221 patients who did not improve with first-line treatment, 125 (57%) received second-line immunotherapy that resulted in a better outcome (mRS 0–2) than those who did not (odds ratio [OR] 2.69, CI 1.24–5.80; p = 0.012). During the first 24 months, 394 of 501 patients achieved a good outcome (mRS 0–2; median 6 months, IQR 2–12) and 30 died. At 24 months' follow-up, 203 (81%) of 252 patients had good outcome. Outcomes continued to improve for up to 18 months after symptom onset. Predictors of good outcome were early treatment (0.62, 0.50–0.76; p < 0.0001) and no admission to an intensive care unit (0.12, 0.06–0.22; p < 0.0001). 45 patients had one or multiple relapses (representing a 12% risk within 2 years); 46 (67%) of 69 relapses were less severe than initial episodes (p < 0.0001). In 177 children, predictors of good outcome and the magnitude of effect of second-line immunotherapy were similar to those of the entire cohort.

Interpretation

Most patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis respond to immunotherapy. Second-line immunotherapy is usually effective when first-line treatments fail. In this cohort, the recovery of some patients took up to 18 months.

### Does early treatment improve outcomes in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis? [^146acfba]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is a treatable cause of autoimmune encephalitis in both children and adults. It is still unclear if the natural history of the condition in children is altered by early treatment with immunosuppressive therapy. We looked at the outcomes of five children (two males, three females; mean age 6y 9mo, range 4-8y) who were treated empirically for autoimmune encephalitis within a brief period of presentation. Features that led clinicians to suspect autoimmune encephalitis included prominent neuropsychiatric features, movement disorder, seizures, and dysautonomic features. Immunosuppressive therapy was carried out in all cases. In this series of children, in whom the median time from symptom onset to treatment was 5 days and median length of time for follow-up was 24 months, four out of the five (80%) recovered to their baseline. Early initiation of immunosuppressive therapy may result in improved clinical outcomes.

### Pregnancy outcome in anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis [^8542251c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is an autoimmune disorder resulting in neurologic and psychiatric symptoms. Treatment is challenging in pregnancy, because little data exist to guide management.

Case

A 24-year-old woman with a known diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis using intravenous immunoglobulin therapy became pregnant. Her pregnancy was uncomplicated with no relapses. She delivered at 35 4/7 weeks of gestation after having preterm premature rupture of membranes. She had a relapse of symptoms after delivery.

Conclusion

This patient with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis had an uneventful pregnancy with overall good outcome; however, she experienced relapse soon after delivery. This disease may mimic other autoimmune diseases, with improvement during pregnancy and risk for relapse postpartum.

### International consensus recommendations for the treatment of pediatric NMDAR antibody encephalitis [^6fabe3b0]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

There was agreement in the need for a more aggressive and prolonged treatment approach in patients with relapsing disease (Table 3, 3.1), with a lower threshold for second-line and maintenance treatments (rituximab or mycophenolate) and more prolonged overall immunotherapy duration. Indeed, the median overall duration of immunotherapy at first event of pediatric NMDARE was recommended to be about 3 months (IQR 3–6 months) in the best responders, 9 months (IQR 6–12 months) in the average responders, 18 months (IQR 12–24 months) in the poorest responders (Table 2, 2.5), and 12–24 months after a relapse, acknowledging patient severity and management variables (Table 3, 3.1). We acknowledge that the definition of "best", "average", and "poorest" is dependent on experience of the clinician; therefore, some guidance is provided in Table 5.

Although not the focus of this work, the Panel acknowledges that infectious risk mitigation strategies are key to ensure the patients' safety while receiving immunotherapy, especially close monitoring for infections and adherence to hospital infection control protocols to prevent hospital acquired infection. In selected patients on prolonged high-dose corticosteroids, multiple second-line or escalation immunotherapies, prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia may be required. In patients with low IgG levels and recurrent infections despite prophylactic antibiotics, immunoglobulin supplementation may be required.

As regards patients with relapse of neurologic symptoms after HSE (Table 3, 3.2), acyclovir should be administered promptly until HSE recurrence is excluded, while maintaining a high index of suspicion for an underlying autoimmune etiology. The Panel agreed that if autoimmune encephalitis is confirmed after HSE, immunotherapy should be used in a similar way to idiopathic/naive NMDARE. e9, e10

### Use and safety of immunotherapeutic management of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibody encephalitis: a meta-analysis [^d6652329]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Methods

A systematic search in PubMed was conducted from inception to January 1, 2019 (M.N.), with the following search keys: (anti–N-methyl — aspartate receptor encephalitis) OR (N-methyl — aspartate antibody encephalitis) OR (anti-NMDAR encephalitis) OR (anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis) OR (NMDA receptor encephalitis) OR (anti-N-methyl — aspartate receptor antibody encephalitis). Publications were eligible if they (1) included patients with NMDARE with positive NMDAR antibodies in serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and (2) provided individual patient data on immunotherapy. Patients with NMDARE preceded by central nervous system infection (ie, herpes simplex virus encephalitis) and large cohorts where individual patient details were not availablewere omitted. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline.

### Clinical presentation… [^97b3ab98]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Both generations of antipsychotics can produce extrapyramidal symptoms of pseudoparkinsonism, akathisia, and dystonia. First-generation antipsychotics, which are comprised of typical antipsychotics phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones, are more likely than second-generation antipsychotics to contribute to developing these conditions. Antihistamines, nonselective beta blockers, or benzodiazepines are used to treat symptoms. 20 Tardive dyskinesia, characterized by repetitive, jerking movements that occur in the face, neck, and tongue, is another adverse effect of first- and second-generation antipsychotics. It is more common in older female patients with diabetes mellitus. TREATMENT-RESISTANT SCHIZOPHRENIA Treatment-resistant schizophrenia is the persistence of significant symptoms despite adequate pharmacologic treatment.

26 To determine severity of symptoms and response to treatment, physicians can use validated scoring scales. 26, 43 Higher scores are indicative of treatment-resistant schizophrenia and should encourage a goal-oriented discussion of escalation of therapy and evaluation of psychosocial interventions. The scales should not be used for diagnostic purposes. In the United States, clozapine has an FDA boxed warning highlighting the risk of severe neutropenia, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, seizures, and profound hypotension. Clozapine requires additional training and enrollment in the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program. 49 Factors contributing to increased mortality include concomitant psychiatric disorders, substance use disorders, and suicide.

50 However, most deaths are related to an increased rate of cardiovascular disease with concomitant renal disease, respiratory diseases, stroke, cancer, and thromboembolic events. 50 People with schizophrenia should be screened by a primary care physician for cardiovascular disease and receive at least annual metabolic screening and counseling with interventions to prevent weight gain and attempt to mitigate other factors that could contribute to their overall health, such as smoking. This article updates previous articles on this topic by Schultz, et al., 54 and Holder and Wayhs. 18.

### International consensus recommendations for the treatment of pediatric NMDAR antibody encephalitis [^94b5bf44]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although not the main aim of this consensus document, the Panel acknowledged that adequate rehabilitation after the acute phase of NMDARE is essential and may improve outcomes. We strongly support the need for rehabilitation to be provided in a center familiar with rehabilitating young people with acquired brain injury such as encephalitis or traumatic brain injury, acknowledging that improvements may continue for up to 24 months. Rehabilitation often includes focus on cognitive and behavioral problems (including executive dysfunction and fatigue) post-NMDARE.

In view of the relative rarity of this condition, any recommendation or guideline for the treatment of pediatric NMDARE is inevitably based on limited evidence; therefore, this document should be intended as a recommendation meant to provide guidance rather than absolute rules, and it should not be used to prevent access to therapies if these are recommended by a patient's physician. Moreover, by putting together international experts from very different settings, the present work highlighted heterogeneity in the management of this condition. The differences stimulated discussion and reflection, and there was still consensus around most aspects of pediatric NMDARE treatment. Although the experts included people with broad international expertise, the opinions remain vulnerable to anecdote and potential bias related to referral of complicated or atypical patients.

Despite these limitations, we strove to create an international consensus-based recommendation aimed at supporting the clinician in the treatment of pediatric NMDARE, with a dedicated global approach for all health care settings. We hope that with the aid of recently released diagnostic criteria, the present treatment recommendation may contribute to a more systematic approach, resulting in more comparable data internationally, which may generate better quality evidence. Nonetheless, there are still major unresolved issues, which should represent the focus of future research.

### Autoantibodies against N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 in health and disease [^4a4e8b01]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Along these lines and enlightening for clinicians, no appreciable differences were extracted by comparing NMDAR1-AB+ and NMDAR1-AB− encephalitis cases, except for typical NMDAR antagonistic (ketamine-like) symptoms. CSF analysis, EEG monitoring, MRI scanning, accompanying tumor frequency and outcomes were not different. These findings would support that 'anti-NMDA encephalitis' is not a separate condition, but marks any type of encephalitis in which the highly prevalent NMDAR1-AB happen to be present, are boosted, and dramatically shape the clinical picture. Dependent on the circumstances, namely absence or presence of an underlying brain inflammation, NMDAR1-AB may contribute to chronic processes (dementia, psychosis, epilepsy of unknown cause, personality changes) or fulminant courses ('anti-NMDAR encephalitis'), provided access to the brain (BBB dysfunction or intrathecal synthesis). The prodromal phase of many encephalitides is 'infectious-like', and infections cannot easily be excluded by routine analyses. Later symptoms may be 'ketamine-like' due to the presence of NMDAR1-AB among many other brain antigen-directed AB. The underlying condition finally determines the highly variable clinical and pathological picture, namely further symptoms, diagnostic readouts (EEG, MRI, CSF/blood parameters), treatment response, outcome and autopsy findings. It may be problematic if the search for causes stops after detection of NMDAR1-AB (IgG). We note, however, that in most cases, 'polypragmatic' treatment anyhow includes antibiotics, antiviral compounds and corticosteroids/immunosuppressants on top of a wide range of supporting measures.

### An updated, comprehensive meta-analysis of the treatment of anti-NMDAR encephalitis: analysis, equipoise, and the urgent need for evidence over anecdote [^d5b7fe35]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There are no FDA-approved treatments for anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARE), and no prospective, multicenter clinical trials have been completed to provide evidence for management of this disease. We evaluated changes in treatment strategies and outcomes since the previous comprehensive review in 2019.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed capturing manuscripts published from January 2019 through March 2024. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from articles containing individual immunotherapy data in NMDARE and were compared to a previously published literature review. Studies with ≥ 10 cases, ≥ 6 months follow-up, and outcomes reported as favorable (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0–2) and poor (mRS 3–5 or 3–6), were grouped and summarized by diagnosis period.

Results

Among 649 patients from 321 articles, first- (from 91.3% to 98.3%, p < 0.001) and second-line (from 31.8% to 42.5%, p < 0.001) immunotherapy use has increased. The proportion of patients receiving immunotherapy within 30 days of symptom onset increased from 50.1% to 72.5% (p < 0.001). Favorable outcome (mRS 0–2) increased from 71.5% to 76.7% (p = 0.024), while mortality (6.3% to 6.9%, p = 0.714) and relapse rates (12.6% vs. 13.2%, p = 0.789) remained unchanged. Data from larger cohort studies of patients diagnosed with NMDARE after 2013 have reported wide variability in the proportion of patients achieving a favorable outcome at final follow-up, ranging from 56% to 93%, depending on the institution and follow-up duration.

Conclusions

Since 2019, more patients have been treated early with first- and second-line immunotherapies. Functional outcomes have shown modest improvements, whereas mortality and relapse rates have remained unchanged.

### Neuroleptic intolerance in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^104dc2eb]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Among the 21 patients transferred for suspicion of antipsychotic intolerance (table 2), 18 (86%) had a temperature above 38.5°C associated with decreased alertness (n = 9), coma (n = 2), catatonia (n = 3), or muscular rigidity (n = 6). For all of these patients, documented evidence showed that antipsychotic drugs were administered hours or days before the emergent high temperature, suggesting neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Biological data were available in 13 patients (table 2). Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level was available for 10 patients and suggested rhabdomyolysis (CPK > 1,000 UI/L) in 7 patients (range 105–4,495 UI/L, median 1,513 UI/L, n = 15–130 UI/L). Serum sodium was available for 10 patients and 7 patients had hypernatremia (Na + 133–160 mEq/L, median 148 mEq/L, n = 135–145 mEq/L). Leukocyte count was available in 10 patients, and elevated in all patients, without evidence of infection (leukocytes 12–23 G/L, median 14.9 G/L, n = 4–10 G/L). Antipsychotic drugs were either first-generation (loxapine, cyamemazine, levomepromazine, zuclopenthixol, haloperidol) or second-generation (risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole), with 7 patients receiving drugs from both generations simultaneously. We did not identify any differences in the tolerance between first- and second-generation antipsychotics. Three other patients were transferred with a suspicion of NMS: 2 with hypothermia (33°C and 30.5°C, respectively), and 1 with a significantly disturbed level of vigilance (table 2). In the entire series, patients who received antipsychotic drugs developed fever more frequently than patients who did not (19 of 36 patients [53%] vs 11 of 75 patients [15%], p < 0.0001; Fisher exact test).

### Refractory anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in early pregnancy: a case report of treatment course and pregnancy outcomes [^bca26dd3]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Anti-N-methyl-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis classically affects women of childbearing age, producing a disproportionate number of pregnant women with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The typical presentation includes progressive neuropsychiatric symptoms, seizures, and alterations in consciousness, all of which present potential risks to the fetus. First-line and second-line treatments similarly pose teratogenic potential; therefore, randomized studies with supportive data on pregnancy and fetal outcomes are lacking.

Methods

We present a case of refractory anti-NMDAR encephalitis during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy with the successful use of rituximab and cyclophosphamide and resultant healthy pregnancy.

Results

The patient was treated with an escalating immunotherapy regimen from 11 to 15 weeks of gestation, including steroids, plasma exchange, IV immunoglobulins, and rituximab, with no clinical response. At 16 weeks of gestation, she received cyclophosphamide with clinical improvement after 4 weeks. She subsequently gave birth to a healthy, term baby boy, who continued to do well at the follow-up.

Discussion

This case illustrates the effective use of cyclophosphamide in the second trimester of pregnancy for anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The use of second-line therapies remains an individualized decision because the relative risk-to-benefit ratio in pregnant women is incompletely understood.

### Autoimmune encephalitis: proposed best practice recommendations for diagnosis and acute management [^434c45f1]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

The objective of this paper is to evaluate available evidence for each step in autoimmune encephalitis management and provide expert opinion when evidence is lacking. The paper approaches autoimmune encephalitis as a broad category rather than focusing on individual antibody syndromes. Core authors from the Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance Clinicians Network reviewed literature and developed the first draft. Where evidence was lacking or controversial, an electronic survey was distributed to all members to solicit individual responses. Sixty-eight members from 17 countries answered the survey. Corticosteroids alone or combined with other agents (intravenous IG or plasmapheresis) were selected as a first-line therapy by 84% of responders for patients with a general presentation, 74% for patients presenting with faciobrachial dystonic seizures, 63% for NMDAR-IgG encephalitis and 48.5% for classical paraneoplastic encephalitis. Half the responders indicated they would add a second-line agent only if there was no response to more than one first-line agent, 32% indicated adding a second-line agent if there was no response to one first-line agent, while only 15% indicated using a second-line agent in all patients. As for the preferred second-line agent, 80% of responders chose rituximab while only 10% chose cyclophosphamide in a clinical scenario with unknown antibodies. Detailed survey results are presented in the manuscript and a summary of the diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations is presented at the conclusion.

### Neuroleptic intolerance in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^4e93826f]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Overall, our data show, as suggested by other authors, that psychiatric presentations in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis are heterogeneous, with several different psychiatric signs, symptoms, or syndromes with no psychiatric clinical characteristics specific to anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

Our results also outline that emergency physicians, neurologists, and psychiatrists must systematically search for associated discreet neurologic signs and symptoms relevant to encephalitis in young patients with psychiatric symptoms. Indeed, more than half (n = 24) of the 45 patients hospitalized in psychiatric departments had neurologic signs at the first evaluation. Despite the presence of these comorbid elements, the patients were not correctly diagnosed or hospitalized in an appropriate unit and did not receive the medical investigations required for diagnosis of encephalitis. Many patients had a normal neuroimaging, which was misinterpreted to support a primary psychiatric etiology of symptoms and signs, but neuroimaging is frequently normal in anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

An interesting observation was the very high rate of possible antipsychotic drug intolerance in our series. Some previous publications have reported a similar phenomenon in a few case reports, but the extremely high rate in our cohort is unprecedented. In several medical records, psychiatrists had diagnosed NMS or malignant catatonia, which are extremely rare conditions that are reported in fewer than 0.1% of patients hospitalized in psychiatric institutions. In particular, it should be stressed that one patient presented with 3 previous psychiatric episodes, separated by many years, and for each episode, she had experienced severe intolerance to antipsychotic drugs.

DSM-5and DSM-IVdo not provide an exact list of criteria for NMS, and we did not have enough information on the 21 patients to strictly confirm the diagnosis of NMS, but the significantly high rate of fever with abnormal biological data in our patients receiving antipsychotic drugs and the absence of such clinical presentation in the group of patients who were not treated with antipsychotic drugs suggests the existence of a pathophysiologic overlap between NMS, malignant catatonia, and anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

### Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis: an etiology worth considering in the differential diagnosis of delirium [^b2dd2271]. Clinical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Medical toxicologists are frequently consulted when young patients present with delirium attributed to suspected poisoning. Medical toxicologists should be aware of non-toxicological mimics of delirium. We describe two patients ultimately diagnosed with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis for which a toxicological consultation was requested to evaluate for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).

Case 1

A 21 year old male was sent from a psychiatric facility for new, worsening psychotic symptoms. He had autonomic instability, confusion, and hyper-reflexia. He was treated for NMS without improvement, and after an extensive workup was unrevealing, he was discharged home with significant cognitive dysfunction. Stored CSF later tested positive for anti-NMDAR antibodies.

Case 2

A 27 year old female was sent from a psychiatric facility for a seizure and new psychiatric symptoms. She was agitated and had violent, alternating extremity flexion and extension along with autonomic instability. She was treated for NMS, rhabdomyolysis, and rabies before analysis of CSF demonstrated anti-NMDAR antibodies. Treatment included surgical resection of a suspicious ovarian cyst, steroids and IVIG, with moderate improvement.

Discussion

Autoimmune syndromes of the central nervous system result from receptor dysfunction after an antibody response to extracellular or intracellular antigens, such as subunits of the NMDA receptor. The NMDA subunits NR2b and NR2a, in addition to the N-terminal region of the glycine binding NR1 subunit, have been implicated. Typical features such as memory loss, movement disorders, and hallucinations reflect the density and distribution of neuronal NDMA receptors. As young people, particularly young women, are predominantly affected, initial symptoms may be attributed to encephalopathy from drug abuse or schizophrenia. Toxicologists may be consulted as many features mimic NMS. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid can be checked for anti-NMDAR antibodies as part of a paraneoplastic or meningioencephalitis panel. Effective treatments have been described and include surgical resection and immunosuppressive medications.

### Long-term maintenance of mycophenolate mofetil in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (LEARN): a multicentre, open-label, blinded-endpoint, randomised controlled trial [^6da21e08]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, MMF typically exhibits a delayed onset of action, often requiring weeks to months to achieve significant therapeutic effects. In contrast, cyclophosphamide can start showing effects within days to weeks due to its potent immunomodulatory action, while rituximab typically induces B-cell depletion within 2–4 weeks after a single intravenous infusion. Thus, for patients with NMDARE with highly active disease or at the acute phase of relapse, rituximab and cyclophosphamide might be more beneficial to rapidly control disease activity. In contrast, MMF's advantages lie in its ability to maintain long-term disease stability and prevent relapse, making it more suited for maintenance therapy rather than acute intervention.

In our study, 98.0% of MMF+ and 89.7% of MMF− patients had attained favourable neurological functional outcomes (mRS of 0–2) at 24 months follow-up. Compared with Western countries, where general favourable clinical outcomes (mRS score ≤ 2) at 70–96 months range from 71% to 78.6%. We speculate two reasons account for this discrepancy: (1) we excluded patients with severe infections, the presence of tumour and overlapping neuronal surface or intracellular autoantibodies, which were previously reported to be related to disease severity and clinical outcomes;(2) in our prospective cohort, all patients with relapse received timely and aggressive rescue immunotherapies; (3) over 80% of patients at new disease onset in our study received timely treatment (timely treatment was defined as the initiation of immunotherapy within 30 days of onset) as compared with 40% delayed treatment in previous studies. As reported from previous and our studies, delayed immunotherapies at onset are a significant risk factor for long-term relapse and worse functional outcomes.

Previous studies have shown that NMDARE is associated with fatigue and persistent cognitive and neuropsychological symptomswhich from the patient's perspective can be of greater concern than simply mRS improvement. This trial incorporated the use of validated questionnaires to assess depressive, cognitive, fatigue and seizure symptoms. Nearly all patients (96 of 100 (96%)) completed the questionnaires at follow-up points. Over 24 months of follow-up, patients who received MMF reported lower levels of fatigue and depressive symptoms. We found no evidence of differences between the groups in cognitive disorder after 6 months by using MOCA cognitive assessment, possible reasons included the sensitivity and specificity of MOCA assessment being unstable under different circumstances. To better assess and detect prolonged cognitive deficits, using a more detailed evaluation such as Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test or Wechsler Memory Scale is necessary for further study.

### Use of propofol to control refractory involuntary movements [^c49a647a]. Neurocritical Care (2004). Low credibility.

The authors report the first case of propofol use for the control of non-epileptic involuntary movements in a patient with postviral encephalitis. The withdrawal from propofol was associated with re-emergence of involuntary movements. The patient was maintained on propofol infusion for 6 months while a series of medications were used in an attempt to control the movements. The movements were finally controlled with high doses of phenobarbital, diazepam, and olanzapine, and the propofol was slowly weaned.

### Evaluation of the diagnostic criteria for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in Japanese children [^94cec9ae]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the validity of the 2016 clinical diagnostic criteria proposed for probable anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis in children, we tested the criteria in a Japanese pediatric cohort.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed clinical information of patients with neurologic symptoms whose CSF was analyzed for NMDAR antibodies (NMDAR-Abs) in our laboratory from January 1, 2015, to March 31, 2019.

Results

Overall, 137 cases were included. Of the 41 cases diagnosed as probable anti-NMDAR encephalitis (criteria-positive) according to the 2016 criteria, 13 were positive and 28 were negative for anti-NMDAR-Abs. Of the 96 criteria-negative cases, 3 were positive and 93 were negative for anti-NMDAR-Abs. The sensitivity of the criteria was 81.2%, specificity was 76.9%, positive predictive value (PPV) was 31.7%, and negative predictive value was 96.9%. Compared with the true-positive group, the false-positive group contained more male than female patients (male:female, 4:9 in the true-positive vs 19:9 in the false-positive group, p = 0.0425). The majority of the cases with false-positive diagnoses were associated with neurologic autoimmunity.

Conclusion

The clinical diagnostic criteria are reliable for deciding to start immunomodulatory therapy in the criteria-positive cases. Low PPV may be caused by a lower prevalence of NMDAR encephalitis or lower level of suspicion for encephalitis in the pediatric population. Physicians should therefore continue differential diagnosis, focusing especially on other forms of encephalitis.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class IV evidence that the proposed diagnostic criteria for anti-NMDAR encephalitis in children has a sensitivity of 81.2% and a specificity of 76.9%.

### Arterial spin labeling changes parallel asymmetric perisylvian and perirolandic symptoms in 3 pediatric cases of anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^e80c41a2]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Patient 1

A previously healthy, developmentally typical 12-year-old right-handed male patient presented with new-onset focal seizure. A few weeks before the acute presentation, he had been exhibiting progressive, subtle changes in cognitive ability and personality. Three days before the seizure, he complained of numbness and paresthesia affecting his right hand and arm, which rapidly spread to involve the leg and trunk. The seizure was seemingly unprovoked and consisted of right focal motor onset with secondary generalization. He was evaluated in the ED and found to have a normal examination after recovering from the postictal state. He was discharged with antiseizure medication (ASM) prophylaxis and neurology referral for suspected new-onset focal epilepsy. He returned to the hospital 2 days later because of worsening speech difficulties since the seizure onset, consistent with nonfluent expressive aphasia. He was transferred emergently to our tertiary hospital for evaluation of possible stroke because of the right-sided weakness, expressive aphasia, and difficulty swallowing. Rapid stroke protocol MRI showed normal parenchymal signal without diffusion restriction. However, the ASL perfusion sequence confirmed hyperperfusion of the left superior, middle and inferior frontal gyri, perirolandic cortex medially, perisylvian region including the frontal operculum, superior parietal lobule more so than inferior parietal lobule, mild right perirolandic, perisylvian, mesial temporal, superior parietal lobule, and bilateral insula (Figure). He was subsequently admitted to the ICU on continuous video EEG monitoring which captured 2 brief focal seizures with left temporal onset, as well as superimposed left frontal, temporal, and central delta slowing. Seizures resolved with ASM boluses and titration of maintenance doses. Lumbar puncture confirmed inflammatory CSF parameters with negative infectious testing. Serum and CSF titers for anti-NMDA receptor antibody both resulted positive (Table), confirming the diagnosis of NMDAR AE. He was treated with IV methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/d for 5 days), IVIG (2 g/kg over 4 days), and rituximab (2 doses of 500 mg/m² 2 weeks apart). He exhibited modest improvement in symptoms at the time of discharge at day 13 of symptom onset, although he still had residual dysarthria, oral motor apraxia, and disinhibited behaviors. He continued IVIG (1 g/kg) monthly for 4 months after discharge and demonstrated steady improvement in neurologic and psychological deficits without any notable persistent symptoms. He was ultimately able to wean off all ASMs without seizure recurrence. At the most recent follow-up visit (2 years after initial presentation), parents noted that he was doing well in regular grade-level classroom and extracurricular activities without limitations.

### Development of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in a patient with multiple sclerosis [^599a1d38]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is mediated by immunoglobulin G antibodies targeting the GluN1 subunit of the glutamate NMDA receptor. It is primarily associated with ovarian teratomas and sporadic herpes simplex encephalitis. However, the underlying neuroimmunological mechanisms linking autoimmune encephalitis to demyelinating diseases remain unclear. Proposed theories include T-cell autoreactivity, genetic predisposition, pro-inflammatory cytokines and microbiota influences, which may help explain the pathogenic overlap of these distinct disorders in the future. Several cases of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis have been reported in association with MOGAD and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. While MS is no exception, only a handful of documented cases support the growing recognition of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis coexisting with MS. A study by Zhang et al identified only 15 MS cases among 79 demyelinating disease patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in a PubMed database review. Psychiatric symptoms are key to early recognition, especially in MS patients, as demonstrated in case studies by Suleman and Javed, Gulec et al and Chahal et al. These symptoms appear in 83% of anti-NMDA encephalitis cases and often accompany cognitive dysfunction. However, cognitive dysfunction alone may be misinterpreted as MS progression or relapse, delaying proper diagnosis and treatment. Fleischmann et al described a woman with RRMS initially misdiagnosed with an MS relapse owing to cognitive impairment and refractory therapeutic response. Her correct diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was only made years after progressive cognitive decline and re-examination of previously obtained CSF samples, resulting in a poor prognosis despite temporary stabilisation with immunosuppressive therapy. According to Dalmau et al, a definitive diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis necessitates IgG GluN1 antibodies and at least one major symptom. In our case, diagnosis was confirmed through the presence of IgG GluN1 antibodies in the CSF — known to be more sensitive than serum testingalong with cognitive dysfunction, speech reduction and a subsequent decline in consciousness, meeting the criteria for definite anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Hummert et al found a correlation between IgG GluN1 titers and clinical severity; however, despite severe symptoms, our patient exhibited a low IgG GluN1 titre, likely owing to prior first-line therapy administration. CSF NMDA receptor antibodies demonstrate high specificity for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. A study involving 431 patients (including 412 with paired serum and CSF samples) found no cases where antibodies were exclusively present in serum. However, diagnosis should not rely solely on antibody presence; fulfilling clinical criteria remains essential. The IgG subclass is highly specific compared with less reliable IgA or IgM antibodies. In a study of 240 patients with conditions such as stroke, dementia and schizophrenia, 11 had IgA, IgM or both, but none had serum IgG NMDA receptor antibodies. Live neuron cultures showed that all 40 serum samples with IgG NMDA receptor antibodies exhibited cell surface reactivity, compared with only three samples with IgM and one with IgA, underscoring IgG's pathognomonic role. Experimental studies further suggest that while IgG NMDA receptor 1 antibodies do not induce brain inflammation, they can trigger psychosis-like symptoms. Although anti-NMDA receptor antibodies can be detected in both serum and CSF, CSF testing is crucial to avoid false-positive and false-negative results. Low serum titres have been reported in individuals without anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis or immune-mediated CNS disorders. Many laboratories use commercially available HEK cell-based assays that co-express GluN1/GluN2 subunits, which can yield inaccurate results. For instance, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and neurocognitive impairment may produce antibodies against the GluN2 subunit, leading to false positives. An indirect immunofluorescence assay targeting the GluN1 subunit in CSF is recommended, though indeterminate results may still occur. In uncertain cases, specialised in-house cell-based assays provide greater specificity but require expertise for accurate interpretation. The breakdown of blood-brain barrier integrity, a known feature of MS demonstrated in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models, may explain how GluN1 antibodies infiltrate the CNS. Acting as NMDA receptor antagonists, these antibodies contribute to the characteristic clinical features of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Given the high mortality rate of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, clinicians should emphasise the importance of recognising severe cognitive symptoms in patients with MS, particularly those with fulminant disease that remains refractory to treatment. Above all, fluctuations in mental status, rapid cognitive decline, verbal reduction and dysautonomia should be considered atypical for MS relapse. These indications can facilitate the timely identification of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.
