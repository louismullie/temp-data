## Question

10. There are five cards in a box, marked with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively. Three cards are drawn without replacement, and the probability that the largest one is 4 is:
(A) [1/10]
(B) [1/5]
(C) [3/10]
(D) [2/5]
(E) [1/2]

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the probability that the largest card drawn is 4 when three cards are drawn without replacement from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total number of possible 3-card draws. Then, I should identify which draws satisfy the condition that the maximum value is exactly 4. Next, I will count the favorable outcomes carefully, making sure I don't overcount or miss cases. Finally, I will compute the probability and double-check the arithmetic against the answer choices.

> Let me first confirm the total number of possible outcomes. Drawing 3 cards from 5 without replacement is a combination problem, so the total number of unordered samples is C(5, 3) = 10, which I should verify mentally: 5!/(3!2!) = (5×4)/(2×1) = 10. Yes, that's correct.

> Now, I need to think about which draws have a maximum of exactly 4. Wait, let me verify the constraint: the largest card must be 4, which means 4 must be in the hand, and the other two cards must be chosen from the numbers strictly less than 4, i.e., from {1, 2, 3}. I should confirm that I'm not allowing 5 to appear, because that would make the maximum 5 instead of 4. So, I need to choose 2 cards from {1, 2, 3} and include 4, which gives C(3, 2) = 3 favorable combinations. Hold on, I should list them to be sure: {1, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4}, and {2, 3, 4}. Yes, that's 3 favorable outcomes.

> I will now examine the probability calculation. Probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, so 3 divided by 10 equals 0.3, which is 3/10. Let me double-check the arithmetic: 3 ÷ 10 = 0.3, and 3/10 is indeed one of the options. Therefore, the correct answer is C, 3/10.

The probability that the largest card drawn is 4 is **3/10**. This is because the largest card being 4 means the other two cards must be from {1, 2, 3} (i.e. less than 4), and there are C(3, 2) = 3 such combinations. With C(5, 3) = 10 total possible draws, the probability is 3/10.

---

## Total number of possible outcomes

The total number of ways to draw 3 cards from 5 without replacement is given by the combination formula:

Total outcomes = C(5, 3) = [5!/(3!(5−3)!)] = 10

---

## Favorable outcomes

For the largest card to be 4, the other two cards must be from {1, 2, 3}. The number of ways to choose 2 cards from these 3 is:

Favorable outcomes = C(3, 2) = 3

---

## Probability calculation

The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:

P(largest card is 4) = [Favorable outcomes/Total outcomes] = [3/10]

---

## Verification

Listing all possible 3-card combinations confirms that exactly 3 have 4 as the largest card: {1, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4}, and {2, 3, 4}. Thus, the probability is **3/10**.

The probability that the largest card drawn is 4 is **3/10**.

Computational analysis

Before the onset of the first card, the prediction about the number on card 1 (and thus the probability of reward given the guess) does not vary with the initial guess, so is denoted followingas a constant P 0 and excluded from subsequent analyses. Upon the onset of the first card, participants are able to compute the EV: the expectation of the probability of reward conditioned on the value of card 1 and their guess:This term can be computed in a normative manner given the relatively limited set size of 10 total values and the knowledge that cards are drawn without replacement, meaning that the second card cannot be the same as the first. For example, if the participant guessed that the second card will be higher and drew a 9 on the first card, it is intuitive that the probability of getting a reward (i.e. that their guess will be correct) will be low given that eight of the nine remaining cards available to draw as the second card are lower than the first. The computation of this EV term also allows for an error term at this stage, defined as the deviation between the EV (the expectation about the probability of reward given the guess), and the constant P 0 (the probability of reward given the guess). In practice this error term is perfectly correlated with the EV term since P 0 is a constant, and is not included in subsequent analyses.

Experimental paradigm

Participants were presented with two cards drawn sequentially and without replacement on each trial. The cards were shuffled from a deck of cards comprising 10 cards (ace to ten) and excluding face cards. Participants were instructed to treat an ace card as denoting "1". The cards were reshuffled after every trial. Prior to the drawing of the first card, participants were instructed to predict whether the second card would have a higher or lower numerical value than the first.

Participants were given up to 7 s to respond. Their guess was displayed on the screen for a duration of 1000 ms, and a pre-card fixation cross was shown for 1500 ms. We then drew the first card which was displayed for 2000 ms before a 1500 ms inter-stimulus period in which only their initial guess remained on the screen. The second card was then shown for another 2000 ms. Upon the presentation of the second card, all information necessary to determine the accuracy of the initial guess was available to the participant. Finally, participants were prompted to report whether they had won (guessed correctly) or lost (guessed incorrectly). Note that the initial guess of the participant remained on the screen throughout the presentation of both cards as well as the report period to reduce memory demands. A schematic of the trial structure and event timings are presented in Fig. 1 A. To incentivize participants to respond both to the initial guess and the final report, participants were instructed that they would receive a reward outcome in the form of 10 game points if their guess was correct and a deduction of 10 points from their cumulative total if their guess was incorrect. Correct or incorrect reporting of their guess accuracy at the end of the trial further resulted in gain or loss of 5 points, respectively. While these outcomes were displayed during the initial instructions and training block, during the task period in which data were analyzed these outcomes were not presented to the participant.

### Neural representations of honesty predict future trust behavior [^63ae60cb]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Moreover, to disentangle trustworthiness information about the advisers (honesty/dishonesty) from value information about participants' decisions (winnings/losses), the advice of honest advisers was made unpredictive of the winning card (i.e. 50% of the time information about the losing card was provided by the honest adviser). Thus, cards were drawn from a uniform distribution with pseudo-random sampling without replacement. The pseudo-random sampling procedure was optimized to have a realized probability of card drawing that approximates chance in both conditions, as would be expected in random drawing. A two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test confirmed that the realized distributions of card numbers did not differ between advisers (K–S test = 0.25; p = 0.929). Participants then chose one of the two cards (decision phase: 1 s) and saw a final feedback (feedback phase: 1 s) in which they received both social information (the card numbers based on which they could infer the adviser's trustworthiness) and nonsocial information (a green or red circle representing winnings and losses, respectively). In each trial, participants could win or lose €1. Intertrial stimulus intervals were 2–8 s (M = 2.6 s) long, whereas jitters between trials were 2–8 s (M = 4 s) long. Participants played a total of 5 runs with 48 trials each (24 with honest and 24 with dishonest advisers) for a total of 240 trials.

5.2.3 书写

对于DCD患者，尤其是DCD儿童，书写是一个特殊的问题；实际上许多患儿都专门针对书写问题接受了治疗。

指南第一版发布后，尚没有DCD儿童书写干预的论文发表，因此第一版这方面的内容暂时不变。仅一项病例研究 264 报道了书写技能训练的相关内容，但只涉及3名儿童。经过强化训练后（每周2次，每次 45分钟；以及持续13周的家庭作业），其中2名儿童有所改善。

虽然智能手机、平板电脑和笔记本电脑等现代技术使用有所增加，并且在某种程度上（取决于文化背景和社会环境）儿童对书写的依赖程度有所下降，但由书写障碍引发的参与问题仍是DCD儿童面临的一个严峻考验。操作键盘和鼠标也是精细运动能力，这可能会给DCD儿童造成问题，他们可能需要接受训练。为防止DCD儿童书写或操作电脑问题带来的对学业成绩的影响（被贴上差生或学习成绩差的标签），可建议进行键盘和平板电脑操作的同步训练。

### Interacting with volatile environments stabilizes hidden-state inference and its brain signatures [^39a5b9fa]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The description of the "observation" (Cb) and "action" (Ob) conditions was fully symmetric and the order in which participants were instructed about them was counterbalanced across participants. We described the "observation" (Cb) condition as follows: "The computer is drawing cards from one of the two decks. The goal of the game is to identify the deck from which cards are drawn. The computer changes deck from time to time, without warning". Each "observation" block was preceded by an instruction screen, indicating the association between keys and decks for the block (left key for the orange deck and right key for the blue deck, or vice versa) counterbalanced across blocks. We described the "action" (Ob) condition as follows: "You are drawing cards from one of the two decks by pressing a key. The goal of the game is to draw cards only from the target deck, by identifying the key it is associated with. The association between keys and decks reverses from time to time, without warning". Each "action" block was preceded by an instruction screen, indicating the target deck for the block (orange or blue) counterbalanced across blocks. Each block was initiated by a response (i.e. a random guess) before the onset of the first stimulus sequence. As can be seen from the descriptions of the two conditions, participants were instructed explicitly about the presence of reversals, but not about their exact frequency (hazard rate h). Reversals defined "episodes" during which the hidden state s (the drawn deck in the "observation" condition or the target-drawing key in the "action" condition) is fixed. The length of these hidden-state episodes was sampled pseudo-randomly from a truncated exponential probability distribution (minimum: 4 trials, maximum: 24 trials) to achieve an approximately constant hazard rate h over the course of each block.

### Financial incentives for reduced alcohol use and increased isoniazid adherence during tuberculosis preventive therapy among people with HIV in Uganda: an open-label, factorial randomised controlled trial [^afab41c2]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Participants assigned to the incentive groups provided a urine sample for group-appropriate testing at each refill visit. At these visits, they were given escalating financial incentives contingent on point-of-care urine tests that were negative for EtG (groups 2 and 4), or positive on IsoScreen (GFC Diagnostics, Chipping Warden, UK), a biomarker of isoniazid use over the previous 1–3 days (groups 3 and 4; appendix 2 p 2). Participants assigned to alcohol reduction incentives who had a negative urine EtG test, and those assigned to isoniazid adherence incentives who had a positive urine isoniazid test, instantly won cash prizes, with prize value determined by drawing one or more lottery scratch cards. Scratch cards revealed low-value, medium-value, and high-value cash prizes, valued at 5000 USh (US$1.50; low), 10 000 USh (US$2.85; medium), and 50 000 USh (US$14.30; high), with each card having at least a low-value prize. Probabilities of winning were 90% for low-value, 7% for medium-value, and 3% for high-value prizes. The number of scratch cards awarded per participant increased by one card at each subsequent visit with a negative urine EtG or positive urine isoniazid test, thereby providing escalating prizes for sustained reductions in alcohol use or sustained isoniazid adherence. Escalating prizes were used based on previous studies demonstrating that escalating reinforcements maintain smoking abstinence longer than fixed reinforcements. If a participant had a positive urine EtG or negative urine isoniazid test, no cards were given, and the participant "reset" to drawing one card if meeting the incentive condition at the subsequent visit.

If participants discontinued isoniazid due to toxicity or pregnancy, they remained in the study for follow-up monitoring. However, these participants were no longer eligible to receive isoniazid adherence incentives if in groups 3 or 4, but were still eligible to receive alcohol reduction incentives (groups 2 and 4). In the isoniazid adherence group, all participants on isoniazid who returned to the clinic for their first visit after the 8-week COVID-19 lockdown (during which they could not obtain isoniazid refills) received incentives for adherence according to their escalating schedules, independent of urine isoniazid test results.

### Alcohol use and HIV suppression after completion of financial incentives for alcohol abstinence and isoniazid adherence: a randomized controlled trial [^5de48c61]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study procedures

After enrollment into the study by trained research study staff, participants were randomized (1:1:1:1) into one of four study arms. Randomization was stratified by gender (female versus male) and study site. We used permuted blocks with random block sizes of 4 and 8 with the allocation sequence computer-generated before trial initiation. Participants selected a preprinted scratch card from eight cards presented by study staff that revealed randomization assignment when scratched by the participant, with replacement of each card taken with the next card in the sequence, to ensure transparency and engagement in the randomisation process.

For the alcohol reduction intervention, incentives were given contingent on recent alcohol abstinence, as measured by urine EtG tests (Arms 2 and 4). For the isoniazid adherence intervention, incentives were given contingent on recent INH use, as measured by urine IsoScreen tests (Arms 3 and 4). The incentives were given via lottery scratch cards indicating the award amount (in Uganda shillings (UGx)); each successive repeat negative EtG or repeat positive IsoScreen tests (depending on study arm) resulted in receipt of one additional scratch card awarded, thereby providing an escalating prize incentive based on literature that escalating prizes maintained smoking abstinence longer than fixed prizes. If a participant had a positive urine EtG test (indicating recent alcohol use) or a negative urine IsoScreen test (indicating recent non-adherence to INH), no lottery scratch cards were given, and the number of scratch cards awarded at the next success was "reset" to one. The scratch cards had varying financial values: low: UGx 5000 (US$1.50), medium: UGx 10,000 (US$2.85) and high: UGx 50,000 (US$14.30). The probabilities of winning were 90% for low-value prizes, 7% for medium-value prizes, and 3% for high-value prizes. The study conducted the urine EtG test (Arms 2 and 4) and/or the urine IsoScreen test (Arms 3 and 4) at INH refill visits 2- and 4-weeks post-randomization, and then monthly thereafter through month 6. Overall and within each incentive arm, 90% of incentive prizes earned during study visits were low-value prizes, 7% were medium-value prizes and 3% were high-value prizes. We implemented the lottery card (or random incentives) system as a feasible solution for using the prize draw approach in a low-resource setting where lottery cards are commonly used.

### Clock drawing: analysis in a retirement community [^dfa48fbf]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that performance on a clock-drawing test in a mailed survey to an older cohort is associated with known and potential risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease.

Design

The Leisure World Cohort Study is an ongoing study, begun in 1981, of nearly 14,000 older adults. In November 1992, the 8,406 living cohort members were mailed a follow-up questionnaire.

Setting

Leisure World Laguna Hills, a southern California retirement community.

Participants

The study population is a predominantly white, well-educated, upper-middle-class community; approximately two-thirds are women. Data from 4,843 cohort members (mean age 80 years; range 52–101) were analyzed.

Measurements

The questionnaire included a clock-drawing task: a predrawn circle 3 1/4 inches (8.3 cm) in diameter was provided with instructions "In the circle below, draw in the numbers as on a clock face. Make no erasures". Clocks were scored on 7 items: all numbers 1–12 present without adding extra or omitting numbers, sequencing of numbers, position of numbers, orientation of numbers to circle, consistent number style (either Arabic or Roman), tilt of numbers, and superfluous marks. A total clock score was calculated by summing the number of correct individual items (0–7). We also classified individuals as cognitively impaired by a previously suggested method: individuals were affected if they did not have three numbers drawn in the upper left quadrant of the clock face.

Results

Ninety percent or more of the participants across all ages placed the numbers 1 to 12 on their clocks without omissions or additions; 35% completed the clock drawing without error. The mean total clock scores decreased with each successive 5-year age group in both men and women. Regression analysis indicated a significant effect for age (b = -0.15, P < .0001), education (b = 0.05, P = 0.0001), smoking (b = 0.13, P = 0.03), and female gender (b = -0.05, P = 0.05) and a marginally significant effect of nonrheumatoid arthritis (b = 0.05, P = 0.07) on total clock score. No other measured variable had a significant effect. Cognitively impaired individuals were more likely to be female and older. After adjusting for age and gender, they were also more likely to be hypertensive and to have taken blood pressure medication and less likely to be college graduates, have glaucoma or arthritis, and to have taken vitamin supplements.

Conclusion

The clock-drawing task is an appealing measure of cognitive function for large epidemiological studies because it is a simple, self-administered test that is easily adapted to mail surveys and correlates with more-detailed and more-time-consuming cognitive screens. Although it is relatively free of influence by language, cultural, or ethnic factors, our study shows that even in a highly educated population, clock drawing is influenced by educational level and other known risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Thus a clock-drawing task may help predict cognitive frailty and future disability in older people. Such determination can direct high-risk individuals to earlier diagnosis, potential therapies, and better management.

### Irrational behavior in C. elegans arises from asymmetric modulatory effects within single sensory neurons [^80abc389]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Construction of the binary preference matrix

The preference matrix set was composed of 28 options (stimuli). Volatile cues were tested at four serial 1:10 dilutions (1:10 2–1:10 5). NaCl was applied at four doses: 4 drops of 5, 1 drop of 5, 1 drop of 1, and 1 drop of 0.2. For NH 4 Ac, we used three doses: four drops of 5, 1 drop of 5, and 1 drop of 1. The condition marked as 20 in Fig. 1b is composed of four drops of 5. Volume of each drop was 5 μl. Data were collected during 58 experiment days, totaling in 5670 experimental plates. Typically, a sub-matrix covering all dose combinations of a pair of substances (i.e. a "box" in Fig. 1b) was tested on the same experimental day, with two–four repeats of each pair of combinations. For the exact number of recording days and measured chemotaxis indexes of each binary interaction, see Supplementary Table 1. Overall, the matrix consists of 3276 possible triple sets (choose 3 out of the 28 stimuli without replacements, 28!/(25! × 3!)).

Of note, The BCIs of all tested stimuli were positive, confirming their attractiveness, and increased dose-dependently across 2–3 orders of magnitude for volatiles and 1–2 orders of magnitude for salts. Order of potency for the volatile stimulants was TT > DA≈PD≈Py > IA. Preference relationships in choice sets comprised of two dilutions of the same stimulant were always in favor of the higher dose. When different stimulants were used in the choice assay, worms typically preferred the option with the higher BCI.

### Picture this: evaluating the efficacy of genetic counseling visual aids [^012e9e72]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2024). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Implications of results

While no statistically significant difference was observed in total knowledge survey scores between the visual and non‐visual groups, the visual group often had higher scores and never had lower scores than the non‐visual group across all comparisons. Moreover, specific comparisons reveal areas in which visual aids may be particularly valuable as well as areas for future research.

A significant difference was observed in the autosomal recessive inheritance knowledge scores between the visual and non‐visual groups, with visual group scores being higher. Knowledge and application of inheritance patterns allow patients to understand not only the genetic mechanisms of their personal conditions but also the risk of their conditions to current and future family members. That visual aids may serve as a useful tool to facilitate this process is a pertinent result for the field of genetic counseling, exemplified by the fact that education on inheritance is included in the definition of genetic counseling itself by the National Society of Genetic Counselors (National Society of Genetic Counselors' Definition Task Force et al.). Moreover, numeracy and probabilistic reasoning skills (e.g. the ability to understand inheritance probabilities and genetic risks) are limited in the general population, underscoring the importance of developing genetic inheritance educational aids (Garcia‐Retamero et al; Rodríguez et al.). Given that understanding of inheritance facilitates understanding of genetic risk, the results of this analysis are supported by previous findings that visual aids robustly improve understanding of risk in diverse populations (Garcia‐Retamero & Cokely). Worth noting is that inheritance visual aids may be especially beneficial when drawn live and personalized to a family's situation during a genetic counseling session (Gale et al.). The results of this analysis therefore support a growing body of evidence that genetic counseling‐specific inheritance visual aids may improve patients' understanding of inheritance and, subsequently, understanding of risk information and implications of a genetic condition within their family context.

### Reminders of past choices bias decisions for reward in humans [^27af71e6]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Experiment 2

The above results concord with our hypothesis that human decisions are guided by samples of individual past choices, even in a simple repeated choice task. However, one disadvantage of applying sampling models to this type of task is that trials are essentially similar; we cannot directly observe (and must instead marginalize when computing model fit) which individual trials participants have sampled. For this reason, our conclusions are based on an overall comparison of model fit rather than a test of clear qualitative features of either model. Moreover, the experiment was correlational, rather than causal. To address this, we performed a second behavioural experiment to provide more direct support for the hypothesis by bringing the sampling process under experimental control, so as to measure the impact of a single, selected experience on choices. We leveraged the fact that multiple aspects of the choice experience can be bound together as a single representation. Therefore, we used choice-incidental — but still trial-unique — information to tag each choice as a unique event. Specifically, we modified the bandit task from Experiment 1 so that each trial involved a uniquely identifying photograph of an everyday object — a 'ticket' emitted by the chosen slot machine (see also ref.). To simplify the task and analysis, the number of choice options was reduced to two from four and outcome values were limited to wins or losses of $5 (Fig. 2a). The probability that each machine would pay a winning ticket varied from trial to trial (Fig. 2b). Other than the ticket presentation, this task matches the sort of 'two-armed bandit' traditionally employed in RL studies.

### A gender specific risk assessment of coronary heart disease based on physical examination data [^fd5fee59]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

CHD risk scorecard

In order to improve the convenience of clinical application and facilitate risk stratification, we designed a gender-specific CHD risk score card. The features used in the CHD risk score card are the same as those in CHD risk assessment model. In the scoring card, firstly, continuous risk factors were divided into 20 bins and ensured that patients with CHD and healthy persons were included in each group. Subsequently, the Chi-square test was performed on the two adjacent groups. The bins with the largest P value were traverses and merged until the number of bins reached the desired number. Then, the most suitable number of bins was determined (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3). For example, for the continuous variable MSP in Supplementary Fig. 2, the x-axis represents the number of bins (initially, each continuous variable was divided into 20 bins), and the y-axis represents the IV value. When the number of bins is 5, the IV value reaches a relatively high value. As the number of bins increases, the increase in IV value slows down. Therefore, we decided to divide the continuous variable MSP into 5 bins. Similarly, we divided Age, FBG, WHtR, PLT, BT, and BUN into 6, 5, 5, 5, 3, and 4 bins, respectively. Discrete variables do not need to be binned. For example, the Dentition variable has only two values, 1 and 0, so it is divided into two bins. The discrete variables ECG and Symptom are also divided into 2 bins each. After feature binning, we calculated the WoE of each bin and replaced WoE with the original benchmark data to ensure that all datasets could be covered by WoE.

### Procedures for the evaluation of the visual system by pediatricians [^83a70978]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Screening process for pediatric visual acuity — large optotypes at the top of an eye chart or on handheld cards are first reviewed with the child with both eyes open to help the child understand the test. After this review, 1 eye is occluded (preferably by an occlusive patch or tape) and lines of optotypes or cards with single crowded optotypes (ie, the figure is surrounded by bars on all 4 sides) are presented to each eye separately. Effective occlusion, such as with tape or an occlusive patch of the eye not being tested, is important to eliminate the possibility of peeking.

### Graphical data presentation [^8085a383]. Injury (2008). Low credibility.

Figures and charts are the most influential vehicles for distributing scientific information, for affecting decisions as to the acceptance or rejection of a manuscript, and for attracting the attention of the scientific community to study results. Graphical excellence is mainly defined, first, by the highest possible data density (that is, the amount of information provided per graph area); second, by a low ink-to-data ratio (the avoidance of unnecessary shading, three-dimensionality, gridlines and what is often called 'chartjunk'); and third, by clear and unequivocal labelling of axes. The researcher's essential graphical toolbox should contain histograms, bar charts (always with measures of error), box-and-whiskers plots, scatter plots and forest plots.

### Designing and implementing an electronic health record-embedded card study in primary care: methods and considerations [^0212b8cb]. Annals of Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Card studies-short surveys about the circumstances within which patients receive care-are traditionally completed on physical cards. We report on the development of an electronic health record (EHR)-embedded card study intended to decrease logistical challenges inherent to paper-based approaches, including distributing, tracking, and transferring the physical cards, as well as data entry and respondent prompts, while simultaneously decreasing the complexity for participants and facilitating rich analyses by linking to clinical and demographic data found in the EHR. Developing the EHR-based programming and data extraction was time consuming, required specialized expertise, and necessitated iteration to rectify issues encountered during implementation. Nonetheless, future EHR-embedded card studies will be able to replicate many of the same processes as informed by these results. Once built, the EHR-embedded card study simplified survey implementation for both the research team and clinic staff, resulting in research-quality data, the ability to link survey responses to relevant EHR data, and a 79% response rate. This detailed accounting of the development and implementation process, including issues encountered and addressed, might guide others in conducting EHR-embedded card studies.

### Introduction to clinical decision making [^9046941c]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In the last few years there has been a remarkable increase in the amount of clinical data in the average hospital chart, and more and more problem-solving algorithms have been developed. We need better "thinking tools" to help us handle the flow of information. The term "clinical decision making" is used to describe a systematic way to handle data and algorithms to decide on a best course of action. This introductory article discusses some of the problems in establishing a decision criterion, both for a population and for an individual patient. Comparing the probabilities and utilities of various diagnostic outcomes (true positive, false positive, etc.) leads to a diagnostic strategy. The article also discusses conditional probability. Bayes' theorem, and likelihood ratios.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^de70aa28]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 5–3 — Poor adherence with prescribed maintenance treatment in asthma — contributing factors and clinical identification are summarized as follows: Medication/regimen factors include "Difficulties using inhaler device (e.g., arthritis)", "Burdensome regimen (e.g., several times per day)", and "Multiple different inhalers"; unintentional poor adherence includes "Misunderstanding about instructions" and "Forgetfulness"; and intentional poor adherence includes "Perception that treatment is not necessary" and "Concerns about side-effects (real or perceived)". For patients prescribed maintenance treatment, "ask an empathic question" and "Acknowledge the likelihood of incomplete adherence and encourage an open non-judgmental discussion", using example prompts such as "In the last 4 weeks, how many days a week have you been taking it – not at all, 1, 2, 3 or more days a week?" and "Do you find it easier to remember your inhaler in the morning or the evening?" Practical checks include "Check the date of the last prescription", "Check the date and dose counter on the inhaler", and, where available, electronic monitoring since "prescribing and dispensing frequency can be monitored electronically by clinicians and/or pharmacists".

### Effect of provider volume on the accuracy of hospital report cards: a monte carlo study [^f0fa58e3]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hospital report cards, in which outcomes after the provision of medical or surgical care are compared across healthcare providers, are being published with increasing frequency. However, the accuracy of such comparisons is controversial, especially when case volumes are small. The objective was to determine the relationship between hospital case volume and the accuracy of hospital report cards.

Methods and Results

Monte Carlo simulations were used to examine the influence of hospital case volume on the accuracy of hospital report cards in a setting in which true hospital performance was known with certainty, and perfect risk-adjustment was feasible. The parameters used to generate the simulated data sets were obtained from empirical analyses of data on patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction in Ontario, Canada, in which the overall 30-day mortality rate was 11.1%. We found that provider volume had a strong effect on the accuracy of hospital report cards. However, provider volume had to be > 300 before ≥ 70% of hospitals were correctly classified. Furthermore, hospital volume had to be > 1000 before ≥ 80% of hospitals were correctly classified.

Conclusions

Producers and users of hospital report cards need to be aware that, even when perfect risk adjustment is possible, the accuracy of hospital report cards is, at best, modest for small to medium-sized case loads (i.e., 100–300). Hospital report cards displayed high degrees of accuracy only when provider volumes exceeded the typical annual hospital case load for many cardiovascular conditions and procedures.

FIGURE 2
Average sensitivities to marginal changes in the treatment attribute levels.

The most important attribute for both adults and adolescents was the probability of scalp regrowth after 24 weeks of treatment from 0% to 50% (adult RAI 42.1% [95% CI, 38.7–45.3]; adolescent RAI 61.6% [95% CI 56.2–65.1]) (Table S4). For adult patients, this was followed by reducing the risk of serious infection during 3 years of treatment (RAI 13.5% [95% CI, 10.3–16.6]), decreasing the risk of getting cancer during 3 years of treatment (RAI 12.8% [95% CI, 9.9–15.7]), increasing the probability of eyebrow regrowth after 24 weeks of treatment (RAI 11.7% [95% CI, 8.8–14.5]), reducing the risk of getting blood clots during 3 years of treatment (RAI 10.7% [95% CI, 7.6–13.5]), and increasing the probability of eyelash regrowth after 24 weeks of treatment (RAI 9.2% [95% CI, 6.9–12.4]). A decreased risk of getting cancer during 3 years of treatment was the second most influential attribute for adolescents (RAI 14.1% [95% CI 10.3–17.4]), followed by increasing the probability of eyebrow regrowth after 24 weeks of treatment (RAI 13.1% [95% CI 9.4–16.3]), and increasing the probability of eyelash regrowth after 24 weeks of treatment (RAI 9.1% [95% CI, 5.6–12.2]). Relative importance of treatment‐related risks (i.e. serious infection, cancer, and blood clots) did not significantly differ for the adults (i.e. the difference between the largest and smallest RAI values was 2.79 points [p = 0.205]).

### Three diverse motives for information sharing [^97a4fba4]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Information-seeking task

Following instructions, participants answered six comprehension questions before the first block and one question before the second block. Participants who responded incorrectly twice on at least one question were not permitted to go on to complete the task. After reading the instructions, participants completed two example trials before starting the actual task.

The task is illustrated in Fig. 1a. Recipients were told they owned 100 stocks in a financial market we created. On each trial recipients were presented with an algorithm's prediction of the value of their stocks and the algorithm's average prediction accuracy (the algorithms could be different on each trial). These cues were presented for 5 s. Predictions regarding the stocks' value ranged from −400 to −500 and from +400 to +500. A positive stock value meant recipients were earning money, a negative value meant they were losing money. We use the word 'valence' to indicate both the direction of the change in stock's value (positive or negative) and the magnitude of such change. The algorithm's prediction accuracy ranged from 0 to 99%, high numbers suggest the algorithm is often correct and vice versa. The algorithm's accuracy represents the probability of the revealed stocks' value being the real value. When the prediction is incorrect, the stocks' value is uniformly distributed over the possible values. Stocks' value and uncertainty level were randomly sampled for each trial. Recipients then indicated whether they wanted to open an envelope containing information about the true value of their stocks (information-seeking decision). They did so using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 0, "Not at all", to 6, "Very much". We adopted a 7-point Likert scale rather than a binary response scale to increase the sensitivity of our measure. Recipients were told that the closer their answer was to "Very much", the more likely we were to open the envelope and reveal the value of their stocks, and vice versa (similar to other studies. If they selected 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, then the information was delivered with a probability of 5%, 20%, 35%, 50%, 65%, 80%, and 95%, respectively. This probabilistic approach, which is adapted from past studies, is reflective of real life where actions are often not deterministically related to outcomes (e.g. one may ask a question but not receive an answer and may need to ask again if they really want to know). Recipients were not aware of these exact mathematical conversions as we did not want them to focus their attention on exact mathematical calculations to avoid distraction. Next, either the value of their stocks (information) was presented on screen for 4 s or hidden ('XX' was shown).

Design

Figure 1 illustrates the game structure and procedures. Exactly 12 participants take part in each session and they are randomly divided into four groups consisting of three participants each. In the baseline condition, participants are informed that they will make (at most) one decision and that there are a total of four sequential groups. Moreover, they are informed about the position of their group in the succession of groups and learn that the allocation of participants to the groups is random. After reading a printout of the instructions (reproduced in Supplementary Note 3) and being given an opportunity to ask clarifying questions, the experiment starts. In the baseline condition, each member of Group 1 is endowed with €10. The three members of this group simultaneously face the same decision: they are required to divide their endowment between a private account and a group account. More precisely, they are required to decide how much money to allocate to the group account while the rest of the endowment automatically remains in their private account. If individual contributions to the group account sum to less than €15, the experiment ends instantly and all participants of later groups are informed that the experiment has ended and that their earning from the experimental task are zero. However, if the sum of contributions to the group account amounts to €15 or more (i.e. at least 50% of the total group endowment), the game continues and moves to the next group (Group 2). Independent from the sum of total contributions in the group account, members of Group 1 earn the respective amounts in their private accounts (i.e. the initial endowment of €10 minus their individual contribution to the group account). If the game is sustained, the same procedure applies for members of Groups 2 and 3. The experiment ends with the decision of the members of Group 3. If the contributions of Group 3's members to the group account sum to €15 or more, then the members of Group 4 each earn €5. Otherwise, members of Group 4 earn nothing. Reaching the threshold exactly costs €15 to the current generation but provides an endowment of €30 to the subsequent generation(s). There is hence a gain in total earnings (across multiple generations) from reaching the threshold. These potential gains from contributing are largest for members of the first generation, but smaller for participants in subsequent generations (with no such gains from Group 3). Choosing €15 as a threshold value has the advantage of facilitating coordination between group members by allowing for individual contributions of €5 (i.e. 50% of the endowment) to be sufficient for reaching the threshold. Hence, it is a symmetric focal point for coordination. At the same time, individual endowments are smaller than the threshold. Hence, no single group member can unilaterally provide the public good and successful provision requires the cooperation of at least two group members.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

Newborn screening in the United States — Newborn screening programs test almost (≥ 97%) of the 4 million babies born each year and are conducted by public health laboratories using a few drops of blood, often collected before hospital discharge, that are spotted onto filter paper cards; over the last decade, increasing use of tandem mass spectrometry has substantially increased the number of metabolic disorders detected from dried blood spot specimens. In 2010, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) adopted a recommendation for a uniform screening panel including screening for 30 core conditions and reporting 26 secondary conditions as a national standard for newborn screening programs and recommended facilitating inclusion of this panel into all state programs.

### The significance of pain drawing as a screening tool for cervicogenic headache and associated symptoms in chronic fatigue [^2d1a27f8]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Over a period of 13 months (February 2019–March 2020), 278 subjects agreed to participate in the study. Three cases where study participants had refrained from symptom-reporting with the pain drawing were excluded from the analysis. For the remaining 275 participants, missing data consisted of 30 reports (11%) of self-rated quality of life, and 4 reports of pain intensity (1,5%). An overview of participants' characteristics is presented in Table 1.

Table 1
Characteristics of the Study Participants (n = 275)

Each of the 275 drawings had a unique marking distributed over the figure. Drawings with the largest pain extent included all body quadrants and the axial area, and some drawings were blank. The assessors were in agreement for 96% of drawings in their interpretation by means of the standardized C2 pattern pain drawing key (yes/no). For 12 drawings, there was a renewed joint assessment by discussion until consensus was reached. Of all participants, 116 (42%) had markings in the pain drawing that corresponded to the specific C2 pain pattern (Figure 3).

2.2 Cognitive assessment procedures

The extended cognitive performance assessment consisted of eight subtests: (1) immediate and (2) delayed word list, (3) Labyrinth test, (4) verbal fluency "animals", (5) clock-drawing test, (6,7) Trail Making Test A and B, (8) Color-Word test (card 1, card 2, difference card 3–card 2). For a detailed description of tests (1) to (5), see the study by Wege et al.and for the extended cognitive assessment (6) to (8), see the study by Tebrügge et al. For the five subtests that have already been used at t1, we performed z-transformation of the raw data at t2 using our own defined norm-data from t1: raw data were z-transformed based on the mean and SD of the appropriate age and education group at t1 (age: 50–59 years, 60–69 years, and ≥ 70 years; education: ≤ 10 years, 11–13 years, and ≥ 14 years). For the subtests of the extended cognitive performance assessment, z-transformation was based on the same education groups from t1 and the following three age groups from t2: 55–64 years, 65–74 years, and ≥ 75 years. Except for the clock-drawing test, the age- and education-adjusted test scores were scaled to have a mean of 10 and an SD of 3. Tests were grouped into four domains: (1) attention — Trail Making Test A, Color-Word test card 1 and card 2; (2) executive function — Trail Making Test B, Labyrinth test, Color-Word test interference performance, verbal fluency; (3) verbal memory — eight-word list immediate and delayed recall; (4) visuoconstruction — clock-drawing test. Within each domain, newly scaled scores of the tests were added. To account for the differing numbers of tests in each domain, domain scores were then scaled to have a mean of 10 and a SD of 3. Cognitive impairment was defined as a performance of more than one SD below the mean (≤ 7) in at least one total domain score of the domains attention, executive function, verbal memory, or as a score of ≥ 3 in visuoconstruction.

### The effect of report cards on the coverage of maternal and neonatal health care: a factorial, cluster-randomised controlled trial in uttar pradesh, India [^3e762297]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Background

Report cards are a prominent strategy to increase the ability of citizens to express their view, improve public accountability, and foster community participation in the provision of health services in low-income and middle-income countries. In India, social accountability interventions that incorporate report cards and community meetings have been implemented at scale, attracting considerable policy attention, but there is little evidence on their effectiveness in improving health. We aimed to evaluate the effect of report cards, which contain information on village-level indicators of maternal and neonatal health care, and participatory meetings targeted at health providers and community members (including local leaders) on the coverage of maternal and neonatal health care in Uttar Pradesh, India.

Methods

We conducted a repeated cross-sectional, 2×2 factorial, cluster-randomised controlled trial, in which each cluster was a village (rural) or ward (urban). The clusters were randomly assigned to one of four groups: the provider group, in which we shared report cards and held participatory meetings with providers of maternal and neonatal health services; the community group, in which we shared report cards and held participatory meetings with community members (including local leaders); the providers and community group, in which report cards were targeted at both health providers and the community; and the control group, in which report cards were not shared with anyone. We generated these report cards by collating data from household surveys and shared the report cards with the recipients (as determined by their assigned groups) in participatory meetings. The primary outcome was the proportion of women who had at least four antenatal care visits (ie, attended a clinic or were visited at home by a health-care worker) during their last pregnancy. We measured outcomes with cross-sectional household surveys that were taken at baseline, at a first follow-up (after 8 months of the intervention), and at a second follow-up (21 months after the start of the intervention). Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN11070792.

Findings

We surveyed eligible women for the baseline survey between Jan 13, and Feb 5, 2015. We then randomly assigned 44 clusters to the provider group, 45 clusters to the community group, 45 clusters to the provider and community group, and 44 clusters to the control group. Report cards of collated survey data were provided to recipient groups, as per their random allocation, in October, 2015, and in September, 2016. We ran the first follow-up survey between May 16 and June 10, 2016. We ran the second follow-up survey between June 18 and July 18, 2017. We measured the primary outcome in 3133 women (795 in the provider group, 781 in the community group, 798 in the provider and community group, and 759 in the control group) who gave birth during implementation of the intervention, between Feb 1, 2016, and July 18, 2017 (the end of the second follow-up survey). The report card intervention did not significantly affect the proportion of women who had at least four antenatal care visits (provider vs non-provider: odds ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.65–1.13; community vs non-community: 0.86, 0.65–1.13).

Interpretation

Maternal health report cards containing information on village performance, targeted at either the community or health providers, had no detectable effect on the coverage of maternal and neonatal health care. Future research should seek to understand how the content of information and the delivery of report cards affect the success of this type of social accountability intervention.

### Biased expectations about future choice options predict sequential economic decisions [^9b0d2bac]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Next, the model works backwards through the sequence, iteratively using the aforementioned formula forwhen computing each respective action value Q for taking the option and declining the option for each t. Whenever the reward value of taking the current option is considered, the reward function R assigns reward values to options based on their ranks. h represents the relative rank of the current option.

In contrast, the reward value of sampling again is simply the cost to sample C.

This customisable R function allowed us to examine how the Ideal Observer changes its sampling strategy under the different reward payoff schemes used in our studies. Pilot full, Study 1 full, Study 2 and both conditions in Study 3 all involved instructing participants to try to choose the best price possible. In study conditions using these instructions, we implemented a continuous payoff function (resembling that of the classic Gilbert & Mosteller formulation), in which the relative rank of each choice would be rewarded commensurate with the value of its associated option. In Pilot baseline and the baseline, squares, timing, and prior conditions of Study 1, we adapted the payoff scheme to match participants' instructions that they would be paid £0.12 for the best rank, £0.08 for the second-best rank, £0.04 for the third best rank and £0 for any other ranks. Lastly, in the payoff condition of Study 1, we programmed the reward payoff function to match participants' reward of 5 stars for the best rank, 3 stars for the second-best rank, one star for the third-best rank and zero stars for any other ranks.

Another feature added to our implementation of the Ideal Observer, compared to the Gilbert & Mosteller base model, is the ability to update the model's generating distribution from its experience with new samples in a Bayesian fashion, instead of this generating distribution being specified in advance and then fixed throughout the paradigm. This Bayesian version of the optimality model treats option values as samples from a Gaussian distribution with a normal-inverse- χ² prior. The prior distribution is initialised before experiencing any options with four parameters: the prior mean μ₀, the degrees of freedom of the prior mean κ, the prior variance σ²₀ and the degrees of freedom of the prior variance ν. The μ₀ and σ²₀ parameters of this prior distribution are then updated by the model following presentation of each newly sampled option value as each sequence progresses.

Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2012). Medium credibility.

Cognitive assessment: Mini-Cog provides stepwise instructions, scoring, and interpretation for word recall and a clock draw. Patients are instructed, 'Give the patient 3 tries to repeat the words. If unable after 3 tries, go to next item', and, for the clock task, 'If subject has not finished clock drawing in 3 minutes, discontinue and ask for recall items', with the clock set to '11:10 (10 past 11)'. A normal clock requires 'All numbers 1–12, each only once, are present in the correct order and direction (clockwise) inside the circle' and 'Two hands are present, one pointing to 11 and one pointing to 2'; 'ANY CLOCK MISSING ANY OF THESE ELEMENTS IS SCORED ABNORMAL. REFUSAL TO DRAW A CLOCK IS SCORED ABNORMAL'. Scoring is '3 item recall (0–3 points): 1 point for each correct word' plus 'Clock draw (0 or 2 points): 0 points for abnormal clock 2 points for normal clock'. Interpretation thresholds are 'Total Score of 0, 1, or 2 suggests possible impairment' versus 'Total Score of 3, 4, or 5 suggests no impairment', and if impairment is present, 'consider a referral to a primary care physician, geriatrician, or mental health specialist'.

### Identity cards help patients identify their doctors [^12d8b319]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Strategy

Our aim was to improve identification of the named consultant and/or single member of the treating team to 80%, within one week of admission. Our main outcome measure was patient recall of the named consultant and/or any member of the treating team. Patients were given ID cards during the consultant- or senior-led ward round which clearly indicated the names and grades of all doctors involved in their care. The card can be kept by each patient for future reference. Patients then surveyed to ascertain if the desired outcome measure was achieved and based on results, further cycles were refined as appropriate, and where possible the scale and scope of the implementation was increased.

PDSA Cycle 1

ID cards were distributed to patients during their first encounter on the respiratory ward with a named consultant. Improved short term recall and awareness of doctor's names was clearly evident (Figures 1 & 2, cycle 1). Patients however could still not retain this information after a few days spent on the ward as ID cards were found to be too small and often went missing. ID cards were then re-fashioned to have a larger font and to be permanently fixed to the bedside. A parallel cycle was carried out on the vascular ward with a dramatic improvement in patient recall observed (Figure 3).

PDSA Cycle 2

Larger ID cards were distributed to patients during their first encounter on the respiratory ward with a named consultant. Cards were placed in protective plastic sheets and fastened to bedside tables. Improved short term recall and awareness of doctor's names was then demonstrated (Figures 1 & 2, cycle 2).

2.1.4.1 Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST)

For the WCST we used Nelson's modified version of the standard procedure. Cards varying on three basic features –colour, shape and number of items– must be sorted according to each feature in turn. The participant's first sorting choice becomes the correct feature, and once a criterion of six consecutive correct sorts is achieved, the subject is told that the rules have changed, and cards must be sorted according to a new feature. After all three features have been used as sorting criteria, subjects must cycle through them again in the same order as they did before. Each time the feature is changed, the next must be discovered by trial and error. Score was total number of categories achieved.

2.1.4.2 Verbal fluency

In verbal fluency tasks, the subject generates as many items as possible from a given category. We used the standard Argentinian phonemic version, asking subjects to generate words beginning with the letter P in a one-minute block. Score was the total number of correct words generated.

2.1.4.3 Trail making test B (TMTB)

In this test the subject is required to draw lines sequentially connecting 13 numbers and 12 letters distributed on a sheet of paper. Letters and numbers are encircled and must be connected alternately (e.g. 1, A, 2, B, 3, C, etc.). Score was the total time (s) required to complete the task, given a negative sign so that higher scores meant better performance.

### Disease prediction with multi-omics and biomarkers empowers case-control genetic discoveries in the UK biobank [^aa6259d2]. Nature Genetics (2024). High credibility.

Model prediction

Once the optimal number of n_estimators was determined for each ICD10 code, the next step was to predict the probability for each UKB participant of being a case given their biomarker profile. A predicted probability value closer to 1 denotes higher chances of a participant being a case while a value closer to 0 denotes higher chances of being a control. To obtain these predicted probabilities, steps outlined in the paragraph below were repeated ten times and average prediction probability across these ten iterations was calculated for each participant in the entire UKB.

In each iteration, all the cases (n) diagnosed with that ICD10 code were taken (Methods section 'Defining cases in UKB') and controls (ctrl_ratio × n) were randomly sampled (Methods section 'Defining controls in UKB'). Fivefold cross-validation was performed, where in each fold, four-fifths of the data (cases = n × 4/5, controls = ctrl_ratio × n × 4/5) were used for training a 'Balanced Ensemble Classifier' and the remaining one-fifth (cases = n × 1/5, controls = ctrl_ratio × n × 1/5) were used for testing model performance. A Balanced Ensemble Classifier trains an XGBoost classifier on an equal number of cases (n × 4/5) and controls (n × 4/5) by random subsampling from ctrl_ratio × n × 4/5 controls without replacement and repeats the training process ctrl_ratio times to include all controls. The average performance from these four Balanced Ensemble Classifier repeats is reported as the performance of each cross-validation fold and the average performance across all five folds is reported as the performance of each overall iteration. An XGBoost classifier is then fitted on the entire training dataset (cases = n, controls = ctrl_ratio × n) to generate prediction probabilities for all UKB participants.

Fig. 1
Example trial sequences.

During the first 150 training trials, participants selected from either the AB or the CD pair. Option labels were randomized (e.g. Option S could correspond to A, B, C, or D in the reward schedule). The total virtual points earned were displayed at the top of the screen. After each selection, participants received feedback on the number of points gained. In the subsequent 100 transfer trials, participants chose from the remaining four option combinations (i.e. 25 trials for each) — CA, BD, AD, and CB — without cumulative point displays or feedback. They were instructed to rely on knowledge acquired during the training phase to maximize their points.

Table 1
Reward Structure

N(M, SD) indicates continuous normal distributions of rewards for each option. M is the mean and SD is the standard deviation. "Base-rate" indicates how frequently each choice pair is presented during training, relative to the other choice pair. For example, 2:1 means the first pair is presented twice as often as the second pair.

In the training phase, participants made choices between option A versus option B, or option C vs option D. There were 100 AB trials, and 50 CD trials, with each trial type randomly distributed over the 150 training trials. Rewards were centered at each deck's mean value (A = 0.65, B = 0.35, C = 0.75, D = 0.25). For the HV condition, rewards were normally distributed with the standard deviation mirroring that of a binomial distribution. For decks A and B, this was, and for C and D this was. For the MV condition, the standard deviation in rewards was half that of the HV condition (i.e.24 for AB;.22 for CD), and the LV condition was a quarter of those in the HV condition (i.e. 0.12 for AB;.11 for CD)

After training, participants were told they would now choose between different option pairs. Transfer test trials included 25 of each AC, AD, BC and BD trials, in random order. No feedback was provided for choices in the test phase.

This study was not preregistered; however, our experiment was carefully designed and provided clear predictions regarding the expected direction of the effects. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested.

### Quantifying of severity of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: adaptations to the definition to allow quantification [^2ee7999a]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) offer a considerable clinical challenge for clinical practice and drug development. The underlying pathobiology of these characteristic events is unclear. We are far behind other disease areas, such as cardiology, where there are effective approaches for diagnosing and managing acute and potentially fatal events. A joint initiative has begun between the pharmaceutical industry, academia, and the Food and Drug Administration to produce a valid diary card measure of exacerbation severity: the EXAcerbations of Chronic pulmonary disease Test-Patient-Reported Outcome (EXACT-PRO). This article describes the background to this initiative, using the consensus definition of a COPD exacerbation as the starting point from which to propose a new method for quantifying the severity of the event. This approach takes into account the relationships between the symptoms that make up an exacerbation and shows that they can be used in a single continuous severity scale. Methods for defining exacerbation onset and cessation are also proposed.

### Reminders of past choices bias decisions for reward in humans [^ebc889d9]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

After selection, the unchosen slot machine was covered and the chosen machine remained alone on the screen for 0.25 s. Then, a trial-unique photograph appeared and remained on the screen until participants again pressed the key corresponding to their chosen slot machine — in the instructions, this corresponded to the mnemonic memory strategy of selecting the left or righthand side 'pockets' for your ticket. When the correct key was pressed, a grey box appeared around the photograph and remained there for at least 500 ms or additional time up to two seconds depending on when the participants pushed the correct key.

At the end of the timeout, the box disappeared and the dollar value associated with the ticket — either −$5 or $5 — was displayed, as a photograph of a $5 bill, with a green '+' or a red '−' to the left of the bill image. The bill photograph remained on the screen — along with the chosen slot machine and the trial-unique 'ticket' photograph — until the participant pressed a key corresponding to the value: either 'a' for −$5 or 'b' for $5. In the instructions, this was referred to as 'putting the ticket in your front or back pocket', on the side indicated by the slot machine identity. Once the correct key was pressed, the bill photograph was surrounded by a grey box and remained on the screen for two seconds. After each trial, a blank screen was displayed for an inter-trial interval of two seconds.

### Assigning the right credit to the wrong action: compulsivity in the general population is associated with augmented outcome-irrelevant value-based learning [^60f832e8]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Two-step task

To obtain individual measures of outcome-irrelevant learning and model-based control, participants completed a two-step reinforcement-learning task. In this task, players were asked to make decisions in order to maximize monetary gains (play pounds). Each trial included two stages, in which participants made a choice between two fractals (see Fig. 2A). The fractals in the first stage led probabilistically to one of the two second-stage pairs; fractals in the second stage led probabilistically to receipt of a reward (£0 or £1). Each fractal was randomly assigned in each trial and stage to appear on the left or right side of the screen. Participants were instructed to select a fractal by pressing the corresponding left or right response key (see Fig. 2B). Importantly, only fractals, but not their arbitrary and varying affiliated response keys, predicted outcomes — the fractal position on the screen, and the effector participants used to select the fractal were randomly assigned by the computer. Subjects' choices and reaction times enabled us to estimate outcome-irrelevant learning and model-based control, as described further below.

Fig. 2
Two-step task illustration.

A Participants navigated between the two stages of the task in order to reap rewards. The second stage included two pairs of fractal images, which led probabilistically to a reward. To attain these rewards, participants made choices during the first stage, which probabilistically determined the fractals presented during the second stage. B Illustration of trial sequences, showing a choice made in the first stage, followed by feedback, and a second-stage selection that was followed by a reward (1 play pound). C A fractal to response key pairing was allocated randomly in each trial. Panel (C) illustrates a trial sequence, in which the same fractals were selected as in panel (B), but now with different effectors. Although fractal identity predicted relevant outcomes (second-stage fractals, and reward), the position of the fractal and the response key used to report a selection were always outcome-irrelevant. Outcome-irrelevant learning was inferred from a participant's tendency to assign value to response keys despite their irrelevance to any individual decision (see Fig. 3 for outcome-irrelevant estimate plots). Model-based control was estimated as the ability to select a first-stage action based on the task's transition probability and subjective action values of second-stage fractals (see Supplementary Fig. S3 for model-based estimate plots).

### Effect of brief produce exposure and unconstrained grocery gift cards on caregiver influence on diet of elementary age children: a randomized clinical trial [^3f090002]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Children's diets affect health trajectories but are difficult to influence, especially for resource-constrained families.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of providing 4 weeks of grocery gift cards and small produce boxes to caregivers on their ability to support healthy shifts in children's diets.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This 2-group randomized clinical trial was conducted from May to July 2021, with 4 weeks of intervention and follow-up at 8 weeks. Resources were provided curbside at 3 schools, 3 housing sites, and 1 after-school site for use at home. Participants consisted of 1 index child ages 5 to 11 years with 1 index caregiver from 68 low-income families. Data were analyzed from July 2021 through March 2022.

Interventions

During each week for 4 weeks, caregivers were offered 10-lb (4.5 kg) boxes of fruits and vegetables, $10.00 grocery gift cards, an additional $10.00 gift card over the last 3 weeks triggered by a task completion, and a 1-time choice of a $25.00 food preparation tool.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Index child and caregiver diets were measured together over the phone at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks using the 2019 to 2020 Texas School Physical Activity and Nutrition (SPAN) tool, which measures the number of times food items were eaten over the prior day to report a SPAN Healthy Eating Index (SHEI) score and subscores for specific categories of foods (range, 0–57, with higher scores indicating a more healthful diet).

Results

Among 68 children (mean [SD] age, 8.2 [1.7] years; 35 [51.5%] girls) and caregivers (mean [SD] age, 37.9 [7.9] years; 63 mothers [92.6%]) from primarily low-income families, 26 caregivers were Hispanic or Latino (38.2%), while 18 caregivers were Black (26.4%), 25 caregivers were White (36.7%), and 24 caregivers had more than 1 race (35.3%). Most families were below the federal poverty level (41 of 60 families that reported income [68.3%]). Per participating caregiver, a mean (SD) 2.7 [1.4] fruit and vegetable boxes and $42.35 ($25.46) worth of gift cards were picked up over 4 weeks. Mean (SE) child SPAN SHEI increased from 32.03 (0.62) times/d to 33.75 (0.69) times/d at 4 weeks (ie, postintervention) and 34.03 (0.69) times/d 4 weeks later (ie, at 8 weeks of follow-up). Mean (SE) child fruit and vegetable intake increased from 5.31 (0.47) times/d to 5.78 (0.51) times/d postintervention and 6.03 (0.51) times/d at follow-up. Children in the control group did not have improved diet (overall mean [SE] SHEI: 31.48 [0.58] times/d at baseline, 31.68 [0.54] times/d postintervention, and 31.81 [0.52] times/d at follow-up; mean [SE] fruit and vegetable intake: 5.21 [0.45] times/d at baseline, 4.77 [0.45] times/d postintervention, and 4.68 [0.41] times/d at follow-up). Compared with children in the control group, mean SHEI was increased for children in the intervention group by 2.07 times/d postintervention and 2.23 times/d at follow-up. Improvements as a function of program dose were statistically significant for child SHEI (P = 0.01) and fruit and vegetable intake (P = 0.03). No significant changes in caregiver diets were found.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that easily accessed fruits and vegetables and unconstrained grocery store cards provided directly to caregivers over 4 weeks resulted in improvements in child diet, which were sustained over 4 additional weeks. Future work may investigate whether diet improvement from a brief intervention optimized for caregiver flexibility reflects a natural maximum or potential for greater improvements on extension.

Results

In total, we received 184 cards addressed to 75 patients. Nighty-eight per cent of cards were delivered successfully. Of the four cards that we were unable to deliver, three cards were addressed to patients that were discharged by the time of delivery. The final, non-delivered card was submitted to a patient who had unfortunately passed away by the time of delivery.

Figure 2 illustrates the weekly total number of recipients and cards delivered during each of the three cycles. The number of weekly recipients rose from 8 in week 1 to a peak of 15 in week 4, coinciding with the implementation of cycle 2. During the same period, the number of cards delivered rose from 9 to 45. On average, each patient received 3.5 cards from two separate senders. The percentage of the inpatient population that received cards varied from 2% (week 1) and 4% (week 4).

### Reminders of past choices bias decisions for reward in humans [^7c0513e1]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

To aid memory, participants were offered a mnemonic strategy. Specifically, they were told that the photographs could be treated as tickets, which could be placed in one of four imaginary 'pockets': left or right, depending on the slot machine, and front or back, depending on the dollar value. During practice, the keypresses required to advance each trial were instructed in the context of this mnemonic strategy (for example, 'Press 'a' to put the ticket in your left hand, now press 'a' again to put the ticket in your front pocket'. Participants completed two practice trials before beginning the main experiment.

Choice trials. On each choice trial, participants were presented with two slot machines, each on either side of the upper third of the screen (Fig. 2a). The slot machines paid out tickets worth either $5 or −$5. Participants were instructed to press a key corresponding to the slot machine they felt had the best chance of paying out a winning (+$5) ticket rather than a losing (−$5) ticket on that trial. They could choose either the lefthand (key 'a') or righthand (key 'b') slot machine. The slot machines were visually identical, except for their colour (blue and red) and side of the screen, both of which remained fixed throughout the task. The probability of each machine paying a winning ticket changed independently on each trial according to a diffusing Gaussian random walk with reflecting bounds at 30 and 70% (Fig. 2b). At each timestep t, — the probability that machine i would pay out a winning ticket — diffused according to:for each i. The diffusion noise v was selected from a zero-mean Gaussian with standard deviation. The initial payoff probabilities were set to 60% and 40%, with the identity (side, colour) of the superior starting bandit psuedorandomly assigned for each participant.

Optimal training difficulty for binary classification tasks

In a standard binary classification task, an animal or machine 'agent' makes binary decisions about simple stimuli. For example, in the classic Random Dot Motion paradigm from Psychology and Neuroscience, stimuli consist of a patch of moving dots — most moving randomly but a small fraction moving coherently either to the left or the right — and participants must decide in which direction the coherent dots are moving. A major factor in determining the difficulty of this perceptual decision is the fraction of coherently moving dots, which can be manipulated by the experimenter to achieve a fixed error rate during training using a procedure known as 'staircasing'.

We assume that agents make their decision on the basis of a scalar, subjective decision variable, h, which is computed from a stimulus that can be represented as a vector x (e.g. the direction of motion of all dots)where Φ(⋅) is a function of the stimulus and (tunable) parameters ϕ. We assume that this transformation of stimulus x into the subjective decision variable h yields a noisy representation of the true decision variable, Δ (e.g. the fraction of dots moving left). That is, we write

where the noise, n, arises due to the imperfect representation of the decision variable. We further assume that this noise, n, is random and sampled from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation σ (Fig. 1a).

Stool color card

In Japan, stool color cards were included in the Maternal and Child Health Handbook in 2012 to aid in the early diagnosis of BA. If the stool color is similar to card numbers 1, 2, or 3, the infant's family is advised to visit a pediatrician or pediatric surgeon using this system (figure 1). The stool color cards comprise seven digital photographic images, and the stool color is inspected at 14 days and 1–4 months of age. Of the 1177 cases registered between 2012 and 2023, color cards were obtained from 450 patients until 2023. Before 1 month, around 1 month, and after 1 month of age, 55% (n = 121/220), 61% (n = 156/255), and 87% (n = 174/199) of the patients passed card numbers 1, 2 or 3 among cases with stool color cards number recorded, respectively. The rest of the patients passed stools of card numbers 4, 5, 6, or 7. The mean age at surgery was 70.6 days and 60.6 days in 2011 and 2023, respectively. The jaundice clearance rates were 57.8% (n = 63/109) and 64.2% (n = 52/81) in 2011 and 2023, respectively. Stool color cards could be effective for early diagnosis and potentially lead to improved surgical outcomes. However, currently, only approximately half of the registered patients have their stool color numbers recorded. Therefore, it is necessary to further promote the use of stool color cards.

### Effect of guideline based computerised decision support on decision making of multidisciplinary teams: cluster randomised trial in cardiac rehabilitation [^6d9e1da9]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Results

In October 2004 we invited 40 centres that were interested in purchasing CARDSS to participate in the trial. Thirty five (88%) centres accepted this invitation. Of these, four centres were unable to implement the system before the end of the recruitment period because of inadequate information technology infrastructure. Figure 1shows that the remaining 31 centres were assigned to the intervention arm (16 centres) or the control arm (15 centres). Centres were enrolled in the trial between January and December 2005. The last centre completed participation in the trial in July 2006.

Fig 1 Flow of centres through trial

During the trial, five control arm centres discontinued their participation. Three control centres were reluctant to continue participation as they believed that the benefits of CARDSS without computerised decision support did not compensate for the increased workload of learning to work with the system. One control centre had to stop participation because of a temporary lack of personnel, and another centre accidentally deleted its CARDSS database during an update of the server's operating system in the last month of the trial.

The data audit revealed poor data quality in three intervention centres, which we therefore excluded from the analysis; in these centres, participants reported that they were unaware that they had to record their therapeutic decisions in CARDSS after consulting its recommendations. We excluded data from a further one intervention centre and one control centre, as in both centres more than 70% of patients' records missed one or more data items as a result of incorrect use of the system. We analysed data from 21 centres including 2787 patients. Table 1shows the baseline characteristics of both trial arms at the level of centres and patients.

Participants were instructed to not eat for at least 4 h before the experimental session. They were also instructed that they would have to stay after the session to consume what they had obtained and that they could not take any of the food items with them when they leave. This was implemented to make sure participants were hungry and thinking carefully about their choices during the session. The procedure was explained beforehand so that each participant knew that their reward would be based on their choices, and they should make their best decision in every trial.

Each participant was asked to rank 30 single item options by order of preference. Each option was a small food serving. All were calibrated to represent between 20 and 50 calories and to look visually similar. The actual servings were displayed in the experimental room. Participants were given cards, each showing the picture of one serving, and they ranked options by placing cards on a long table. This ranking was used to create 40 bundles, 20 combinations of two same single items, and 20 combinations of two different single items. The participant was then asked to include those bundles in their previous ranking. Asking participants to rank all options allowed us to abstract from nonlinearity effects (complementarity or substitutability between single items) when value was combined. We then selected 11 single item options, 10 combinations of two same single items and 10 combinations of two different single items to include in the experimental task, where each participant made binary choices in the scanner. One of the 11 single item options was a reference option, denoted hereafter by REF. Choices were divided into three conditions (see Figure 1a): CONTROL, SCALING, and BUNDLING. Each participant made choices in all three conditions. In each of the CONTROL trials, the participant had to choose between REF and one of the 10 remaining single items. In each of the SCALING trials, the participant had to choose between REF and one of the 10 combinations of two same single items. In each of the BUNDLING trials, the participant had to choose between REF and one of the 10 combinations of two different single items. SCALING trials were included to control for the effect of quantity. In all cases, REF was off‐screen, it was the same for each trial and it was shown to the participant at the beginning of the experiment. The other option was on‐screen and it was displayed at the beginning of each trial (see Figure 1b). Each individual trial was repeated nine times for a total of 90 trials in each condition. Therefore, each participant made 270 choices in the scanner. In each trial, the circles at the bottom of the screen told the participant what button selected which option, the solid circle always representing REF. The button mappings were randomly assigned for each trial. 1 When the participant responded, the circle representing the chosen option was framed in a square to let the participant know that their answer was recorded. The screen then advanced to a fixation cross for the remainder of the trial. The fMRI task was optimized for detecting neural responses. We used Optsec2, a tool that automatically schedules events for rapid presentation event‐related fMRI experiments. Trials order and inter‐stimulus intervals were optimized for task regressor estimation efficiency (Dale,) and organized into five runs.

### Solving perfect matchings by frequency-grouped multi-photon events using a silicon chip [^559ac16a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In addition, multi-photon processors can enhance classical stochastic algorithms for solving NP problems, such as SAT, max-clique –, and dense subgraph –. The enhancement comes from the positive correlation between perfect matchings counts and the density of the graph. Thus, we can use biased randomness from perfect matchings sampler to enhance stochastic algorithms for these problems. The SAT is the problem of finding an assignment that satisfy the given Boolean formula. A clausal formula can be converted into a graph, and one SAT solution will correspond to a clique of the graph. We set a clausal formula with four clauses. It can be reduced to a 4-Clique problem of an eight-vertex graph shown in Fig. 4 a. The four-photon distribution in 2 h is shown in Fig. 4 b, with a fidelity of 98.25%. The four-vertex subgraph with the most samples is a clique, plotted with the red line in Fig. 4 a. It means that the formula F is satisfiable, and the corresponding assignment is x 1 = True, x 2 = False, and x 3 = True. On the other hand, the densest subgraph problem is defined to find the densest k -vertex subgraph with the largest density from a given n -vertex graph(k < n). No polynomial-time approximation scheme exists for the problem. To avoid being fooled by special graph structures, stochastic algorithms that employ uniform randomness for exploration are always preferable in solving the densest subgraph of a general graph. We verify the enhancement of random search by perfect matchings samples. For example, to find the densest subgraph of a 16-vertex graph with weighted edges as shown in Fig. 4 c, we experimentally obtained the four-photon distribution in 2 h shown in Fig. 4 d, with a fidelity of 92.49%. Note that the perfect matching number of an edge-weighted graph is a more general definition, that the weight of every perfect matching contains a coefficient of the multiplication of the weights of related edges. Then, we use the samples to identify the densest four-vertex subgraph via random search. In the random search, we draw several samples, each containing four vertices, compare the density of the samples, and select the one with the maximum density. We vary the number of samples drawn from 1 to 300 and repeat 400 times for each value. Figure 4 e shows the mean density obtained with a different number of samples. The ideal curve corresponds to the loss-free case. We can see that the protocol whose samples are drawn from the perfect matching solver performs markedly better than the uniform sampling.

### A computerized handheld decision-support system to improve pulmonary embolism diagnosis: a randomized trial [^51aa7106]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Testing for pulmonary embolism often differs from that recommended by evidence-based guidelines.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of a handheld clinical decision-support system to improve the diagnostic work-up of suspected pulmonary embolism among patients in the emergency department.

Design

Cluster randomized trial. Assignment was by random-number table, providers were not blinded, and outcome assessment was automated. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00188032).

Setting

20 emergency departments in France.

Patients

1103 and 1768 consecutive outpatients with suspected pulmonary embolism.

Intervention

After a preintervention period involving 20 centers and 1103 patients, in which providers grew accustomed to inputting clinical data into handheld devices and investigators assessed baseline testing, emergency departments were randomly assigned to activation of a decision-support system on the devices (10 centers, 753 patients) or posters and pocket cards that showed validated diagnostic strategies (10 centers, 1015 patients).

Measurements

Appropriateness of diagnostic work-up, defined as any sequence of tests that yielded a posttest probability less than 5% or greater than 85% (primary outcome) or as strict adherence to guideline recommendations (secondary outcome); number of tests per patient (secondary outcome).

Results

The proportion of patients who received appropriate diagnostic work-ups was greater during the trial than in the preintervention period in both groups, but the increase was greater in the computer-based guidelines group (adjusted mean difference in increase, 19.3 percentage points favoring computer-based guidelines [95% CI, 2.9 to 35.6 percentage points]; P = 0.023). Among patients with appropriate work-ups, those in the computer-based guidelines group received slightly fewer tests than did patients in the paper guidelines group (mean tests per patient, 1.76 [SD, 0.98] vs. 2.25 [SD, 1.04]; P < 0.001).

Limitation

The study was not designed to show a difference in the clinical outcomes of patients during follow-up.

Conclusion

A handheld decision-support system improved diagnostic decision making for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism in the emergency department.

### The association of suicidal ideation with firearm purchasing during a firearm purchasing surge [^4090abc0]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

This survey study followed the American Association for Public Opinion Research reporting guideline. All procedures were approved by the institutional review board at Rutgers University Health Sciences. Participants provided informed consent by selecting a box online indicating they understood the information in the consent document and agreed to participate, and they were compensated in the form and amount they agreed upon when they joined the panel (eg, airline miles, points at preferred retail outlets, cash, gift cards).

Participants and Procedures

Participants included 6404 US residents recruited from 3 states — New Jersey (n = 3197), Minnesota (n = 1789), and Mississippi (n = 1418) — between January and June 2021 using Qualtrics Panels, an online survey platform that maintains a database of millions of US residents. Potential participants were informed that the primary aims of the study were to examine methods individuals use to keep themselves and their loved ones safe and to understand factors that influence the decision to obtain a firearm. Quota sampling was used to enroll a sample matched to 2010 state-level Census distributions for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, and education. Recruitment in Minnesota included an oversampling of zip codes based within Minneapolis and St Paul (982; 54.6% of the statewide sample) in an effort to center this component of the project on the death of George Floyd. Although a precise participation rate is difficult to calculate, the estimate provided by Qualtrics was 54%. Target enrollment was 7500; however, Qualtrics reported delays in data acquisition during early 2021, and data collection was halted in June because of diminished returns (ie, 71.3% of the final sample had been obtained by late March, and 88.2% had been obtained by late April). Women were overrepresented in the full sample and in each statewide subsample; thus, sample weighting was applied. Weights were derived by dividing 2010 statewide Census demographic distributions by sample demographic distributions, such that the weight assigned to each participant was based on the state in which they lived. Weighted data are presented in all text and tables describing the sample. Demographic distributions can be found in Table 1.

### Using a report card to increase HIV screening in a large primary care group practice [^686a776f]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Data collection

The data set was comprised of eligible KP members aged 13–64 who remained on a single PCP panel for at least 6 months prior to the reference date of 31 December 2017. Members were excluded from the data set if they changed PCPs, changed membership status with KP or aged out of the screening guidelines at 65 years. No additional patients were added to the data set after 31 December 2017. HIV testing data were collected by PCP panel and divided into three different PCP groups in order to compare the effects of the HIV screening report card intervention. First, data were collected from the PCPs involved in the intervention (cohort PCP). Second, data from the remaining PCPs in the Department of Adult and Family Medicine at KPOAK were collected as a reference to compare the intervention group to their peers. Third, data from the non-Oakland PCPs were collected as a non-intervention reference. Deidentified, aggregated HIV testing data were extracted from the KPNC regional laboratory data system.

HIV screening report cards

At the start of the study, PCP-specific baseline report cards were given individually to each PCP. The report card showed the per cent of eligible panel members who received HIV testing of their respective patient panel. The report card also ranked PCPs in comparison to their peers in the cohort. Over 12 months, PCPs received a quarterly report card on HIV screening percentages compared with other PCPs in the cohort.

Statistical analysis

We used Poisson regression to model screening rates per 100 people with terms for group (cohort PCP, KPOAK and KPNC), interval (baseline and intervals 1–4) and interaction terms for group/interval. We then measured linear trends in the screening rate over time by group based on χ² tests. We also determined whether the linear trends were different across groups based on the interaction term p values.

### Phase 0 / microdosing approaches: time for mainstream application in drug development? [^98d5620b]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2020). High credibility.

Phase 0 approaches - which include microdosing - evaluate subtherapeutic exposures of new drugs in first-in-human studies known as exploratory clinical trials. Recent progress extends phase 0 benefits beyond assessment of pharmacokinetics to include understanding of mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics. Phase 0 approaches have the potential to improve preclinical candidate selection and enable safer, cheaper, quicker and more informed developmental decisions. Here, we discuss phase 0 methods and applications, highlight their advantages over traditional strategies and address concerns related to extrapolation and developmental timelines. Although challenges remain, we propose that phase 0 approaches be at least considered for application in most drug development scenarios.

### Accuracy of practitioner estimates of probability of diagnosis before and after testing [^2574f738]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Enrollment Procedure

People in leadership positions for group practices or residency programs were contacted and informed of the study. Investigators sought permission to give a short presentation or email introduction that described the study during a group practice meeting. Individual practitioners were then approached by a coordinator and/or physician investigator to request participation. The survey was offered to 723 primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants practicing in Delaware, Maryland, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia (Table 1). The survey was administered in paper format. The coordinator generally remained at the clinic, office, or meeting location until the practitioner had completed the survey. If practitioners requested to complete the survey at a later date, they were provided with an addressed, stamped envelope and could return the survey by mail, email, or clinic drop-off. Respondents were provided with a US $50 gift card for completion, if permitted by their employer.

Table 1.
Survey Responses

Practitioners who initially agreed to participate but did not return the survey within 2 weeks were contacted by study staff via email and/or in person up to 5 times during 3 months. Practitioners who did not complete the survey after these subsequent contacts were considered nonparticipants. Practitioners who declined to participate at initial enrollment or after reminders were asked to provide a reason for not participating from a standardized list to assess for selection bias. Of the contacted practitioners, 585 responded to the survey, and 553 answered all the questions.

Imputed Likelihood Ratios

To understand the adjustment in probability of disease after a positive or negative test result, we calculated an imputed likelihood ratio. By comparing estimated probability of disease before and after testing, we could impute the likelihood ratio that was consciously or unconsciously applied to modify probabilities. The imputed likelihood ratio was calculated by dividing posttest odds by pretest odds, where odds were calculated as probability divided by 1 minus probability. Responses of 0% or 100% were modified to 0.1% and 99.9% to allow for calculation of a likelihood ratio.

Difficult airway — consensus-based evidence and survey scoring indicates validation by consensus from survey opinion from expert consultants, survey opinions from randomly selected samples of active members of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and participating organizations, and internet commentary, with only findings from formal surveys reported. Survey responses were recorded using a five-point scale and summarized based on median values, with categories defined as: strongly agree median score of 5 (at least 50% of the responses are 5), agree median score of 4 (at least 50% of the responses are 4 or 4 and 5), equivocal median score of 3 (at least 50% of the responses are 3, or no other response category or combination of similar categories contains at least 50% of the responses), disagree median score of 2 (at least 50% of responses are 2 or 1 and 2), and strongly disagree median score of 1 (at least 50% of responses are 1). When an equal number of categorically distinct responses are obtained, the median value is determined by calculating the arithmetic mean of the two middle values, and ties are calculated by a predetermined formula.
