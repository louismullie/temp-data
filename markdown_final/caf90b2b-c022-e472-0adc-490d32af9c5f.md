## Question

A 68-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia is found incidentally to have severe stenosis (> 70%) of the superior mesenteric artery and moderate stenosis of the celiac artery on a CT angiogram performed for evaluation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. She denies any abdominal pain, weight loss, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Her physical examination is unremarkable, and laboratory studies are within normal limits. You are asked to outline an appropriate follow-up plan for this patient.

According to current guidelines, what is the recommended follow-up strategy for this asymptomatic patient with severe mesenteric artery occlusive disease?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate follow-up plan for a 68-year-old woman with asymptomatic severe superior mesenteric artery stenosis and moderate celiac stenosis, including whether surveillance is needed, how often it should occur, what modality to use, and when to consider prophylactic revascularization. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and severity on imaging. Then, I should verify the natural history and risk of progression in asymptomatic mesenteric occlusive disease. Next, I will review guideline-directed surveillance recommendations. After that, I need to check thresholds and triggers for intervention. Finally, I will integrate cardiovascular risk optimization and summarize a practical, evidence-based plan with contingencies for symptom development or anatomic progression.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. Severe stenosis is generally defined as greater than 70% luminal narrowing, and in mesenteric arteries this degree of stenosis is considered hemodynamically significant when correlated with symptoms and imaging, with CTA being the preferred definitive modality to characterize anatomy and plan care, so the finding of > 70% SMA stenosis with moderate celiac stenosis is clinically meaningful even if the patient is asymptomatic [^c4ec415b] [^7862c24f].

> Wait, let me verify the natural history before jumping to surveillance. I initially thought most asymptomatic patients with severe MAOD would progress to symptoms, but hold on, I should double-check that. Contemporary data suggest progression from asymptomatic MAOD to symptomatic CMI is actually uncommon in the first 2–3 years, with a recent retrospective series showing 0% progression among 43 asymptomatic patients followed for a mean 32.7 months, and broader epidemiology indicates that while MAOD is not rare, most patients remain asymptomatic, which supports conservative management with surveillance rather than immediate revascularization in the absence of symptoms [^6e6ec2b3] [^af5e7b71].

> Next, I should review guideline-directed surveillance. The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends close monitoring for symptoms and suggests annual evaluation with mesenteric duplex ultrasound as a reasonable schedule for asymptomatic patients with severe MAOD, and the European Society for Vascular Surgery similarly emphasizes structured follow-up with duplex as first-line surveillance after interventions, which we can extrapolate to native severe disease surveillance in asymptomatic patients, acknowledging the evidence quality is low but the consensus is strong [^3c64c8b9] [^2b4fc329] [^f83c1a8c].

> I need to ensure the surveillance modality and thresholds are appropriate. Mesenteric duplex ultrasound is the preferred noninvasive screening tool for MAOD, with fasting studies improving visualization, and for native arteries, SMA peak systolic velocity around 275–300 cm/s correlates with significant stenosis, though post-intervention criteria differ and velocities tend to be higher, so I should interpret any duplex abnormalities in context and confirm with CTA if symptoms arise or if velocities rise substantially from baseline [^c4ec415b] [^c850cdf9] [^0cac4d95].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about intervention. I should confirm when prophylactic revascularization is reasonable. Revascularization is not indicated for asymptomatic single-vessel disease; however, in select asymptomatic patients with severe multivessel disease, particularly involving the SMA, a shared decision-making discussion may be considered, and some guidelines allow consideration of prophylactic revascularization only in asymptomatic patients with significant stenosis or occlusion of all three mesenteric vessels after careful risk–benefit analysis, which is not the case here with only two-vessel involvement and preserved collaterals [^2b4fc329] [^09249546] [^2499adc2].

> Let me consider patient-specific modifiers. Age, comorbidities, life expectancy, and access to care influence the threshold for prophylactic therapy; in patients with limited life expectancy or high surgical risk, the net benefit of prophylactic revascularization is unlikely, whereas in younger, low-risk patients with extensive disease, some experts may discuss prophylaxis, but again, the evidence base is weak and decisions should be individualized [^232a7717] [^2b4fc329].

> I should confirm that cardiovascular risk optimization is part of the plan. Patients with atherosclerotic mesenteric disease should have their cardiovascular risk profile assessed and secondary prevention optimized, including statin therapy, blood pressure control, diabetes management, smoking cessation, and antiplatelet therapy when indicated for global atherosclerotic risk reduction, even though antiplatelet therapy is not specifically for mesenteric symptom prevention in this context [^bdbf7a24] [^6b7a3b6e] [^727b0098].

> Next, I should review what to do if symptoms develop or imaging progresses. If the patient develops postprandial pain, weight loss, or food fear, I should expedite evaluation with CTA and proceed to revascularization if significant stenoses are confirmed, with endovascular therapy as the first-line approach given lower perioperative morbidity, reserving open surgery for anatomically unsuitable lesions or failed endovascular therapy [^c4ec415b] [^2b4fc329] [^f553a3ff].

> Putting this together, my practical, evidence-based plan is as follows: establish baseline with a vascular surgery referral and document current symptom status. Initiate annual mesenteric duplex ultrasound surveillance with fasting studies to assess SMA and celiac velocities. Reinforce symptom education so the patient reports new postprandial pain, weight loss, or food fear promptly. Optimize cardiovascular risk factors and continue best medical therapy. And reserve revascularization for symptom onset or, in rare select cases of asymptomatic multivessel disease with high-risk features after shared decision-making, recognizing that current guidelines do not recommend routine prophylactic revascularization for isolated severe SMA stenosis without symptoms [^3c64c8b9] [^2b4fc329] [^2499adc2].

For an asymptomatic 68-year-old woman with severe SMA stenosis (> 70%) and moderate celiac stenosis, **no immediate revascularization is indicated** [^2499adc2]. The recommended approach is **annual surveillance with mesenteric duplex ultrasound** [^3c64c8b9] and aggressive cardiovascular risk modification (high-intensity statin, antiplatelet therapy, blood pressure control, smoking cessation, and diabetes optimization) [^bdbf7a24] [^727b0098]. Revascularization is only considered if symptoms of chronic mesenteric ischemia develop or if duplex shows progression to critical stenosis or occlusion. This strategy balances the low risk of progression in asymptomatic patients [^6e6ec2b3] with the potential risks of intervention [^f553a3ff].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) 2021 guidelines**: Recommend close monitoring for symptoms in asymptomatic patients with severe mesenteric artery occlusive disease (MAOD) [^2b4fc329], with annual mesenteric duplex ultrasound as a reasonable surveillance modality [^3c64c8b9].

- **European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2025 guidelines**: Emphasize cardiovascular risk assessment and secondary prevention in asymptomatic patients with atherosclerotic mesenteric artery disease [^bdbf7a24], with no routine recommendation for prophylactic revascularization.

- **European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2024 guidelines**: Explicitly recommend against revascularization of asymptomatic atherosclerotic visceral artery stenosis [^2499adc2].

---

## Natural history and risk of progression

Asymptomatic MAOD is relatively common, especially in older adults with atherosclerotic risk factors [^af5e7b71]; however, progression to symptomatic chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is **infrequent** [^6e6ec2b3]. A retrospective study of 79 patients with > 70% SMA or celiac stenosis found that none of the 43 asymptomatic patients progressed to CMI over a mean follow-up of 32.7 months, whereas symptomatic patients were more likely to have severe SMA stenosis, multivessel disease, and calcified aortic plaque [^6e6ec2b3]. These findings support a conservative approach in asymptomatic patients, given the low risk of progression and the potential risks associated with intervention [^6e6ec2b3].

---

## Recommended follow-up strategy

Based on current guidelines and evidence, the following follow-up strategy is recommended:

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Surveillance imaging | Annual mesenteric duplex ultrasound [^3c64c8b9] to monitor for progression of stenosis or development of collateral flow patterns [^c850cdf9] |
| Clinical monitoring | Regular clinical assessment for symptoms of CMI, including postprandial abdominal pain, weight loss, and food fear [^f20503a8] |
| Cardiovascular risk modification | Aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors, including high-intensity statin therapy, antiplatelet therapy (aspin), blood pressure control, smoking cessation, and diabetes optimization [^727b0098] [^bdbf7a24] |
| Indications for intervention | Revascularization should be considered only if the patient becomes symptomatic or if duplex ultrasound demonstrates progression to critical stenosis (> 70%) or occlusion [^c4ec415b] |

---

## Rationale for conservative management

Conservative management with surveillance and risk modification is appropriate because:

- **Low progression risk**: Asymptomatic patients have a low risk of progression to symptomatic CMI [^6e6ec2b3].

- **Potential intervention risks**: Revascularization carries risks of procedural complications, restenosis, and recurrent symptoms [^21e8a2c1].

- **Lack of benefit**: There is no proven benefit to prophylactic revascularization in asymptomatic patients [^2499adc2].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

For an asymptomatic 68-year-old woman with severe SMA stenosis and moderate celiac stenosis, **conservative management with annual mesenteric duplex ultrasound surveillance and aggressive cardiovascular risk modification is recommended** [^3c64c8b9] [^bdbf7a24]. Revascularization should be reserved for patients who develop symptoms or demonstrate progression to critical stenosis or occlusion. This approach aligns with current guidelines and evidence, balancing the low risk of progression with the potential risks of intervention [^2499adc2].

Background

Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) results from the inability to achieve adequate postprandial intestinal blood flow, usually from atherosclerotic occlusive disease at the origins of the mesenteric vessels. Patients typically present with postprandial pain, food fear, and weight loss, although they can present with acute mesenteric ischemia and bowel infarction. The diagnosis requires a combination of the appropriate clinical symptoms and significant mesenteric artery occlusive disease, although it is often delayed given the spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders associated with abdominal pain and weight loss. The treatment goals include relieving the presenting symptoms, preventing progression to acute mesenteric ischemia, and improving overall quality of life. These practice guidelines were developed to provide the best possible evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with CMI from atherosclerosis.

Methods

The Society for Vascular Surgery established a committee composed of vascular surgeons and individuals experienced with evidence-based reviews. The committee focused on six specific areas, including the diagnostic evaluation, indications for treatment, choice of treatment, perioperative evaluation, endovascular/open revascularization, and surveillance/remediation. A formal systematic review was performed by the evidence team to identify the optimal technique for revascularization. Specific practice recommendations were developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system based on review of literature, the strength of the data, and consensus.

Results

Patients with symptoms consistent with CMI should undergo an expedited workup, including a computed tomography arteriogram, to exclude other potential causes. The diagnosis is supported by significant arterial occlusive disease in the mesenteric vessels, particularly the superior mesenteric artery. Treatment requires revascularization with the primary target being the superior mesenteric artery. Endovascular revascularization with a balloon-expandable covered intraluminal stent is the recommended initial treatment with open repair reserved for select younger patients and those who are not endovascular candidates. Long-term follow-up and surveillance are recommended after revascularization and for asymptomatic patients with severe mesenteric occlusive disease. Patient with recurrent symptoms after revascularization owing to recurrent stenoses should be treated with an endovascular-first approach, similar to the de novo lesion.

Conclusions

These practice guidelines were developed based on the best available evidence. They should help to optimize the care of patients with CMI. Multiple areas for future research were identified.

Mesenteric arteries — clinical context and treatment options indicate that chronic mesenteric arterial insufficiency is manifested by postprandial pain and weight loss and, if untreated, is a potentially fatal condition; open reconstruction options include transaortic endarterectomy of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries, antegrade bypass from the supraceliac aorta to the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries, and retrograde bypass from the infrarenal aorta or an iliac artery to the superior mesenteric and celiac arteries; endovascular approaches consist of balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting, often using balloon-expandable stents due to ostial stenoses and plaque recoil; open surgical repair is described as more durable than endovascular repair, yet because patients are typically malnourished, frail, and poor candidates for major surgery, endovascular intervention has become the more frequent modality, trading increased risk of recurrent stenosis or occlusion for lower periprocedural morbidity and mortality.

Asymptomatic severe MAOD — selection for prophylactic revascularization — revascularization may be justified in a small subset with severe disease involving all three mesenteric vessels, with close monitoring and counseling; revascularization may be justified for noncompliant patients or those with limited access to medical care, and revascularization is also likely indicated in the presence of vague or nonspecific abdominal pain given the potential adverse sequelae, including progression to acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI).

### Risk stratification in patients with asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms… [^4938ede0]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Numbers with Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes categories refer to estimated glomerular filtration rates in milliliters per minute per 1. 73 meters squared. COPD indicates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves show overall survival after elective treatment of intact abdominal aortic aneurysms stratified by risk score and type of treatment. Numbers at risk reflect the weighted pseudopopulation. Shaded areas denote 95% CIs. Estimators were trimmed at 15 years and if the number at risk was less than 20 in any group. The risk score is presented in Figure 1. Of 6891 identified patients, 5757 were men. Women were older, more often had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and had lower estimated glomerular filtration rate compared with men.

No differences in 10-year incidence of secondary AAA ruptures or solid malignant tumor were detected. The choice of surgical technique for elective abdominal aortic aneurysms is a challenge because multiple factors should be considered when individualizing treatment. Comorbidities and secondary outcomes were defined on the basis of the validated items of the Elixhauser score. 11 The Danish National Patient Registry was used to identify all patients older than 60 years treated for nonruptured AAA between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2023, to extract comorbidities at the time of treatment, and to extract diagnoses given during follow-up, as well as date of death. The primary outcome was overall survival.

Secondary outcomes included incidence rates of cardiovascular diagnosis, as well as oncological diagnosis. Between 2004 and 2023, 10 852 patients older than 60 years underwent infrarenal repair of a nonruptured AAA in Denmark. After excluding 3961 patients without preoperative creatinine measurements available, 6891 remained for analysis, with 3926 undergoing OSR and 2965 treated with EVAR. Table 1 shows baseline characteristics of the 6891 analyzed patients by risk group. At the time of treatment, women were significantly older, more often had COPD, and had lower eGFR compared with men. In low-to-moderate-risk patients, EVAR had a significantly higher early RMST, which diminished over time, becoming nonsignificant after 8. 9 years. In moderate-to-high-risk patients, EVAR's early advantage in RMST persisted, resulting in a 9-month longer RMST at 12. 5 years. For high-risk patients, EVAR's early RMST advantage became nonsignificant after 8. 7 years. On the other hand, new diagnosis of heart failure was recorded more often after OSR in 15. 0% of patients after 10 years compared with
13. 0% of patients undergoing EVAR. 35), lymphoma, or tumor metastasis, as well as new-onset of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, dialysis, diabetes, or COPD between patients treated with OSR and EVAR.

Mesenteric artery occlusive disease (MAOD) prevalence and its relationship to symptoms — screening and pathology data: The presence of MAOD, in contradistinction to CMI, is quite common, with one report noting that 17% of independent, elderly adults (n = 553) had significant occlusive disease in the celiac artery or superior mesenteric artery on routine mesenteric duplex ultrasound screening; there were no deaths attributable to mesenteric infarction at follow-up (mean, 6.5 years) and none of the surveyed survivors (71%) reported symptoms consistent with CMI. Unselected autopsy studies reported a stenosis of 50% or more in at least one mesenteric vessel in up to 10% of patients, and almost 30% of patients undergoing catheter-based arteriography before peripheral artery revascularization had a comparable degree of stenosis in either the celiac artery or superior mesenteric artery.

Rationale and background — management of recurrent disease after chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) revascularization emphasizes surveillance imaging criteria and an endovascular-first strategy: "Patients may develop recurrent stenoses and/or recurrent symptoms after both endovascular and open revascularization for CMI". It is noted that "endovascular revascularization is associated with a higher rate of recurrent stenoses and symptoms". For imaging thresholds, "DUS examination is the optimal surveillance imaging study after revascularization although the criteria for the native arteries tend to overestimate the degree of stenosis (ie, 70% stenosis in treated arteries associated with higher PSV and EDV). CTA can help to confirm or refute the DUS findings". Treatment scope states, "The management of significant recurrent stenoses, both asymptomatic and symptomatic, should be the same as outlined for de novo lesions", and specifically, "patients with recurrent CMI should undergo revascularization with an endovascular-first approach, regardless of the initial approach, whereas open revascularization should be reserved for patients who are not amenable to the endovascular approach". Additionally, "A select group of patients with asymptomatic recurrent stenosis may also benefit from reintervention, but the exact indications for such reintervention remain undefined".

### Chronic mesenteric ischemia: critical review and guidelines for management [^a34a71f9]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

CMI is caused by chronic occlusive disease of mesenteric arteries. In such an uncommon disease, clear recommendations are strongly needed. Unfortunately, treatment options for symptomatic CMI are still controversial and no guidelines exist.

Methods

A systematic literature review of the last 25-years was conducted through MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Review/Trials register to identify studies reporting on CMI treatment with more than 10 patients. Primary outcomes were perioperative mortality and morbidity rates. Secondary outcomes were survival rates, primary and secondary patency rates, vessels treated, CMI recurrence, follow-up (FU), technical success (TS), and in-hospital length of stay (InH-LOS). Patients were divided into endovascular treatment (ET) or open treatment (OT) groups. Subsequently, primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed by study publication year for the interval periods 1986–2000 ("A") and 2001–2010 ("B"). Differences were assessed using the t-test and the χ² test.

Results

Forty-three articles with 1,795 patients were included. Perioperative mortality and morbidity rates were lower in the ET group. No difference in survival rate was observed. Primary and secondary patencies were superior in the OT group. A greater number of vessels were revascularized in the OT group. CMI recurrence was more frequent in the ET group. FU was longer in the OT group. TS was superior in the OT group and InH-LOS was shorter in the ET group. A higher number of patients were treated by ET in the period "A". No differences in mortality and morbidity were observed between period "A" and "B" in ET and OT groups.

Conclusions

Considering the lower periprocedural mortality and morbidity after ET, this approach should be considered as the first treatment option in most CMI patients, especially in those with severe malnutrition. Primary OT should be restricted to cases that do not qualify for ET or good surgical risk patients with long life expectancy. Considering better long-term results of OT, ET treatment should be considered as a bridge therapy to OT in some patients requiring retreatment if ET does not preclude subsequent OT.

Continued surveillance for stent or graft restenosis is important, as AMI after mesenteric revascularization accounts for 6–8% of late deaths.

Patients undergoing revascularization should have surveillance imaging obtained via CTA or duplex ultrasound within 6 months, with frequent follow-up to enable early intervention for recurrent disease. Current Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines recommend duplex ultrasonography at 1, 6, and 12 months after the intervention, and then annually thereafter.

Long-term care should be focused on the patient's underlying medical comorbidities in order to minimize the risk of relapse. Lifestyle modification as well as management of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes is necessary.

### Natural history of asymptomatic mesenteric artery occlusive disease and predictors of symptomatic progression [^6e6ec2b3]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to characterize the natural history of incidentally identified asymptomatic mesenteric artery stenosis and to identify clinical and radiographic predictors that differentiate patients with asymptomatic mesenteric artery occlusive disease (MAOD) and patients with symptomatic chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) diagnosed at the index study.

Methods

This single-institution retrospective analysis included patients diagnosed with > 70% stenosis of the celiac or superior mesenteric artery (SMA) on axial imaging or duplex ultrasound examination in an institutional radiology database. Patients were grouped into asymptomatic MAOD and symptomatic CMI cohorts according to their clinical presentation at index study. The primary end point was progression of disease from asymptomatic stenosis to CMI. Demographic, clinical, and imaging features at index study were also compared between asymptomatic and symptomatic cohorts.

Results

Seventy-nine patients met the inclusion criteria, with 43 in the asymptomatic group and 36 in the symptomatic group. Patients in the asymptomatic group were followed for mean 32.7 ± 30.2 months; 60.5% (n = 26) were referred to and followed by a vascular surgeon for 21.5 ± 27.8 months. No asymptomatic patients developed symptoms during the follow-up period. All patients in the symptomatic group were evaluated by a vascular surgeon and underwent procedural intervention for CMI within 6 months of diagnosis. Patients with CMI were more likely to have a history of smoking (P = 0.02) and less likely to be anticoagulated (P < .01) than patients with asymptomatic MAOD. Symptomatic patients trended toward a greater prevalence of coronary artery disease (P = 0.06) and a lower prevalence of arrhythmia (P = 0.08). On imaging, the symptomatic cohort was more likely to have severe SMA stenosis (P < .001), multivessel mesenteric disease (P = 0.001), calcified aortic plaque (P = 0.01), and severe stenosis in one or both internal iliac arteries (P < .001). On multivariable analysis, a lack of anticoagulation use (P < .01) and severe SMA stenosis (P < .001) were associated independently with higher odds of symptomatic mesenteric stenosis. Although statistically insignificant, calcified aortic plaque (P = 0.08) and smoking history (P = 0.06) trended toward higher odds of symptomatic index presentation.

Conclusions

The rate of progression from asymptomatic MAOD to CMI seems to be exceedingly low in the first 2 to 3 years after diagnosis, suggesting that prophylactic revascularization is mostly unnecessary. Surveillance of asymptomatic MAOD may be personalized based on clinical and radiographic features of disease. SMA stenosis severity, anticoagulation use, and possibly smoking history and the presence of aortic plaque calcification may be promising markers to stratify the risk of ischemic progression.

### Chronic mesenteric ischemia: clinical practice guidelines from the Society for Vascular Surgery [^56cbd1ca]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia — post-revascularization surveillance schedules and imaging criteria are outlined as follows: A practical longer term follow-up protocol may include clinic evaluation and image-based surveillance within 1 month of the initial procedure and then every 6 months for the first 2 years and yearly thereafter. DUS examination is the ideal initial imaging study for the detection of recurrent stenoses, while CTA is the definitive imaging study for recurrent stenosis and can be helpful to confirm/refute DUS findings and plan intervention. For suspected hemodynamically significant restenosis, a PSV of more than 300 cm/s with an EDV of more than 50 cm/s at an angioplasty site or bypass anastomosis, or a dampened velocity spectra and a PSV of less than 40 cm/s within a bypass graft, are all suggestive of a greater than 70% stenosis. In equivocal cases, a catheter-based arteriogram with measurement of intraluminal pressures may occasionally be helpful to determine the hemodynamic significance of a recurrent stenosis.

### Chronic mesenteric ischemia: clinical practice guidelines from the Society for Vascular Surgery [^5d1f32f5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia — management of symptomatic recurrent stenosis mirrors initial symptomatic lesions and emphasizes advanced imaging and endovascular therapy: The management of patients with a recurrent stenosis and recurrent symptoms consistent with CMI is similar to the management of a symptomatic de novo lesion. Patients should undergo a CTA to facilitate the intervention, if not already performed. An endovascular-first approach is recommended for both failing endovascular and open revascularization with procedure specifics based on lesion extent and thrombus, with options including balloon angioplasty alone for in-stent stenosis and/or the placement of a balloon-expandable covered stent within a bare metal stent.

### Chronic mesenteric ischemia: how to select patients for invasive treatment [^2577bacf]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) remains a well-described disease process that is difficult to diagnose. Since its initial description more than a century ago, a myriad of diagnostic and treatment modalities have been applied to ameliorate the classic symptoms of postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss. It is estimated that mesenteric occlusive disease affects approximately 1% to 18% of the population, with a majority of these patients manifesting no symptoms of CMI. While associated with a small prevalence, the potential economic impact of this disease process, with the increasing age of the population and the catastrophic outcomes associated with no treatment, is significant. The primary etiology of CMI is atherosclerotic occlusive disease involving the ostia of the mesenteric arteries. Several studies have investigated the pathophysiology of the postprandial abdominal pain associated with ischemia focusing on transport mechanisms, claudication of the intestinal musculature, and ischemia of the visceral nerves. The process of diagnosing CMI involves assimilation of the presentation, typical history and physical examination findings, and results of imaging modalities. At the end of this diagnostic process, the decision to offer a patient surgical intervention is primarily based on symptomatology and results of duplex and other imaging modalities. There are specific criteria for which to offer symptomatic patients interventions. Patients who are asymptomatic do not need to undergo revascularization, which may disrupt collateral arterial circulation to the mesentery. They should be followed conservatively.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia — single-vessel disease and classic teaching note that there is likely a role for revascularization in patients with symptoms consistent with CMI and occlusive disease isolated to a single mesenteric vessel, particularly the SMA. Although classic teaching stressed that patients cannot develop CMI unless at least two of the three mesenteric vessels are involved, this teaching point is likely incorrect because it is possible to develop CMI from isolated mesenteric involvement, usually with a poor collateral network between vessels. The common scenario is significant occlusive disease isolated to the SMA or CA with vague abdominal complaints, and treatment decisions balance the natural history of untreated CMI with the risks and costs of open or endovascular treatment.

Objective

The European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) has developed clinical practice guidelines for the care of patients with diseases of the mesenteric and renal arteries and veins, in succession to the first 2017 guidelines, with the aim of assisting physicians and patients in selecting the best management strategy.

Methods

These guidelines are based on scientific evidence and expert opinion. By summarising and evaluating the best available evidence, recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of patients have been formulated. The recommendations are graded according to the new ESVS clinical practice guidelines class of recommendation grading system, where the strength (class) of each recommendation is graded from I to III, and the letter A to C marks the level of evidence.

Results

A total of 102 recommendations have been issued on the management of chronic arterial mesenteric ischaemia, median arcuate ligament syndrome, acute arterial mesenteric ischaemia, non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia, venous mesenteric thrombosis and ischaemia, occlusive disease of the renal arteries and veins, visceral artery aneurysms, and spontaneous isolated dissection of the visceral arteries.

Conclusion

These 2025 ESVS clinical practice guidelines provide comprehensive and up to date advice to physicians and patients on the management of diseases of the mesenteric and renal arteries and veins.

Duplex ultrasonography is the preferred noninvasive screening test for superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and celiac artery (CA) stenosis. Although postprandial increases in SMA peak systolic velocity (PSV) are known to occur, the principal duplex criteria for hemodynamically significant SMA and CA stenosis are based on fasting flow velocities. In the SMA, a PSV ≥ 275 cm/s predicts a ≥ 70% angiographic stenosis with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 96%, whereas a CA PSV of ≥ 200 cm/sec predicts a ≥ 70% stenosis with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 80%. Patients with appropriate symptoms of chronic visceral ischemia and a duplex scan showing high-grade stenosis of the SMA, especially when combined with CA stenosis, should have a confirmatory mesenteric angiogram. This approach will facilitate prompt intervention in these patients. If the duplex examination indicates widely patent mesenteric arteries, alternative diagnoses should be investigated. Other applications of mesenteric duplex scanning include evaluation of median arcuate ligament syndrome and postoperative surveillance of mesenteric artery revascularizations.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on follow-up after vascular surgery arterial procedures [^3a232ff8]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Although follow-up after open surgical and endovascular procedures is generally regarded as an important part of the care provided by vascular surgeons, there are no detailed or comprehensive guidelines that specify the optimal approaches with regard to testing methods, indications for reintervention, and follow-up intervals. To provide guidance to the vascular surgeon, the Clinical Practice Council of the Society for Vascular Surgery appointed an expert panel and a methodologist to review the current clinical evidence and to develop recommendations for follow-up after vascular surgery procedures. For those procedures for which high-quality evidence was not available, recommendations were based on observational studies, committee consensus, and indirect evidence. Recognizing that there are numerous published reports on the role of duplex ultrasound for surveillance of infrainguinal vein bypass grafts, the Society commissioned a systematic review and meta-analysis on this topic. The panel classified the strength of each recommendation and the corresponding quality of evidence on the basis of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system: recommendations were graded either strong or weak, and the quality of evidence was graded high, moderate, or low. The resulting recommendations represent a wide variety of open surgical and endovascular procedures involving the extracranial carotid artery, thoracic and abdominal aorta, mesenteric and renal arteries, and lower extremity arterial revascularization. The panel also identified many areas in which there was a lack of high-quality evidence to support their recommendations. This suggests that there are opportunities for further clinical research on testing methods, threshold criteria, and the role of surveillance as well as on the modes of failure and indications for reintervention after vascular surgery procedures.

### Chronic mesenteric ischemia: clinical practice guidelines from the Society for Vascular Surgery [^c4ec415b]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) diagnostic evaluation — recommendations specify the initial workup and preferred imaging. We recommend an expedited workup in patients with abdominal pain, weight loss, and food fear to exclude other causes, which may include esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, abdominal computed tomography (CT), and abdominal ultrasound (Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong). Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)). We recommend making a diagnosis of CMI in patients with the appropriate clinical scenario and significant stenoses (> 70%) within the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and the diagnosis maybe also made with a significant stenosis (> 70%) in either the celiac axis or SMA alone (Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong). Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)). We recommend using the mesenteric duplex ultrasound (DUS) examination as the preferred screening test for mesenteric artery occlusive disease (MAOD) (Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong). Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)). We recommend using CT arteriography (CTA) as the preferred definitive imaging test for MAOD unless unusual anatomic features obscure the anatomy such that a catheter-based arteriogram may be required (Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong). Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)).

### Treatment guidelines for isolated dissection of the superior mesenteric artery based on follow-up CT findings [^f57a0805]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The treatment guidelines for isolated superior mesenteric artery dissection (SMAD) are not well established. The purpose of this study was to report a single-centre series of SMAD and propose treatment guidelines.

Materials and Methods

Between November 2004 and December 2009, 30 patients were diagnosed with SMAD. We retrospectively reviewed their medical records.

Results

The subjects included 26 men and four women, with a mean age of 55.1 years. The chief complaint was abdominal pain in 17 patients, whereas 13 patients were asymptomatic. The mean follow-up was 38.3 months. The radiographic findings included intimal flap with a false lumen in 20 patients and intramural haematoma in 10 patients. The treatments included observation in 18 patients, anticoagulation in five patients, stenting in six patients and surgery in one patient. During follow-up (mean 15.6 months), there was no change in the computed tomography scans of seven patients, improvement was observed in four patients and complete resolution was observed in four patients. All patients, including the symptomatic patients, remained asymptomatic during follow-up.

Conclusions

Most patients with SMAD can be successfully managed with conservative treatment. Surgical treatment or percutaneous intervention can be reserved for patients with severe mesenteric ischaemia and those for whom the initial conservative treatment fails.

Chronic Mesenteric Ischaemia

Post-interventional antiplatelet therapy is essential to prevent early stent thrombosis. Although no comparative studies have been conducted to identify the best pharmacotherapy regimen after angioplasty and/or stenting of visceral arteries, most interventionalists use the same medications as for renal or carotid artery stenting, namely, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 100 mg daily lifelong combined during the 1st month with clopidogrel 75 mg daily.

Follow-up after angioplasty or stenting of a visceral artery consists mainly in clinical monitoring of changes in CMI symptoms such as post-prandial abdominal pain, weight loss, and intermittent diarrhoea. Follow-up imaging of the treated visceral artery can be performed at pre-defined intervals or only if typical symptoms recur. Duplex US and/or CTA may be performed depending on local practice and the patient's general condition including body habitus and renal function. Magnetic resonance angiography is not indicated after visceral artery stenting given the major artifacts produced by stainless steel and cobalt-chrome stents. Prior to repeat angioplasty or stenting, recurrent stenosis should be confirmed with catheter angiography.

### Chronic mesenteric ischemia: clinical practice guidelines from the Society for Vascular Surgery [^1725d236]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia — rationale, targets, and expected benefits: The SMA is the optimal target for revascularization and revascularization of the SMA alone is usually sufficient given the extensive mesenteric collateral network, whereas revascularization of the CA or IMA alone should likely be reserved for scenarios when revascularization of the SMA is inadequate or not feasible. It is possible for patients to develop symptoms consistent with CMI with occlusive disease isolated to the SMA despite the traditional teaching that it requires involvement of at least two mesenteric vessels, and revascularization is indicated in this scenario given the potential adverse sequelae and the resolution of symptoms can actually serve as a diagnostic tool for CMI in patients with equivocal symptoms. There is essentially no role for prolonged total parenteral nutrition given the associated risks and prolonged attempts to optimize the nutritional status before revascularization may be harmful. Untreated patients with CMI can clearly waste away from inanition and/or progress to AMI, and it has been reported that the 5-year mortality rate for untreated patients approaches 100%, and furthermore, up to 50% of patients with AMI present with thrombosis of an existing lesion and antecedent symptoms consistent with CMI. Revascularization, either open or endovascular, has been associated with excellent results in terms of both symptomatic relief and long-term graft or mesenteric vessel patency and was associated with an overall improvement in quality of life with improvement within the activities and pain/discomfort domains.

### Midterm results after covered stenting of the superior mesenteric artery [^d656b258]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite the continuing controversy of covered stents (CS) vs bare metal stents, the use of CS in mesenteric occlusive disease (MOD) has been recommended by expert centers. The aim of this study was to report midterm results with CS of the superior mesenteric artery.

Methods

Between January 2014 and October 2019, patients with MOD with a severe atheromatous stenosis or occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery treated by mesenteric CS were included. Clinical presentation included both acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI), chronic mesenteric ischemia, and asymptomatic patients planned for major surgery. Demographics, procedure details, and follow-up data were prospectively collected and retrospectively reviewed. Study end points included primary patency, primary assisted patency, and secondary patency.

Results

During the study period, 86 patients (mean age, 70 ± 9 years; 57% males) were included. Clinical presentation was AMI (n = 42 [49%]), chronic mesenteric ischemia (n = 31 [36%]), and asymptomatic (n = 13 [15%]). The technical success rate was 97%. A total of 96 stents were implanted, including 86 proximal CS (Advanta V12, n = 73; Lifestream, n = 13). The mean length and mean diameter of the CS were 31.5 ± 6.3 mm and 6.9 ± 0.5 mm, respectively. Additional distal bare metal stents were used in 10 patients (12%) to overcome a kinking (n = 9) or a dissection (n = 1) downstream of the CS. All postoperative deaths occurred in patients with AMI (n = 11, 13%). During a median follow-up of 15.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.6 ± 3.6 months), 12 patients (14%) underwent reinterventions for either stent misplacement (n = 3), stent recoil (n = 3), stent thrombosis (n = 2), de novo stenosis at the distal edge of the CS (n = 2), or gastric ischemia (n = 1). At 1 year, overall the primary patency, primary assisted patency, and secondary patency rates were 83% (95% CI, 83% ± 9%), 99% (95% CI, 99% ± 3%), and 99% (95% CI, 99% ± 3%), respectively. At 2 years, the overall primary patency, primary assisted patency, and secondary patency rates were 76% (95% CI, 76% ± 13%), 95% (95% CI, 95% ± 8%) and 95% (95% CI, 95% ± 8%), respectively.

Conclusions

Mesenteric CS provide very satisfactory midterm results in patients with MOD, with an excellent primary assisted patency rate at 2 years, at the price of a significant reintervention rate.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaImaging of mesenteric ischemia [^a9866ba2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Mesenteric ischemia is an uncommon condition resulting from decreased blood flow to the small or large bowel in an acute or chronic setting. Acute ischemia is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality; however, it is difficult to diagnose clinically. Therefore, a high degree of suspicion and prompt imaging evaluation are necessary. Chronic mesenteric ischemia is less common and typically caused by atherosclerotic occlusion or severe stenosis of at least two of the main mesenteric vessels. While several imaging examination options are available for the initial evaluation of both acute and chronic mesenteric ischemia, CTA of the abdomen and pelvis is overall the most appropriate choice for both conditions. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

For diagnosis, "CTA is currently recommended as the first-line imaging study for mesenteric ischemia (both acute and chronic)". For therapy, "Endovascular treatment with angioplasty and intraluminal stents has largely replaced open surgical bypass as the first treatment option for mesenteric revascularization", with use that "has increased 10-fold over the past decade and now accounts for more than 70% of the initial revascularization procedures". Symptom patterns "do not occur unless at least two of the mesenteric vessels are involved", though "symptoms can develop in patients with single vessel disease, particularly the SMA".

### Management strategy based on disease stages for patients with symptomatic isolated mesenteric artery dissection [^da0966ac]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

An optimal treatment regimen is sought for symptomatic isolated mesenteric artery dissection (IMAD) on the basis of its clinical staging.

Methods

From January 2011 to December 2018, 120 patients with symptomatic IMAD from two institutions were collected retrospectively. We reviewed the clinical features, risk factors, computed tomography (CT) images, treatment modalities, and follow-up results to propose a new management strategy based on the clinical stages of the disease.

Results

A total of 120 patients were collected in this study; 77 patients (69 men, 8 women; median age, 52.53 years; range, 39–73 years) who had undergone successful conservative management with antithrombotic agents were included in group A. The remaining 43 patients (34 men, 9 women; median age, 52.63 years; range, 26–66 years) who underwent invasive therapy were included in group B. Significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to dissection length (50.72 ± 27.72 mm vs. 62 ± 24.3 mm; P = 0.02), true lumen residual diameter (3.31 ± 1.05 mm vs. 2.83 ± 2.05 mm; P = 0.01), and branch involvement (8 and 19, respectively; P < 0.001). Success was achieved in 76.24% (77/101) of patients treated by conservative management with antithrombotic agents in the acute stage; 43 patients underwent invasive interventional therapy in different stages of symptomatic IMAD. In group A, 6 patients had recurrent abdominal pain, three of whom underwent invasive intervention, and the remaining patients improved after conservative treatment. Positive remodeling was observed in 80.33% (49/61) of patients treated with conservative management alone versus 19.67% (12/61) of patients who experienced negative remodeling. Endovascular intervention in group B, CT angiography, or mesenteric angiography yielded complete remodeling in 23 (76.67%, 23/30) patients and evidence of stent restenosis in 7 (23.33%, 7/30) patients. Among the surgical patients, 7 patients showed improvement in the luminal diameter. However, 3 patients with short bowel syndrome require long-term parenteral nutrition.

Conclusions

Conservative management with antithrombotic agents should be a first-line regimen for symptomatic IMAD in the acute stage. If symptoms persist, endovascular intervention is a safe and feasible treatment in the subacute or chronic stage. When peritonitis is present, surgical treatment should be promptly performed, regardless of the disease stage.

### Assessment and management of peripheral arterial disease: what every cardiologist should know [^5ee8c99c]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Mesenteric artery disease

Acute or chronic mesenteric ischaemia is uncommon but carries high mortality rates if not treated promptly. The classic symptoms of chronic mesenteric artery disease are food aversion from postprandial abdominal pain, weight loss and diarrhoea or constipation. Due to robust collateral circulation patients typically only develop symptoms when there is severe disease in two out of the three main arterial systems: coeliac trunk, superior mesenteric artery and inferior mesenteric artery. Revascularisation is indicated for all symptomatic patients with chronic mesenteric ischaemia. As these patients tend to be older with multiple comorbidities, endovascular approach with primary stenting is typically the first option to minimise perioperative complications. If patient is a lower risk surgical candidate, surgical repair offers more symptom relief and higher primary patency but at the expense of slower recovery and longer hospital stays compared with endovascular repair.

Acute mesenteric ischaemia occurs most commonly in the superior mesenteric artery from an embolic source, although thrombotic occlusion from atherosclerotic disease can sometimes be seen as well. Mortality is very high if diagnosis or treatment is delayed. The classic presentation is acute severe abdominal pain that is out of proportion to the physical exam (soft abdomen without rebound or guarding). D-dimer is highly sensitive for acute mesenteric ischaemia, but specificity is poor. There is no RCT comparing open surgery with endovascular therapy, so treatment often depends on local expertise. An advantage of open surgery is the ability to concomitantly inspect the bowel for gangrene, necrosis and perforation. At the time of laparotomy, hybrid revascularisation can also be performed with direct puncture of the mesenteric artery followed by stenting.

### Management of chronic mesenteric vascular insufficiency: an endovascular approach [^b5440909]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with chronic mesenteric insufficiency (CMI), traditional bypass surgery carries a high operative mortality. Endovascular therapy for reconstruction of the mesenteric vascular system has high technical success but poor long-term patency. Secondary procedures are often mandatory for recurrent disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an endovascular-first treatment strategy for CMI, reserving open reconstruction for complex disease patterns without an endovascular option.

Study Design

Data for consecutive adult patients (N = 107) initially treated with endovascular techniques for CMI were reviewed. The management algorithm consisted of postoperative and biannual ultrasound and clinical follow-up.

Results

A total of 107 patients with CMI were treated from April 2004 through June 2010. Technical success for endovascular reconstruction was 100%. Long-term follow-up data were available on 90% of patients. After the index procedure, 57% of patients (n = 55) had complete resolution of the preoperative symptoms. During the management phase, 83% of patients had elevated velocities on duplex evaluation. During this interval, 53% of patients required no further intervention after the index procedure, and the remaining patients required an additional 78 procedures. Five patients required open revascularization for recurrent disease, and only 2 patients died from complications of mesenteric insufficiency.

Conclusions

Endovascular management for CMI has a high technical success rate with low morbidity and mortality. Regular follow-up is essential to optimize patient outcomes. Ultrasound findings alone are a poor predictor of recurrent disease. Long-term success requires adaptation of a management program to elicit recurrent symptoms and offer prompt treatment.

Renal artery interventions — restenosis and follow-up: Recurrent stenosis after reinterventions is also common, occurring at rates of 20% to 71% after secondary interventions, and no single technique appears to be superior. For follow-up, CT angiography has been shown to be effective and sensitive but not specific for detecting renal artery ISR, and DUS is the most common modality used for follow-up of renal artery interventions. As for the evaluation of mesenteric artery interventions, patients should be fasting overnight before the examination to limit bowel gas and to improve visualization of the renal arteries, and a low-frequency, curved linear or phased array transducer, typically 1 to 5 MHz, is most commonly used. This ratio is valid only if the aortic PSV is in the normal range (typically between 40 and 100 cm/s), and the length of each kidney should also be measured. ASTRAL and CORAL randomized trials failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit of renal artery intervention compared with best medical therapy for patients with moderate stenosis and hypertension.

### Chronic mesenteric ischemia: clinical practice guidelines from the Society for Vascular Surgery [^8921ff43]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Rationale and background — Pathophysiology and presentation of chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) are summarized as follows: CMI is caused by the failure to achieve adequate postprandial intestinal blood flow and usually results from atherosclerotic occlusive disease at the origin of the mesenteric arteries; because of redundancy in the mesenteric circulation, symptoms of CMI do not typically develop unless both the celiac artery (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) have hemodynamically significant lesions (> 70%). In contrast, MAOD is relatively common and affects a large percentage of patients with peripheral vascular and aneurysmal disease. Patients with CMI typically present with postprandial abdominal pain, weight loss, and food fear.

### Chronic mesenteric ischemia: diagnosis and management [^f20503a8]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic mesenteric ischemia:

- **Definition**: Chronic mesenteric ischemia is a clinical condition characterized by reduced blood flow to the mesenteric arteries, usually due to atherosclerotic occlusive disease at the origins of the mesenteric vessels, which can lead to ischemia to the intestinal tissues.
- **Pathophysiology**: The primary pathophysiological mechanism underlying chronic mesenteric ischemia is atherosclerotic occlusive disease at the origins of the mesenteric vessels. Rare causes include thromboangiitis obliterans, FMD, and aortic dissection.
- **Epidemiology**: Chronic mesenteric ischemia is a relatively rare condition, with a reported incidence of 9.2 per 100,000 person-years and a prevalence of 0.03%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for chronic mesenteric ischemia include age, smoking, and comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes. These factors contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, which in turn leads to the narrowing or occlusion of the mesenteric arteries.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, chronic mesenteric ischemia presents with postprandial abdominal pain, unintended weight loss, nausea, vomiting, early satiety, anorexia, and changes in bowel habits. These symptoms are progressive and can lead to fear of food due to the associated pain.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of chronic mesenteric ischemia can be severe if left untreated. Patients often develop severe malnutrition due to the associated weight loss and changes in eating patterns. Endovascular interventions have improved postoperative morbidity but have also resulted in early symptom recurrence and reintervention. Age > 80 years, diabetes, CKD stage IV or V, and home oxygen are independent predictors of any-cause mortality.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the interventional radiology management of acute and chronic arterial mesenteric ischaemia [^0a4fd89a]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Mesenteric ischaemia due to arterial occlusion, usually secondary to atherosclerosis or arterial thromboembolism, may be acute or chronic. Endovascular intervention is now the primary treatment based on its minimally invasive nature and lower in-hospital mortality. Open surgery is indicated in the presence of bowel necrosis, the diagnosis of which remains challenging. This document makes best-practice recommendations about the interventional radiology management of acute and chronic mesenteric ischaemia.

Methods

The CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee established a writing group of six clinicians with internationally recognised expertise in the management of arterial mesenteric ischaemia. The writing group performed a pragmatic search on PubMed for relevant studies published in English in 2013–2024. The final recommendations were developed by consensus.

Results

Endovascular interventions for arterial mesenteric ischaemia have very high technical success rates. Complication rates are lower than with open surgical revascularisation; however, patency times may be shorter. Patients must receive antiplatelet therapy and be monitored for recurrence.

### Mesenteric ischemia [^ac68b7ac]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

MI remains a highly lethal entity. Improving survival requires an aggressive, multidisciplinary approach. High-risk patients with severe abdominal pain and a paucity of physical findings should be undergo emergent imaging in a search for this disease. Improvements in laboratory tests and advances in imaging techniques may improve the ability to diagnose MI earlier in its course, before irreversible damage has occurred. Many treatment modalities are available and should be tailored to each individual case. By recognizing and preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury, the cycle of protracted complications may be broken. A decrease in the mortality from MI finally is occurring. Early recognition and aggressive treatment finally may allow clinicians to have a marked impact on patient survival.

Society for Vascular Surgery — Diagnostic evaluation for chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) states: We recommend an expedited workup in patients with abdominal pain, weight loss, and food fear to exclude gastrointestinal malignancies and other potential causes, noting the workup may include esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, abdominal CT, and abdominal ultrasound; Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). We recommend making a diagnosis of CMI in the appropriate clinical scenario when significant stenoses (> 70%) are present within the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery (SMA), or when the appropriate clinical scenario is present with a significant stenosis (> 70%) in either the celiac axis or SMA alone; Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). We recommend using the mesenteric duplex ultrasound (DUS) examination as the preferred screening test for MAOD with Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). We recommend using CTA as the preferred definitive imaging test for MAOD unless unusual anatomic features obscure the anatomy such that a catheter-based arteriogram may be required.

Objective

The benefit of preventive treatment for superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis remains uncertain. The latest European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) guidelines remain unclear given the lack of data in the literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate asymptomatic SMA stenosis prognosis according to the presence of associated coeliac artery (CA) and/or inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) stenosis.

Methods

This was a single academic centre retrospective study. The entire computed tomography (CT) database of a single tertiary hospital was reviewed from 2009 to 2016. Two groups were defined: patients with isolated > 70% SMA stenosis (group A) and patients with both SMA and CA and/or IMA > 70% stenosis (group B). Patient medical histories were reviewed to determine the occurrence of mesenteric disease (MD) defined as development of acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) or chronic mesenteric ischaemia (CMI).

Results

Seventy-seven patients were included. Median follow up was 39 months. There were 24 patients in group A and 53 patients in group B. In group B, eight (10.4%) patients developed MD with a median onset of 50 months. AMI occurred in five patients with a median of 33 months and CMI in three patients with a median of 88 months. Patients of group B developed more MD (0% vs. 15.1%; p = .052). The five year survival rate was 45% without significant difference between groups.

Conclusion

Patients with SMA stenosis associated with CA and/or IMA seem to have a higher risk of developing mesenteric ischaemia than patients with isolated SMA stenosis. Considering the low life expectancy of these patients, cardiovascular risk factor assessment and optimisation of medical treatment is essential. Preventive endovascular revascularisation could be discussed for patients with non-isolated > 70% SMA stenosis, taking into account life expectancy.
