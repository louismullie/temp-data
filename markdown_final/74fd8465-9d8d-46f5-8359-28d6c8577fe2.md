## Question

High Fever of unknown origin.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate high fever of unknown origin in adults, preserving the stepwise thinking and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the fever and applying the correct FUO definition. Then, I should verify the initial history and physical examination strategy to uncover potential diagnostic clues. Next, I will review the first-line laboratory and imaging workup. After that, I need to consider when to escalate to FDG-PET/CT and tissue biopsy. I will then examine special populations and geographic modifiers. Finally, I should address the role of empiric therapy, prognosis, and follow-up, while double-checking where the evidence is strong versus uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the fever and the diagnostic threshold, because I need to ensure we are truly dealing with FUO rather than a short-lived febrile illness. Classic adult FUO is defined as documented fever of at least 38.3°C on multiple occasions persisting for more than 3 weeks without a diagnosis despite appropriate initial evaluation, with modern interpretations allowing outpatient-based assessments rather than requiring a week of inpatient workup, and some contemporary proposals suggest a lower threshold of 38.0°C with standardized minimum testing to harmonize research and practice, so I should verify the temperature documentation method and duration before labeling this as FUO [^112FQ7yj] [^115QePFm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check the initial history and physical examination because most diagnoses hinge on potential diagnostic clues. I need to ask about travel, animal exposures, occupational hazards, medications including anticoagulants and anticonvulsants, prior infections or surgeries, and a meticulous fever diary with pattern, chills, night sweats, and weight loss, while on exam I should look for rashes, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, arthritis, cardiac murmurs, and subtle neurologic or ENT findings, repeating both history and exam over time since new clues often emerge and FUO is frequently an atypical presentation of a common disease rather than a rare disorder [^1131XZYQ] [^115ChBjx] [^112FQ7yj].

> Next, I should review the first-line laboratory and simple imaging workup to anchor the evaluation. I need a CBC with differential, ESR and CRP, comprehensive metabolic panel including liver enzymes, urinalysis with culture, and at least two sets of blood cultures drawn before antibiotics if feasible. I should add HIV testing, rheumatoid factor and ANA when inflammatory disease is plausible, LDH and CK if myositis or hemolysis is suspected, and a chest radiograph, reserving abdominal ultrasound or CT for those with suggestive symptoms or abnormal labs, because this panel balances yield and cost and avoids premature advanced testing [^112FQ7yj] [^117Nng2s].

> Wait, let me verify the role of inflammatory markers in guiding next steps. If ESR and CRP are normal, the likelihood of a focal inflammatory or infectious process is lower and a watchful waiting approach may be reasonable, whereas markedly elevated ESR or CRP should prompt me to continue a structured search for infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disease and consider second-line imaging sooner rather than later [^112FQ7yj] [^112tCg9C].

> I will now examine when to escalate to advanced imaging, and I need to ensure I am not over-ordering low-yield tests. FDG-PET/CT is the preferred second-line modality when initial evaluation is unrevealing and inflammatory markers are elevated, with a diagnostic yield or helpfulness around 50–60% and the added value of localizing occult infection, inflammation, or malignancy and guiding biopsy; importantly, a negative PET/CT predicts spontaneous remission in a substantial proportion and supports watchful waiting, though I should remember that uptake can be nonspecific and interpretation must be clinical and pattern-based [^115JBc5m] [^116Pp6iL] [^111FZBfS].

> But wait, what if PET/CT is unavailable or contraindicated? I should consider labeled leukocyte imaging or gallium-67 in select scenarios, yet I must acknowledge that modern evidence and guidelines favor FDG-PET/CT over these legacy nuclear medicine approaches due to broader diagnostic coverage and superior localization with CT fusion, so I should reserve alternatives for specific questions or when PET/CT is not feasible [^116hcvcj] [^115JBc5m].

> Next, I should review the role of tissue diagnosis, because if noninvasive tests are unrevealing, targeted biopsy often provides the highest yield. Depending on PET/CT findings and clinical clues, I should consider lymph node excision, liver biopsy, temporal artery biopsy in older adults with high ESR, bone marrow biopsy for cytopenias or suspected hematologic disease, and directed skin or deep tissue biopsies, recognizing that biopsy yield is maximized when the site is chosen by metabolic or clinical localization [^112FQ7yj] [^115JBc5m].

> Let me consider special populations, because the etiologic spectrum and urgency differ. In older adults, temporal arteritis and other vasculitides are more prominent, so I should maintain a low threshold for ESR and temporal artery biopsy when systemic inflammatory signs are present. In HIV, opportunistic infections especially mycobacterial disease predominate and CD4-guided testing is essential. In solid organ transplant recipients, drug fever, opportunistic infections, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder move up the list. In neutropenic or critically ill patients, empiric antibacterial therapy is indicated while cultures are pending, with antifungal escalation if fever persists and risk is high, and I should coordinate imaging with surgical teams in postoperative ICU patients when fever remains unexplained [^1137vZGu] [^1142Pz31] [^112agoVH] [^112FQ7yj] [^1119ZEQw].

> I should confirm geographic and epidemiologic modifiers, because pretest probabilities shift with region and exposures. In endemic areas or returning travelers, I need to consider tuberculosis, brucellosis, malaria, leishmaniasis, and rickettsial infections, tailoring serologies and smears accordingly; in Southeast Asia, infections dominate FUO series, whereas Western Pacific cohorts show more noninfectious inflammatory disease, reinforcing the need to align testing with local disease prevalence and travel history [^113VW5zS] [^111Cmo4x].

> Hold on, I should verify the stance on empiric therapy in classic FUO, because indiscriminate antibiotics or steroids can obscure diagnosis. Empiric antimicrobials should generally be avoided except in neutropenia, severe immunocompromise, or critical illness, while diagnostic trials may be justified in suspected culture-negative endocarditis, cryptic disseminated tuberculosis, or temporal arteritis with vision threat; otherwise, watchful waiting after a negative PET/CT is reasonable given the favorable prognosis in many undiagnosed cases [^112FQ7yj] [^115UwYEq] [^111FZBfS].

> I need to ensure I address prognosis and follow-up explicitly. Up to half of FUO cases remain undiagnosed, yet many resolve spontaneously. A negative FDG-PET/CT predicts remission and allows observation, whereas persistent or evolving symptoms warrant renewed history and exam and reconsideration of biopsy or repeat imaging. Long-term outcomes are generally favorable in undiagnosed cases, though malignancy carries higher mortality and should be vigilantly excluded when clinical suspicion persists [^112FQ7yj] [^111FZBfS] [^115JBc5m].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that structured diagnostic protocols consistently outperform unstructured approaches; let me reconsider that. High-quality meta-analyses of prospective studies show no significant superiority of structured versus nonstructured protocols overall, though diagnostic yields vary widely by region and study design, so I should individualize the workup to patient clues, local expertise, and resource availability rather than rigidly adhere to a single algorithm [^114aDuma] [^113VW5zS].

> Finally, I should double-check that my plan remains iterative and clue-driven: confirm true fever and duration, extract diagnostic clues from repeated history and exam, complete a focused first-line lab and imaging set, escalate to FDG-PET/CT when indicated and use it to guide biopsy, tailor testing to special populations and geography, avoid empiric therapy outside defined exceptions, and reassess continuously for evolving clues that can redirect the evaluation toward a treatable cause [^112FQ7yj] [^115JBc5m] [^117Nng2s].

High fever of unknown origin (FUO) is defined as **≥ 38.3°C for ≥ 3 weeks** without diagnosis after a reasonable initial workup [^117Nng2s] [^114rkC3H]. The most common causes are **infections, malignancies, and autoimmune diseases**, with up to 50% remaining undiagnosed despite extensive evaluation [^116Pp6iL] [^114rkC3H]. A **structured, clue-driven approach** — history, exam, labs, and targeted imaging — is essential; FDG-PET/CT is the preferred second-line test when initial workup is unrevealing [^1127xPko] [^116hcvcj]. Empiric antibiotics or steroids are discouraged unless the patient is immunocompromised or critically ill [^112FQ7yj] [^114rkC3H]. Prognosis is generally favorable, with many cases resolving spontaneously [^111FZBfS].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

FUO is defined as **fever ≥ 38.3°C persisting for ≥ 3 weeks** without a diagnosis after a reasonable initial evaluation [^117Nng2s] [^114rkC3H]. The original definition required ≥ 1 week of inpatient evaluation; modern criteria accept ≥ 3 outpatient visits or 3 inpatient days [^117Nng2s] [^114rkC3H].

---

## Etiological categories

FUO is traditionally classified into **four main categories**:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Infectious diseases | - Tuberculosis <br/> - Endocarditis <br/> - Abscesses <br/> - HIV/AIDS [^112FQ7yj] [^115UwYEq] |
| Malignancies | - Lymphoma <br/> - Leukemia <br/> - Renal cell carcinoma <br/> - Hepatocellular carcinoma [^112FQ7yj] [^114t38in] |
| Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases | - Systemic lupus erythematosus <br/> - Rheumatoid arthritis <br/> - Vasculitis <br/> - Adult-onset Still's disease [^112FQ7yj] [^113Ddf88] |
| Miscellaneous causes | - Drug fever <br/> - Deep vein thrombosis <br/> - Thyroiditis <br/> - Factitious fever [^112FQ7yj] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic, stepwise approach** is essential:

---

### Initial evaluation

- **History and physical examination**: Detailed history, travel, occupational exposures, animal contact, medication use, and repeated physical exams to identify diagnostic clues [^1131XZYQ] [^114t38in].
- **Basic laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR, CRP, LFTs, renal function, urinalysis, blood cultures, serologies (HIV, EBV, CMV, TB), autoimmune screening (ANA, RF) [^1127xPko] [^114rkC3H].
- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound or CT as indicated [^114rkC3H] [^1127xPko].

---

### Advanced diagnostic testing

- **FDG-PET/CT**: Preferred second-line test when initial workup is inconclusive; high diagnostic yield for infection, inflammation, and malignancy [^116hcvcj] [^112TXbWd].
- **Targeted biopsies**: Based on PET/CT or clinical clues (lymph node, bone marrow, liver, temporal artery) [^112FQ7yj] [^111FZBfS].
- **Empiric therapy**: Generally discouraged unless patient is immunocompromised or critically ill [^112FQ7yj].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Prognosis is **generally favorable**; many cases resolve spontaneously, and mortality is low when no diagnosis is made [^111FZBfS]. Malignancy-associated FUO carries higher mortality, whereas infectious and autoimmune causes have better outcomes with appropriate treatment [^111FZBfS].

---

## Special considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Higher risk of opportunistic infections and atypical presentations; tailored diagnostic approach required [^1142Pz31] [^112agoVH].
- **Elderly patients**: Higher prevalence of malignancy and autoimmune diseases; careful evaluation for temporal arteritis and other age-specific conditions [^1137vZGu] [^113n9s21].
- **Geographic variations**: Infectious etiologies predominate in developing countries, whereas autoimmune and malignancy-related FUO are more common in developed regions [^notfound].

---

High fever of unknown origin is a persistent fever ≥ 38.3°C for ≥ 3 weeks without diagnosis after an initial workup. A **structured, clue-driven approach** — history, exam, labs, and targeted imaging — is essential; FDG-PET/CT is the preferred second-line test when initial workup is unrevealing [^116hcvcj]. Empiric antibiotics or steroids are discouraged unless the patient is immunocompromised or critically ill [^112FQ7yj]. Prognosis is generally favorable, with many cases resolving spontaneously [^111FZBfS].

## References

### Prospective studies comparing structured vs nonstructured diagnostic protocol evaluations among patients with fever of unknown origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116RRYcA]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Several reports, including 2 by de Kleijn et al, enrolled patients younger than 18 years, if the patients met the adult FUO criteria. Among studies in this analysis, ages ranged from 10 to 94 years, with female participants ranging from 21.0% to 64.0%. The main reason for excluding variables was missing information. Lack of sufficient data meant that analysis of temperature measurement method, duration of fever and hospitalization before a diagnosis, the contribution of potential diagnostic clues, biochemical and immunological serologic studies, microbiology cultures, histologic analysis, and imaging studies could not be performed.

Statistical Analysis

The diagnostic yield (ie, the proportion of cases resulting in a diagnosis) was plotted by study and region (Figure 2) and sorted by structured or nonstructured category (eFigure 1 in the Supplement) for 17 studies, because 2 studies did not report undiagnosed cases. Studies with diagnostic yields of greater than 80.0% included 4 with structured diagnostic protocols, and 6 with nonstructured protocols. When studies with a diagnostic yield greater than 80.0% are compared, all ranged above the 50th percentile, except China, which ranked in the fourth percentile on the United Nations Human Development Index ranking list. Interestingly, the studies with diagnostic yields less than 70.0% all ranked within the top 26 countries economically. When the outcomes were compared by years of LEB and GNI per capita, the countries with the lowest diagnostic yield had LEB ranging from 81.6 to 83.6 years and GNI ranging from $40 975 to $57 707. In contrast, countries with a diagnostic yield greater than 80.0% had LEB ranging from 69.7 to 77.7 years and GNI ranging from $6681 to $29 497 (eFigures 2–4 in the Supplement).

### Pyrexia: aetiology in the ICU [^114Hxhz7]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Whether due to pyrexia or a hyperthermia syndrome, elevated body temperature is commonly encountered in patients admitted to adult ICUs. Although estimates of the incidence of infectious and noninfectious aetiologies are derived from studies with small sample size and inconsistent reporting of noninfectious aetiologies, current literature suggests that pyrexia is most frequently the sign of an infection. Among patients admitted to the ICU following surgery and/or an acute neurological condition, early fever may indicate a noninfectious process. Pyrexia commonly triggers a full septic work-up, but on its own is a poor predictor of culture-positivity. In order to improve culturing practices, and better guide the diagnostic approach to critically ill patients with pyrexia, additional research is required to provide more robust estimates of the incidence of infectious and noninfectious aetiologies, and their relationship to other clinical features. In the meantime, we suggest that investigations in patients with an elevated body temperature should be guided by the clinical probability of the aetiologies outlined in our proposed diagnostic approach.

### Update on imaging in fever and inflammation of unknown origin: focus on infectious disorders [^116hcvcj]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) and inflammation of unknown origin (IUO) are diagnostic challenges that often require an extensive work-up. When first-line tests do not provide any or only misleading clues, second-line investigations such as specialized imaging techniques are often warranted.

Objectives

To provide an overview of the diagnostic value of imaging techniques that are commonly used in patients with FUO/IUO.

Sources

MEDLINE database was searched to identify the most relevant studies, trials, reviews, or meta-analyses until 31 March 2023.

Content

The most important types of second-line imaging tests for FUO and IUO are outlined, including [67 Ga]-citrate single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (CT), labelled leukocyte imaging, [18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography CT ([18 F]-FDG-PET), and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging. This review summarizes the diagnostic yield, extends on potential future imaging techniques (pathogen-specific bacterial imaging and [18 F]-FDG-PET/magnetic resonance imaging), discusses cost-effectiveness, highlights practical implications and pitfalls, and addresses future perspectives. Where applicable, we provide additional data specifically for the infection subgroup.

Implications

Although many imaging examinations are proven to be useful in FUO and IUO, [18 F]-FDG-PET/CT is the preferred second-line test when available as it provides a high diagnostic yield in a presumably cost-effective way.

### Fever of unknown origin: a clinical approach [^115ChBjx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Fevers of unknown origin remain one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges in medicine. Because fever of unknown origin may be caused by over 200 malignant/neoplastic, infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, and miscellaneous disorders, clinicians often order non-clue-based imaging and specific testing early in the fever of unknown origin work-up, which may be inefficient/misleading. Unlike most other fever-of-unknown-origin reviews, this article presents a clinical approach. Characteristic history and physical examination findings together with key nonspecific test abnormalities are the basis for a focused clue-directed fever of unknown origin work-up.

### Fever of unknown origin in HIV / AIDS patients [^1142Pz31]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown or uncertain origin (FUO) constitutes a common clinical challenge in patients infected with HIV. It is usually caused by disseminated opportunistic infection, and the relative frequency of each cause of FUO is influenced by multiple factors including CD4 count, geographic setting, and local prevalences of infectious agents, which may provide clues to the diagnosis. Infections presenting as FUO in the HIV population occur most often in the late stages of the disease and high diagnostic suspicion for mycobacterial disease should be maintained when evaluating these patients, particularly in areas of high prevalence. This article discusses the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of FUO in HIV-infected individuals.

Common clinical indications

A. Fever and inflammation of unknown origin

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is defined as fever higher than 38.3°C (100.9°F) persisting for at least 3 weeks, with no diagnosis despite 3 outpatient visits or in-patient days. FUO is divided into four different subcategories: classical, nosocomial, neutropenic and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) – related. The etiology includes infectious, inflammatory, malignant and miscellaneous causes. The distribution varies according to the FUO subcategory and geographical location. Inflammation of unknown origin (IUO), defined as unexplained and prolonged elevation of inflammatory markers, without fever, shares similar etiologies. [18 F]FDG PET/CT has a high diagnostic yield in both these clinical settings. As many patients never have a final causative diagnosis, the diagnostic yield and helpfulness of [18 F]FDG PET/CT are usually preferred over sensitivity and specificity.

Indications

Evaluation of patients with FUO/IUO without a diagnosis despite standard work-up.

Indications with insufficient evidence

Evaluation of patients with FUO and normal inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein-CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate-ESR).

Specific protocol points and interpretation criteria

Consider myocardial suppression preparation (See section " Patient preparation and precautions, no.5") when there is a potential cardiac etiology.
[18 F]FDG PET/CT study should ideally be performed within 3 days of initiation of oral glucocorticoid therapy.

Diagnostic performance (Table 1)

Additional data:
The results of [18 F]FDG PET/CT can aid in identifying the etiology of FUO/IUO. It can guide further investigations, biopsy or specific treatment when the cause of the FUO/IUO is established.
A negative [18 F]FDG PET/CT can predict favorable prognosis through spontaneous remission of fever and potentially allows a watchful waiting approach.
Cost effectiveness of [18 F]FDG PET/CT, particularly when performed early in the diagnostic work-up, has been demonstrated in both FUO and IUO. Table 1 Major performance values from systematic reviews and meta-analyses on [18 F]FDG PET/CT in patients with FUO/IUO *NR – Not reported.

Areas of potential research

Prospective studies on diagnostic yield, helpfulness and impact in patients with IUO.

### Spectrum of 18F-FDG PET / CT findings in patients presenting with fever of unknown origin [^116QVe7e]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this article is to provide an illustrative tutorial highlighting the clinical utility of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for imaging patients presenting with fever of unknown origin (FUO).

Conclusion

FDG PET/CT is a powerful tool in localizing an inciting source in patients with FUO. The high sensitivity of FDG PET/CT for diagnosing infective, inflammatory, and neoplastic processes can be exploited in this setting because these processes are often the common causes of FUO.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^114guWyh]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline abstract — evaluation of new fever in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients states that fever occurs in 26–88% of adult ICU patients and that etiologies include both infectious and noninfectious causes; noninfectious causes of fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis, but initial evaluation of patients with new-onset fever is usually directed at potential microbial causes and this is the primary focus of the guideline. The SCCM and IDSA convened a taskforce to update the 2008 version, the guidelines committee consisted of 12 experts, and there was no industry input or funding. Methods included a systematic review that statistically summarized the evidence, assessment of evidence quality using the GRADE approach, and use of an evidence-to-decision framework to formulate recommendations as strong or weak or as best-practice statements.

### Fever of unknown origin in solid organ transplant recipients [^112agoVH]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Fever is a common clinical manifestation in transplant patients, and it may be due to many different reasons. In the general population, infections and malignancies as causes of fever of unknown origin (FUO) have decreased over time, whereas inflammatory diseases and undiagnosed fevers have increased. This article reviews FUO in transplant patients, despite there being no clear and widely accepted definition of FUO for such patients. The methodology of diagnosis has been accelerated and made more accurate, not only for the imaging diagnosis but also for microbiology. With respect to diagnosis of FUO in the transplant patient population, consideration should be given to the specific type of transplant patient, to the results of the physical examination, and to the epidemiological antecedents. This article examines an approach that considers different syndromes, followed by an etiologically oriented differential diagnosis.

### Fever therapy in febrile adults: systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^111voXvf]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Results

The search strategy defined in the protocol found 3273 publications that were evaluated to identify trials matching our inclusion criteria. We included a total of 42 trials randomising 5140 participants (supplementary figure S1). Twenty three trials assessed 11 different antipyretic drugs, 11 trials assessed physical cooling, and eight trials assessed a combination of antipyretic drugs and physical cooling. Of the participants, 3007 were critically ill, 1892 were non-critically ill, 3277 had infectious fever, and 1139 had non-infectious fever; 3062 participants were admitted to hospital, and 2078 were outpatients. We assessed 21 trials as being of some concern and 21 trials as being at high risk of bias (fig 1). The 42 included trials provided a total of 75 comparisons (supplementary table S1). Seventeen trials were included in meta-analyses. Missing data constituted ≤ 5% of the overall data, and we deemed the impact of missing data to be low; therefore, we did not do sensitivity analyses

All cause mortality

Sixteen trials (19 comparisons) with a total of 2415 participants reported on all cause mortality. The included trials assessed the effects of five different fever therapy interventions: ibuprofen versus placebo (three trials), paracetamol versus placebo (six trials), physical cooling versus no intervention (three trials), antipyretics plus physical cooling versus no intervention (two trials), and physical cooling plus antipyretics versus antipyretics (two trials). All 2415 participants were admitted to hospital; 2050 were critically ill, and 251 were non-critically ill (supplementary table S1). One trial included both critically ill and non-critically ill patients (120/2415) (supplementary table S1). Of the 2415 participants, 1658 had infectious fever and 477 had non-infectious fever (supplementary table S1). For 286/2415 participants, the origin of fever was unknown (supplementary table S1). A total of 294 (23.0%) of 1281 fever therapy participants died compared with 258 (22.6%) of 1140 control participants.

### The role of 18F-FDG PET or PET / CT in the detection of fever of unknown origin [^113R4Znd]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Even with the recent advance in diagnostic tools and techniques, fever of unknown origin (FUO) remains a clinical challenge. A wide range of diseases, mainly infections, autoimmune conditions (inflammatory diseases), malignancies and miscellaneous can cause FUO. Positron emission tomography (PET) or positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning makes a great contribution to the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of FUO due to the high sensitivity of pathological accumulation of 18F-FDG. The diagnostic yield of PET/CT is higher than traditional radiographic imaging and other nuclear medicine scanning. Owing to the numerous advantages of PET/CT including high sensitivity and the ability to perform whole-body scans, many rare diseases presenting with FUO can be detected and the spectrum of diseases that can exhibit FUO has been increasing. Recent studies utilizing FUO are discussed in this paper. However, there are limited data available about the role of 18F-FDG PET or PET/CT in evaluation of FUO.

### Fever of unknown origin in Turkey: evaluation of 87 cases during a nine-year-period of study [^115HTVoG]. The Journal of Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate fever of unknown origin (FUO) in 87 patients.

Methods

We investigated 87 (61 male) patients with FUO using the criteria of Petersdorf and Beeson [Medicine 40 (1961) 1] hospitalized between January 1994 and August 2002 at Cukurova University Hospital.

Results

The median age of the patients was 38.5 years (range: 14–80 years). Eleven patients (12.6%) were over 65. The mean duration of hospitalization was 22.5 ± 13 days. Infectious diseases were the most common causes of FUO. Tuberculosis (n = 15, 17.2%), infective endocarditis (n = 6), abdominal abscess (n = 6), brucellosis (n = 5), urinary tract infection (n = 5), visceral leishmaniasis (n = 4), salmonellosis (n = 3), rhinocerebral mucormycosis (n = 4), atypical pneumonia, cerebral toxoplasmosis, Cytomegalovirus infection or encephalitis were diagnosed in 51 (58.6%) patients. The second most common causes of FUO were collagen vascular diseases (n = 16, 18.3%) determined as vasculitis syndrome, adult Still's disease (n = 4), systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet's disease, juvenile ankylosing spondylitis. Neoplasm was found in 12 (13.7%) patients; (non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal tract carcinoma, glioma). Miscellaneous diseases thyroiditis, granulomatous hepatitis were diagnosed in two (2.2%) patients. On admission, six patients (6.8%) were neutropenic.

Conclusions

Infectious diseases, especially tuberculosis, were the leading diagnostic category of FUO in this study. Adult Still's disease was more common than expected. An aetiological diagnosis could not be reached in six (7%) patients who were followed for 1 year. Five of these patients completely recovered, and one patient died.

### Fever of unknown origin caused by tuberculosis [^111yoMBK]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis is an important cause of fever of unknown origin. Travel, age, dialysis, diabetes, birth in a country with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, and immunoincompetence are among the most salient risks. Associated physical findings, radiologic evaluation, and hematologic and endocrinologic abnormalities may provide clues to the diagnosis. Both noninvasive and invasive diagnostic modalities are reviewed. Because diagnosis may be elusive, therapeutic and diagnostic trials of antituberculous therapy should be considered in all patients with fever of unknown origin who defy diagnosis.

### Investigating and managing pyrexia of unknown origin in adults [^117Nng2s]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Few clinical problems generate such a wide differential diagnosis as pyrexia (fever) of unknown origin. The initial definition proposed by Petersdorf and Beeson in 1961,¹ later revised, is "a fever of 38.3°C (101°F) or more lasting for at least three weeks for which no cause can be identified after three days of investigation in hospital or after three or more outpatient visits". ²⁻⁴Essentially the term refers to a prolonged febrile illness without an obvious cause despite reasonable evaluation and diagnostic testing. A fever that is not self limiting for which no cause can be found can become a source of frustration for both patient and doctor. There is little consensus on how such patients should be investigated, although recent prospective studies have evaluated diagnostic protocols to suggest approaches to investigation. ³⁵⁶ We discuss evidence from epidemiological and diagnostic studies and suggest an approach to investigating and managing pyrexia of unknown origin. Immunocompromised individuals, those with HIV infection, and patients admitted to hospital for other reasons with persistent or unexplained fever represent distinct subgroups in which the likely causes, diagnosis, and treatment of pyrexia usually differ from those in patients who are not immunocompromised. We do not discuss these subgroups in this review other than to provide definitions of pyrexia of unknown origin in different groups of patients (see box 1).

### Fever of unknown origin in childhood [^112qt4hV]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Childhood fever of unknown origin (FUO) is most often related to an underlying infection but can also be associated with a variety of neoplastic, rheumatologic, and inflammatory conditions. Repeated, focused reviews of patient history and physical examination are often helpful in suggesting a likely diagnosis. Diagnostic workup should be staged, usually leaving invasive testing for last. Advances in molecular genetic techniques have increased the importance of these assays in the diagnosis of FUO in children.

### EANM consensus document on the use of [F] FDG PET / CT in fever and inflammation of unknown origin [^114Mbi8L]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

The variable performance of [18 F]FDG PET/CT in FUO/IUO may be explained, as previously described, by a multitude of factors; the complexity of patients, definitions of FUO/IUO, retrospective and observational study designs, relatively small sample sizes, differences in pre-scan work-up, differences in [18 F]FDG PET/CT timing, and varying definitions of a clinical helpful result.

Overall, the results of most studies show that a positive [18 F]FDG PET/CT is often contributive and, in some cases, is essential to establish a diagnosis by identifying potential causes of FUO/IUO, localizing sites for further evaluation, and guiding further management. Conversely, a negative scan excludes focal disease and predicts a favourable prognosis.

### Fever of unknown origin: focused diagnostic approach based on clinical clues from the history, physical examination, and laboratory tests [^112W7EYY]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The causes of fevers of unknown origin (FUOs) are diverse and may be the result of infectious rheumatic or inflammatory, neoplastic, or miscellaneous disorders. This article reviews the focused diagnostic approach to FUOs, emphasizing relevant history, physical examination, and selected laboratory tests using a clinical syndrome approach. Laboratory tests should be guided by the most likely diagnoses based on the presenting clinical syndrome. Considered in concert, nonspecific laboratory tests may provide important diagnostic clues. Using a sequential diagnostic approach, a focused evaluation diagnoses all but the rarest or most obscure causes of FUO.

### Fever of unknown origin: a diagnostic approach to this vexing problem [^113T3Cvh]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Fever is a common complaint leading families to seek medical attention. Its routine management is the bread and butter of pediatric practice. When fever is seen as prolonged beyond the expected time course (eg, 10 days for a presumed viral respiratory tract infection or 3 weeks for mononucleosis), concern for fever of unknown origin (FUO) may ensue. This diagnosis is among the most challenging for health care providers to approach and often involves referral to subspecialists. Generally, the pace of the evaluation should be guided by the severity of the disease, rather than the anxiety of the family or of the health care providers. It is useful to recognize that uncommon manifestations of common diseases are more likely than are rare diseases. Furthermore, clues to the diagnosis are frequently present in the history and physical examination but are not elicited or unappreciated (perhaps due to time constraints). Therefore, thoroughness and repetition are vitally important. Although the differential diagnosis of FUO is vast, a thoughtful, focused approach based on information gleaned from a thorough history and physical examination (together with any laboratory or other study results) is preferable to a "shotgun" or "running the list" one. Finally, FUO in special populations, including children in the hospital, those with HIV infection or other immunocompromise, and those in the developing world, require special consideration. Most children do well, compared to adults with FUO, but true FUO is not always a benign condition, necessitating the best care a health care provider can offer.

### Fever of unknown origin (FUO) criteria influences diagnostic outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112fHDkq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Criteria classifying fever of unknown origin (FUO) patients remains subject to discrepancies. A minimal standardized set of investigative tests serves as the foundation for the qualitative criteria, whereas quantitative incorporates the length of evaluation (7 or 3 days). A systematic review of studies would help physicians anticipate the frequency of illness types that could influence management.

Methods

Prospective studies published in Medline (PubMed), Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from January 1, 1997 to July 31, 2022, were included. A meta-analysis estimated associated pooled proportions between these criteria and diagnostic outcomes adjusted to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) definitions.

Results

Five qualitative studies corresponded to an increase of 15.3% (95% CI: 2.3%-28.3%, P = 0.021) in undiagnosed FUO proportions compared to eleven quantitative studies. Quantitative studies had 19.7% (95% CI: 6.0%-33.4%, P = 0.005) more in adjusted infectious disease proportions than qualitative studies. No significant differences in proportions between FUO defining criteria were noted for adjusted noninfectious inflammatory disorders (P = 0.318), oncology (P = 0.901), non-inflammatory miscellaneous disorders (P = 0.321), diagnostic evaluation process, gross national income (GNI), or World Health Organization (WHO) geographic region.

Conclusions

Use of either qualitative or quantitative FUO criteria was associated with a statistically significant risk of over- or under-estimating infectious diseases and undiagnosed illnesses when using an ICD-10 adjusted FUO five-category system. Clinicians should anticipate differences depending on which criteria are used. While further research is warranted, qualitative criteria provide the best framework for study comparisons.

### Adult-onset Still's disease presenting as fever of unknown origin in a patient with HIV infection [^117JnvPC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

A 43-year-old African American man with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was found to have adult-onset Still's disease manifesting as fever of unknown origin. In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy, HIV-infected patients are preserving their immune status and, thus, must be evaluated in a manner similar to that for the general population.

### EANM consensus document on the use of [F] FDG PET / CT in fever and inflammation of unknown origin [^116AEgmE]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with HIV

One study prospectively evaluated the performance of [18 F]FDG PET/CT in 20 HIV-infected patients with FUO in comparison to 10 HIV-infected high viraemic patients without FUO. Despite the limited number of included patients, high viraemic status did not interfere with a correct scan interpretation but different uptake patterns were observed: more peripheral active lymph nodes in patients without FUO compared to more central active lymph nodes in FUO patients. [18 F]FDG PET/CT contributed to the diagnosis or exclusion of a focal etiology in 80% of the patients. The absence of active central lymph nodes in FUO patients showed a 100% negative predictive value for focal disease. Lymph node biopsy in central active areas allowed identification of underlying disease in all patients with FUO. Furthermore, [18 F]FDG PET/CT demonstrated more extensive disease than conventional imaging. The other study in this patient population found [18 F]FDG PET/CT helpful in 9/10 patients, six with infection and three with malignancy.

In conclusion, [18 F]FDG PET/CT can be considered useful for evaluating the cause of FUO/IUO in these specific populations, taking into account the same caveats as the general adult FUO/IUO population. The diagnostic yield and helpfulness of [18 F]FDG PET/CT in these specific patient groups are similar to the results in the general adult population.

### Fever of unknown origin in older persons [^113n9s21]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Infectious diseases in general in the aged are associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates. Decremental biologic changes with age affect host defenses and responses to infection, and the frequent presence of comorbidities also may adversely impact host defenses, especially in frail older persons. Infections may present differently in older persons than in younger populations, making early diagnosis difficult. Within this context, the article explores the importance of how fever of unknown origin (FUO) in the old differs significantly from FUO in younger adults because the etiology is different. Moreover, it is important to aggressively determine the etiology of FUO in this older population because it is often treatable.

### Prospective studies comparing structured vs nonstructured diagnostic protocol evaluations among patients with fever of unknown origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113DhTB8]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Although fever of unknown origin (FUO) syndrome is a commonly accepted medical diagnosis, no universally accepted method of postdiagnostic evaluation exists. In 1997, a prospective study, advised using a qualitative standard definition and structured diagnostic protocol because of limited high-quality evidence supporting the use of prior methods. Most published studies are prospective or retrospective single-center case series that lack a uniform process. Although ample expert opinion exists, substantial missing data in these studies preclude definitive conclusions about an optimal investigative process.

Two retrospective trials from Japanand Italythat included 9830 hospitalized patients reported the prevalence of this syndrome ranged from 2.0% to 2.9% based on admission diagnosis. Articles cataloging associated conditions appeared as early as 1930 with insufficient definitions and follow-up. Petersdorf and Beesonwere the first to prospectively adopt formal criteria by which patients would be classified. Subsequent investigators, modified these criteria to reflect practice changes in medicine and increased outpatient evaluation of these patients, including a recent set of standardized proposed defining criteria.

Petersdorf and Beesonemphasized patient uniqueness where they should not be "subjected to routine battery of laboratory tests" or structured diagnostic protocols. In contrast, de Kleijn et al, and Bleeker-Rovers et aladvocate for staged structured diagnostic protocols, particularly when potential diagnostic clues from history, examination findings, or existing diagnostic data do not strongly point to an answer. However, many recent series include undiagnosed cases among patients with FUO, ranging from 8.5% to 51.0% despite intensive evaluations. Factors influencing outcomes might include differences in defining criteria applied, minimum diagnostic protocol use, location, and prospective or retrospective study design.

To our knowledge, a statistical comparison between studies using either a structured or a nonstructured diagnostic approach is lacking. We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis to explore the hypothesis that a structured compared with a nonstructured diagnostic protocol for patients offers an increased diagnostic yield.

### Evaluation of fever in the emergency department [^115TbfrE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fever is one of the most common complaints in the emergency department (ED) and is more complex than generally appreciated. The broad differential diagnosis of fever includes numerous infectious and non-infectious etiologies. An essential skill in emergency medicine is recognizing the pitfalls in fever evaluation.

Objective Of Review

This review provides an overview of the complaint of fever in the ED to assist the emergency physician with a structured approach to evaluation.

Discussion

Fever can be due to infectious or non-infectious etiology and results from the body's natural response to a pyrogen. Adjunctive testing including C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and procalcitonin has been evaluated in the literature, but these tests do not have the needed sensitivity and specificity to definitively rule in a bacterial cause of fever. Blood cultures should be obtained in septic shock or if the results will change clinical management. Fever may not be always present in true infection, especially in elderly and immunocompromised patients. Oral temperatures suffer from poor sensitivity to diagnose fever, and core temperatures should be utilized if concern for fever is present. Consideration of non-infectious causes of elevated temperature is needed based on the clinical situation.

Conclusion

Any fever evaluation must rigorously maintain a broad differential to avoid pitfalls that can have patient care consequences. Fever is complex and due to a variety of etiologies. An understanding of the pathophysiology, causes, and assessment is important for emergency physicians.

### EANM consensus document on the use of [F] FDG PET / CT in fever and inflammation of unknown origin [^112h9sU6]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Imaging of infection and inflammation has been part of nuclear medicine since the 1970s with the use of [67 Ga]Ga-citrate, radiolabelled white blood cells, and finally the glucose analog 2-deoxy-2-[18 F]-fluoro- D -glucose ([18 F]FDG). In the first decade of [18 F]FDG PET, incidental [18 F]FDG uptake in infectious or inflammatory foci in cancer patients was considered a false-positive nuisance, but from the 1990s onward, this changed with a greater understanding and appreciation of [18 F]FDG PET in infectious and inflammatory conditions.

An early application of [18 F]FDG PET in infectious and inflammatory diseases was fever of unknown origin (FUO), a heterogeneous and clinically challenging condition with a multitude of underlying differential diagnoses, i.e. infections, non-infectious inflammatory diseases (NIID), malignancies, and miscellaneous. The definition of FUO has changed several times since the original definition from 1961; the current definition includes fever > 38.3° C on more than three occasions during more than three weeks with no clear diagnosis despite three days of relevant inpatient workup or three outpatient visits.

In recent years, inflammation of unknown origin (IUO) was introduced as an equivalent to FUO without fever, i.e. patients with normal temperature, but increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) on more than three occasions for more than three weeks and no diagnosis despite relevant inpatient or outpatient workup similar to FUO.

The overarching etiologies of FUO and IUO (i.e. infection, NIID, malignancies, and miscellaneous) are comparable, although infections are usually more prevalent in FUO and NIID more prevalent in IUO. Therefore, the diagnostic approach is similar in both conditions. It is important to remember that not all patients with unexplained infection or nonspecific systemic inflammation meet the stringent criteria of FUO or IUO, but they may still be suitable candidates for a [18 F]FDG PET/CT exam.

### Nuclear medicine imaging tools in fever of unknown origin: time for a revisit and appropriate use criteria [^112TXbWd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a clinical conundrum for patients and clinicians alike, and imaging studies are often performed as part of the diagnostic workup of these patients. Recently, the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging convened and approved a guideline on the use of nuclear medicine tools for FUO. The guidelines support the use of 2–18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in adults and children with FUO. 18F-FDG PET/CT allows detection and localization of foci of hypermetabolic lesions with high sensitivity because of the 18F-FDG uptake in glycolytically active cells that may represent inflammation, infection, or neoplasia. Clinicians should consider and insurers should cover 18F-FDG PET/CT when evaluating patients with FUO, particularly when other clinical clues and preliminary studies are unrevealing.

### Periodic fever, apthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis syndrome [^111CFdtL]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Periodic fever, apthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome is the most common cause of periodic fever of unknown origin in childhood. During the last years a number of studies on large series of patients have shed more light on the actual clinical characterization, long-term outcome and response to treatment. Current PFAPA criteria have low specificity since they are positive in a considerable proportion of patients with inherited periodic fevers. We report on the findings coming from the analysis of large cohorts of PFAPA patients and the possible implication for the differential diagnosis. An update on the efficacy of possible prophylactic treatments and tonsillectomy is given.

Recent Findings

A diagnostic score developed in a large series of children identifies patients meeting PFAPA criteria and at higher risk to carry relevant mutations of genes associated with periodic fevers. Randomized studies on the efficacy of tonsillectomy give a more evidence-based justification to this possible therapeutic approach.

Summary

The findings coming from the recent literature give new information to clinicians for the correct diagnostic approach to pediatric and adult patients presenting periodic fever of unknown origin and provide an updated overview on the therapeutic possibilities for patients presenting a persistence of fever attacks.

### Fever of unknown origin in adults: 40 years on… [^1175MSLX]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

A revision of the criteria of fever of unknown origin (FUO), established in 1961, is desirable because of important evolutions in medical practice and the emergence of new patient populations. The development of rapid laboratory tests and powerful diagnostic tools, such as ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging often makes hospitalization unnecessary and new categories of patients such as those with HIV infection, neutropenia, immunosuppression and nosocomial illness require an approach different from classical FUO. The more then 200 reported causes of FUO can be classified into four diagnostic categories; infections, tumours, noninfectious inflammatory diseases (NIID) and miscellaneous. A uniform classification system is highly wanted to allow comparison between different series. The reports of the 1990s show slight changes in the distribution of causes, namely less infections, less tumours, more NIID and more undiagnosed cases. A uniform diagnostic strategy cannot be determined. The initial investigation should be directed by potentially diagnostic clues revealed by extensive history, meticulous physical examination and a standard set of laboratory tests. 18Fluoro-deoxy-glucose-positron-emitted-tomography is a new valuable total body scintigraphy in the search for the site of origin of the fever. In view of the rather good long-term prognosis, a wait-and-see strategy may be more appropriate than a systematic staged approach. Elderly patients and patients with episodic fever represent two specific groups of classical FUO that require a distinct approach. HIV-associated, nosocomial and neutropenic FUO should be considered as separate clinical entities.

### Recurrent fevers of unknown origin [^112DjDK3]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Recurrent fever of unknown origin is mostly caused by rather rare diseases and many cases remain unexplained. The very limited literature data do not allow one to construct a diagnostic algorithm. A number of general principles should be kept in mind before starting the investigation for this rare subtype of fever of unknown origin.

### 18F-FDG PET and PET / CT in fever of unknown origin [^114t38in]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) was originally defined as recurrent fever of 38.3 degrees C or higher, lasting 2–3 wk or longer, and undiagnosed after 1 wk of hospital evaluation. The last criterion has undergone modification and is now generally interpreted as no diagnosis after appropriate inpatient or outpatient evaluation. The 3 major categories that account for most FUOs are infections, malignancies, and noninfectious inflammatory diseases. The diagnostic approach in FUO includes repeated physical investigations and thorough history-taking combined with standardized laboratory tests and simple imaging procedures. Nevertheless, there is a need for more complex or invasive techniques if this strategy fails. This review describes the impact of (18)F-FDG PET in the diagnostic work-up of FUO. (18)F-FDG accumulates in malignant tissues but also at the sites of infection and inflammation and in autoimmune and granulomatous diseases by the overexpression of distinct facultative glucose transporter (GLUT) isotypes (mainly GLUT-1 and GLUT-3) and by an overproduction of glycolytic enzymes in cancer cells and inflammatory cells. The limited data of prospective studies indicate that (18)F-FDG PET has the potential to play a central role as a second-line procedure in the management of patients with FUO. In these studies, the PET scan contributed to the final diagnosis in 25%-69% of the patients. In the category of infectious diseases, a diagnosis of focal abdominal, thoracic, or soft-tissue infection, as well as chronic osteomyelitis, can be made with a high degree of certainty. Negative findings on (18)F-FDG PET essentially rule out orthopedic prosthetic infections. In patients with noninfectious inflammatory diseases, (18)F-FDG PET is of importance in the diagnosis of large-vessel vasculitis and seems to be useful in the visualization of other diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, and painless subacute thyroiditis. In patients with tumor fever, diseases commonly detected by (18)F-FDG PET include Hodgkin's disease and aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma but also colorectal cancer and sarcoma. (18)F-FDG PET has the potential to replace other imaging techniques in the evaluation of patients with FUO. Compared with labeled white blood cells, (18)F-FDG PET allows diagnosis of a wider spectrum of diseases. Compared with (67)Ga-citrate scanning, (18)F-FDG PET seems to be more sensitive. It is expected that PET/CT technology will further improve the diagnostic impact of (18)F-FDG PET in the context of FUO, as already shown in the oncologic context, mainly by improving the specificity of the method.

### Fever of unknown origin: historical and physical clues to making the diagnosis [^1131XZYQ]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) has fascinated and perplexed clinicians for over a century. No published guidelines exist on the approach to FUO, and studies have demonstrated that a diagnosis is never established in up to 30% of cases. A comprehensive history and physical examination are the keys to establishing a diagnosis in patient with FUO. This article provides a systematic approach to the diagnosis of FUO by delineating the most important elements of a comprehensive history and physical examination.

### Fever of unknown origin in the elderly [^1137vZGu]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) means fever that does not resolve itself in the period expected for self-limited infection and whose cause cannot be ascertained despite considerable diagnostic efforts. The differential diagnosis is often different in older patients, and presentation of disease is frequently nonspecific and symptoms are difficult to interpret. Multisystem disease has emerged as the most frequent cause of FUO in the elderly, and temporal arteritis is the most frequent specific diagnosis. Infections, particular tuberculosis, remain an important group. FUO is often associated with treatable conditions in this age group. Early recognition and prompt initiation of appropriate empirical therapy are cornerstones of the strategy.

### FDG PET in evaluation of patients with fever of unknown origin: expert panel narrative review [^116Pp6iL]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2023). Medium credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a diagnostic challenge, with its cause remaining undiagnosed in approximately half of patients. Nuclear medicine tests typically are performed after a negative or inconclusive initial workup. Gallium-67 citrate and labeled leukocytes were previous mainstays of radionuclide imaging for FUO, although they had limited diagnostic performance. FDG PET/CT has subsequently emerged as the nuclear medicine imaging test of choice, supported by a growing volume of evidence. A positive FDG PET/CT result contributes useful information by identifying potential causes of fever, localizing sites for further evaluation, and guiding further management; a negative result contributes useful information by excluding focal disease as the cause of fever and predicts a favorable prognosis. In 2021, CMS rescinded a prior national noncoverage determination for FDG PET for infection and inflammation, leading to increasing national utilization of FDG PET/CT for FUO workup. This article reviews the current status of the role of FDG PET/CT in the evaluation of patients with FUO. The literature reporting the diagnostic performance and yield of FDG PET/CT in FUO workup is summarized, with comparison with historically used nuclear medicine tests included. Attention is also given to the test's clinical impact; protocol, cost, and radiation considerations; and application in children.

### Fever of unknown origin (FUO) – A call for new research standards and updated clinical management [^115QePFm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Prolonged fever of 38.3°C or higher for at least 3 weeks' duration has been termed fever of unknown origin if unexplained after preliminary investigations. Initially codified in 1961, classification with subgroups was revised in 1991. Additional changes to the definition were proposed in 1997, recommending a set of standardized initial investigations. Advances in diagnosis and management and diagnostic testing over the last 3 decades have prompted a needed update to the definition and approaches. While a 3-week fever duration remains part of the criteria, a lower temperature threshold of 38°C and revised minimum testing criteria will assist clinicians and their patients, setting a solid foundation for future research.

### Fever of unknown origin: is there a role for empiric therapy? [^115UwYEq]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Empiric therapy has little or no role to play in cases of classic fever of unknown origin with three important exceptions: cases that meet criteria for culture-negative endocarditis; cases in which findings or the clinical setting suggests cryptic disseminated tuberculosis (or, occasionally, other granulomatous infections); and cases in which temporal arteritis with vision loss is suspected. Several studies indicate that patients with prolonged, undiagnosed fever of unknown origin generally have a favorable prognosis. A small and largely anecdotal literature suggests a small role for symptomatic use of corticosteroids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in highly selected cases.

### Ferritin, fever, and frequent visits: hyperferritinemic syndromes in the emergency department [^114pC5PW]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is defined as persistent fevers without an identifiable cause despite extensive medical workup. Emergency physicians caring for patients reporting a persistent, nonspecific, febrile illness should carefully consider potentially serious non-infectious causes of FUO. We present a case of a 35-year-old man who presented to the emergency department (ED) three times over a 10-day period for persistent febrile illness and was ultimately diagnosed with Adult-Onset Still's Disease (AOSD) after a serum ferritin level was found to be over 42,000 μg/L. AOSD, along with macrophage activation syndrome, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, and septic shock comprise the four hyperferritinemic syndromes. These are potentially life-threatening febrile illnesses that characteristically present with elevated ferritin levels. In this article, we highlight the value of a serum ferritin level in the workup of a patient with prolonged febrile illness and its utility in facilitating early diagnosis and prompt treatment of hyperferritinemic syndromes in the ED.

### Fever of unknown origin [^112tCg9C]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) often is defined as a fever greater than 38.3 degrees C on several occasions during at least 3 weeks with uncertain diagnosis after a number of obligatory tests. In general, infection accounts for approximately one-fourth of cases of FUO, followed by neoplasm and noninfectious inflammatory diseases. No diagnosis is reached in up to 50% of cases. Scintigraphic methods, such as (67)Ga-citrate, labeled leukocytes, and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), are often used in the diagnosis of FUO. In FUO, FDG-PET appears to be of great advantage because malignancy, inflammation, and infection can be detected. FDG-PET does not seem to contribute to a final diagnosis in patients with normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Image fusion combining PET and computed tomography facilitates anatomical localization of increased FDG uptake and better guiding for further diagnostic tests to achieve a final diagnosis. In conclusion, the body of evidence on the utility of FDG-PET in patients with FUO is growing and FDG-PET will probably become the preferred diagnostic procedure, especially when a definite diagnosis cannot easily be achieved. Because of favorable characteristics of FDG-PET, conventional scintigraphic techniques may be replaced by FDG-PET in institutions in which PET is available.

### EANM consensus document on the use of [F] FDG PET / CT in fever and inflammation of unknown origin [^115JBc5m]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Patients with fever and inflammation of unknown origin (FUO/IUO) are clinically challenging due to variable clinical presentations with nonspecific symptoms and many differential diagnoses. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with 2-deoxy-2-[18 F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18 F]FDG) is increasingly used in FUO and IUO, but the optimal diagnostic strategy remains controversial. This consensus document aims to assist clinicians and nuclear medicine specialists in the appropriate use of [18 F]FDG-PET/CT in FUO and IUO based on current evidence.

Methods

A working group created by the EANM infection and inflammation committee performed a systematic literature search based on PICOs with "patients with FUO/IUO" as population, "[18 F]FDG-PET/CT" as intervention, and several outcomes including pre-scan characteristics, scan protocol, diagnostic yield, impact on management, prognosis, and cost-effectiveness.

Results

We included 68 articles published from 2001 to 2023: 9 systematic reviews, 49 original papers on general adult populations, and 10 original papers on specific populations. All papers were analysed and included in the evidence-based recommendations.

Conclusion

FUO and IUO remains a clinical challenge and [18 F]FDG PET/CT has a definite role in the diagnostic pathway with an overall diagnostic yield or helpfulness in 50–60% of patients. A positive scan is often contributory by directly guiding treatment or subsequent diagnostic procedure. However, a negative scan may be equally important by excluding focal disease and predicting a favorable prognosis. Similar results are obtained in specific populations such as ICU-patients, children and HIV-patients.

### Is malaria an important cause of death among adults? [^113DfhCn]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Million Death Study deaths have now been captured and reported through 2013, and the U-shaped distribution clearly persists (Figure 1) (unpublished data from MDS). From 2004 to 2013, 7,527 (2.3%) deaths were attributed to malaria, representing about 150,000 deaths nationwide. Comparing high and low malaria states on the percentage of deaths from major causes for which "fever" was a symptom (Table 1), deaths from malaria stand out as the most discrepant — 20% in high and 7% in low malaria states. A 5% higher distribution of acute respiratory infections in low versus high malaria states (21% versus 15%) could signal some malaria overdiagnosis but not enough to account for the entire difference. We believe this makes a compelling case for at least considering that malaria deaths among adults, particularly those dying at home, may be considerably more common than has been assumed.

Table 1
Fever-related cause-of-death distribution by high and low malaria regions, 2001–2013

We also compared the earlier MDS results (2001–2003) with information from other sources in India. The proportional distribution of malaria deaths in the MDS in states with substantial malaria transmission is similar to the geographic pattern of clinically confirmed malaria deaths reported by the national malaria control program. The same is true comparing malaria mortality from the MDS with P. falciparum district transmission rates from the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme. The malaria mortality distribution was not correlated with national data for dengue, typhoid, or meningitis, which might be confused with malaria. The MDS deaths coded as "fever of unknown origin" also were not correlated with the independent malaria indices.

### Fever of unknown origin in adults [^112FQ7yj]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Fever of unknown origin is defined as a clinically documented temperature of 101°F or higher on several occasions, coupled with an unrevealing diagnostic workup. The differential diagnosis is broad but is typically categorized as infection, malignancy, noninfectious inflammatory disease, or miscellaneous. Most cases in adults occur because of uncommon presentations of common diseases, and up to 75% of cases will resolve spontaneously without reaching a definitive diagnosis. In the absence of localizing signs and symptoms, the workup should begin with a comprehensive history and physical examination to help narrow potential etiologies. Initial testing should include an evaluation for infectious etiologies, malignancies, inflammatory diseases, and miscellaneous causes such as venous thromboembolism and thyroiditis. If erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein levels are elevated and a diagnosis has not been made after initial evaluation, 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan, with computed tomography, may be useful in reaching a diagnosis. If noninvasive diagnostic tests are unrevealing, then the invasive test of choice is a tissue biopsy because of the relatively high diagnostic yield. Depending on clinical indications, this may include liver, lymph node, temporal artery, skin, skin-muscle, or bone marrow biopsy. Empiric antimicrobial therapy has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of fever of unknown origin and therefore should be avoided except in patients who are neutropenic, immunocompromised, or critically ill.

### Fever therapy in febrile adults: systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^116W9oDD]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Methods

This systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials was conducted in accordance with a pre-specified protocol registered on the international prospective registry of systematic reviews (PROSPERO CRD42019134006).

We searched all relevant databases from their inception to 2 July 2021 and included randomised clinical trials including adults diagnosed as having fever of any origin. Trials had to compare fever therapy with no fever therapy (with or without placebo/sham). Primary outcomes were all cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were quality of life and non-serious adverse events. In accordance with the instructions in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, two authors independently reviewed each trial, using the second version of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (RoB2) to assess the risks of bias. We calculated risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals by using meta-analyses for dichotomous outcomes. We handled missing data by following the eight step procedure suggested by Jakobsen and colleagues. We did meta-analyses by following the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions, Keus and colleagues, and Jakobsen and colleagues. We used Stata version 16 to analyse the data. We combined a visual inspection of forest plots with a statistical analysis to identify potential heterogeneity. We did subgroup analyses to further investigate heterogeneity and to inspire hypotheses for future studies. Aiming to reduce the risk of type I and II errors, we used a multiplicity adjusted P value and did trial sequential analyses. We used the approach proposed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group for rating the certainty of the evidence. A comprehensive description of the methods is provided in the supplementary methods.

Differences between protocol and review

We revised our planned methods of assessing the risk of bias of the included trials and used the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool 2 (RoB2 tool)instead of the first version of the tool as stated in the protocol. Research in the field has progressed, and RoB2 reflects current understanding of how the causes of bias may influence trial results and is the most appropriate way to assess the risk of bias. Furthermore, we revised our planned methods for confirming or rejecting a fixed intervention effect of 25% to instead use trial sequential analyses to define the lowest intervention effects threshold we could confirm or reject.

### EANM consensus document on the use of [F] FDG PET / CT in fever and inflammation of unknown origin [^114vCVpj]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Protocol

A major advantage of [18 F]FDG PET/CT over CT, MRI and ultrasound is the possibility to screen the whole body in patients with suspected systemic disease and few diagnostic clues. The scan field should minimally include the vertex to mid-thighs, but a total-body acquisition could be considered.

Stand-alone PET is nowadays considered obsolete in FUO and only combined [18 F]FDG PET/CT will be addressed in this document A disadvantage of hybrid-PET/CT over CT alone is the higher combined radiation exposure, which should be kept as low as possible especially in children and young adults. Depending on the clinical indication, CT may be contrast-enhanced or non-enhanced. The latter is often referred to as low-dose, although this may be misleading, and the actual settings are usually based on local practice more than guidelines. Adding CT to PET results in an additional exposure of approximately 2–10 mSv depending on protocols on top of the radiation exposure of FDG (0.019 mSv/MBq). In the literature on FUO, most studies used a non-enhanced "low-dose" CT while few studies were performed with contrast-enhanced CT. However, head-to-head comparisons are lacking to determine the incremental value of upfront contrast-enhanced CT. Solid malignancies and abscesses are notable exceptions, and if these are suspected upfront, contrast-enhanced CT is indicated but may be performed in a separate setting.

In conclusion, a non-enhanced "low-dose" CT is sufficient in FUO/IUO to define the location of metabolic abnormalities that could lead to the diagnosis. There is usually limited value of contrast-enhanced CT because of the often relatively minor morphologic changes from infectious and inflammatory processes, especially at early stages.

### Prolonged and recurrent fevers in children [^112YUxC3]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Some children referred for prolonged fever are actually not having elevated temperatures; the approach here requires dissection of the history and correction of health misperceptions. Others have well-documented fevers associated with clinical, laboratory, or epidemiologic findings that should point to a specific diagnosis. "Fever-of-Unknown-Origin" (FUO) is the clinical scenario of daily fever for ≥ 14 days that defies explanation after a careful history, physical examination, and basic laboratory tests. The diagnostic approach requires a meticulous fever diary, serial clinical and laboratory evaluations, vigilance for the appearance of new signs and symptoms, and targeted investigations; the pace of the work-up is determined by the severity of the illness. Approximately half of children with FUO will have a self-limited illness and will never have a specific diagnosis made; the other half will ultimately be found to have, in order, infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic conditions. Irregular, intermittent, recurrent fevers in the well-appearing child are likely to be sequential viral illnesses. Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases should be considered in those who do not fit the picture of recurrent infections and who do not have hallmarks of immune deficiency. Stereotypical febrile illnesses that recur with clockwork periodicity should raise the possibilities of cyclic neutropenia, if the cycle is approximately 21 days, or periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome, the most common periodic fever in childhood.

### Multiple myeloma and fever of unknown origin: a need for therapy [^111sa7wj]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Sir,

In their concise review on evolving treatment strategies for myeloma, stated that 'early death was, and still is, a significant problem, and addressing the causes of this is important including early diagnosis, the treatment of infection, hydration and the choice of the most appropriate chemotherapy'. The most common presenting symptoms of the disease are fatigue, bone pain and recurrent infections. The latest classification system, recently released from), highlighted the importance to distinguish between asymptomatic and overt myeloma, because only the latter requires active treatment. According to this statement, the biological activity of the disease, more than the tumour mass, is the foremost guide to the therapy. The related organ or tissue impairment (ROTI) that meets the criterion for the diagnosis consists of hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anaemia or bone lesions (a group of findings referred to as CRAB). However, we need to understand that some of the clinical features of the disease, as the degree of anaemia, are not completely explained by the plasma cellular infiltrates or paraprotein secretion. Although uncommonly, myeloma can present as fever of unknown origin (FUO). In these cases the fever is attributable to the disease itself, and indeed no infections are demonstrable, even with extensive work-up. Moreover, the fever cannot be abated with antibiotics although chemotherapy works well. It is not already known if the modulation of the interaction between the neoplastic clone and the marrow microenvironment, as is the case during therapy with bortezomib, could reverse this kind of presentation; this could in turn result in delaying chemotherapy, at least in patients not eligible for transplantation procedures. Morgan and Davies conclude saying that in the future it will be desirable to describe myeloma as a treatable disease with prolonged survival and good quality of life if the correct treatment decisions are made. We agree with this and we add, moreover, if the correct diagnosis has also been made. We therefore suggest that FUO should be mentioned as an indication for diagnosis and therapy in myeloma patients.

### EANM consensus document on the use of [F] FDG PET / CT in fever and inflammation of unknown origin [^114uAhiM]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

FUO/IUO remains a clinical challenge due to the heterogeneous patient presentation, a wide variety of differential diagnoses, and the lack of an established workup strategy. The literature is as challenging and heterogeneous as the population, which hampers pooling of data and direct comparison between studies.

However, [18 F]FDG PET/CT has a definite role in the diagnostic workup with an overall diagnostic yield/helpfulness of 50–60%. A positive scan is often contributory and, in some cases, even essential to diagnosis, whereas a negative scan may be equally important as it excludes focal disease and predicts a favorable prognosis. Similar results are obtained in specific populations such as ICU-patients, children and HIV-patients.

### Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis presenting as fever of unknown origin: case report [^1172ndby]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) can be defined as a body temperature higher than 38.3°C on several occasions over more than 3 weeks, the diagnosis of which remains uncertain after 1 week of evaluation. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with a wide range of clinical manifestations. The highest incidence of ADEM is observed during childhood and it usually occurs following a viral or bacterial infection or, more rarely, following a vaccination, or without a preceding cause.

Case presentation

Here, we describe an atypical case of ADEM that initially manifested as several weeks of FUO in a fifteen years old boy.

Conclusions

This case report suggests a new possible syndromic association between ADEM and FUO, which should be considered in the clinical examination of patients with FUO, especially in the presence of also modest neurologic or neuropsychiatric symptoms.

### Contribution of (18) F-FDG PET in the diagnostic assessment of fever of unknown origin (FUO): a stratification-based meta-analysis [^115rXtS6]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to quantify the contribution of FDG PET to the diagnostic assessment of fever of unknown origin (FUO), taking into account the diagnostic limitations resulting from the composite nature of this entity.

Methods

The PubMed/MEDLINE database was searched from 2000 to September 2015. Original articles fulfilling the following criteria were included: (1) FUO as the initial diagnosis, (2) no immunosuppressed or nosocomial condition, (3) final diagnosis not based on PET, (4) a follow-up period specified, (5) adult population, and (6) availability of adapted data for calculation of odds ratios (ORs). ORs were computed for each study and then pooled using a random effects model. Stratification-based sensitivity analyses were finally performed using the following prespecified criteria: (a) study design, (b) PET device, (c) geographic area, and (d) follow-up period.

Results

A meta-analysis of the 14 included studies showed that normal PET findings led to an increase in the absolute final diagnostic rate of 36% abnormal PET findings to an increase of 83%, corresponding to a pooled OR of 8.94 (95% CI 4.18–19.12, Z = 5.65; p < 0.00001). The design of the studies influenced the results (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.00–8.53 for prospective studies; OR 18,57, 95% CI 7.57–45.59 for retrospective studies; p = 0.01), whereas devices (dedicated or hybrid), geographic area and follow-up period did not.

Conclusion

Abnormal PET findings are associated with a substantially increased final diagnostic rate in FUO. Consequently, FDG PET could be considered for inclusion in the first-line diagnostic work-up of FUO. Further randomized prospective studies with standardized FDG PET procedures are warranted to confirm this first-line position.

IV. Blood cultures in critically ill patients with fever — For ICU patients with fever without an obvious source who have a central venous catheter, "we recommend simultaneous collection of central venous catheter and peripherally drawn blood cultures to allow calculation of differential time to positivity (best practice statement)". When central venous catheter cultures are indicated, "we recommend sampling at least two lumens (best-practice statement)". For a new fever of unclear origin in critically ill patients, "we suggest that if rapid molecular tests on blood are performed, they should only be used with concomitant blood cultures (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence)". In adult ICU patients, "we recommend sequentially collecting at least two sets of blood cultures (ideally 60 mL of blood total), from different anatomical sites, without a time interval between them (Best practice statement)".

### Prospective studies comparing structured vs nonstructured diagnostic protocol evaluations among patients with fever of unknown origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113RjAiM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

A question remains: can there be an optimal diagnostic protocol to improve diagnostic yield, and for whom or where would it be most applicable? If this search is based on the diagnostic protocol with the least percentage of undiagnosed cases (eg, highest correlation), only 2 studies, used structured protocols reporting rates less than 10.0% despite differing protocols. However, these 2 studies enrolled patients with FUO according to criteria by de Kleijn et al. Therefore, further exploration into the most valuable elements of these 2 protocols might inform an optimal protocol. The positive practical implications of our research results appear to be clear, suggesting physicians worldwide should initially consider geographic disease prevalence when evaluating these patients.

Although this meta-analysis did not support using a structured FUO protocol, that does not exclude additional, more extensive studies exploring optimal diagnostic methods. The goal of FUO research should be to improve the accurate diagnosis and facilitate efficiency with as few tests as required. Possible concepts for future studies include (1) use of a standard contemporary criterion to classify adults with FUOthat would enhance research by allowing better comparison of studies; (2) use of geographic disease epidemiologyand potential diagnostic clues in formulating disease hypotheses, because cases without these clues are particularly challenging to diagnose; (3) design of initial agnostic panel-based diagnostic testing strategies to meet geographic variations in disease, particularly in patients without potential diagnostic clues; and (4) earlier incorporation of advanced diagnostic methods (eg, 18 F-fludeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography with or without computed tomography or unbiased next-generation sequencing methods). The most definitive approach would be developing a multicenter FUO network that could prospectively evaluate structured vs nonstructured diagnostic investigations incorporating these elements with geographic disease epidemiology.

Finally, undiagnosed disorders are challenging for patients, families, and clinicians. Therefore, forging an FUO network to evaluate patients with undiagnosed diseases that fosters the breadth of expert collaborations and builds on the principles of the precision diagnostic model implemented by the National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Diseases Networkmight reduce undiagnosed FUO cases. By improving testing efficiency and patient outcomes, such a network would leverage findings to facilitate better patient care, including added information about existing diseases as well as the discovery of novel prolonged febrile conditions among the many remaining without diagnoses.

### F-FDGPET / CT in fever of unknown origin and inflammation of unknown origin: a Chinese multi-center study [^115Y73PK]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the clinical value of 18 F-FDG-PET/CT for the diagnosis of fever of unknown origin (FUO) and inflammation of unknown origin (IUO) in Chinese population, as well as the characteristics of PET/CT in different category of etiological disease.

Methods

A total of 376 consecutive patients with FUO/IUO who underwent FDG-PET/CT at 12 hospitals were retrospectively studied. FDG uptake was quantitatively and visually evaluated, by using SUV max and a 4-grade scale respectively. A questionnaire survey to the clinicians was used to evaluate the significance of PET/CT in diagnosing of FUO/IUO. Data analysis included the etiological distribution in the study population, image characteristics in different category of diseases, and clinical significance of PET/CT.

Results

In 376 studied patients, the infectious diseases accounted for 33.0% of patients, rheumatologic diseases for 32.4%, malignancies for 19.1%, miscellaneous causes for 6.6%, and cause unknown for 8.8%. However, the etiological distribution among hospitals was varied. In addition, the etiological disease composition ratio has changed over time in China. On PET/CT examinations, 358 (95.2%) of the patients had a positive finding. Within them, local high uptake lesion was found in 219 cases, and nonspecific abnormal uptake (NAU) was found in 187 cases. FDG uptake in malignant diseases was significantly higher than in other category diseases both on SUV max and visual scores (t-value range from 4.098 to 5.612, all P value < 0.001). Based on a clinical questionnaire survey, PET/CT provided additional diagnostic information for 77.4% of patients, and 89.6% of patients benefited from PET/CT examination.

Conclusions

FDG PET/CT is a valuable tool for clinical diagnosis of FUO/IUO, and it is of great significance in further investigating the usefulness of PET/CT in non-neoplastic diseases.

### Panniculitis with fever of unknown origin [^112auSmq]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Background

The term fever of unknown origin (FUO) was first used by Petersdorf and Beeson at Yale University in the 1960s. They studied 100 patients with a body temperature above 38.3°C for over 3 weeks without diagnosis despite a week of hospital evaluation. Most panniculitides present similarly, with tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules, typically where fatty tissue is prominent (eg, legs, thighs, buttocks and cheeks). Subtypes of panniculitis are linked to infections, trauma, cancer and inflammatory illnesses. Diagnosing panniculitis is challenging due to its rarity and similar clinical presentations. Diagnosis requires thorough clinical examination, considering patient risk factors, lesion distribution and related symptoms (eg, ulceration, sclerosis and atrophy). Histopathologic evaluation can aid diagnosis, but requires careful clinical correlation to avoid inaccuracies. The challenge increases with FUO, necessitating a comprehensive assessment. We describe a young child with panniculitis and recurring fevers, highlighting the diagnostic challenges and need for a multidisciplinary approach

### Summary: appropriate use criteria for the use of nuclear medicine in fever of unknown origin [^1127xPko]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic work-up of patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO) begins with a thorough history and physical examination, complete blood count with differential, chest x-ray, urinalysis and culture, electrolyte panel, liver enzymes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level. Additional imaging procedures, including nuclear medicine tests, are generally used as second-line procedures, with 18 F-FDG PET and PET/CT assuming increasingly important roles in the diagnostic work-up. The Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American College of Nuclear Medicine convened an autonomous expert work group to comprehensively review the published literature for nuclear imaging in adults and children with FUO and establish appropriate use criteria (AUC). This process was performed in accordance with the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which requires that all referring physicians consult AUC by using a clinical decision support mechanism before ordering advanced diagnostic imaging services. The complete findings and discussions of the work group were published on January 8, 2023, and are available at https://www.snmmi.org/ClinicalPractice/content.aspx?ItemNumber = 15666 The AUC in the final document are intended to assist referring health care providers in appropriate use of nuclear medicine imaging procedures in patients with FUO. The work group noted limitations in the current literature on nuclear medicine imaging for FUO, with the need for well-designed prospective multicenter investigations. Consensus findings from published data and expert opinions were used to create recommendations in common clinical scenarios for adults and children. Included in the complete document is a discussion of inflammation of unknown origin (IUO), a recently described entity. In view of the fact that the criteria for FUO and IUO are similar (except for fever > 38.3°C [100.9°F]) and that the most common etiologies of these 2 entities are similar, it is the expert opinion of the work group that the recommendations for nuclear medicine imaging of FUO are also applicable to IUO. These recommendations are included in the full guidance document. This summary reviews rationale, methodology, and main findings and refers the reader to the complete AUC document.

### Fever of unknown origin: the value of FDG-PET / CT [^11579hXS]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is commonly defined as fever higher than 38.3°C on several occasions during at least 3 weeks with uncertain diagnosis after a number of obligatory investigations. The differential diagnosis of FUO can be subdivided in four categories: infections, malignancies, noninfectious inflammatory diseases, and miscellaneous causes. In most cases of FUO, there is an uncommon presentation of a common disease. FDG-PET/CT is a sensitive diagnostic technique for the evaluation of FUO by facilitating anatomical localization of focally increased FDG uptake, thereby guiding further diagnostic tests to achieve a final diagnosis. FDG-PET/CT should become a routine procedure in the workup of FUO when diagnostic clues are absent. FDG-PET/CT appears to be a cost-effective routine imaging technique in FUO by avoiding unnecessary investigations and reducing the duration of hospitalization.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® fever without source or unknown origin-child: 2024 update [^117EcqxT]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fever is the most common reason for the evaluation of pediatric patients in acute care settings. Patients for whom no source of infection is identified after a thorough history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation are classified as having fever without source. Special considerations should be taken in the evaluation of neonates and neutropenic patients as they are at higher risk of serious bacterial infection. Patients with prolonged fever lasting > 3 weeks who have no identifiable source of fever are classified with fever of unknown origin and represent an additional subset of febrile pediatric patients that also require special consideration. This document summarizes the relevant literature and provides expert recommendations for the selection of the initial imaging in four common clinical scenarios in pediatric patients with fever without source or unknown origin. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Fever of unknown origin: a challenging case [^116WzKVD]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is defined as a body temperature of ≥ 38.3°C on at least two occasions and a duration of illness of ≥ 3 weeks or having multiple febrile episodes over this time period. There must be no obvious diagnosis despite complete history taking and examination, as well as appropriate investigation that should include routine blood tests, inflammatory markers, autoimmune screen, cultures, chest radiography and abdominal imaging. Investigation includes identifying any potential diagnostic clues (PDCs) that can help reveal the underlying cause of the fever; however, up to 50% of cases of FUO remain undiagnosed.

The case described here is of a rare condition presenting with FUO that proved to be a diagnostic challenge. Despite its rarity, accurate documentation of cases of Cogan's syndrome remains crucial to improving our awareness and understanding of this condition. This could in turn bring about the development of more effective treatment as well as reduce patient morbidity by leading to earlier diagnosis. Our case also stresses how laboratory and radiological investigations should not serve as an alternative to thorough clinical assessments since early recognition of PDCs and symptom complexes is more likely to help clinch a diagnosis than investigations which can at times return non-specific results.

### Approach to the adult patient with fever of unknown origin [^1135PtTj]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) in adults is defined as a temperature higher than 38.3 degrees C (100.9 degrees F) that lasts for more than three weeks with no obvious source despite appropriate investigation. The four categories of potential etiology of FUO are classic, nosocomial, immune deficient, and human immunodeficiency virus-related. The four subgroups of the differential diagnosis of FUO are infections, malignancies, autoimmune conditions, and miscellaneous. A thorough history, physical examination, and standard laboratory testing remain the basis of the initial evaluation of the patient with FUO. Newer diagnostic modalities, including updated serology, viral cultures, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, have important roles in the assessment of these patients.

### EANM consensus document on the use of [F] FDG PET / CT in fever and inflammation of unknown origin [^115qKiVy]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

The literature on [18 F]FDG PET in FUO/IUO reflects the heterogeneous nature of the clinical entity itself and comparison across different studies is difficult. It may be difficult to dichotomize findings to obtain sensitivity and specificity, and instead, most studies report either "diagnostic yield" or the proportion of patients in whom FDG-PET/CT was considered "helpful". However, both terms are defined differently; some consider only true-positive findings helpful, whereas some also include true-negative findings that may rule out focal infection, inflammation, or malignancies with a high negative predictive value. Some define the term "diagnostic yield" as the fraction of true positives among all positive and negative findings, whereas some the term interchangeably with diagnostic helpfulness. The eldest studies performed with stand-alone PET are now obsolete and not comparable to those performed with modern PET/CT scanners. Most studies are retrospective, with a significant heterogeneity with regard to the use of [18 F]FDG PET/CT during the workup strategy, and baseline characteristics such as population size, definition of FUO/IUO, inclusion and exclusion criteria, patient demographics, and imaging parameters.

The purpose of this consensus document is to help the clinicians and nuclear medicine specialists involved in the management of patients with FUO/IUO to decide how and when to perform [18 F]FDG PET/CT in this setting according to the current evidence.

### Fever of unknown origin: the role of 18F-FDG PET / CT [^116kQyZB]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a challenging diagnostic problem. Timely identification and precise localization of the causing process are critical for appropriate patient management. The present prospective study evaluates the role of PET/CT using (18)F-FDG in the investigation of FUO.

Methods

A total of 48 consecutive patients (25 men, 23 women; age range, 24–82 y) with FUO underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans. FUO was defined as a fever of more than 38.3 degrees C that lasted for more than 3 wk and failure to reach diagnosis after more than 1 wk of inpatient investigation. The performance of PET/CT for identifying the etiology of FUO was assessed. Final diagnosis was based on histopathology, microbiologic assays, or clinical and imaging follow-up.

Results

PET/CT detected suggestive foci of increased (18)F-FDG uptake in 27 patients. In 22 of these 27 positive studies (81%), PET/CT identified the underlying disease and diagnosed infection in 9 patients, an inflammatory process in 10 patients, and malignancy in 3 patients. (18)F-FDG PET/CT was negative in 21 patients. All these patients were diagnosed as having systemic nonfocal infection or drug-induced fever or showed spontaneous resolution of the febrile state with no further evidence of a localized inflammatory, infectious, or malignant process for a clinical follow-up period of 12–36 mo.

Conclusion

(18)F-FDG PET/CT identified the underlying cause of the fever in 46% of the present study population and contributed to the diagnosis or exclusion of a focal pathologic etiology of the febrile state in 90% of patients. (18)F-FDG PET/CT has a high negative predictive value (100%) for assessment of FUO. If confirmed by further studies, (18)F-FDG PET/CT may be used in the future as an initial noninvasive diagnostic modality for assessment of this group of patients.

Diagnostic yield in specific populations

As mentioned above, [18 F]FDG PET/CT provides a good diagnostic yield in the general population of adults with FUO/IUO and can be considered as a primary imaging tool. In addition to the general adult population, [18 F]FDG PET/CT has also been evaluated in specific subpopulations with FUO/IUO, including children, intensive care unit patients, patients with end stage renal disease, and HIV (Table 3).

Table 3
Original studies, special populations

N: number; PPV: positive predictive value; NPV: negative predictive value; R: retrospective; NR: not reported; P: prospective; FUO: fever of unknown origin; IUO: inflammation of unknown origin; ICU: intensive care unit; HIV: human immunodeficiency virus

Children with FUO/IUO

Six retrospective studies (n = 238 patients) evaluated the value of [18 F]FDG PET/CT in children with FUO/IUO, including one study in pediatric transplant patients. The largest study by Pijl et al. including 110 children with FUO showed that [18 F]FDG PET/CT identified a true positive cause of fever in 53 (48%) children, and in 58 children (53%) treatment modifications were based on PET/CT results. The sensitivity and specificity were 86% and 79%, respectively, and CRP levels were positively associated with finding a true focus. [18 F]FDG PET/CT was considered helpful in 48%, whereas 38% remained without a final diagnosis after [18 F]FDG PET/CT. In addition and similar to the adult population, the same issues were encountered regarding different definitions of helpful and whether or not negative scans were considered helpful, non-contributory or unclassified. The clinical helpfulness across the six studies had a considerable span but with sample sizes ranging from 5 to 110 patients, the relative weight of these results are different and not readily comparable.

### Fever of unknown origin: a challenging case [^1113Y21j]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Learning points

History and examination should be repeated throughout the course of the investigation of a fever of unknown origin as these are crucial to identifying potential diagnostic clues, particularly for conditions for which no specific confirmatory test exists.
Longitudinal patient follow-up is essential in making a diagnosis as pathogneumonic features may not all be present at the outset, but tend to develop over a period of time.
The differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with simultaneous eye and inner ear disease includes sarcoidosis, Whipple's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Behçet's syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, syphilis, lympho/myeloproliferative disease of the central nervous system and Cogan's syndrome.
Cogan's syndrome is a challenging diagnosis that can easily be missed at first presentation.
Delay in making the diagnosis should be avoided in view of the potentially disabling sequelae of this condition.
Follow-up of any patient with sudden or rapidly progressive hearing loss should be guaranteed for at least 2 years as this could represent the initial manifestation of Cogan's syndrome.

### A fever of unknown origin workup in the emergency department reveals an unusual pathogen [^113Mu4ND]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

The cause of a fever of unknown origin (FUO, fever of > 21 days without an identified etiology) may be a common illness, an atypical presentation of a common illness, or an unusual illness. A patient with an FUO occasionally presents to the emergency department (ED). The differential diagnosis of an FUO is extensive. A primary goal for the ED physician is to determine if the patient with an FUO has a disorder that needs immediate recognition and treatment. We describe a case of a teenage boy who presented to our ED with 2 weeks of high fever and back pain. We describe this teenage boy with FUO and a surprising diagnosis.

The authors present a patient with fever of unknown origin and vague loin pain. Baseline investigations revealed elevated inflammatory markers and imaging eventually identified a renal mass. Radical nephrectomy was performed at a collaborative surgical list involving both the urology and vascular surgical teams. Histological examination confirmed a retroperitoneal paraganglioma and the patient made a rapid recovery and remains well at follow-up. This case draws attention to the rare diagnosis of retroperitoneal paraganglioma and the potential for diagnostic delay. Furthermore, the vital multi-disciplinary approach to the optimum management of patients with such tumours is highlighted.

### Granulomatosis with polyangiitis manifesting as fever of unknown origin [^113Ddf88]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) has a broad differential diagnosis, including infectious, inflammatory and malignant aetiologies. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) can present with non-specific symptoms, including fever, lethargy and flu-like illness. While systemic vasculitis causing FUO has been well-documented, GPA as an underlying cause for FUO poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for clinicians. We present the case of a 65-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with a report of fever, myalgia and night sweats for greater than 3 weeks. After an extensive workup, the patient was diagnosed with GPA and he eventually responded to corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy. This case aims to raise awareness of FUO secondary to GPA and serves as a reminder to clinicians that early recognition and prompt treatment of this syndrome improves patient outcomes.

### Cat scratch disease presenting as fever of unknown origin is a unique clinical syndrome [^11489y1V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a rare manifestation of cat scratch disease (CSD). Data regarding CSD-associated FUO (CSD-FUO), particularly in adults, are limited. We aimed to study disease manifestations and long-term clinical outcome.

Methods

A national CSD surveillance study has been conducted in Israel since 1991. Data are obtained using questionnaires, review of medical records, and telephone interviews. FUO was defined as fever of ≥ 14 days without an identifiable cause. CSD-FUO patients were identified in the 2004–2017 CSD national registry. Follow-up included outpatient clinic visits and telephone/e-mail surveys.

Results

The study included 66 CSD-FUO patients. Median age was 35.5 years (range, 3–88). Median fever duration was 4 weeks (range, 2–9). Relapsing fever pattern was reported in 52% of patients, weight loss in 57%, and night sweats in 48%. Involvement of ≥ 1 organs occurred in 59% of patients; hepatosplenic space-occupying lesions (35%), abdominal/mediastinal lymphadenopathy (20%), ocular disease (18%), and multifocal osteomyelitis (6%) were the most common. Malignancy, particularly lymphoma, was the initial radiological interpretation in 21% of patients; 32% underwent invasive diagnostic procedures. Of the 59 patients available for follow-up (median duration, 31 weeks; range, 4–445), 95% had complete recovery; 3 patients remained with ocular sequelae.

Conclusion

This is the first attempt to characterize CSD-FUO as a unique syndrome that may be severe and debilitating and often mimics malignancy. Relapsing fever is a common clinical phenotype. Multiorgan involvement is common. Recovery was complete in all patients except in those with ocular disease.

### Quantifying the contribution ofF-FDG PET to the diagnostic assessment of pediatric patients with fever of unknown origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113kbxkq]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The value of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18 F-FDG PET) in the diagnostic assessment of pediatric fever of unknown origin is not known, and evidence from adults is not applicable.

Objective

To quantify the contribution of 18 F-FDG PET to pediatric fever of unknown origin, considering its diagnostic limitations.

Materials and Methods

We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to Feb. 18, 2021. We included studies on patients with pediatric fever of unknown origin presenting sufficient data to calculate the likelihood of achieving definite diagnosis (based on pathology or clinical follow-up) between those with abnormal PET findings versus those with normal PET findings. We assessed the risk of bias using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale and quantified the value of PET by pooling the likelihood of achieving definite diagnosis using a random-effects model.

Results

We included 6 studies and found that pediatric patients with abnormal PET findings were about 17 times more likely to achieve definite diagnoses than those with normal PET findings (odds ratio [OR]: 16.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.0–35, P < 0.00001). Sensitivity analyses using a fixed-effect model (OR 16.91, 95% CI 8.1–35, P < 0.0001) or removing one study at a time (OR 12–20, 95% CI lower bound 3.8–8.6, 95% CI upper bound 33–45, P < 0.0001) did not significantly alter the results. Sample size (interaction P = 0.75), imaging modality (interaction P = 0.29), length of follow-up (interaction P = 0.37), fever of unknown origin subclasses (interaction P = 0.89) and geographical areas (interaction P = 0.74) of studies showed no statistically significant influence on the results.

Conclusion

18 F-FDG PET is a promising approach in the diagnostic work-up of pediatric fever of unknown origin. Further studies are warranted to support routine use in clinical care.

### Fever of unknown origin: clinical overview of classic and current concepts [^111237hy]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) refers to disorders that present with prolonged and perplexing fevers that are difficult to diagnose. This article presents a clinical overview of classic and current causes of FUOs, which may be due to infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, neoplastic, or miscellaneous disorders. Comprehensive but nonfocused diagnostic testing is ineffective and should be avoided. The FUO workup should be directed by the key history, physical, and laboratory findings in clinical presentation. The clinical syndromic approach in the differential diagnosis of FUOs is emphasized, and the diagnostic importance and significance of fever patterns are discussed.

### Fever of unknown origin in the returning traveler [^111Cmo4x]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The returning traveler with fever presents a diagnostic challenge for the health care provider. When evaluating such a patient, the highest priority should be given to diseases that are potentially fatal or may represent public health threats. A good history is paramount and needs to include destination, time and duration of travel, type of activity, onset of fever in relation to travel, associated comorbidities, and any associated symptoms. Pretravel immunizations and chemoprophylaxis may alter the natural course of disease and should be inquired about specifically. The fever pattern, presence of a rash or eschar, organomegaly, or neurologic findings are helpful physical findings. Laboratory abnormalities are nonspecific but when corroborated with clinical and epidemiologic data may offer a clue to diagnosis.

### Overview of fever of unknown origin in adult and paediatric patients [^112ZBvwo]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) can be caused by a wide group of diseases, and can include both benign and serious conditions. Since the first definition of FUO in the early 1960's, several updates to the definition, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches have been proposed. This review outlines a case report of an elderly Italian male patient with high fever and migrating arthralgia who underwent many procedures and treatments before a final diagnosis of Adult-onset Still's disease was achieved. This case report highlights the difficulties in diagnosing certain causes of FUO that requires a very high index of suspicion. The main causes of FUO in paediatric and adult patients will be reviewed here, underlying the fact that a physician should also consider the possibility that a patient with FUO may have a monogenic autoinflammatory disease (AID). The identification of AIDs requires a careful evaluation of both history and clinical details that may reveal important clues to identify the correct aetiology. We also provide a comprehensive account of specific signs and symptoms that could suggest possible diagnoses and guide the work-up of FUO and non-genetic periodic fevers in children.

### FDG-PET in fever of unknown origin [^1112u2oZ]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is commonly defined as fever higher than 38.3°C on several occasions during at least 3 weeks with uncertain diagnosis after a number of obligatory tests. FUO remains a clinical challenge as no diagnosis is reached in up to 50% of cases. In general, infection accounts for one-fourth of cases of FUO, followed by neoplasm and noninfectious inflammatory diseases. FDG-PET is a sensitive diagnostic technique for the evaluation of FUO. Especially integrated imaging combining PET and CT facilitates anatomical localization of focally increased FDG uptake, thereby guiding further diagnostic tests to achieve a final diagnosis. FDG-PET/CT appears to be a more sensitive diagnostic tool in FUO than stand-alone FDG-PET, because of the precise anatomical localization of small lesions and better differentiation between physiological and pathologic metabolic foci. With FDG-PET/CT becoming widely available, FDG-PET/CT should be a routine procedure in the workup of FUO.

### Revised definition of' fever of unknown origin': limitations and opportunities [^115oNtFP]. The Journal of Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

The limitations and opportunities of revised definition of fevers of unknown origin (FUO) in comparison to conventional definition were investigated, and prehospital characteristics of the patients were detailed.

Method

The patients were grouped according to both revised and classic definitions of FUO.

Results

Fifty-nine of the 80 patients (74%) met the conventional definition of FUO. Before their admissions, all patients had at least one course of antibiotic therapy. The aetiology was infectious in 52%, autoimmune in 19%, and neoplastic in 17%. In 12% of the cases, the reason for high fever could not be explained. The most common infectious aetiologies were various forms of tuberculosis (12%), brucellosis (12%), salmonella (7%) and malaria (5%). The revised definition inflated the rate of infectious aetiology.

Conclusion

A standardized set of diagnostic tools used in this study was suggested. The subjects of FUO series have to be screened for endemic infections.

### ACR appropriateness criteria fever without source or unknown origin-child [^113NWVeq]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The cause of fever in a child can often be determined from history, physical examination, and laboratory tests; infections account for the majority of cases. Yet in 20%, no apparent cause can be found, designated as fever without source (FWS). The yield of chest radiography in children with FWS is low, and it is usually not appropriate. However, in children with respiratory signs, high fever (> 39°C), or marked leukocytosis (≥ 20,000/mm(3)), chest radiography is usually appropriate, as it has a higher yield in detecting clinically occult pneumonia. In newborns with FWS, there is higher risk for serious bacterial infection, and the routine use of chest radiography is controversial. In children with neutropenia, fever is a major concern. In some clinical circumstances, such as after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, chest CT scan may be appropriate even if the results of chest radiography are negative or nonspecific, as it has higher sensitivity and can demonstrate specific findings (such as lung nodule and "halo sign") that can guide management. In a child with prolonged fever of unknown origin despite extensive medical workup (fever of unknown origin), diagnosis is usually dependent on clinical and laboratory studies, and imaging tests have low yield. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^1119ZEQw]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Society of Critical Care Medicine/Infectious Diseases Society of America ICU fever evaluation — computed tomography (CT) in postoperative surgical patients: For patients who have recently undergone thoracic, abdominal, or pelvic surgery, we recommend performing CT (in collaboration with the surgical service) as part of a fever workup if an etiology is not readily identified by the initial workup (best-practice statement). There is insufficient evidence to allow for a recommendation to inform the diagnostic value of CT for the diagnosis of underlying causes of fever in ICU patients, yet there was consensus among the panel that it is reasonable for surgical patients to undergo CT imaging of the operative area when fever first occurs several days after surgery and an alternative cause is not readily identified; timing in the immediate postoperative setting has currently insufficient data and should be made in collaboration with the surgical services, with stability of the patient and risk of adverse events during transportation taken into consideration, indications that may include immunocompromised state and specific follow-up of abnormalities on plain radiography, and a benefit that CT can identify sources of fever for which direct diagnostic and/or therapeutic intervention is possible (e.g., percutaneous drainage of an intra-abdominal abscess).

### Mucositis-associated bloodstream infections in adult haematology patients with fever during neutropenia: risk factors and the impact of mucositis severity [^114KZMgc]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients receiving myelotoxic treatment for haematological malignancies are at high risk for bloodstream infections (BSI) and sepsis, which brings about a significant risk of intensive care admission and treatment-related mortality. Many neutropenic fever episodes coincide with an chemotherapy-induced inflammatory response of the gastro-intestinal mucosa, called mucositis. This mucositis-associated gastro-intestinal inflammation results in mucosal barrier disruption which is thought to be the main cause of secondary bloodstream infections. On the other hand, no infectious cause is found in 30% to 60% of neutropenic fever episodes. It is hypothesized that these cases of fever of unknown origin are caused by mucositis-associated inflammation and not by infection, which questions the need for prolonged antibiotic therapy. The uncertainty about the true cause of fever often results in continuation of antibiotic treatment and inherently overtreatment of a group of patients without infection. In order to improve appropriate use of antibiotics for fever during neutropenia, it is important to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious fever and be aware of the presence of risk factors for mucositis-associated bloodstream infections. Previous retrospective studies reported that mucositis severity, prolonged neutropenia, gastro-intestinal dysbiosis, myeloablative conditioning before haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and lack of antibiotic prophylaxis are the most important risk factors for mucositis-associated bloodstream infections. However, there is a lack of prospective multicentre studies focusing on the first days after the onset of febrile neutropenia when the important decision whether or not to continue empirical antibiotics has to be made. In this study, we aimed to improve the understanding of fever during neutropenia by identifying risk factors for mucositis-associated bloodstream infections in haematology patients with high-risk fever during neutropenia.

### EANM / SNMMI guideline / procedure standard for [F] FDG hybrid PET use in infection and inflammation in adults v2.0 [^113pBQpj]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). High credibility.

Common clinical indications — A fever of unknown origin (FUO) is defined as fever higher than 38.3°C (100.9°F) persisting for at least 3 weeks, with no diagnosis despite 3 outpatient visits or in-patient days; FUO is divided into four different subcategories: classical, nosocomial, neutropenic and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) – related. Indications for [18F]FDG PET/CT include evaluation of patients with FUO/IUO without a diagnosis despite standard work-up, while indications with insufficient evidence include evaluation of patients with FUO and normal inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein-CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate-ESR). Specific protocol points state to consider myocardial suppression preparation when there is a potential cardiac etiology, and that [18F]FDG PET/CT study should ideally be performed within 3 days of initiation of oral glucocorticoid therapy.

Impact on patient management and prognosis

A correct and early diagnosis can change the therapeutic strategy, i.e. initiate new therapy, modulate already instituted therapy, or switch therapy regimen completely. Moreover, it may guide specific invasive and noninvasive procedures such as biopsy or drainage, specific serology, or cultures of blood, urine, or tissues with a direct impact also on costs.

A major contribution of [18 F]FDG PET/CT for obtaining the final histological diagnosis is to guide the clinician to the most appropriate and accessible site for biopsy to confirm the underlying etiology.

An indirect impact is to exclude several causes and to narrow down the range of possible diagnoses. About 43–75% of adult patients with undiagnosed FUO experience spontaneous remission of fever before reaching a final diagnosis, and empirical treatment with corticosteroids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs does not affect this rate. Identifying predictors of spontaneous resolution could reduce the use of unnecessary, invasive tests or empirical treatments, and furthermore potentially reduce patient anxiety. As such, a negative PET/CT result can be a good predictor of favorable prognosis in patients with undiagnosed FUO after a series of unsuccessful investigations; watchful waiting may be a valid option for undiagnosed FUO patients with no specific findings. One systematic review studied the association of [18 F]FDG PET/CT results with spontaneous remission in FUO. Patients with negative scan results were significantly more likely to have spontaneous remission of fever than were those with positive scan results, with a summary risk ratio of 5.6 (95% CI, 3.4–9.2). This may also have a direct impact on patient outcome, as prognosis was generally good and mortality very low in patients in whom a final diagnosis could not be obtained.

As FUO is caused by a wide variety of diseases; the overall prognosis highly depends on the underlying disease, with malignancy probably having the most prominent association with mortality.

However, although promising, more robust evidence is required to evaluate the prognostic role of [18 F]FDG PET/CT in FUO/IUO patients.

### Prospective studies comparing structured vs nonstructured diagnostic protocol evaluations among patients with fever of unknown origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1134bzQQ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Our hypothesis that structured protocolized evaluation of FUO would offer a higher diagnostic yield was not borne out through this systematic review–based meta-analysis using prospective studies. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis examining rates of diagnosis between structured compared with nonstructured methods.

The odds of finding a diagnosis were lower in Europe than in other parts of the world. This outcome is consistent with the results reported in a recent systematic review by Fusco et al. Among 18 prospective and retrospective studies from 2005 to 2015, Fusco et alalso reported a lack of data from the African and American regions, which may have influenced diagnostic outcomes. Similarly, our study was also associated with significant heterogeneity and higher percentages of infectious diseases. Unlike their study, which reported a lower frequency of oncologic conditions using the Durack and Street criteria, we had insufficient data to note differences in outcomes based on FUO definitions. However, the estimates derived from studies included in our analyses are more robust owing to the inclusion of only prospective studies from a more extensive set of databases for a greater extended period and different statistical models.

### Prolonged febrile illness and fever of unknown origin in adults [^114rkC3H]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin has been described as a febrile illness (temperature of 101°F [38.3°C] or higher) for three weeks or longer without an etiology despite a one-week inpatient evaluation. A more recent qualitative definition requires only a reasonable diagnostic evaluation. Although there are more than 200 diseases in the differential diagnosis, most cases in adults are limited to several dozen possible causes. Fever of unknown origin is more often an atypical presentation of a common disease rather than an unusual disease. The most common subgroups in the differential are infection, malignancy, noninfectious inflammatory diseases, and miscellaneous. Clinicians should perform a comprehensive history and examination to look for potentially diagnostic clues to guide the initial evaluation. If there are no potentially diagnostic clues, the patient should undergo a minimum diagnostic workup, including a complete blood count, chest radiography, urinalysis and culture, electrolyte panel, liver enzymes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level testing. Further testing should include blood cultures, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibodies. Human immunodeficiency virus and appropriate region-specific serologic testing (e.g., cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, tuberculosis) and abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography or computed tomography are commonly performed. If the diagnosis remains elusive, 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography plus computed tomography may help guide the clinician toward tissue biopsy. Empiric antibiotics or steroids are generally discouraged in patients with fever of unknown origin.

### Surveillance for nosocomial infections and fever of unknown origin among adult hematology-oncology patients [^114DgyLp]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the incidence of nosocomial infections (NIs) and fever of unknown origin among adult hematology-oncology patients.

Design

Prospective surveillance study.

Setting

The 18-bed hematology-oncology unit at the University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.

Patients

All hematology-oncology patients admitted during a total of 8 months in 1998 and 1999.

Methods

Standardized surveillance system based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance system. Rates of NI and fever of unknown origin were calculated for patient-days and patient-days at risk (ie, days with neutropenia of < 500/mm3 or leukopenia of < 1,000/mm3).

Results

Of 116 patients hospitalized for a total of 4,002 days (172 admissions; mean length of stay, 25.2 days), 32 (27.6%) had a total of 44 documented NIs (19 bloodstream infections, 15 pneumonias, 7 urinary tract infections, and 3 others). In addition, 33 fevers of unknown origin were documented in 28 patients. No patient had thrush while receiving antifungal prophylaxis. The overall rates for NI and fever of unknown origin were 11.0 and 8.2 per 1,000 patient-days (25.3 and 15.4 per 1,000 patient-days at risk), respectively. The risks for NI and fever of unknown origin were significantly higher during neutropenic days, with 34 (77.3%) of the 44 NIs and 22 (66.7%) of the 33 fevers of unknown origin occurring during 1,345 patient-days at risk.

Conclusions

Prospective surveillance for NIs on hematology-oncology units should include fever of unknown origin as the single most common and clinically important entity. For a meaningful comparison of surveillance data for hematology-oncology patients, the reported infection rates should include rates based on days with neutropenia, for which days with leukopenia could serve as a surrogate marker under routine conditions.

### Short versus extended treatment with a carbapenem in patients with high-risk fever of unknown origin during neutropenia: a non-inferiority, open-label, multicentre, randomised trial [^113aKs8N]. The Lancet: Haematology (2022). High credibility.

The study SHORT was published by Nick A de Jonge and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Lancet Haematol. This study is related to the following diseases: Febrile neutropenia and Fever of unknown origin. In the SHORT study, the trial question was: is short antibiotic treatment noninferior to extended antibiotic treatment with carbapenems in patients with high-risk fever of unknown origin during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia? In the SHORT study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SHORT study, the population was: 281 patients (109 female, 172 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients who had fever of unknown origin during high-risk neutropenia and were treated for hematological malignancy. The key exclusion criteria were contraindication to use of imipenem-cilastatin or meropenem; corticosteroid use ≥ 10 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent for > 3 consecutive day during the previous 7 days; infection; symptoms of septic shock. In the SHORT study, the interventions were: n = 144 short treatment (500 mg intravenous imipenem-cilastatin QID or 1,000 mg intravenous meropenem TID for 72 hours) n = 137 extended treatment (500 mg intravenous imipenem-cilastatin QID or 1,000 mg intravenous meropenem TID for ≥ 9 days). In the SHORT study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in carbapenem­-sensitive infection or recurrent fever (19% vs. 15%; AD 4%, 90% CI -1.7 to 9.7). In the SHORT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the rate of death within 30 days after the end of neutropenia (3% vs. 1%; AD 2.6%, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.1) Borderline significant increase in duration of hospital admission (24 days vs. 24 days;). In the SHORT study, the safety outcomes were: significant difference in serious adverse events (16% vs. 10%). In the SHORT study, the conclusion was: in adult patients who had fever of unknown origin during high-risk neutropenia and were treated for hematological malignancy, short treatment was noninferior to extended treatment with respect to carbapenem­-sensitive infection or recurrent fever.

### Fever of unknown origin: what is remarkable in the elderly in a developing country? [^113CDVAs]. The Journal of Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate fever of unknown origin (FUO) in 97 patients and compare geriatric and adult population.

Methods

We investigated 97 (22 elderly) patients with FUO using the criteria of Petersdorf and Beeson [Medicine 40 (1961) 1] hospitalized between January 1990 and May 2005 at Hacettepe University Hospital.

Results

Infectious diseases were the most common cause in the adult (33.3%) and the elderly (45.5%) patients both. Neoplasms were seen in 18.7; 4.5% and collagen vascular diseases were diagnosed in 9.3; 4.5% of the adults and the elderly respectively. Tuberculosis accounted for 60% of all the infectious causes and empirical anti-tuberculous treatment served as a diagnostic method in 43% of the cases with tuberculosis. Lymphadenopathy was more common among the adults with FUO. A diagnosis could be reached in all the elderly patients with a very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR > 100mm/h). At the end of the hospitalization, 14.7% (11/75) of the adult patients and 13.6% (3/22) of the elderly patients died.

Conclusion

Geriatric patients with FUO usually have characteristics similar to the adult patients with respect to the hospitalization time, diagnosis, and inpatient mortality. Lymphoid organ hyperplasia might be expected less frequently and very high ESR might be a more reliable indicator of systemic disease in the elderly. Empirical anti-tuberculous treatment plays an important diagnostic role in the developing countries with a higher prevalence of tuberculosis.

### Is malaria an important cause of death among adults? [^112NwUbf]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Skepticism of VA results alone is healthy. The arguments against believing that malaria is causing substantial deaths are well reasoned. People know when they live in an area of high malaria transmission. When interviewed about an acute infectious death, they may be inclined to have a heightened memory of what they consider malaria-like symptoms, which is conveyed to the interviewer. Although interviewers should not influence the interviewees, it would not be unheard of for this to happen. Finally, if physicians are coding cause of death, they may have an unconscious bias toward a malaria determination if they know that the deceased comes from a high-transmission area. For computer-coded VAs, a bias could even be programmed in.

Given the limits of VA, we have searched for reasons to discount or diminish the unexpectedly high malaria mortality rates among adults in the MDS (although we have not done the same for INDEPTH). In India, we found no deficits of other likely causes, including dengue, meningitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, or HIV, but we have found a lower percentage coded as fever of unknown origin in high-transmission areas. We have found that the deaths correlate with other malaria indices (but this could be ascribed to the bias aforementioned). We are not attempting to explain the mechanisms (presumably immunologic) underlying the patterns we describe, but note that arguments against the observed excess being due to malaria are based in large part on an assumption that acquired immunity to malaria is unchanging even at older ages. While involving different aspects of the immune response than malaria immunity, immunity to other common infections, such as influenza and pneumonia, does wane with age.

§§ Based on the same study as Buchrits et al.

Balink et al. performed the largest multicentre retrospective study on FUO/IUO patients (n = 498). [18 F]FDG PET/CT had a high diagnostic accuracy (89%) and the addition of [18 F]FDG PET/CT to a model for the prediction of a diagnosis including CRP, ESR and age resulted in a significant change in patient classification in 42% of patients.

The largest prospective study (n = 524) on the diagnostic value of [18 F]FDG PET/CT in patients with FUO aimed to develop a diagnostic model to distinguish the different causes of FUO. [18 F]FDG PET/CT showed positive findings in 477 (91%) patients (diffuse or focal high uptake in various organs and tissues). The diagnostic model including [18 F]FDG PET/CT and relevant clinical parameters (e.g. blood cell counts, inflammatory and immunological indicators, age) showed a good performance in discriminating the cause of FUO with AUCs for infection, malignancy, and NIID of 0.88, 0.93 and 0.95, respectively. Previous studies have also divided positive [18 F]FDG PET/CT studies into focal and nonspecific abnormal uptake. The latter is represented by diffuse high [18 F]FDG uptake of spleen and bone marrow and multiple lymph nodes with high [18 F]FDG uptake and symmetrical distribution. This pattern was considered non-contributing to the diagnosis or even false positives in other studies. However, nonspecific abnormal [18 F]FDG uptake as well as a negative [18 F]FDG PET/CT scan could also be of benefit for the patients.

### Prospective studies comparing structured vs nonstructured diagnostic protocol evaluations among patients with fever of unknown origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113VW5zS]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

In this meta-analysis, we noted a considerable variation in diagnostic yield across studies, with significant geographic variations in the diagnostic outcomes. Analysis by geographic region based on the 6 WHO regionswas associated with the diagnostic yield, despite the limited number of studies for some locations, suggesting that geographic disease prevalence affects outcomes of FUO investigations. Infection was most prevalent in Southeastern Asia at 49.0%. Noninfectious inflammatory disorders were most common in Western Pacific regions (27.0%). The highest rates for oncologic explanations were in the Eastern Mediterranean region (24.0%).

There was considerable variation in diagnostic yield across WHO regions and studies performed within each region. Plotting the diagnostic yield by United Nations Human Development Index ranking, GNI, and LEB (eFigures 2–4 in the Supplement) resulted in a nonlinear trend. Those at the highest ends of the scale tended to have the worst diagnostic yield, those in the middle had the best diagnostic yield, and those at the bottom end of the scale tended to be somewhere in between. Factors associated with these differences in diagnostic yields in this analysis are unclear. Plausible hypotheses include the following: (1) more rigorous initial investigations leave the most complex cases for evaluation; (2) episodic and benign fevers prompt less rigorous evaluations; (3) conditions yet to be understood exist despite the availability of advanced diagnostic methods and several rounds of evaluations within a higher income environment of clinical experts; (4) diagnostic methods improve over time; (5) variations associated with the ecology of medical care are present; and (6) differences exist within populations that have to do with inflammatory tendencies vs infection prevalence, which appears to be diagnosed more readily.

### Role of FDG-PET / CT in children with fever of unknown origin [^114E4C2v]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fever is defined as an elevated body temperature of 38.0–38.3 °C or higher. It is one of the most common symptoms in children presenting at the hospital. In fact, fever is the chief complaint of children who visit the hospital in 16 to 30% of cases. The differential diagnosis of fever is broad. The most common cause is infection, with autoimmune disease and malignancy as second and third causes, respectively. In approximately 50% of infants up to 3 years old with fever, no cause is found. In all children with FUO, no definitive cause of fever is found in 10 to 20% of cases, despite extensive history taking, physical examination, and laboratory testing.

There is no widespread consensus on the definition of fever of unknown origin (FUO), and various definitions have been applied throughout the years (,–). Currently, fever in children is considered FUO after 8 or more days of febrile illness, when a careful and thorough history taking, physical examination, and laboratory workup failed to reveal a probable cause of the fever. If these criteria apply, but children have fever for less than 8 days, they are sometimes considered to have "fever without source" (FWS).

In the workup of febrile patients, various diagnostic tests may be used to identify the cause of fever. These investigations often include chest radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocyte count, urinalysis, and microbiologic tests. More advanced or invasive investigations may include computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), immunologic or organ-specific laboratory investigations, cytologic punctures, and histologic biopsies.

In adults, 18 F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT is known to be helpful for diagnosing infectious or inflammatory foci in patients with FUO (,–). FDG-PET/CT is already the first imaging modality in several infectious and inflammatory diseases.

### Etiology and resource use of fever of unknown origin in hospitalized children [^112h3Wip]. Hospital Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a well-known pediatric presentation. The primary studies determining the causes of prolonged fever in children were performed 4 decades ago, before major advances in laboratory and diagnostic testing. Given that the distribution of diagnosed causes of adult FUO has changed in recent decades, we hypothesized that the etiology of FUO in children has concordantly changed and also may be impacted by a definition that includes a shorter required duration of fever.

Methods

A single-center, retrospective review of patients 6 months to 18 years of age admitted to the North Carolina Children's Hospital from January 1, 2002, to December 21, 2012, with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis of fever, a documented fever duration > 7 days before admission, and a previous physician evaluation of each patient's illness.

Results

A total of 1164 patients were identified, and of these, 102 met our inclusion criteria for FUO. Etiologic categories included "infectious" (42 out of 102 patients), "autoimmune" (28 out of 102 patients), "oncologic" (18 out of 102 patients), and "other" or "unknown" (14 out of 102 patients). Several clinical factors were statistically and significantly different between etiologic categories, including fever length, laboratory values, imaging performed, length of stay, and hospital costs.

Conclusions

Unlike adult studies, the categorical distribution of diagnoses for pediatric FUO has marginally shifted compared to previously reported pediatric studies. Patients hospitalized with FUO undergo prolonged hospital stays and have high hospital costs. Additional study is needed to improve the recognition, treatment, and expense of diagnosis of prolonged fever in children.

### Prospective studies comparing structured vs nonstructured diagnostic protocol evaluations among patients with fever of unknown origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114aDuma]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Patients meeting the criteria for fever of unknown origin (FUO) can be evaluated with structured or nonstructured approaches, but the optimal diagnostic method is unresolved.

Objective

To analyze differences in diagnostic outcomes among patients undergoing structured or nonstructured diagnostic methods applied to prospective clinical studies.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases with librarian-generated query strings for FUO, PUO, fever or pyrexia of unknown origin, clinical trial, and prospective studies identified from January 1, 1997, to March 31, 2021.

Study Selection

Prospective studies meeting any adult FUO definition were included. Articles were excluded if patients did not precisely fit any existing adult FUO definition or studies were not classified as prospective.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Abstracted data included years of publication and study period, country, setting (eg, university vs community hospital), defining criteria and category outcome, structured or nonstructured diagnostic protocol evaluation, sex, temperature threshold and measurement, duration of fever and hospitalization before final diagnoses, and contribution of potential diagnostic clues, biochemical and immunological serologic studies, microbiology cultures, histologic analysis, and imaging studies. Structured protocols compared with nonstructured diagnostic methods were analyzed using regression models.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Overall diagnostic yield was the primary outcome.

Results

Among the 19 prospective trials with 2627 unique patients included in the analysis (range of patient ages, 10–94 years; 21.0%-55.3% female), diagnoses among FUO series varied across and within World Health Organization (WHO) geographic regions. Use of a structured diagnostic protocol was not significantly associated with higher odds of yielding a diagnosis compared with nonstructured protocols in aggregate (odds ratio [OR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.65–1.49) or between Western Europe (Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Spain) (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.49–1.86) and Eastern Europe (Turkey and Romania) (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.41–1.69). Despite the limited number of studies in some regions, analyses based on the 6 WHO geographic areas found differences in the diagnostic yield. Western European studies had the lowest percentage of achieving a diagnosis. Southeast Asia led with infections at 49.0%. Noninfectious inflammatory conditions were most prevalent in the Western Pacific region (34.0%), whereas the Eastern Mediterranean region had the highest proportion of oncologic explanations (24.0%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, diagnostic yield varied among WHO regions. Available evidence from prospective studies did not support that structured diagnostic protocols had a significantly better rate of achieving a diagnosis than nonstructured protocols. Clinicians worldwide should incorporate geographical disease prevalence in their evaluation of patients with FUO.

### Characterization of genetic landscape and novel inflammatory biomarkers in patients with adult-onset Still's disease [^115YK82V]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Adult‐onset Still disease (AOSD) is a systemic autoinflammatory disorders (AID) of unknown etiology. Typically presenting with prolonged intermittent fevers, arthralgias, and evanescent rash — any system can be affected. It is most often diagnosed following exclusion of infection, malignancy, or other inflammatory rheumatologic diseases, and patients must fulfill classification criteria to confirm the diagnosis. The criteria by Yamaguchi et al is the most commonly used.

AOSD can be stratified into different subtypes depending on disease course or predominant clinical features. In the chronic disease course, patients either have systemic disease characterized by high fevers, rash, and multiorgan involvement, or a predominantly articular disease manifesting with inflammatory joint problems. There is frequent overlap among these presentations.

### Prospective studies comparing structured vs nonstructured diagnostic protocol evaluations among patients with fever of unknown origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111nCFXT]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis of recent prospective study data demonstrated insufficient evidence to support a positive association between using a structured diagnostic protocol and diagnostic yield in cases of FUO syndrome. However, analysis by geographic region did show clear differences in rates and types of diagnoses. This supports the argument that physicians worldwide should incorporate geographic disease prevalence when evaluating these patients. Given the considerable variation across regions and studies, larger-scale research is needed to sufficiently understand the sources and magnitudes of variation in FUO cases. Whether a universal FUO protocol can be developed or enhanced and tailored to geography and widely available resources has yet to be discerned. Clinicians evaluating these patients should remain vigilant for clues based on individual presentations and consequently acknowledge that a nonstructured evaluation protocol might be an appropriate choice for some or most patients.
