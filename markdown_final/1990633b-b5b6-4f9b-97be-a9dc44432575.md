## Question

How does pyridoxine supplementation affect homocysteine levels in patients with cardiovascular disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation affects homocysteine levels and whether this impacts cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biochemical role of pyridoxine in homocysteine metabolism. Then, I should verify whether pyridoxine alone meaningfully lowers homocysteine in clinical trials. Next, I will examine whether homocysteine lowering with B-vitamin combinations that include pyridoxine reduces cardiovascular outcomes. After that, I need to check for any subgroup signals or mechanistic findings that might suggest a role for pyridoxine. Finally, I will synthesize guideline-level recommendations and a practical clinical takeaway, making sure I distinguish pyridoxine-specific effects from folate-driven effects.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical rationale. Pyridoxine, as pyridoxal-5′-phosphate, is a required cofactor for cystathionine β-synthase in the transsulfuration pathway that irreversibly converts homocysteine to cystathionine, so in principle B6 could lower homocysteine, particularly post–methionine load when flux through transsulfuration is higher [^117EaJJD] [^1148yDaD].

> Wait, let me verify whether pyridoxine alone lowers homocysteine in practice. A meta-analysis of randomized trials found that adding vitamin B6 to folic acid produced no additional reduction in homocysteine beyond folate, suggesting no clinically meaningful independent effect of B6 on fasting homocysteine in typical populations, although B6 may have a role after a methionine load where transsulfuration is stressed [^115Go8Hp] [^1148yDaD]. I should double-check that this aligns with trial formulations; indeed, large outcome trials that included B6 used folate-based regimens and showed homocysteine reductions attributable primarily to folate, not to an independent B6 effect on fasting homocysteine [^115Go8Hp] [^111drmZY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about outcomes. I will now examine whether homocysteine lowering with B-vitamin combinations that include pyridoxine reduces cardiovascular events. Multiple large randomized trials and meta-analyses show that folate-based regimens with or without B6/B12 lower homocysteine by roughly 20–30% but do not reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, or all-cause mortality, and in some settings show no stroke benefit either, indicating that any homocysteine lowering achieved does not translate into fewer cardiovascular outcomes [^112Ws4bs] [^111drmZY] [^111giLr2] [^113U2eT6] [^115hsoBH].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there was a consistent stroke signal across all B-vitamin trials. Let me reconsider. The most consistent signal for benefit is a modest reduction in stroke with folic acid–based therapy in some analyses, but this is largely driven by folate and is inconsistent across meta-analyses, with many showing neutral effects overall; moreover, when B6 is included, it is not the driver of benefit, and the magnitude of homocysteine reduction correlates poorly with stroke risk reduction, arguing against a causal role for B6-specific homocysteine lowering in stroke prevention [^112Ws4bs] [^111giLr2] [^117CMh8A] [^116RjiYU].

> I need to check whether pyridoxine has any independent mechanistic or subgroup signals. Small studies suggest B6 may improve endothelial function in specific populations, such as cardiac transplant recipients, but these findings did not show concurrent homocysteine lowering and have not translated into hard cardiovascular outcome benefits in larger trials, so they remain hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing [^1173e8qV]. Let me also confirm whether B6 modifies inflammatory or coagulation biomarkers; substudies show no consistent improvement in inflammatory or endothelial biomarkers with B-vitamin regimens that include B6, which aligns with the lack of clinical outcome benefit [^111KkzGh] [^112vsDV9].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. Contemporary guidelines for PAD and general CVD prevention state that B-complex vitamin supplementation to lower homocysteine is not recommended because it does not improve clinical outcomes, reflecting the neutral results of large randomized trials including HOPE-2 and subsequent meta-analyses [^116R6vDn] [^115bkSf1]. I should confirm that this applies across high-risk populations; indeed, even in renal disease and transplant cohorts, folate-based homocysteine lowering has not reduced cardiovascular events despite biochemical homocysteine reductions, reinforcing the lack of causal benefit from homocysteine lowering in established disease [^113L6V69] [^116SeK1u] [^113Lgz8T].

> But wait, what if the issue is timing or baseline homocysteine level? Observational and genetic data suggest homocysteine is a risk marker, and Mendelian randomization hints at a stroke signal, yet randomized trials in largely folate-replete or fortified populations have not shown robust, consistent benefits, and any stroke effect appears folate-driven rather than B6-driven; thus, B6-specific homocysteine lowering remains unsupported as a strategy to prevent cardiovascular events [^113Ajxd7] [^116bzASv] [^111giLr2].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. Pyridoxine can participate in homocysteine metabolism, but in clinical practice it does not meaningfully lower fasting homocysteine on its own, and when included in B-vitamin regimens, the observed homocysteine reductions and any stroke signals are attributable to folate. Importantly, these biochemical changes have not translated into consistent reductions in cardiovascular events, so pyridoxine supplementation should not be used to lower homocysteine for the purpose of preventing cardiovascular events in patients with established cardiovascular disease [^115Go8Hp] [^112Ws4bs] [^111giLr2] [^115bkSf1].

> Final clinical takeaway: I should confirm the practical guidance. Do not prescribe pyridoxine to lower homocysteine for cardiovascular risk reduction. Instead, manage standard risk factors and reserve B-vitamin testing and targeted therapy for specific deficiencies or inborn errors of metabolism, such as cystathionine β-synthase deficiency where pyridoxine responsiveness may be relevant to stroke prevention strategies, not for routine secondary prevention in CVD [^1121mWee] [^115bkSf1].

Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) lowers homocysteine by driving its conversion to cysteine via CBS [^114P474V] [^1121mWee], but **clinical trials show no consistent reduction in cardiovascular events** when B6 is used alone or with other B vitamins [^111giLr2] [^113U2eT6]. The **HOPE-2 trial** found a modest stroke reduction with combined B vitamins, but no benefit for MI or death, and B6-specific effects are unclear [^112Ws4bs] [^116HRDsr]. Routine B6 supplementation is **not recommended** for CVD prevention; reserve it for confirmed B6 deficiency or specific metabolic disorders [^115bkSf1] [^114KtM99].

---

## Biochemical role of pyridoxine in homocysteine metabolism

Pyridoxine is a **cofactor for CBS**, which converts homocysteine to cysteine, thereby reducing homocysteine levels [^114P474V]. Deficiency impairs this pathway and raises homocysteine, a recognized cardiovascular risk marker [^111wnTfU].

---

## Clinical evidence on pyridoxine supplementation and homocysteine levels

Clinical trials show that **B6-containing regimens lower homocysteine** by about 20–30% [^115Go8Hp], with the effect largely attributable to folate and B12; B6 alone has minimal impact on fasting homocysteine [^115Go8Hp].

---

## Clinical evidence on pyridoxine supplementation and cardiovascular outcomes

- **HOPE-2**: Combined folate/B6/B12 reduced stroke modestly (RR 0.75) but not MI or death; B6-specific effects were not isolated [^112Ws4bs] [^116HRDsr].
- **VISP**: High-dose B vitamins (including B6) did not reduce recurrent stroke or vascular events [^1179GHNq].
- **SEARCH**: Folate/B12 (with/without B6) lowered homocysteine but did not reduce major vascular events [^115TkmpY].
- **Meta-analyses**: Consistently show no reduction in MI, death, or overall CVD events with B6-containing regimens [^111giLr2] [^113U2eT6].

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

High-dose B6 (> 100 mg/day) can cause **neurotoxicity** (sensory neuropathy) [^notfound]; routine high-dose use is not advised without a clear indication.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines **do not recommend routine B6 supplementation** for CVD prevention; use is limited to confirmed deficiency or specific metabolic disorders [^115bkSf1] [^1121mWee].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Outcome** | **Effect of pyridoxine supplementation** |
|-|-|
| Homocysteine levels | Modest reduction (20–30%) when combined with folate and B12; minimal effect alone |
| Cardiovascular events | No consistent reduction in MI, stroke, or death |
| Safety | High doses (> 100 mg/day) can cause neurotoxicity |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Routine use**: Not recommended for CVD prevention.
- **Deficiency**: Treat confirmed B6 deficiency.
- **Metabolic disorders**: Use for specific disorders (e.g. CBS deficiency) [^1121mWee].
- **Dosing**: Avoid high-dose B6 without indication due to neurotoxicity risk [^114Cezst].

---

Pyridoxine lowers homocysteine via CBS, but **does not consistently improve cardiovascular outcomes** in trials; therefore, it is not recommended for routine CVD prevention, and use should be limited to deficiency or specific metabolic indications.

Assessment of Heterogeneity, Publication Bias, and Sensitivity Analysis

There was no evidence of between‐study heterogeneity in any of the analyses (Figures 2, 3, 4). Visual examination of Begg funnel plots for all analyses were moderately symmetrical, providing little evidence of publication bias. This was further supported by the results of the Egger test, which were nonsignificant in all analyses (all P > 0.05) (Figure 5). We did not observe any difference of intervention effects between trials with different risks of bias (Tables 3 and 4).

Methodological Quality Summary of Authors' Judgments About Each Methodological Item

In the sensitivity analysis, we did a metaregression analysis of the continuous variables that might potentially affect the treatment effects. We found no statistically significant dose‐response relationships between CVD outcomes and dosage of folic acid, baseline homocysteine levels, baseline mean age, and percentage of men in the trial, average follow‐up time, and number of events in the study, suggesting that none of these factors had a significant impact on the overall meta‐analysis (data not shown). We observed an inverse relation between degree of homocysteine reduction and intervention effect on CVD (Figure 6) with a significant dose‐response association (P = 0.037 for metaregression after adjustment of baseline mean age and percentage of men in the trial). We did not, however, observe significant dose‐response associations between degree of homocysteine reduction and risk of stroke or CHD. The exclusion of any single study from the analyses did not appreciably change the summary RRs and between‐study heterogeneity (Table 5).

### Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor of atherosclerosis in patients with metabolic syndrome [^115fGDro]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

As already described in the general population, we confirmed in patients with MetS the negative relationship between homocysteinemia and folic acid. Considering the key role of folates in the metabolism of methionine and our observation of a significant reduction of folate concentrations in MetS patients with high Hcy, we suggest that any folic acid deficiency occurring in these patients be promptly corrected. Such a therapy would, in fact, improve this methionine metabolic disorder thought to contribute to the CV complications of the MetS, without any significant side effect. Vitamins B supplementation is undoubtedly effective in lowering serum Hcy levels, but data on its effects on CVR reduction are not conclusive. Evidence has been provided that Hcy-lowering vitamin B treatments failed to improve CV outcomes and to reduce death from any cause or stroke recurrence in patients with or without previous ischemic stroke or known CV disease, and this would not seem to recommend the systematic use of such therapeutic regimens in patients with a CV disease history. Conversely, it has also been reported that supplementation with folic acid, alone or in combination with vitamin B6 and B12, is effective in reducing stroke risk in patients with known CV disease and, above all, can significantly decrease the risk for first stroke in hypertensive adults without a CV disease history. This particular capacity of Hcy-lowering therapy to provide an effective primary prevention against CV events strengthens our proposal to systematically treat folic acid deficiency in MetS patients. Further support of this approach is provided by the outcomes of a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of several randomized controlled trials addressing the effects of metformin, a first-line insulin-sensitizing drug, on Hcy serum levels. Authors concluded that, although metformin does not directly affect Hcy levels, it would induce an increase in the amino acid concentration when patients are not appropriately supplemented with group B vitamins and/or folates. This effect is considered evidently detrimental by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, whose guidelines do, in fact, suggest that vitamin B12/folates be added in patients under treatment with metformin.

Comparison of RCTs With Observational and Genetic Studies

Compared with the results from prospective observations, 2, 3, 65 the magnitude of the intervention effect on stroke was much lower (only around half), and we did not find any significant effect on CHD. Many factors may contribute to this discrepancy in the results of observational studies and RCTs of folic acid supplementation.

All participants in the RCTs had some preexisting diseases, including CVD, renal disease, atherosclerosis, or hypertension, and they were usually older, whereas participants in epidemiological studies were typically younger and healthier. In our subgroup analysis, the intervention effect of folic acid supplementation on both stroke and CVD was stronger among participants with neither CVD nor renal diseases; the magnitude of 20% reduced risk among this relatively healthy population was comparable to the findings from observational studies. Another explanation was that homocysteine reduction may be beneficial only at early stages of vascular disease manifestation and less effective in established CVD. Hodis and colleagues 48 observed that B vitamin supplementation significantly reduced the progression of early‐stage subclinical atherosclerosis and carotid artery intima–media thickness but had no effect on the progression of markers of late‐stage atherosclerosis. Patients with CVD tend to have more serious complications, and thus lifestyle modifications or medications, which may have stronger effects on CVD than homocysteine reduction, might have masked the effect of homocysteine reduction on risk of CVD. The HOPE2 trial observed that participants who did not receive lipid‐lowering drugs had a larger treatment benefit, 66 whereas the VITATOPS trial found beneficial effects of B vitamins among patients without antiplatelet treatment. 15

The homocysteine hypothesis

The hypothesis that B vitamin therapy (folic acid, vitamin B 6 and vitamin B 12) may prevent stroke emerged more than 15 years ago after early case and epidemiological studies reported an association between high plasma concentrations of total homocysteine (tHcy) and incident cardiovascular diseases, laboratory studies reported atherogenic and thrombogenic properties of high tHcy, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showed that supplementation with B vitamins lowers tHcy.

### Homocysteine, B vitamins, and cardiovascular disease: a mendelian randomization study [^113Ajxd7]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The B vitamins, including folate and vitamins B6 and B12, play vital roles in the metabolism of homocysteine (Fig. 1). Deficiency of either of these B vitamins can lead to an elevated circulating level of total homocysteine (tHcy), which has been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The association has been supported by several possible underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, such as impaired endothelial function, increased oxidative stress, induced vascular inflammation, stimulated vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, and activated coagulation factors by homocysteinemia. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have generally not detected a protective effect of homocysteine-lowering therapy with B vitamins on total CVD or coronary artery disease. Findings of corresponding RCTs on stroke are inconclusive. Potential explanations for the inconsistent results may be related to small sample sizes, low adherence to the treatment, and different study populations and CVD outcomes.

Fig. 1
Overview of folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 in homocysteine metabolism. Homocysteine is reconverted to methionine by receiving a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the active form of folate, or betaine in the remethylation pathway. Irreversible removal of homocysteine occurs through the transsulphuration pathway where homocysteine condenses with serine to form cystathionine

Using genetic variants as instrumental variables for an exposure (e.g. tHcy), the Mendelian randomization (MR) design can strengthen the causal inference by minimizing residual confounding and reverse causation. Previous MR studies showed that tHcy levels proxied by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MTHFR gene region were associated with stroke and imaging burden of cerebral small vessel disease, but not with coronary artery disease. Studies utilizing more SNPs suggested a positive association of genetically predicted tHcy levels with risk of ischemic stroke, especially small vessel stroke, but no association with coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation. Data are scarce for other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).

Here, we conducted an MR study to assess the associations of genetically predicted tHcy levels with a wide range of CVDs. We also examined the associations of genetically predicted levels of folate and vitamins B6 and B12 with CVDs.

### Effects of B vitamins and omega 3 fatty acids on cardiovascular diseases: a randomised placebo controlled trial [^116P9YAF]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Randomisation and blinding

Included participants were randomly assigned to receive B vitamins alone, omega 3 fatty acids alone, both active treatments, or placebo for both treatments. Study treatment was given as two capsules to be taken once daily. Randomisation was performed by means of a computerised block sequence stratified by three age groups (44–54, 55–64, and 65–80 years), sex, prior disease at enrolment (myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, or ischaemic stroke) and recruitment centre. Permuted block randomisation (with block size randomly selected as 8) was used. Patients, clinicians, trial coordinators, and outcome investigators were blinded to treatment allocation. The allocation of participants was programmed by the statistical coordinating centre. Once participants were randomised, the coordinating centre sent them sufficient treatment capsules for one year (and repeated yearly) in an appropriately labelled package.

Assessment

Every six months after enrolment, we mailed questionnaires to all the participants, asking about any serious disease outcomes, treatment compliance, presence of cardiovascular risk factors, and adverse effects. A non-mandatory visit was scheduled annually in one of the 257 centres, and participants who were unable or unwilling to attend and who did not return the questionnaire were interviewed by telephone by study physicians. The general practitioners, cardiolologists, or neurologists treating the participants were asked to report any relevant information on health events that might have occurred every six months. Once a possible event was suspected, we sought all relevant medical records, including results of diagnostic tests and procedures, from the treating physician or general practitioner or directly from the participant.

Compliance with treatment was self reported in the biannual questionnaires (or by telephone interview). Compliance was defined as taking at least 80% of the allocated treatment. Blood samples were obtained from all participants at baseline, and from a sample of participants attending their health centre visit at 12 months (n = 2147) and at the end of the trial (n = 1160) for assessment of plasma concentrations of total homocysteine and pyridoxal phosphate and serum concentrations of folate and vitamin B-12. Fatty acid composition of plasma lipids was also determined by gas chromatography in a random sample (n = 682) at baseline and at 12 months. In addition, all participants had plasma concentrations of cholesterol (total, low density lipoprotein, and high density lipoprotein) and triglycerides and fasting blood glucose concentrations measured at enrolment. Participants were censored on the date of their first major event, death, or, for those without an event, at the end of follow-up on 1 July 2009.

### Homocysteine-lowering therapy and stroke risk, severity, and disability: additional findings from the HOPE 2 trial [^116HRDsr]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Elevated total homocysteine is associated with a higher risk of cerebrovascular disease. It is not known whether lowering homocysteine impacts on stroke risk, both in terms of severity and ischemic vs hemorrhagic stroke subtypes. Our aim was to determine whether vitamin therapy reduces the risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, as well as stroke-related disability.

Methods

We analyzed stroke outcomes among participants of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation 2 (HOPE 2) trial that randomized 5522 adults with known cardiovascular disease to a daily combination of 2.5 mg of folic acid, 50 mg of vitamin B6, and 1 mg of vitamin B12, or matching placebo, for 5 years.

Results

Among 5522 participants, stroke occurred in 258 (4.7%) individuals during a mean of 5 years of follow-up. The geometric mean homocysteine concentration decreased by 2.2 micromol/L in the vitamin therapy group and increased by 0.80 micromol/L in the placebo group. The incidence rate of stroke was 0.88 per 100 person-years in the vitamin therapy group and 1.15 per 100 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59–0.97). Vitamin therapy also reduced the risk of nonfatal stroke (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54–0.95) but did not impact on neurological deficit at 24 hours (P = 0.45) or functional dependence at discharge or at 7 days (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.57–1.56). In subgroup analysis, patients aged younger than 69 years, from regions without folic acid food fortification, with higher baseline cholesterol and homocysteine levels, and those not receiving antiplatelet or lipid-lowering drugs at enrollment had a larger treatment benefit.

Conclusions

Lowering of homocysteine with folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 did reduce the risk of overall stroke, but not stroke severity or disability.

### Homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid, cobalamin, and pyridoxine does not reduce blood markers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, or hypercoagulability in patients with previous transient ischemic attack or stroke: a randomized substudy of the VITATOPS trial [^111KkzGh]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Epidemiological and laboratory studies suggest that increasing concentrations of plasma homocysteine (total homocysteine [tHcy]) accelerate cardiovascular disease by promoting vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulability.

Methods

We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 285 patients with recent transient ischemic attack or stroke to examine the effect of lowering tHcy with folic acid 2 mg, vitamin B12 0.5 mg, and vitamin B6 25 mg compared with placebo on laboratory markers of vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulability.

Results

At 6 months after randomization, there was no significant difference in blood concentrations of markers of vascular inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [P = 0.32]; soluble CD40L [P = 0.33]; IL-6 [P = 0.77]), endothelial dysfunction (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [P = 0.27]; intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [P = 0.08]; von Willebrand factor [P = 0.92]), and hypercoagulability (P-selectin [P = 0.33]; prothrombin fragment 1 and 2 [P = 0.81]; D-dimer [P = 0.88]) among patients assigned vitamin therapy compared with placebo despite a 3.7-micromol/L (95% CI, 2.7 to 4.7) reduction in total homocysteine (tHcy).

Conclusions

Lowering tHcy by 3.7 micromol/L with folic acid-based multivitamin therapy does not significantly reduce blood concentrations of the biomarkers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, or hypercoagulability measured in our study. The possible explanations for our findings are: (1) these biomarkers are not sensitive to the effects of lowering tHcy (eg, multiple risk factor interventions may be required); (2) elevated tHcy causes cardiovascular disease by mechanisms other than the biomarkers measured; or (3) elevated tHcy is a noncausal marker of increased vascular risk.

### Antiplatelet therapy and the effects of B vitamins in patients with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack: a post-hoc subanalysis of VITATOPS, a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^111pGQJf]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Observational studies show a strong, positive, and dose-related association between serum concentrations of homocysteine and the risk of stroke, which is independent of other vascular risk factors and biologically plausible. Homocysteine can be lowered by a mean of 25% (95% CI 23–28) with folic acid supplementation. A meta-analysis of eight randomised, placebo-controlled trials of folic acid supplementation in 37 485 patientsshowed that, despite yielding an average 25% reduction in homocysteine, folic acid had no significant effect on the rate of first stroke (rate ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.87–1.06) over a median follow-up of 5 years. However, the role of homocysteine-lowering in stroke prevention might be complex. A meta-analysis of 237 genetic epidemiological studies, in which homocysteine and the presence of the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism in 60 000 individuals were correlated with 20 885 subsequent stroke events, suggested that established or increasing dietary folate intake in the countries where the trials were undertaken might have modified the effect of lowering homocysteine on risk of stroke.

Antiplatelet therapy might also modify the effect of lowering homocysteine on the risk of stroke and ischaemic heart disease events. An exploratory analysis of trials of lowering homocysteinesuggested an interaction between antiplatelet therapy and the effect of lowering homocysteine on risk of ischaemic heart disease events: in the five trials with the lowest prevalence of antiplatelet therapy (mean 60%, usually aspirin), the relative risk was 0.93 (95% CI 0.84–1.05) and in the five trials with the highest prevalence (mean 91%) the relative risk was 1.09 (1.00–1.19), p for interaction = 0.037. In another analysis of trials of the effects of lowering homocysteine on the risk of stroke events, the effect was greater in the four trials that enrolled patients with renal disease and oesophageal dysplasia (who were not likely to be taking antiplatelet therapy) compared with the trials that enrolled patients with previous vascular disease. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation 2 (HOPE 2) trialsubsequently reported a non-significant trend towards a greater effect of folic acid-based vitamin B supplementation, compared with placebo, in reducing stroke in patients with known cardiovascular disease who were not taking antiplatelet therapy at enrolment compared with patients who were (p for interaction = 0.25). The biological plausibility of these findings is supported by the recognised potential for antiplatelet therapy to modify any antithrombotic or other antiatherogenic effects of lowering homocysteine.

### Homocysteine levels and reduction of stroke risk… [^113FrUUU]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

High levels of homocysteine have been associated with atherosclerosis and cerebrovascular disease. One meta-analysis indicated that even moderately elevated levels of homocysteine are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Folic acid, pyridoxine, and cobalamin are known to reduce homocysteine levels. Toole and associates, on behalf of the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention trial, investigated whether adding a multivitamin containing folic acid, pyridoxine, and cobalamin to optimal medical and surgical management of patients with nondisabling cerebral infarction and elevated homocysteine levels could reduce the incidence of recurrent cerebral infarction, as well as coronary heart disease and death. Patients with a presumptive diagnosis of stroke with elevated homocysteine levels were included in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Of the 3, 680 eligible adults, 1, 827 were randomized to a high-dose vitamin group, while 1, 853 patients were randomized to a low-dose vitamin group. Primary end points included recurrent stroke, increased score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and death. Other end points were myocardial infarction requiring hospitalization, coronary revascularization, cardiac resuscitation, and fatal CHD. Among patients in the low-dose vitamin group, 8. 1 percent had a recurrent ischemic stroke compared with
8. 4 percent of patients in the high-dose group. The risk ratio for ischemic stroke between the two groups was 1. 0 at two years. A risk ratio of 0. 9 was found between the groups for CHD events and death at two years. Although no treatment effect was found between the groups, a graded association occurred between baseline homocysteine levels and subsequent homocysteine levels.

In the low-dose group, a 3 μmol per L lower total homocysteine level was associated with a 10 percent lower risk of stroke, a 26 percent lower risk of CHD events, and a 16 percent lower risk of death. Decreases in risk in the high-dose group were 2 percent for stroke, 7 percent for CHD events, and 7 percent for death, but these figures were not significant.

### Elevated plasma homocysteine as risk factor for peripheral arterial disease – what is the evidence? [^114ZJyiM]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

There is abundant evidence that elevated plasma homocysteine (HC) is independently associated with presence of atherosclerotic disease. There is credible evidence from a number of prospective studies that elevated HC is independently associated with progression of atherosclerotic disease. All studies to date agree that vitamin therapy, primarily folate, results in reliable decreases in HC, without recognized toxicity or side effects. Two small, randomized clinical trials have demonstrated clinically relevant benefit from folate treatment, which reduced HC in patients, compared to placebo. The results of multiple large scale clinical trials will be available within 2 to 5 years, and these have sufficient power to determine whether vitamin therapy intended to lower plasma HC will be established as the first effective therapy for atherosclerosis that does not involve expensive medication with toxic side effects and/or difficult changes in habits or lifestyle.

### Effect of homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid and B vitamins on risk of type 2 diabetes in women: a randomized, controlled trial [^115Au3zA]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Homocysteinemia may play an etiologic role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes by promoting oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. We investigated whether homocysteine-lowering treatment by B vitamin supplementation prevents the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

The Women's Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study (WAFACS), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 5,442 female health professionals aged ≥ 40 years with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or three or more CVD risk factors, included 4,252 women free of diabetes at baseline. Participants were randomly assigned to either an active treatment group (daily intake of a combination pill of 2.5 mg folic acid, 50 mg vitamin B6, and 1 mg vitamin B12) or to the placebo group.

Results

During a median follow-up of 7.3 years, 504 women had an incident diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Overall, there was no significant difference between the active treatment group and the placebo group in diabetes risk (relative risk 0.94 [95% CI 0.79–1.11]; P = 0.46), despite significant lowering of homocysteine levels. Also, there was no evidence for effect modifications by baseline intakes of dietary folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12. In a sensitivity analysis, the null result remained for women compliant with their study pills (0.92 [0.76–1.10]; P = 0.36).

Conclusions

Lowering homocysteine levels by daily supplementation with folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 did not reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes among women at high risk for CVD.

### The homocysteine controversy [^116Pd4fk]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions and implications

Recently, the outcome of Mendelian randomization studies and large intervention trials of homocysteine lowering have cast doubt on the role of B vitamins and homocysteine in CVD. In our view, what the intervention trials have indeed convincingly shown is that routine administration of high-dose multi-B vitamins to patients with (a high risk of) CVD has no net benefit and can thus not be recommended. However, abandoning the field of research into the associations between B vitamins, homocysteine, and CVD would be unwise. As outlined, the Mendelian randomization experiments have limitations that preclude final conclusions. In addition, some characteristics of the intervention trials limit the interpretation of their results. Finally, the possibility that homocysteine lowering is beneficial but is offset by adverse side effects of B-vitamin supplementation on atherosclerosis deserves serious attention. As explained, these side effects may relate to direct adverse effects of the B-vitamin regimen (in particular, the use of high-dose folic acid), or to proinflammatory and proproliferative effects of B vitamins on advanced atherosclerotic lesions.

There are several implications to what we have discussed. First, we need to increase our understanding of how homocysteine damages the vascular system and what ways of preventing such damage, other than high-dose B vitamins, are possible. Second, we must study the potential adverse effects of the various forms of (high-dose) B vitamins in cell and animal experiments. Third, we should use epidemiological data to explore the hypothesis that a high B-vitamin status may indeed prevent the initial development of atherosclerosis, particularly in young people. Intervention trials in such people will be very hard to perform logistically, especially with hard clinical endpoints. Finally, we must continue to perform intervention trials addressing questions that have remained unanswered in the trials performed so far. In particular, these remaining questions relate to the type of intervention (e.g. natural folate versus folic acid), the duration of follow-up (e.g. long-term studies or, at least, extended follow-up of the existing studies), and the target population (e.g. separate studies in patients with more severe degree of hyperhomocysteinemia). Abandoning the homocysteine hypothesis now might well turn out to be a historical mistake.

### Homocysteine, B vitamins, and cardiovascular disease: a mendelian randomization study [^117ANJXn]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This MR study investigated the potential causal role of circulating tHcy and B vitamins in a broad range of CVDs and revealed suggestive associations of higher genetically predicted tHcy levels with increased risk of any stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke. Furthermore, higher genetically predicted levels of folate and vitamin B6 were suggestively associated with a reduced risk of any stroke and ischemic stroke, respectively. Higher genetically predicted folate levels were additionally associated with a suggestive lower risk of coronary artery disease, whereas genetically predicted vitamin B6 levels showed a suggestive positive association with risk of peripheral artery disease. There was no evidence in support of any association between genetically predicted vitamin B12 levels and the 12 studied CVDs.

The detrimental role of tHcy in stroke, especially in ischemic stroke and small vessel disease, has been established in a large body of observational studies, MR studies and RCTs. The present study confirmed such potential benefit of homocysteine-lowing therapy with B vitamins in the primary prevention of stroke. Nevertheless, this study did not support an association between genetically predicted vitamin B12 and stroke, which is in line with results of subgroup analyses for vitamin B12 supplementation and baseline blood vitamin B12 levels in relation to risk of stroke in a meta-analysis of 14 RCTs. A possible explanation may be that vitamin B12 generates little impact on tHcy levels. In a meta-analysis of 12 RCTs, daily folic acid (synthetic form of folate) supplementation reduced blood homocysteine levels by 25% and vitamin B12 supplementation produced an additional 7% reduction in blood homocysteine.

From a mechanistic perspective, homocysteinemia may increase the risk of ischemic stroke via several pathways. Excessive homocysteine can directly impair neuronal cells and blood-brain barrier function by promoting oxidative stress, protein homocysteinylation, and Ca 2+ dysregulation. In addition, homocysteine can induce deoxyribonucleic acid hypomethylation and worsen apoptosis, neuronal death, and blood-brain barrier dysregulation. Such actions can promote damage to brain parenchyma and susceptibility to damage from ischemic stroke. Furthermore, the intact vascular endothelium is integral for preventing cardiovascular sequelae such as ischemic stroke, and high levels of homocysteine can also promote endothelial dysfunction in multiple ways. This includes increased oxidant stress, decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide, increased endothelial inflammation with expression of vascular adhesion molecules and leukocyte recruitment, increased platelet activation, and promotion of thrombosis. Together these consequences of the dysfunctional endothelium promote all stages of ischemic stroke from early atherosclerosis development through to thrombosis and this is likely to be an important mechanism contributing to the excess ischemic stroke risk which is established in patients with high levels of homocysteine.

### Hyperhomocysteinemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus: cardiovascular risk factors and effect of treatment with folic acid and pyridoxine [^116YAMFk]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether hyperhomocysteinemia (HH) exacerbates other cardiovascular risk factors and markers of coagulation and hemostasis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and whether treatment of HH with vitamins will alter these risk factors.

Methods

We measured several cardiovascular risk factors and markers of coagulation and hemostasis in patients with type 2 DM with and without HH. We also treated patients with type 2 DM and coexistent HH with high doses of folic acid and pyridoxine to determine whether this treatment would lower plasma total homocysteine concentrations as well as correct other associated cardiovascular risk factors in this population.

Results

Plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and fibrinogen were significantly higher in all patients with DM in comparison with control subjects (P < 0.01), whether they had HH or not. No significant difference was noted between the two groups of patients with DM. The presence of hypertension and microalbuminuria did not lead to a higher plasma total homocysteine. After treatment with folic acid, 15 mg daily, and pyridoxine, 600 mg daily, fasting (basal) plasma total homocysteine declined significantly in patients with DM from 12.3 ± 2.9 micromol/L to 9.1 ± 1.1 micromol/L (P < 0.01). The peak post-methionine load plasma total homocysteine in the patients with DM decreased from 39.9 ± 11.4 micromol/L to 30.4 ± 6.5 micromol/L (P < 0.05). Neither fasting nor peak plasma total homocysteine changed in normal subjects. None of the cardiovascular risk factors measured changed significantly with the vitamin treatment.

Conclusion

The coexistence of type 2 DM and HH does not lead to an exacerbation of abnormalities in the measured variables of coagulation and hemostasis. Treatment with high doses of folic acid and pyridoxine lowers the plasma total homocysteine significantly but does not improve any of the associated cardiovascular risk factors that we measured. Long-term clinical trials should be conducted to determine whether high-dose vitamin treatment will diminish the increased morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 DM.

### Combined analyses and extended follow-up of two randomized controlled homocysteine-lowering B-vitamin trials [^116n4Nuz]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

In the Norwegian Vitamin Trial and the Western Norway B Vitamin Intervention Trial, patients were randomly assigned to homocysteine-lowering B-vitamins or no such treatment. We investigated their effects on cardiovascular outcomes in the trial populations combined, during the trials and during an extended follow-up, and performed exploratory analyses to determine the usefulness of homocysteine as a predictor of cardiovascular outcomes.

Design

Pooling of data from two randomized controlled trials (1998–2005) with extended post-trial observational follow-up until 1 January 2008.

Setting

Thirty-six hospitals in Norway.

Subjects

6837 patients with ischaemic heart disease.

Interventions

One capsule per day containing folic acid (0.8 mg) plus vitamin B12 (0.4 mg) and vitamin B6 (40 mg), or folic acid plus vitamin B12, or vitamin B6 alone or placebo.

Main Outcome Measures

Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs; cardiovascular death, acute myocardial infarction or stroke) during the trials and cardiovascular mortality during the extended follow-up.

Results

Folic acid plus vitamin B12 treatment lowered homocysteine levels by 25% but did not influence MACE incidence (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.95–1.21) during 39 months of follow-up, or cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.95–1.31) during 78 months of follow-up, when compared to no such treatment. Baseline homocysteine level was not independently associated with study outcomes. However, homocysteine concentration measured after 1–2 months of folic acid plus vitamin B12 treatment was a strong predictor of MACEs.

Conclusion

We found no short- or long-term benefit of folic acid plus vitamin B12 on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ischaemic heart disease. Our data suggest that cardiovascular risk prediction by plasma total homocysteine concentration may be confined to the homocysteine fraction that does not respond to B-vitamins.

### Homocysteine, B vitamins, and cardiovascular disease: a mendelian randomization study [^116bzASv]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This MR study provides limited evidence in support of a general benefit of lowering tHcy levels in the prevention of a broad range of CVDs in the general population. Nevertheless, our findings confirm and extend the evidence that B vitamin therapy lowering tHcy may play a role in the prevention of stroke, especially ischemic stroke and possibly subarachnoid hemorrhage.

### Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1174pcKw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Results from observational and genetic epidemiological studies suggest that lower serum homocysteine levels are associated with lower incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Numerous randomized controlled trials have investigated the efficacy of lowering homocysteine with folic acid supplementation for CVD risk, but conflicting results have been reported.

Methods and Results

Three bibliographic databases (Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) were searched from database inception until December 1, 2015. Of the 1933 references reviewed for eligibility, 30 randomized controlled trials involving 82 334 participants were included in the final analysis. The pooled relative risks of folic acid supplementation compared with controls were 0.90 (95% CI 0.84–0.96; P = 0.002) for stroke, 1.04 (95% CI 0.99–1.09; P = 0.16) for coronary heart disease, and 0.96 (95% CI 0.92–0.99; P = 0.02) for overall CVD. The intervention effects for both stroke and combined CVD were more pronounced among participants with lower plasma folate levels at baseline (both P < 0.02 for interaction). In stratified analyses, a greater beneficial effect for overall CVD was seen in trials among participants without preexisting CVD (P = 0.006 for interaction) or in trials with larger reduction in homocysteine levels (P = 0.009 for interaction).

Conclusions

Our meta‐analysis indicated a 10% lower risk of stroke and a 4% lower risk of overall CVD with folic acid supplementation. A greater benefit for CVD was observed among participants with lower plasma folate levels and without preexisting CVD and in studies with larger decreases in homocysteine levels. Folic acid supplementation had no significant effect on risk of coronary heart disease.

### The homocysteine controversy [^112WoFaK]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Mild hyperhomocysteinemia has been firmly established as an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). A meta-analysis of studies published before 2002 concluded that a 3-μmol/l increase in fasting plasma homocysteine is associated with an 11% increase in the incidence of ischemic heart disease and a 19% increase in the incidence of stroke (Homocysteine Studies Collaboration; Hansson). More recent studies confirmed that homocysteine is a strong, independent CVD predictor (de Ruijter et al.). The resulting homocysteine hypothesis states that mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is a causal contributor (i.e. a risk factor) to the occurrence of CVD.

Not all disease predictors are risk factors in the strict definition. A variable may predict disease without being causally related to the disease. The common term for such a predictor is biomarker (alternatively, the term risk marker or risk indicator is used). A biomarker commonly represents an early stage of the disease. Interventions aimed at optimizing a biomarker may or may not be associated with reduced disease incidence depending on whether the treatment has an effect on a causal mechanism that underlies both the appearance of the biomarker as well as the occurrence of disease. Treatment that reduces the biomarker without affecting disease incidence is useless. Recent outcomes of large intervention trials have raised suspicion that mild hyperhomocysteinemia is not a causal risk factor but is, in fact, a predictor of CVD by virtue of a role as biomarker, treatment of which does not reduce clinical disease. A detailed analysis of the intervention studies is presented elsewhere in this issue. In essence, the collective evidence shows that treating mild hyperhomocysteinemia (mean baseline homocysteine usually between 10 and 14 μmol/l) with B vitamins (folic acid, vitamin B 12, and vitamin B 6, usually in combination) for a mean period ranging from 2 to 7 years does not reduce the incidence of clinical CVD endpoints.

### Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111QoC5h]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Data Extraction, Synthesis, and Methodological Quality Assessment

According to the standard protocol, all data from eligible trials were independently extracted in duplicate by 2 investigators (Y.L. and T.H.) and reviewed by a third investigator (Y.Z.). A predesigned data extraction form was used to extract relevant information. This included information on study design, baseline characteristics of participants, supplementation strategies, intervention effects on homocysteine and outcomes, mean age of participants at baseline (median if mean value not available), sex proportion, plasma folate and homocysteine levels at baseline, net changes and percentage changes of homocysteine before and after folic acid supplementation, the dosage of folic acid supplementation, intervention with and without other B vitamins, types of controls (placebo, usual care, untreated, or low dose of B vitamins), study location (countries) and mandatory folic acid fortification in the study location, preexisting disease status at baseline, the names of RCTs if available, and any systematically recorded outcomes that occurred during the scheduled treatment period (eg, events in intervention and control groups and reported hazard ratios).

The risk of biases for each RCT (selection, performance, detection, attrition, reporting, and other biases) was assessed using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias assessment tool 29; 7 criteria were evaluated. The risk of bias was rated as low, high, or unclear for each criterion.

For each selected trial, net change in mean homocysteine was calculated as the change in mean homocysteine level from baseline to postintervention in the intervention group minus that change in the control group. Percentage change was defined as the net change divided by the mean baseline homocysteine level averaged across groups. If information on homocysteine was available only for the treatment group, 13, 30 net change was calculated as preintervention concentrations minus postintervention concentrations in the treatment group. For RCTs of factorial design, 13, 14, 31 participants receiving folic acid supplementation were compared with the placebo group if data on all factors were available in the publications 13, 31; otherwise, all trial participants receiving folic acid supplementation were compared with all participants not receiving it regardless of other factorial interventions. 14 For trials with multiple publications 32, 33 at different follow‐up periods, results for clinical outcomes with the longest follow‐up from the primary publication were extracted. 33

### Coronary microvascular endothelial dysfunction in patients with angina and nonobstructive coronary artery disease is associated with elevated serum homocysteine levels [^111SSdNb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, its retrospective and cross‐sectional design makes it challenging to derive causal associations, and the results should be considered as hypothesis generating. However, to our knowledge, this cohort is the largest database of patients undergoing an invasive assessment of endothelial function. Furthermore, some variables were not taken into account during clinical assessment. First, folate‐fortified food intake may directly affect folate levels in the blood, so B‐vitamin use is not the only factor that affects folate levels and therefore homocysteine levels. 68 We do not have the dose and frequency of B‐vitamin supplementation in our population. In one randomized controlled trial in a Chinese population, only medium (400 μg/day) or high‐dose (4000 μg/day) supplementation decreased homocysteine levels in patients in the quartile with the highest baseline homocysteine levels (> 12 μmol/L). 69

### Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116KepJd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our findings, based on the most comprehensive and up‐to‐date evidence, provide support for a modest benefit of folic acid supplementation for the prevention of stroke. There was a 10% reduced risk of stroke and a 4% reduced risk of overall CVD with folic acid supplementation. A greater benefit for CVD was observed among participants without preexisting CVD or with lower plasma folate levels at baseline and in studies with a larger decrease in homocysteine levels. We did not observe any significant benefit or harm with folic acid supplementation for the risk of CHD.

### Is folate a promising agent in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease in patients with renal failure? [^113Wn2GT]. Kidney International (2002). Low credibility.

Management of the conventional cardiovascular risk factors is insufficient to prevent the dramatic increase in atherosclerotic cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with renal failure. Folate recently received attention as a potential alternative treatment option to decrease the excess cardiovascular risk in the uremic population. Folate administration is the principal treatment modality for hyperhomocysteinemia. Hyperhomocysteinemia is prevalent in more than 85% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is independently associated with increased odds for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Several attempts have been made to normalize homocysteine levels in uremic patients with folate-based vitamin regimens. Although supraphysiologic doses of folic acid afford greater reductions in homocysteine levels than standard doses, the response to treatment is generally only partial and the large majority of ESRD patients have residual hyperhomocysteinemia. Several defects in folate metabolism have been described in uremia, which may explain the relative folate resistance in patients with renal failure, but their clinical relevance remains uncertain. It appears unlikely that the hyperhomocysteinemia in ESRD can be cured solely with folic acid supplements, since folate does not affect the prolonged plasma elimination of homocysteine, which is the primary defect in homocysteine metabolism in uremia. Folate restores endothelial dysfunction, associated with hyperlipidemia, diabetes and hyperhomocysteinemia. The beneficial effect appears to be independent of its homocysteine-lowering capacity and is possibly related to an improved bioavailability of nitric oxide. However, folate has failed to improve endothelial dysfunction in uremic patients. In the ESRD population, multiple metabolic and hemodynamic abnormalities adversely affect endothelial function. In addition, irreversible structural vascular disease already may be present. Folate should, therefore, probably be an integral part of an "endothelial protective regimen", consisting of lipid-lowering agents, antihypertensives and antioxidant vitamins and started very early in patients with renal failure. Before large-scale folate administration can be recommended, effects on hard endpoints of cardiovascular disease need to be demonstrated in randomized trials. Such trials are currently underway in patients with normal renal function at high risk for cardiovascular disease, and one trial has recently been initiated in stable renal transplant recipients.

### Effect of homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid and B vitamins on risk of type 2 diabetes in women: a randomized, controlled trial [^111rzMW1]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 7.3 years of treatment among 4,252 women at high risk for CVD, we found no significant effect of homocysteine-lowering treatment by a combination pill of folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 on risk of type 2 diabetes. There remained no evidence for a treatment effect in a sensitivity analysis restricted to women compliant with their study pills over the follow-up period. Our study provides the first randomized trial data regarding the long-term effect of folic acid/B vitamin supplementation on the risk of type 2 diabetes, although our findings remain to be corroborated by future research.

It has been hypothesized that B vitamins may help reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by ameliorating metabolic abnormalities, such as oxidative damage, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, which characterize all phases of insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell function and are implicated in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes. Due to their relative safety and low cost, B vitamin supplements have been targeted as potential therapeutic agents in previous randomized controlled trials for prevention of vascular diseases in high-risk populations. In contrast, direct evidence from randomized trials of B vitamin supplementation for type 2 diabetes has been very limited. Some but not all secondary prevention trials have suggested that folic acid supplementation may be effective in the improvement of oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes. To our knowledge, no large clinical trials have specifically examined homocysteine-lowering interventions on the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we provide evidence that folic acid and B vitamins have a neutral effect on the risk of type 2 diabetes among nondiabetic women; this is consistent with the absence of benefit from this intervention in lowering risk of cardiovascular events. Given the efficacy of the intervention in reducing homocysteine levels, our trial casts doubt on the etiologic role of hyperhomocysteinemia in the development of type 2 diabetes.

### Epigenetic associations in relation to cardiovascular prevention and therapeutics [^113zdjC3]. Clinical Epigenetics (2016). Low credibility.

Yang et al. tried to avoid limitations of meta-analyses, like search comprehension and selection, the accuracy of study methodologies, and publication bias, by maximizing study identification and minimizing biases through an a priori development of the study protocol, a profound survey of several databases, and the definition and execution of explicit criteria for the selection of applicable studies, data collection, and data analysis. As a positive result, the results of the included trials did not exhibit any substantial heterogenities.

Vitamin B complex (folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12) substitution therapy leads to a decreased plasma homocysteine level. Folic acids themselves are necessary to methylate homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine. Low serum levels of folic acid have furthermore been connected to increased serum levels of Hcy. Hcy serum levels are increased through the common C677T variant in MTHFR. The risk of CVD increases 14–21% in individuals with the homozygous TT genotype. Daily dietary supplementation with folic acid and B vitamins reduces plasma Hcy levels, which in turn decreases the risk of CVD in healthy subjects or improves the likeliness of survival in patients with CHD. This is, nevertheless, a controversial effect, as the reducing Hcy concentrations has not proven to be beneficial in the majority of clinical studies. Although folic acid supplementation shows a potentially modest benefit in stroke prevention, it does not seem to exhibit benefits in connection with preventing CHD and CVD. On the contrary, a meta-analysis indicated a potential detrimental effect of folic acid in subjects with high baseline Hcy. However, the study by Miller et al. is limited by (i) differences in the composite clinical end points between trials and in CVD risk factors for trial participant-based eligibility criteria; (ii) an inconsistent and incomplete discussion of baseline homocysteine level results that preclude a more detailed assessment of interactions; and (iii) neglecting that subgroup effects and potential interactions may occur solely by chance.

### Homocysteine and cardiovascular disease: current evidence and future prospects [^115YwWPy]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Despite the well-known effectiveness of vitamin supplementation in reducing homocysteine levels, it is not known whether lowering of homocysteine levels is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aim of this review is to discuss the epidemiologic evidence about the relation between homocysteine and cardiovascular disease, the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the deleterious vascular and hemostatic effects of homocysteine, and studies of the potential benefits of homocysteine-lowering therapy.

### Homocysteine-lowering therapy: a role in stroke prevention? [^112Ku46j]. The Lancet: Neurology (2007). Medium credibility.

On the basis of the results of several recent clinical trials, many researchers have concluded that vitamin therapy designed to lower total homocysteine concentrations is not effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. However, whereas almost all myocardial infarctions are due to plaque rupture, stroke has many more pathophysiological mechanisms, and thrombosis-which is increased by raised total homocysteine concentrations-has an important role in many of these processes. Thus, stroke and myocardial infarction could respond differently to vitamin therapy. A detailed assessment of the results of the recent HOPE-2 trial and a reanalysis of the VISP trial restricted to patients capable of responding to vitamin therapy suggest that higher doses of vitamin B12 and perhaps new approaches to lowering total homocysteine besides routine vitamin therapy with folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 could reduce the risk of stroke. Thus, therapy to lower homocysteine could still help to prevent stroke, if not other vascular outcomes.

### The effect of folic acid based homocysteine lowering on cardiovascular events in people with kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113L6V69]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

People with kidney disease of any severity experience excess cardiovascular events and mortality compared with the general population. High plasma homocysteine levels increase as estimated glomerular filtration rate levels decline with the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinaemia (defined in relation to the upper limit of the reference range), reported to be 36–89% in patients with chronic kidney disease depending on severity,70–75% in those with functioning kidney transplants, and 85–100% in those with end stage kidney disease. High homocysteine levels have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular eventsin the general population, with a 25% lower homocysteine level associated with an 11% lower risk of coronary artery disease and a 19% lower risk of stroke.

The direct relation between homocysteine levels and cardiovascular events observed in the general population has led to the hypothesis that reducing homocysteine levels could reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease. However, studies of homocysteine lowering in the general population have failed to show clear cardiovascular benefits. Moreover, one study in people with a history of myocardial infarction suggested harm with use of a combination of folic acid, vitamin B 12, and vitamin B 6.

The lack of benefit in the general population contrasts with that seen in people with homocysteinuria, where therapy prevents cardiovascular events. A key distinction between the two populations is the level of homocysteine, which is noticeably higher (100–400 µmol/L) in people with homocysteinuria than in people with cardiovascular disease or diabetes (mean 13 µmol/L). Homocysteine levels in people with kidney disease lie between those of the general population and those with classic homocysteinuria. This has led to the hypothesis that homocysteine lowering may be useful in people with kidney disease, despite the lack of benefit in the broader population, and has driven the conduct of randomised trials in this patient group. A meta-analysis of eight large trials using individual patient level data found the lack of effect of homocysteine lowering to be consistent across categories of renal function. That study utilised serum creatinine levels rather than an estimate of glomerular filtration rate to assess renal function and compared the impact of relatively mild differences in renal function (serum creatinine concentrations < 80, 80–94, and ≥ 95 µmol/L).

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the effects of folic acid based homocysteine lowering compared with placebo or control treatments on cardiovascular events and other clinical outcomes in people with a range of severity of kidney disease, including kidney transplant recipients and those with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease and end stage kidney disease.

### Homocysteine-lowering and cardiovascular disease outcomes in kidney transplant recipients: primary results from the folic acid for vascular outcome reduction in transplantation trial [^113Lgz8T]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Kidney transplant recipients, like other patients with chronic kidney disease, experience excess risk of cardiovascular disease and elevated total homocysteine concentrations. Observational studies of patients with chronic kidney disease suggest increased homocysteine is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The impact of lowering total homocysteine levels in kidney transplant recipients is unknown.

Methods and Results

In a double-blind controlled trial, we randomized 4110 stable kidney transplant recipients to a multivitamin that included either a high dose (n = 2056) or low dose (n = 2054) of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 to determine whether decreasing total homocysteine concentrations reduced the rate of the primary composite arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcome (myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular disease death, resuscitated sudden death, coronary artery or renal artery revascularization, lower-extremity arterial disease, carotid endarterectomy or angioplasty, or abdominal aortic aneurysm repair). Mean follow-up was 4.0 years. Treatment with the high-dose multivitamin reduced homocysteine but did not reduce the rates of the primary outcome (n = 547 total events; hazards ratio [95 confidence interval] = 0.99 [0.84 to 1.17]), secondary outcomes of all-cause mortality (n = 431 deaths; 1.04 [0.86 to 1.26]), or dialysis-dependent kidney failure (n = 343 events; 1.15 [0.93 to 1.43]) compared to the low-dose multivitamin.

Conclusions

Treatment with a high-dose folic acid, B6, and B12 multivitamin in kidney transplant recipients did not reduce a composite cardiovascular disease outcome, all-cause mortality, or dialysis-dependent kidney failure despite significant reduction in homocysteine level.

### Coronary microvascular endothelial dysfunction in patients with angina and nonobstructive coronary artery disease is associated with elevated serum homocysteine levels [^114P474V]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrated that elevated serum homocysteine levels in patients with early coronary atherosclerosis are associated with endothelial dysfunction. The current study further supports a role for homocysteine in the mechanism, and potentially a therapeutic target, of early coronary atherosclerosis in humans. Interestingly, the association between elevated levels of serum homocysteine and CMED seemed to be augmented in patients on B‐vitamin supplementation, while this association was not statistically different between patients on statin or diuretic therapy as compared with those who are not.

Homocysteine is not obtained from diet but rather biosynthesized from essential amino acid methionine via a demethylation multistep process. Homocysteine plays an important mediator role in several basic metabolic processes. It could be reused in the methionine cycle, with the help of folate (B 9) and cobalamin (B 12), which is important for S‐adenosyl methionine production, an essential methylation agent used in several pathways. Alternatively, it could be irreversibly converted to cysteine, via transsulfuration assisted by pyridoxine (B 6), to be used in protein synthesis and other biochemical processes. Through these mechanisms, homocysteine levels are maintained at a safe range with constant turnover and little accumulation. Therefore, the lack of B vitamins as well as other genetic variations affecting these enzymatic pathways could lead to hyperhomocysteinemia. In this study, we demonstrated a clear association between the highest quartile of serum homocysteine levels and coronary microvascular endothelial function, a feature of early atherosclerosis. The chronic effects of elevated homocysteine were previously shown in a case‐control study where a modest increase of homocysteine was associated with an increased risk of vascular diseases, including coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral artery disease. 47 This is the first study to demonstrate the association between modest elevations of homocysteine on CMED, a marker of early preobstructive atherosclerosis.

### Dose-dependent effects of folic acid on blood concentrations of homocysteine: a meta-analysis of the randomized trials [^115Go8Hp]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary supplementation with B vitamins that lower blood homocysteine concentrations is expected to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, but there has been uncertainty about the optimum regimen to use for this purpose.

Objective

The objectives were to ascertain the lowest dose of folic acid associated with the maximum reduction in homocysteine concentrations and to determine the additional relevance of vitamins B-12 and B-6.

Design

A meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials involving individual data on 2596 subjects assessed the effect on plasma homocysteine concentrations of different doses of folic acid and of the addition of vitamins B-12 and B-6.

Results

The proportional reductions in plasma homocysteine concentrations produced by folic acid were greater at higher homocysteine (P < 0.001) and lower folate (P < 0.001) pretreatment concentrations; they were also greater in women than in men (P < 0.001). After standardization for sex and to pretreatment plasma concentrations of 12 micromol homocysteine/L and 12 nmol folate/L, daily doses of 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 2.0, and 5.0 mg folic acid were associated with reductions in homocysteine of 13% (95% CI: 10%, 16%), 20% (17%, 22%), 23% (21%, 26%), 23% (20%, 26%), and 25% (22%, 28%), respectively. Vitamin B-12 (x: 0.4 mg/d) produced 7% (95% CI: 4%, 9%) further reduction in homocysteine concentrations, but vitamin B-6 had no significant effect.

Conclusions

Daily doses of ≥ 0.8 mg folic acid are typically required to achieve the maximal reduction in plasma homocysteine concentrations produced by folic acid supplementation. Doses of 0.2 and 0.4 mg are associated with 60% and 90%, respectively, of this maximal effect.

### Homocysteine lowering does not improve outcomes in ESRD… [^113zkkhe]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Background: High levels of homocysteine are associated with cardiovascular disease, but studies examining the cardiovascular benefit of lowering homocysteine levels with folic acid and B vitamins have inconsistent results. The only benefit shown in recent studies was in a subgroup of stroke patients. Because patients with end-stage renal disease have an annual cardiovascular mortality of 20 percent and higher levels of homocysteine than patients in previous studies, Jamison and colleagues conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine whether this high-risk population would benefit from folic acid and B-vitamin supplementation. Participants were randomized to folic acid and B-vitamin supplementation or placebo. Both groups were allowed to take an additional 1 mg or less of folate as part of their routine medical care. Homocysteine, vitamin B. The primary outcome was time to all-cause mortality.

Secondary outcomes were time to myocardial infarction, stroke, and amputation of a lower extremity, and a composite of all secondary outcomes and all-cause mortality. Additional secondary outcomes were time to thrombosis of arte-riovenous access in hemodialysis patients, and time to dialysis initiation in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. Results: The 2, 056 participants included 751 with ESRD and 1, 305 with advanced chronic kidney disease; 1, 032 were in the treatment group and 1, 024 were in the placebo group. All participants were followed for a median of 3. 2 years. At three months, the mean homocysteine level in the treatment group was reduced by 0. 84 mg per L. In the placebo group, the mean reduction was nonsignificant at 0. 05 mg per L. In more than one third of treated patients, the homocysteine level was reduced to the normal range. Folic acid level increased in the treatment group.

These changes persisted throughout the three years of follow-up in the representative subgroup. Conclusion: Lowering homocysteine levels with folate and B vitamins in patients with chronic kidney disease does not improve outcomes. The authors conclude that although patients with homocystinuria benefit from such supplementation, patients with cardiovascular and end-stage renal disease do not.

### Homocysteine-lowering interventions for preventing cardiovascular events [^111giLr2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease, which includes coronary artery disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease, is a leading cause of death worldwide. Homocysteine is an amino acid with biological functions in methionine metabolism. A postulated risk factor for cardiovascular disease is an elevated circulating total homocysteine level. The impact of homocysteine-lowering interventions, given to patients in the form of vitamins B6, B9 or B12 supplements, on cardiovascular events has been investigated. This is an update of a review previously published in 2009, 2013, and 2015.

Objectives

To determine whether homocysteine-lowering interventions, provided to patients with and without pre-existing cardiovascular disease are effective in preventing cardiovascular events, as well as reducing all-cause mortality, and to evaluate their safety.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to 1 June 2017), Embase (1980 to 2017 week 22) and LILACS (1986 to 1 June 2017). We also searched Web of Science (1970 to 1 June 2017). We handsearched the reference lists of included papers. We also contacted researchers in the field. There was no language restriction in the search.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of homocysteine-lowering interventions for preventing cardiovascular events with a follow-up period of one year or longer. We considered myocardial infarction and stroke as the primary outcomes. We excluded studies in patients with end-stage renal disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction in duplicate. We estimated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB). We measured statistical heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic. We used a random-effects model. We conducted trial sequential analyses, Bayes factor, and fragility indices where appropriate.

Main Results

In this third update, we identified three new randomised controlled trials, for a total of 15 randomised controlled trials involving 71,422 participants. Nine trials (60%) had low risk of bias, length of follow-up ranged from one to 7.3 years. Compared with placebo, there were no differences in effects of homocysteine-lowering interventions on myocardial infarction (homocysteine-lowering = 7.1% versus placebo = 6.0%; RR 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.10, I² = 0%, 12 trials; N = 46,699; Bayes factor 1.04, high-quality evidence), death from any cause (homocysteine-lowering = 11.7% versus placebo = 12.3%, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.06, I² = 0%, 11 trials, N = 44,817; Bayes factor = 1.05, high-quality evidence), or serious adverse events (homocysteine-lowering = 8.3% versus comparator = 8.5%, RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.14, I² = 0%, eight trials, N = 35,788; high-quality evidence). Compared with placebo, homocysteine-lowering interventions were associated with reduced stroke outcome (homocysteine-lowering = 4.3% versus comparator = 5.1%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99, I² = 8%, 10 trials, N = 44,224; high-quality evidence). Compared with low doses, there were uncertain effects of high doses of homocysteine-lowering interventions on stroke (high = 10.8% versus low = 11.2%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.22, I² = 72%, two trials, N = 3929; very low-quality evidence). We found no evidence of publication bias.

Authors' Conclusions

In this third update of the Cochrane review, there were no differences in effects of homocysteine-lowering interventions in the form of supplements of vitamins B6, B9 or B12 given alone or in combination comparing with placebo on myocardial infarction, death from any cause or adverse events. In terms of stroke, this review found a small difference in effect favouring to homocysteine-lowering interventions in the form of supplements of vitamins B6, B9 or B12 given alone or in combination comparing with placebo. There were uncertain effects of enalapril plus folic acid compared with enalapril on stroke; approximately 143 (95% CI 85 to 428) people would need to be treated for 5.4 years to prevent 1 stroke, this evidence emerged from one mega-trial. Trial sequential analyses showed that additional trials are unlikely to increase the certainty about the findings of this issue regarding homocysteine-lowering interventions versus placebo. There is a need for additional trials comparing homocysteine-lowering interventions combined with antihypertensive medication versus antihypertensive medication, and homocysteine-lowering interventions at high doses versus homocysteine-lowering interventions at low doses. Potential trials should be large and co-operative.

### B vitamins for stroke prevention [^117EaJJD]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

What is homocysteine?

Homocysteine is derived from the essential amino acid methionine, which is abundant in animal sources of protein. Methionine is converted to homocysteine via the intermediate S-adenosylmethionine, which acts as a methyl donor, as in several other biochemical processes such as DNA methylation and creatine and phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Homocysteine can be remethylated back to methionine or converted to cysteine by transsulfuration (figure 1).

### Homocysteine-lowering therapy does not affect inflammatory markers of atherosclerosis in patients with stable coronary artery disease [^112vsDV9]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

A high level of total homocysteine (tHcy) is a risk marker for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and is related to inflammation. We wanted to test the effect of homocysteine-lowering B-vitamin therapy, as used in the Western Norway B-vitamin Intervention Trial (WENBIT), on inflammatory markers associated with atherosclerosis.

Design

Single centre, prospective double-blind clinical interventional study, randomised in a 2 x 2 factorial design.

Subjects and Methods

Ninety patients (21 female) with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), aged 38–80 years, were blindly randomised into one of four groups of daily oral treatment with (A) folic acid (0.8 mg)/vitamin B12 (0.4 mg)/vitamin B6 (40 mg), (B) folic acid/vitamin B12, (C) vitamin B6 alone or (D) placebo. Blood samples were collected before and after 6 months of treatment.

Results

Before intervention, median levels of the analytes were: tHcy 11.0 micromol L(-1), neopterin 8.1 nmol L(-1), soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) 3.9 ng mL(-1), interleukin (IL)-6 1.9 pg mL(-1), C-reactive protein (CRP) 1.9 mg L(-1) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 3.3 mmol L(-1). tHcy was significantly associated with neopterin (r = 0.49, P < 0.001) and with IL-6 (r = 0.29, P = 0.01), but not with CRP or sCD40L. Neither treatment with folic acid/B12 nor with B6 induced significant changes in any of these inflammatory biomarkers (P ≥ 0.14). In patients receiving folic acid/B12 (groups A and B), tHcy was reduced with 33% (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In patients with stable CAD, homocysteine-lowering therapy with B-vitamins does not affect levels of inflammatory markers associated with atherogenesis. Failure to reverse inflammatory processes, may partly explain the negative results in clinical secondary B-vitamin intervention trials.

### Water-soluble vitamins in people with low glomerular filtration rate or on dialysis: a review [^112SA8Uu]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular Disease and Thrombosis

Inadequate B6 leads to hyperhomocysteinemia; genetic hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with venous thrombosis and arterial atherosclerosis; patients with low glomerular filtration rate or on dialysis have very high levels of homocysteine, and are at high risk for both thrombosis and atherosclerosis. Because of these connections, it has been hypothesized that hyperhomocysteinemia accounts for some of the excess cardiovascular risk associated with low kidney function, and that lowering homocysteine levels with B6, B12, and folate, especially in high-dose combination, might ameliorate this risk. Randomized trials of multiple B vitamins in the treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia in patients on dialysis have been conducted and are largely disappointing; results are summarized in detail in the section on B12, below, and in Table 4.

Table 4
Summary of randomized controlled trials of water-soluble vitamin supplementation in patients with renal disease that reported a clinical outcome

Summary

The recommended dose has varied between none, 10 mg, and 300 mg/day. Levels of PLP in patients on either HD or PD have been very low in most, but not all, studies, suggesting that some supplementation is warranted. In high-flux hemodialysis, some regard 10 mg daily as adequate supplementation, but other data suggest that somewhat higher doses of 12–17 mg daily are needed to normalize PLP. In peritoneal dialysis, 10 mg appears to be adequate for all patients, based on one small study. However, studies have been conducted in prevalent patients who may have become deficient over some time, and it is possible that lower doses would be needed if started earlier in the course of kidney disease or at the initiation of dialysis.

### Folate and vitamin B6 from diet and supplements in relation to risk of coronary heart disease among women… [^1148yDaD]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

leading to the hypothesis that elevated blood homocysteine levels may cause coronary disease. 1, 2 More recently, evidence linking moderately elevated blood homocysteine levels to increased risk3 has focused attention on genetic and lifestyle determinants of homocysteine levels. Folate and vitamin B6 are important cofactors for metabolism. Supplementation of the diet. our data suggest a graded inverse association between CHD and increasing intake of folate regardless of folate source. Finally, the magnitude of the inverse association for folate is consistent with our parallel study among male health professionals32 and with the physiologic effects of folate on lowering of homocysteine levels.
3. From calculations by Boushey et al3 and Tucker et al, 25 increasing folate intake by 100 µg/d would lower homocysteine levels by 6% and risk of CHD by approximately 5%. Each 100 µg/d increase in folate in our population was associated with. a 5. 8% lower risk of CHD.

Homocysteine may increase risk of CHD through direct toxicity to endothelial cells, increased coagulation, decreased endothelial reactivity, and stimulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation. 33–36 Higher levels of homocysteine have been observed among patients with peripheral37, 38 and cerebral vascular occlusion39, 40 and coronary disease.
3. Although the positive association is graded between levels of homocysteine and degree of carotid artery stenosis13 and. Recent evidence suggests that vitamin B6 is generally more effective at lowering homocysteine levels after methionine load, 43, 44 and folate more effective at lowering fasting homocysteine levels. Our results of a maximum benefit among women in the highest quintile of both folate and vitamin B6 are consistent with independent. effects of these vitamins in lowering homocysteine levels and suggest that maximum benefit is obtained at optimal levels of both.

Randomized trials in secondary and primary prevention are needed to test their independent effects. 45 Although dietary B12 also may lower homocysteine level, plasma B12 levels are influenced more by absorption than. on CHD rates, but that maximum benefit would be achieved at folate intake of at least 400 µg/d.

### Effect of combined treatment with folic acid, vitamin B, and vitamin bon plasma biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in women [^115RHQMr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Mild or moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, typically defined as fasting blood homocysteine concentrations between 12 and 30 μmol/L, 1, 2 has been associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in observational studies. 3 However, evidence supporting a causal relationship is lacking. In vitro studies and studies in animals and humans show that mildly or moderately elevated homocysteine is associated with several important components of atherogenesis, including vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulability 4; however, the extent to which these and other pathogenic mechanisms may underlie the apparent association with CVD remains unclear.

The WAFACS (Women's Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study), conducted among women at high CVD risk, showed that combined treatment with folic acid, vitamin B 6, and vitamin B 12 for 7.3 years significantly reduced homocysteine concentrations, but did not reduce a combined end point of total cardiovascular events. 5 Meta‐analyses of other randomized trials in high‐risk patients similarly indicate that homocysteine lowering with B vitamins has no beneficial effect on CVD or venous thrombosis, although a possible benefit on stroke has been suggested. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 One interpretation of the mostly null findings in trials is that elevated homocysteine is a marker of suboptimal B‐vitamin status, but is not causally related to CVD. Others have speculated that the beneficial effects of homocysteine lowering may be countered by adverse effects of high‐dose B vitamins such as an increase in inflammation or endothelial dysfunction. 11, 12 With regard to this possibility, current evidence, including substudies of randomized trials, suggests that homocysteine lowering with B vitamins has little impact on plasma biomarkers of inflammation 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and endothelial dysfunction. 12, 17, 18, 24, 28, 29 However, most of these studies have been limited by small sample size (n < 200) and short treatment duration (< 2 years).

To address this question, we investigated the effect of long‐term, combined treatment with folic acid, vitamin B 6, and vitamin B 12 on plasma biomarkers of chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in a subsample of 300 participants in WAFACS. 5

### Interventions for lowering plasma homocysteine levels in kidney transplant recipients [^11423ZKW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated homocysteine levels have been shown to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However studies of homocysteine lowering in general and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) populations have not demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular event rates. Kidney transplant recipients have high homocysteine levels, high cardiovascular event rates and, unlike the ESKD population, may achieve normalisation of homocysteine levels with homocysteine lowering therapies. Thus may benefit from homocysteine lowering therapy.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of established homocysteine lowering therapy on cardiovascular mortality in patients with functioning kidney transplants.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 16 March 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of any therapy that has been shown to significantly lower homocysteine levels conducted in people with functioning kidney transplants. Studies were to be included if they compared homocysteine lowering therapy with placebo or usual care, or compare higher versus lower doses of homocysteine lowering therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Results were to be expressed as the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Data was to be pooled using the random effects model.

Main Results

The literature search yielded 359 reports of which only one study was identified that met our inclusion criteria and reported relevant clinical endpoints. This study randomised 4110 adult participants with a functioning kidney transplant and elevated homocysteine levels to folic acid plus high dose B multivitamins or low dose multivitamins who were followed for a mean 4.0 years. Despite effectively lowering homocysteine levels) in homocysteine levels at follow-up (MD -4.40 μmol/L, 95% CI -5.98 to -2.82) there was no evidence the intervention impacted on any of the outcomes reported including cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.20), all-cause mortality (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.22), myocardial infarction (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.35), stroke (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.71), commencement of renal replacement therapy (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.37) or all reported adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.20). There was no evidence the intervention impacted on the primary endpoint of the study, a cardiovascular event composite (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.15). The study was of high quality.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no current evidence to support the use of homocysteine lowering therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention in kidney transplant recipients.

### Meta-analysis of folic acid supplementation trials on risk of cardiovascular disease and risk interaction with baseline homocysteine levels [^114m1Rfv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Experimental models and observational studies suggest that homocysteine-lowering therapy with folic acid (FA) may prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, FA also stimulates cell proliferation and might promote progression of atherosclerosis. Our objectives were to perform a meta-analysis of FA supplementation trials on CVD events and to explore a potential interaction between FA supplementation and baseline homocysteine levels on CVD events. We searched MEDLINE for randomized controlled trials of FA supplementation to prevent CVD events (January 1966 to July 2009) and performed meta-analyses using random effects models. For trials that reported responses to FA supplementation stratified by baseline levels of homocysteine, we pooled within-trial estimates of differences in log-relative risks by baseline homocysteine levels using a random effects model. Overall, FA supplementation did not affect primary cardiovascular clinical end points (relative risk 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93 to 1.13, p = 0.66) or stroke (relative risk 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.08, p = 0.43). However, in trials that reported analyses stratified by baseline homocysteine, effect of FA supplementation differed by strata of baseline homocysteine (p for interaction = 0.030). Specifically, risks of primary clinical CVD events comparing FA supplementation to control were 1.06 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.13) in strata with mean baseline homocysteine levels > 12 mumol/L and 0.94 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.03) in strata with baseline homocysteine levels < 12 micromol/L. In conclusion, FA had no effect on CVD or stroke. However, analysis of within-trial results stratified by baseline homocysteine suggests potential harm in those with high homocysteine at baseline. This interaction may have important implications for recommendations of FA supplement use. In the meantime, FA supplementation should not be recommended as a means to prevent or treat CVD or stroke.

### The effect of folic acid based homocysteine lowering on cardiovascular events in people with kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113kmmJJ]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with systematic reviews of homocysteine lowering in all populations

These data are consistent with studies in the general population, where folic acid based homocysteine lowering has also not been found to prevent cardiovascular events in large randomised trials. Previous systematic reviews have analysed the effect of folic acid based homocysteine lowering in the general population as successive trials have been reported. In 2006, a meta-analysis of 12 randomised trials reported no effect on the risk of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, or all cause mortality. The possibility of benefit for stroke outcomes was raised in 2007 in a meta-analysis of eight trials (relative risk 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.00, P = 0.045). More recently, the VITATOPS trial carried out in people with recent stroke or transient ischaemic attack found no significant effect on cardiovascular events (relative risk 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.00, P = 0.05) or stroke (0.92, 0.81 to 1.06). The addition of the VITATOPS results to those of previous studies again found no reduction in cardiovascular events, stroke (0.94, 0.86 to 1.01), or myocardial infarction.

An individual patient meta-analysis was published by the B-Vitamin Treatment Trialists' Collaboration in 2010 of 37 485 participants in eight trials randomised to folate containing B vitamins or to control for the prevention of vascular disease. The meta-analysis showed that folic acid supplementation had no impact on major vascular events, mortality, or cancer incidence despite an average 25% reduction in homocysteine levels. There was no evidence of heterogeneity in subgroup analyses comparing the impact of the intervention according to serum creatinine concentrations (< 80, 80–94, and ≥ 95 µmol/l). The trialists' analysis included 4361 participants contained in the current analysis, representing 12% of the individual patient data meta-analysis and 40% of the current report. The additional 6590 participants included in the current report are from studies published after the previous report (4603 participants) or from studies that did not meet the 1000 participant criteria of the former report (1987 participants). These studies have effectively excluded any beneficial cardiovascular effect of homocysteine lowering therapy in the general population, and the current review adds to this evidence by similarly excluding meaningful benefit in kidney disease.

### Effects of B vitamins and omega 3 fatty acids on cardiovascular diseases: a randomised placebo controlled trial [^116jafXW]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Observational studies have reported inverse associations of cardiovascular disease with dietary intake or plasma concentrations of B vitamins (folate and vitamin B-6) and omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Moderately elevated concentrations of plasma total homocysteine have been associated with higher risks of coronary heart disease and stroke, and dietary supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B-12 typically lowers plasma total homocysteine concentration by about 25–30%, raising the prospect that dietary supplementation with these B vitamins might reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.

Several large scale trials have examined the effects of supplementation with B vitamins on cardiovascular disease, but none has reported any significant effects on risk of cardiovascular disease. Possible reasons for the failure of these trials to show any significant effects on vascular disease include lack of statistical power to detect treatment effects (owing to an insufficient number of participants or duration of treatment), attenuation of the effects of B vitamins by mandatory folic acid fortification or by widespread use of supplements containing folic acid among trial participants, or that homocysteine is not causally related to vascular disease.

Observational studies have also reported inverse associations of cardiovascular disease with dietary intake or plasma concentrations of omega 3 fatty acids (mainly eicosapentanoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid), suggesting that supplementation with omega 3 fatty acids might exert protective effects on cardiovascular disease. These fatty acids have been shown to have beneficial effects on several cardiovascular risk factors — including blood pressure, plasma triglyceride concentration, and markers of thrombosis and inflammation — and may also have antiarrhythmic effects. Although some trials involving patients with a history of cardiovascular diseases or with high levels of cardiovascular risk factors have reported positive effects of omega 3 fatty acids on cardiovascular events, other trials have reported no effects on arrhythmia or mortality.

The aims of the Supplémentation en Folates et Omega-3 (SU.FOL.OM3) trial were to investigate whether dietary supplementation with homocysteine lowering B vitamins or omega 3 fatty acids, or both, could prevent major cardiovascular events in patients with a history of ischaemic heart disease or stroke.

### Plasmatic homocysteine response to vitamin supplementation in elderly people [^112Cu7Vx]. Thrombosis Research (2000). Low credibility.

Homocysteine (Hcy) increase is now widely accepted as a risk factor for vascular disease. The effects of folic acid (FA) and vitamins B12 and B6 in lowering Hcy have been extensively studied, but there is still little data on the response to FA dietary administration. Our purpose was to evaluate the impact of the diet and the degree of response to different doses of pharmacological FA supplementation. In a prospective, randomized, and simple blind study, 50 elderly subjects were given a 400-microg/day FA diet and were randomly assigned to one of the following treatments: Group I = placebo tablet; Group II = tablet containing 1-mg folic acid, 1-mg B12, and 25-mg B6; and Group III = tablet containing 2.5-mg folic acid and same B6 and B12 doses as Group II. Forty-four subjects completed the study, and their plasmas were evaluated. Hcy concentration significantly decreased even in patients with normal basal values, and there were no differences in the response between individuals receiving diet plus placebo and those receiving diet plus pharmacological supplementation. After the treatment, the mean decrease of plasmatic Hcy levels was 10.8 (9.4, 12.5) micromol/l, geometric mean [95% confidence interval (95% CI)], and particularly, the values for Group I were 10.6 (7.4, 14.8) micromol/l. In 31% of the subjects, the post-treatment Hcy levels were less than or = 5 micromol/l. These results show that a special diet, with or without pharmacological FA and B12 and B6 supplementation, significantly decreases the Hcy levels in elderly people. Therefore, a diet with high contents of FA might have an enormous impact on the morbidity and mortality of atherothrombosis.

### Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1122v2hw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Regarding the intervention effect of folic acid supplementation on risk of CHD, all meta‐analyses, 23, 53, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61 including ours, reported a consistent nonsignificant intervention effect. The mechanism for the discrepancy in the folic acid intervention effect on stroke and CHD is unclear. Compared with CHD, which involves mainly large vessels, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for stroke are more heterogeneous and involve both cerebral large vessels and small vessels. As reported previously, elevated homocysteine was more likely a risk factor for small vessel diseases 62; therefore, the modest beneficial effect of homocysteine reduction by folic acid supplementation on stroke but not on CHD may be driven by its impact on reducing the atherosclerotic processes of small vessels. This hypothesis was indirectly supported by the stronger associations with stroke than CHD, with higher homocysteine levels observed in both prospective cohort and genetic studies. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Three previous meta‐analyses 50, 63, 64 of RCTs indicated a significant intervention effect among patients with renal diseases. One of the meta‐analyses observed an intervention effect of 27% (95% CI 0.56–0.94, P = 0.02) 50 based on pooled results from 3 RCTs 30, 40, 44 among patients on dialysis; another meta‐analysis of 7 RCTs observed an intervention effect of 15% (95% CI 0.76–0.96, P = 0.009) among patients with end‐stage renal disease or advanced chronic kidney disease. 63 The third meta‐analysis 64 based on 10 RCTs among patients with chronic kidney diseases did not observe significant overall intervention effects but found significant intervention effects among subgroups (with preexisting end‐stage renal disease: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68–0.99; without folic acid fortification: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56–0.96). Our subgroup analysis reported a nonsignificant effect on CVD among patients with renal disease, mainly driven by 1 RCT. 34

### Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112rMC6G]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Characteristics of the Selected RCTs

The selected 30 RCTs enrolled 82 334 participants with a mean age of 50 years, and 53% were male. The average folic acid supplementation duration was 3.2 years (< 2 years in 7 trials, 2–4 years in 18 trials, and ≥ 5 years in 5 trials). The dosage of folic acid in the intervention groups ranged from 0.5 to 15 mg/day except in 1 RCT 16 among patients with end‐stage renal disease with a dosage of 40 mg/day.

All 30 trials included participants with preexisting conditions (Tables 1 and 2). Sixteen trials enrolled participants with prior CVD, 10 trials included participants with renal diseases (chronic kidney disease, end‐stage renal disease, or diabetes nephropathy), 1 included participants with hypertension, 26 1 included participants with atherosclerosis, 48 1 included participants with esophageal dysplasia, 38 and 1 included participants with history of colorectal adenomas. 46 Eighteen trials were conducted in nonfortified regions, 4 were conducted in partly fortified regions, and 8 were conducted in mandatorily fortified populations. Twenty trials applied folic acid supplementation only, and 10 trials applied folic acid supplementation in combination with vitamin B6 and/or B12. The control groups in 4 trials were treated with low‐dose vitamin B, whereas another 26 trials used placebo or usual care for participants in the control group.

In considering the form of supplementation, only the SU.FOL.OM3 trial 14 from France used 5‐methyltetrahydrofolate, and all others used folic acid. The change in homocysteine levels from the beginning to the end of the folic acid supplementation was reported in 23 trials (Table 1). All 23 trials showed a reduction in homocysteine levels, with net changes ranging from −1.5 to −26.0 μmol/L (percentage changes from −10.9% to 57.7%) (Table 1).

### The homocysteine controversy [^111gJnSV]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Awaiting the results of studies to come, what should we do with our high-risk patient? Clearly, an evidence-based recommendation is impossible. The evidence collected so far allows for just a single conclusion: high-dose B-vitamin therapy in all patients at high risk of CVD does not reduce events after 5 years. In view of what we have discussed, the following policy may be considered:
Do not screen for hyperhomocysteinemia routinely in high-risk patients, but only if: An inborn error of 1-carbon metabolism is suspected based on the clinical phenotype CVD occurs prematurely (i.e. < 50 years, cutoff depending on conventional risk-factor profile) in the patient or his/her family B-vitamin depletion is suspected based on history or comorbidity
Do not treat mild hyperhomocysteinemia routinely, but only if fasting levels exceed a certain threshold of, for example, 20–25 μmol/l
Upon decision to treat, do not use high-dose B-vitamin preparations routinely, but start with a multivitamin containing moderate amounts of folate, B 12, and B 6.
Switch to high-dose B vitamins only if homocysteine remains clearly elevated
Keep an eye on the literature

### Homocysteine lowering with folic acid and B vitamins in vascular disease [^112Ws4bs]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

In observational studies, lower homocysteine levels are associated with lower rates of coronary heart disease and stroke. Folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 lower homocysteine levels. We assessed whether supplementation reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with vascular disease.

Methods

We randomly assigned 5522 patients 55 years of age or older who had vascular disease or diabetes to daily treatment either with the combination of 2.5 mg of folic acid, 50 mg of vitamin B6, and 1 mg of vitamin B12 or with placebo for an average of five years. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, and stroke.

Results

Mean plasma homocysteine levels decreased by 2.4 micromol per liter (0.3 mg per liter) in the active-treatment group and increased by 0.8 micromol per liter (0.1 mg per liter) in the placebo group. Primary outcome events occurred in 519 patients (18.8 percent) assigned to active therapy and 547 (19.8 percent) assigned to placebo (relative risk, 0.95; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.84 to 1.07; P = 0.41). As compared with placebo, active treatment did not significantly decrease the risk of death from cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.96; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.13), myocardial infarction (relative risk, 0.98; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.85 to 1.14), or any of the secondary outcomes. Fewer patients assigned to active treatment than to placebo had a stroke (relative risk, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.97). More patients in the active-treatment group were hospitalized for unstable angina (relative risk, 1.24; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.49).

Conclusions

Supplements combining folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 did not reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with vascular disease. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00106886; Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN14017017.).

### Study of the effectiveness of additional reductions in cholesterol and homocysteine (SEARCH): characteristics of a randomized trial among 12064 myocardial infarction survivors [^113PFUUy]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Cholesterol lowering with statins reduces the risk of vascular disease, but uncertainty remains as to whether more intensive statin therapy produces worthwhile benefits safely. Blood homocysteine level is an independent marker of vascular risk, but it is unknown whether this association is causal.

Methods and Results

12,064 myocardial infarction survivors have been randomized to more versus less intensive cholesterol-lowering treatment using simvastatin 80 mg versus 20 mg daily. Allocation to more intensive treatment has yielded average further low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reductions of 0.5 mmol/L at 2 months and 0.4 mmol/L at 5 years. In addition, using a factorial design, these patients have been randomized to homocysteine lowering with folic acid 2 mg plus vitamin B12 1 mg daily versus matching placebo, yielding an average 3 to 4 mumol/L reduction in homocysteine. After 6 years of median follow-up, the annual overall rate of major vascular events is approximately 3%. Follow-up is scheduled to continue for a median of 7 years.

Conclusion

SEARCH should provide reliable evidence about the efficacy and safety of prolonged use of more intensive cholesterol-lowering therapy and, separately, of folate-based homocysteine-lowering therapy in a high-risk population.

### Modification of vitamin B6 on the associations of blood lead levels and cardiovascular diseases in the US adults [^116vc1N7]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Previous literature has found that suboptimal level or mild deficiency of vitamin B6 could be associated with a higher risk of many chronic diseases, including CVDs. For example, in a multicentre case-control study in Europe, vitamin B6 concentrations were significantly lower in patients with vascular disease than in healthy controls. Another case-control study in the USA found a strong independent association between low PLP and stroke. Underlying mechanisms may involve homocysteine metabolisms, in which the synthesis of cystathionine requires vitamin B6 in the form of PLP. Vitamin B6 was also inversely related to inflammatory markers such as CRP and fibrinogen, which may induce a higher risk of CVDs.

However, there has not been a consensus on the effect of vitamin B6 supplementation on the prevention or treatment of CVDs. A Japan study showed that vitamin B6 supplement has the potential to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction. However, some large-scale clinical trials reported negative results on the effect of Vitamin B6 in reducing cardiovascular risk in humans. For example, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation 2 Study found no effect of vitamin B6 supplementation in reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with vascular disease. The Norwegian Vitamin trial reported no association between vitamin B6 supplement and benefit for myocardial infarction and stroke. These negative results may suggest that vitamin B6 does not work well in patients with CVDs but cannot preclude a protective effect in primary prevention. It was also pointed out that some neglected confounding factors and inappropriate designs may implicate the negative evidence in previous studies. Therefore, further studies are needed to find the role of vitamin B6 in CVD prevention and the optimal dose and combination.

### Effects of homocysteine-lowering with folic acid plus vitamin B12 vs placebo on mortality and major morbidity in myocardial infarction survivors: a randomized trial [^115TkmpY]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

Blood homocysteine levels are positively associated with cardiovascular disease, but it is uncertain whether the association is causal.

Objective

To assess the effects of reducing homocysteine levels with folic acid and vitamin B(12) on vascular and nonvascular outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Double-blind randomized controlled trial of 12,064 survivors of myocardial infarction in secondary care hospitals in the United Kingdom between 1998 and 2008.

Interventions

2 mg folic acid plus 1 mg vitamin B(12) daily vs matching placebo.

Main Outcome Measures

First major vascular event, defined as major coronary event (coronary death, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization), fatal or nonfatal stroke, or noncoronary revascularization.

Results

Allocation to the study vitamins reduced homocysteine by a mean of 3.8 micromol/L (28%). During 6.7 years of follow-up, major vascular events occurred in 1537 of 6033 participants (25.5%) allocated folic acid plus vitamin B(12) vs 1493 of 6031 participants (24.8%) allocated placebo (risk ratio [RR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97–1.12; p = 0.28). There were no apparent effects on major coronary events (vitamins, 1229 [20.4%], vs placebo, 1185 [19.6%]; RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.97–1.13), stroke (vitamins, 269 [4.5%], vs placebo, 265 [4.4%]; RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.86–1.21), or noncoronary revascularizations (vitamins, 178 [3.0%], vs placebo, 152 [2.5%]; RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.95–1.46). Nor were there significant differences in the numbers of deaths attributed to vascular causes (vitamins, 578 [9.6%], vs placebo, 559 [9.3%]) or nonvascular causes (vitamins, 405 [6.7%], vs placebo, 392 [6.5%]) or in the incidence of any cancer (vitamins, 678 [11.2%], vs placebo, 639 [10.6%]).

Conclusion

Substantial long-term reductions in blood homocysteine levels with folic acid and vitamin B(12) supplementation did not have beneficial effects on vascular outcomes but were also not associated with adverse effects on cancer incidence.

### Homocysteine and cardiovascular disease: biological mechanisms, observational epidemiology, and the need for randomized trials [^113ZdPbP]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Basic research indicates that homocysteine causes endothelial dysfunction and damage, accelerates thrombin formation, inhibits native thrombolysis, promotes lipid peroxidation through free radical formation, and induces vascular smooth muscle proliferation and monocyte chemotaxis. Most, but not all, observational epidemiological studies indicate that individuals with higher homocysteine levels have increased risks of cardiovascular disease. The magnitude ranges from approximately 20% in prospective studies to approximately 80% in retrospective case-control studies. In all observational epidemiological studies, however, the amount of uncontrolled and uncontrollable confounding is as large as the postulated small to moderate effect size. Thus, the totality of evidence should include randomized trials of sufficient sample size and duration with clinical end points. Folic acid reduces levels of homocysteine, but at present, despite several plausible biological mechanisms and a large body of observational epidemiological data, it is unclear whether supplementation will reduce risks of cardiovascular disease. It is also unclear whether any benefit of folic acid is attributable to lowering homocysteine levels. The current evidence is necessary, but not sufficient to judge causality. Such judgments await the availability of data from large-scale randomized trials. The availability of such data would permit rational clinical decision-making for individual patients and policy decisions for the health of the general public.

### Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112joece]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Multivariate‐adjusted relative risks (RRs) assessing the effects of folic acid supplementation on the risk of CVD, CHD, and/or stroke were extracted from each RCT if they were reported in the publications; otherwise, we calculated the RRs based on the number of events in each group. CHD events included nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary disease; stroke events included nonfatal and fatal stroke. The number of CVD events was obtained directly from the trial reports or as the composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and vascular death.

Meta‐Analysis

We assessed the overall effect of folic acid supplementation on the risk of CVD, CHD, or stroke. RRs and corresponding standard errors were logarithmically transformed to stabilize variance and normalize the distribution. The inverse variance weighted method was used to combine summary measures using random‐effects models to minimize the effects of between‐study heterogeneity. Fixed‐effect models were used in subsidiary analyses.

We conducted stratified analyses by a number of factors, including duration of folic acid supplementation (< 3 or ≥ 3 years), the magnitude of decrease in homocysteine concentration (< 20%, 20–29.9%, or ≥ 30%), mandatory folic acid grain fortification (yes, partially, or no), folic acid with or without vitamin B6 or B12 (yes or no), control group with or without low‐dose B vitamin (yes or no), preexisting renal disease status (yes or no), and CVD status (yes or no). For the stratified analysis by existing renal disease, we extracted data from the renal HOPE‐2 study, 34 which was a post hoc analysis of a subgroup of participants who had renal diseases at baseline of the HOPE‐2 trial. 17

The P value of the Cochrane Q statistic and I 2 index was used to evaluate between‐study heterogeneity. 35 The potential for publication bias was evaluated by using Egger and Begg tests with funnel plots of the natural log of the RR versus its standard error. 36 Sensitivity analyses were done to assess the influence of each individual trial by omitting the trial that had the largest effect on the overall result one by one. All analyses were conducted using Stata 10 software (StataCorp LP). A 2‐tailed P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Homocysteine lowering interventions for preventing cardiovascular events [^115hsoBH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease, stroke and congestive heart failure, is a leading cause of death worldwide. A postulated risk factor is elevated circulating total homocysteine (tHcy) levels which is influenced mainly by blood levels of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), folic acid (vitamin B9) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6). There is uncertainty regarding the strength of association between tHcy and the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Objectives

To assess the clinical effectiveness of homocysteine-lowering interventions (HLI) in people with or without pre-existing cardiovascular disease.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library (issue 3 2008), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2008), EMBASE (1988 to August 2008), and LILACS (1982 to September 2, 2008). We also searched in Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED; 1985 to August 2008), ISI Web of Science (1993 to August 2008), and the Cochrane Stroke Group Specialised Register (April 2007). We hand searched pertinent journals and the reference lists of included papers. We also contacted researchers in the field. There was no language restriction in the search.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of HLI for preventing cardiovascular events with a follow-up period of 1 year or longer. We considered myocardial infarction and stroke as the primary outcomes. We excluded studies in patients with end-stage renal disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. We estimated relative risks (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using I(2). We used a random-effects model to synthesise the findings.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs involving 24,210 participants with a low risk of bias in general terms. HLI did not reduce the risk of non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or death by any cause (pooled RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.13, I(2) = 0%; pooled RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.08, I(2) = 15%); and pooled RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.09, I(2): 0%), respectively.

Authors' Conclusions

Results from available published trials suggest that there is no evidence to support the use of HLI to prevent cardiovascular events.

### Homocysteine-lowering interventions for preventing cardiovascular events [^113U2eT6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease, which includes coronary artery disease, stroke and congestive heart failure, is a leading cause of death worldwide. Homocysteine is an amino acid with biological functions in methionine metabolism. A postulated risk factor is an elevated circulating total homocysteine level, which is associated with cardiovascular events. The impact of homocysteine-lowering interventions, given to patients in the form of vitamins B6, B9 or B12 supplements, on cardiovascular events. This is an update of a review previously published in 2009 and 2013.

Objectives

To determine whether homocysteine-lowering interventions, provided in patients with and without pre-existing cardiovascular disease are effective in preventing cardiovascular events, as well as all-cause mortality and evaluate their safety.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1950 to January week 5 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 2014 week 6) and LILACS (1986 to February 2014). We also searched Web of Science (1970 to 7 February 2014). We handsearched the reference lists of included papers. We also contacted researchers in the field. There was no language restriction in the search.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of homocysteine-lowering interventions for preventing cardiovascular events with a follow-up period of one year or longer. We considered myocardial infarction and stroke as the primary outcomes. We excluded studies in patients with end-stage renal disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction in duplicate. We estimated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic. We used a random-effects model.

Main Results

In this second updated Cochrane Review, we identified no new randomised controlled trials. Therefore, this new version includes 12 randomised controlled trials involving 47,429 participants. In general terms, 75% (9/12) trials had a low risk of bias. Homocysteine-lowering interventions compared with placebo did not significantly affect non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction (1743/23,590 (7.38%) versus 1247/20,190 (6.17%); RR 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.10, I(2) = 0%, high quality evidence), stroke (968/22,348 (4.33%) versus 974/18,957 (5.13%); RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.0, I(2) = 11%, high quality evidence) or death from any cause (2784/22,648 (12.29%) versus 2502/19,250 (10.64%); RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.07, I(2) = 6%, high quality evidence). Homocysteine-lowering interventions compared with placebo did not significantly affect serious adverse events (cancer) (1558/18,130 (8.59%) versus 1334/14,739 (9.05%); RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.13; I(2) = 0%, high quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This second update of this Cochrane Review found no evidence to suggest that homocysteine-lowering interventions in the form of supplements of vitamins B6, B9 or B12 given alone or in combination should be used for preventing cardiovascular events. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that homocysteine-lowering interventions are associated with an increased risk of cancer.

### Vitamin, mineral, and multivitamin supplementation to prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114KtM99]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Folic acid with or without vitamin B12 — trials showed no mortality benefit and a potential increase in cancer incidence in selected populations. The USPSTF found 5 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in nonpregnant adults, with 1 trial studying folic acid plus vitamin B12. A pooled analysis showed no association between folic acid supplementation and all-cause mortality over 2 to 6.5 years, and events for cardiovascular disease mortality and cardiovascular disease events were too low to draw conclusions. In pooled analyses, folic acid either alone or with vitamin B12 was associated with higher rates of any cancer incidence at 2 to 6 years of follow-up, and generalizability is uncertain because trials were limited to adults with moderately elevated homocysteine levels or with a history of colorectal adenomas.

### Folic acid supplementation on inflammation and homocysteine in type 2 diabetes mellitus: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112HK68r]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a condition that elevates blood glucose, also known as hyperglycemia. Patients living with T2DM are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) than healthy individuals. The prevalence of diabetes worldwide in 2021 was estimated to be 10.3% and this is continually rising with estimated projections of around 12.2% in 2045. The main factors that exacerbate the development of CVD in T2DM include but are not limited to hyperinsulinemia, obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and homocysteinemia. Inflammation is a central feature in T2DM, contributing to CVD among patients with T2DM. For instance, an increased circulating plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) is noted in patients with T2DM, which may further increase the risk of CVD. Moreover, T2DM are more likely to develop hyperhomocysteinemia primarily due to folate and vitamin B 12 deficiency. It is noteworthy to indicate that patients with T2DM who rely on metformin to control hyperglycemia often develop hyperhomocysteinemia, which further makes them susceptible to CVDs.

Previous studies have reported a link between homocysteine and inflammation. For instance, evidence from preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated an association between homocysteine and proinflammatory responses. Homocysteine is an amino acid associated with the risk of CVD if its level is elevated in the body. Although homocysteine and inflammation markers are frequently detected at the same time, they are not correlated as they have revealed an inverse relationship in previous scientific evidence. We anticipate that measuring them simultaneously will improve the overall interpretation and understanding of their correlation in T2DM. Due to their contribution to the development of CVDs in T2DM, an approach that can reduce the circulating levels of inflammatory markers and homocysteine in T2DM can be important to ameliorate inflammation, halt cardiovascular-related complications amongst T2DM and further reduce morbidity and mortality. It is important to note that T2DM medications widely used to control hyperglycemia in T2DM are available; however, their long-term may result in vitamin B 12 and folate deficiency. Recent evidence has shown that folate deficiency is associated with an increased level of homocysteine, increasing the risk of CVD in T2DM. The above shortfalls for drugs and related side effects have prompted an exploration of dietary supplements and macronutrients in alleviating cardiovascular-related complications in T2DM. Other examples include vitamin D, and folate, a natural form of vitamin B 9 due to its pleiotropic effects in diabetes and fewer side effects than other expensive and toxic therapies. Folate is primarily found in green leafy vegetables and plays a role in cell division and synthesis of nucleic acids.

### The homocysteine controversy [^115Afp4P]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Contrast between intervention groups

The power of any intervention study is dependent no so much on the effect size of the active treatment, but rather on the contrast generated between the intervention groups. In this respect, several intervention trials have been compromised by B-vitamin food fortification implemented just prior to or during the intervention period. In addition, the use of multivitamins is so widespread that up to 20% of patients included in the large B-vitamin trials were actually using multivitamins at the time of randomization.

The impact of contrast between the intervention groups has not been sufficiently addressed. In the aforementioned meta-analysis of stroke prevention by B vitamins, however, there was a significant impact of both grain fortification and the degree of homocysteine lowering on the probability of finding a protective effect of B vitamins on stroke incidence. Intervention effects were not observed in fortified study populations or if the degree of homocysteine lowering was < 20% compared with baseline (Wang et al.).

In conclusion, although the cumulative intervention studies contain a large number of patients, the actual power to detect an intervention effect may be compromised by a duration of follow-up that is simply too short in relation to the time frame of the development of atherosclerotic disease. In addition, conclusions from intervention studies may not apply to patients with moderate hyperhomocysteinemia — for example, exceeding 20 μmol/l — or to patients not exposed to multivitamins or food fortification with B vitamins.

### Homocysteine and vascular disease: review of published results of the homocysteine-lowering trials [^114gh6zr]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Moderately elevated homocysteine levels have been associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in observational studies, but whether these associations are causal is uncertain. Randomized trials of dietary supplementation with B vitamins were set up to assess whether lowering homocysteine levels could reduce the risk of vascular disease. This review is based on a meta-analysis of published results of eight homocysteine-lowering trials for preventing vascular disease. The eight trials comprised a total of 37,485 individuals and provided comparisons of the effects of B vitamins on 5,074 coronary heart disease (CHD) events, 1,483 stroke events, 2,692 incident cancer events, and 5,128 deaths. Our meta-analysis assessed the effects of lowering homocysteine levels by about 25% for about 5 years. Allocation to B vitamins had no beneficial effects on any cardiovascular events, with hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 1.01 (0.96–1.07) for CHD and 0.96 (0.87–1.07) for stroke. Moreover, allocation to B vitamins had no significant adverse effects on cancer [1.08 (0.99–1.17)], or for death from any cause [1.02 (0.97–1.07)]. Thus, supplementation with B vitamins had no statistically significant effects on the risks of cardiovascular events, total mortality rates, or cancer. A meta-analysis based on individual participant data from all available trials will assess the effects of lowering homocysteine levels on a broader range of outcomes, overall and in all relevant subgroups. However, available evidence does not support the routine use of B vitamins to prevent cardiovascular disease.

### Lowering homocysteine in patients with ischemic stroke to prevent recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and death: the vitamin intervention for stroke prevention (VISP) randomized controlled trial [^1179GHNq]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

In observational studies, elevated plasma total homocysteine levels have been positively associated with ischemic stroke risk. However the utility of homocysteine-lowering therapy to reduce that risk has not been confirmed by randomized trials.

Objective

To determine whether high doses of folic acid, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), and cobalamin (vitamin B12), given to lower total homocysteine levels, reduce the risk of recurrent stroke over a 2-year period compared with low doses of these vitamins.

Design

Double-blind randomized controlled trial (September 1996-May 2003).

Setting and Participants

3680 adults with nondisabling cerebral infarction at 56 university-affiliated hospitals, community hospitals, private neurology practices, and Veterans Affairs medical centers across the United States, Canada, and Scotland.

Interventions

All participants received best medical and surgical care plus a daily multivitamin containing the US Food and Drug Administration's reference daily intakes of other vitamins; patients were randomly assigned to receive once-daily doses of the high-dose formulation (n = 1827), containing 25 mg of pyridoxine, 0.4 mg of cobalamin, and 2.5 mg of folic acid; or the low-dose formulation (n = 1853), containing 200 microg of pyridoxine, 6 microg of cobalamin and 20 microg of folic acid.

Main Outcome Measures

Recurrent cerebral infarction (primary outcome); coronary heart disease (CHD) events and death (secondary outcomes).

Results

Mean reduction of total homocysteine was 2 micromol/L greater in the high-dose group than in the low-dose group, but there was no treatment effect on any end point. The unadjusted risk ratio for any stroke, CHD event, or death was 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8–1.1), with chances of an event within 2 years of 18.0% in the high-dose group and 18.6% in the low-dose group. The risk of ischemic stroke within 2 years was 9.2% for the high-dose and 8.8% for the low-dose groups (risk ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8–1.3) (P = 0.80 by log-rank test of the primary hypothesis of difference in ischemic stroke between treatment groups). There was a persistent and graded association between baseline total homocysteine level and outcomes. A 3- micromol/L lower total homocysteine level was associated with a 10% lower risk of stroke (P = 0.05), a 26% lower risk of CHD events (P < .001), and a 16% lower risk of death (P = 0.001) in the low-dose group and a nonsignificantly lower risk in the high-dose group by 2% for stroke, 7% for CHD events, and 7% for death.

Conclusions

In this trial, moderate reduction of total homocysteine after nondisabling cerebral infarction had no effect on vascular outcomes during the 2 years of follow-up. However, the consistent findings of an association of total homocysteine with vascular risk suggests that further exploration of the hypothesis is warranted and longer trials in different populations with elevated total homocysteine may be necessary.

### Homocysteine, B-vitamin supplementation, and stroke prevention: from observational to interventional trials [^116fh5fa]. The Lancet: Neurology (2004). Medium credibility.

Background

Homocysteine is an amino acid, the metabolism of which is linked to that of several vitamins-especially folic acid, B6, and B12. A high concentration of homocysteine in the plasma is linked to vascular disease, including stroke. Concentrations of homocysteine can be inexpensively and safely lowered by treatment with a combination of folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6. However, whether the association between high plasma concentrations of homocysteine and vascular disease is causal is unclear.

Recent Developments

Two studies have assessed the relation between dietary or supplementary B vitamin intake on the risk of stroke. In a prospective observational study of 43?732 healthy men, there was an inverse relation between dietary folate intake and the risk of ischaemic stroke. The Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention study (VISP) was the first large-scale randomised interventional study that investigated the lowering of homocysteine concentrations with B vitamins in patients with ischaemic stroke. There was an association between baseline homocysteine concentrations and vascular risk in this trial. Plasma concentrations of homocysteine were only modestly reduced by high-dose versus low-dose formulation, and there was no treatment effect on recurrent stroke, coronary events, or deaths. Limitations of VISP included that only patients with mild increases in baseline homocysteine concentrations were studied, only modest reductions of homocysteine concentrations were achieved, and follow up was short. In addition, fortification of food with folate and treatment of low vitamin-B12 concentrations may have masked the effect of treatment on stroke risk. WHAT NEXT? When exposure can be safely assigned at random, as in the case of B-vitamin therapy, randomised trials should be the standard proof to determine the effect of therapy. The results of the first randomised clinical trial of B vitamins for secondary prevention of stroke were neutral. Larger trials with longer follow-up, selection of patients with higher plasma concentrations of homocysteine, and systematic assessment of cognitive functions and dementia are needed. In the meantime, homocysteine-lowering treatment that is cheap and well-tolerated should be considered a rational approach in patients at high risk of stroke and high concentrations of homocysteine.

### Health effects of vitamin and mineral supplements [^116KB8Ka]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Do supplements protect against non-communicable diseases?

It remains controversial whether supplements are effective in reducing the risk of non-communicable diseases. In contrast to results of observational studies, the accumulated evidence from randomised controlled trials does not support benefits of supplements in reducing risks of cardiovascular disease, cancer, or type 2 diabetes in healthy people with no clinical nutritional deficiencies.

Cardiovascular disease

An updated systematic review of 15 randomised trials published after the 2013 US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) reviewconfirmed the lack of benefits of supplements on cardiovascular events, mostly among patients with risk factors. Although randomised trials of folic acid, alone or in combination with vitamins B 12 or B 6, found significant reductions in plasma homocysteine levels, total cardiovascular events were not reduced. Another systematic review reported a reduced risk of stroke in association with supplementation of homocysteine lowering B vitamins, but the result was largely driven by one large trial in China. Overall, there is no consistent evidence to support the use of antioxidant supplements for reducing cardiovascular risk.

The Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), one of the few randomised trials of supplements for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, found no effect of vitamin D supplementation (2000 IU/day) on its primary endpoint (myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death) in healthy people. Previous large scale trials such as the Women's Health Initiative Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation Studyand the Vitamin D Assessment Studyalso showed vitamin D supplements, alone or in combination with calcium, had no effect on cardiovascular risk.

Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids (1 g/day) did not reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events among healthy people in the VITAL trial. However, benefits were found for some secondary endpoints such as total myocardial infarctions. This result is largely consistent with findings from meta-analyses that fish oil supplementation did not have substantial effects on the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, a meta-analysis including the most recent trials reported a significant reduction in risk of myocardial infarction. Further studies are needed to determine whether fish oil supplementation has a greater effect on risk of heart disease than of stroke.

### Homocysteine lowering and cardiovascular events after acute myocardial infarction [^111drmZY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

Homocysteine is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We evaluated the efficacy of homocysteine-lowering treatment with B vitamins for secondary prevention in patients who had had an acute myocardial infarction.

Methods

The trial included 3749 men and women who had had an acute myocardial infarction within seven days before randomization. Patients were randomly assigned, in a two-by-two factorial design, to receive one of the following four daily treatments: 0.8 mg of folic acid, 0.4 mg of vitamin B12, and 40 mg of vitamin B6; 0.8 mg of folic acid and 0.4 mg of vitamin B12; 40 mg of vitamin B6; or placebo. The primary end point during a median follow-up of 40 months was a composite of recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden death attributed to coronary artery disease.

Results

The mean total homocysteine level was lowered by 27 percent among patients given folic acid plus vitamin B12, but such treatment had no significant effect on the primary end point (risk ratio, 1.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.93 to 1.25; P = 0.31). Also, treatment with vitamin B6 was not associated with any significant benefit with regard to the primary end point (relative risk of the primary end point, 1.14; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.98 to 1.32; P = 0.09). In the group given folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6, there was a trend toward an increased risk (relative risk, 1.22; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.50; P = 0.05).

Conclusions

Treatment with B vitamins did not lower the risk of recurrent cardiovascular disease after acute myocardial infarction. A harmful effect from combined B vitamin treatment was suggested. Such treatment should therefore not be recommended. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00266487.).

### Rationale and design of the folic acid for vascular outcome reduction in transplantation (FAVORIT) trial [^114EmQ3R]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic kidney disease, including kidney transplant recipients, are at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In addition to the constellation of traditional CVD risk factors in chronic kidney disease, elevated total homocysteine (tHcy) is notably more prevalent among the general population. The Folic Acid for Vascular Outcome Reduction In Transplantation (FAVORIT) trial is designed to evaluate whether lowering tHcy using vitamin supplementation reduces CVD events in renal transplant recipients.

Methods

FAVORIT is a multicenter double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants are clinically stable renal transplant recipients who are 6 months or longer posttransplant with elevated tHcy. Patients are randomized to a multivitamin that includes either a high-dose or low-dose of folic acid (5 or 0 mg), vitamin B6 (50 or 1.4 mg), and vitamin B12 (1000 or 2 microg). The primary end point is a composite of incident or recurrent CVD outcomes, that is, coronary heart, cerebrovascular, or abdominal aortic/lower extremity arterial events. A sample size of 4000 is estimated to provide 87% power to detect a 20% treatment effect. Recruitment is expected to continue until July 2006, with follow-up through June 2010.

Results

From August 2002 through December 2004, 2234 of the target 4000 patients were enrolled. In accordance with trial design, mean (SD) screening tHcy was elevated (17.4 ± 6.2 micromol/L), and mean (SD) estimated creatinine clearance was consistent with stable renal function (58.0 ± 18.6 mL/min). Evaluating baseline results to date, 42% of the randomized participants had a history of diabetes mellitus, and 21% had prevalent CVD.

Conclusions

The FAVORIT trial is designed with sufficient power and follow-up time to detect a clinically relevant change in CVD risk between renal transplant recipients receiving a high or low tHcy-lowering folic acid multivitamin. Preliminary screening and baseline data support the trial's objectives.

### Effect of homocysteine lowering on mortality and vascular disease in advanced chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease: a randomized controlled trial [^1171QhEV]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

High plasma homocysteine levels are a risk factor for mortality and vascular disease in observational studies of patients with chronic kidney disease. Folic acid and B vitamins decrease homocysteine levels in this population but whether they lower mortality is unknown.

Objective

To determine whether high doses of folic acid and B vitamins administered daily reduce mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Double-blind randomized controlled trial (2001–2006) in 36 US Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. Median follow-up was 3.2 years for 2056 participants aged 21 years or older with advanced chronic kidney disease (estimated creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min) (n = 1305) or end-stage renal disease (n = 751) and high homocysteine levels (≥ 15 micromol/L).

Intervention

Participants received a daily capsule containing 40 mg of folic acid, 100 mg of pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), and 2 mg of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) or a placebo.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, amputation of all or part of a lower extremity, a composite of these 3 plus all-cause mortality, time to initiation of dialysis, and time to thrombosis of arteriovenous access in hemodialysis patients.

Results

Mean baseline homocysteine level was 24.0 micromol/L in the vitamin group and 24.2 micromol/L in the placebo group. It was lowered 6.3 micromol/L (25.8%; P < .001) in the vitamin group and 0.4 micromol/L (1.7%; p = 0.14) in the placebo group at 3 months, but there was no significant effect on mortality (448 vitamin group deaths vs 436 placebo group deaths) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.91–1.18). No significant effects were demonstrated for secondary outcomes or adverse events: there were 129 MIs in the vitamin group vs 150 for placebo (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.67–1.08), 37 strokes in the vitamin group vs 41 for placebo (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.58–1.40), and 60 amputations in the vitamin group vs 53 for placebo (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.79–1.64). In addition, the composite of MI, stroke, and amputations plus mortality (P = 0.85), time to dialysis (P = 0.38), and time to thrombosis in hemodialysis patients (P = 0.97) did not differ between the vitamin and placebo groups.

Conclusion

Treatment with high doses of folic acid and B vitamins did not improve survival or reduce the incidence of vascular disease in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.

### Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114TgdkF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Summary of Main Results

In this meta‐analysis we found a modest benefit of 10% reduced risk of stroke with folic acid supplementation compared with the control group. Folic acid supplementation also showed a small but significant benefit or 4% less risk of overall CVD events, with significant heterogeneity according to baseline folate levels, preexisting diseases, or the extent of homocysteine reduction. No significant benefit or harm of folic acid supplementation on the risk of incident CHD was found.

Comparison With Other Meta‐Analyses or Reviews

Compared with the most recent systematic reviews of folic acid supplementation and CVD risk, 20, 23, 52 we included 3 new trials 24, 25, 26 published during the 2013–2015 period and conducted in 4 countries with 22 510 more participants. Consequently, our comprehensive meta‐analysis summarized the most up‐to‐date evidence. In addition, different from previous meta‐analyses, we included all RCTs of folic acid supplementation and CVD without restrictions on the study sample size, treatment period, or preexisting disease status; however, we conducted stratified analyses to fully consider the impact of these factors on the intervention effect.

Folic acid supplementation significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 18% in a meta‐analysis in 2007 based on 8 RCTs with at least 10 stroke cases in each group and at least 6 months of follow‐up. 22 After that, with more RCTs published, 10 more meta‐analyses of folic acid supplementation and risk of stroke were published with different inclusion criteria. 20, 21, 23, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 Although all of these meta‐analyses suggested a potential beneficial effect of folic acid supplementation on stroke (RRs ranged from 0.82 to 0.96), 20, 21, 23, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 none reached statistical significance, making the findings less conclusive. The results of our meta‐analysis based on 20 RCTs provided similar results and extended the findings of previous meta‐analyses, indicating a 10% significantly lower risk of stroke with folic acid supplementation.

### Effect of homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid and B vitamins on risk of type 2 diabetes in women: a randomized, controlled trial [^115VqHBo]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Homocysteinemia has been recognized as a vascular risk factor for diabetic angiopathy, whereas few human data are currently available on the relation between homocysteine levels and risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In observational studies, homocysteine levels in nondiabetic individuals have been positively correlated with several biomarkers of insulin resistance and/or glucose intolerance in some but not all studies. In a 4-year prospective cohort study, elevated levels of homocysteine were independently associated with a 3.6-fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes among 170 women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus. These observations not only provided suggestive evidence linking elevated levels of homocysteine to the development of type 2 diabetes but also led to the suggestion that lowering homocysteine levels may prevent or reduce risk of type 2 diabetes.

Dietary folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 are the most important modifiable determinants of homocysteine levels, and adequate intake of B vitamins may be potentially beneficial for prevention of type 2 diabetes in the general population. However, no previous prospective cohort studies have specifically examined intakes of individual B vitamins and diabetes risk. Some small and short-term randomized trials for secondary prevention of diabetes complications have been conducted but yielded inconsistent results; some reported that folic acid supplementation (5–10 mg/day) reduced oxidative stress and improved endothelial function in diabetic patients during a period of 2–12 weeks. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous randomized clinical trials assessing the efficacy of B vitamin supplements for primary prevention of type 2 diabetes. In a large cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention trial, the Women's Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study (WAFACS), we specifically examined the homocysteine-lowering effect by daily supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 on the risk of type 2 diabetes in women at high risk for CVD.

### Update on the NCEP ATP-III emerging cardiometabolic risk factors [^111wnTfU]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Presently, no data exist to confirm that lowering lipoprotein (a) reduces CVD risk; however, lipoprotein (a) can be reduced by niacin, mipomersen, LDL apheresis, cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, and estrogens. Of interest, estrogens may confer benefit on CVD events in post-menopausal women with the highest quintile of lipoprotein (a). A major problem with interpretation of any studies using these medications is that variably other lipoproteins are also altered favorably. The anti-sense oligonucleotide from ISIS may be necessary before the independent effect of lipoprotein (a) lowering is realized.

Homocysteine

Hyperhomocysteinemia can be as a result of deficiencies of vitamin B6, folic acid or vitamin B12 or due to a rare genetic enzyme defect. Hyperhomocysteinemia was first associated with CVD risk as it relates to the rare autosomal recessive disorder, homocystinuria. Individuals with homocystinuria have markedly elevated levels of plasma homocysteine and have a very high risk of CVD if untreated. While the mechanisms are not clearly elucidated, it appears that homocysteinemia is associated with endothelial dysfunction and increased thrombosis. Furthermore, observational studies, both retrospective and prospective, have shown that even moderate elevations in homocysteine, even within the normal range, are also associated with a higher risk of CVD. A number of clinical trials have since been published examining the effects of folic acid/B vitamin supplementation on preventing CVD events. These studies have been done in individuals of moderate to very high risk of CVD events and, while homocysteine levels are reduced with folic acid/B vitamin supplementation, none of these studies has shown a benefit in clinical CVD outcomes. Clarke and colleagues recently published a meta-analysis of these outcome trials. They included eight trials comprising a total of 37,485 individuals and found that lowering homocysteine levels by about 25% for a mean of five years was not associated with significant beneficial effects on CVD events. Specifically, no benefit was seen in major CVD events (HR 1.01, CI 0.97 to 1.05), major coronary events (HR 1.03, CI 0.97 to 1.10), stroke (HR 0.96, CI 0.87 to 1.06), or all-cause mortality (HR 1.00, CI 0.85 to 1.18). The available evidence, therefore, does not support the routine use of folic acid/B vitamin supplementation to prevent cardiovascular disease or improve overall survival, and as such there are no official recommendations for routine testing for homocysteine.

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^114UexJN]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Homocysteine-lowering therapy in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) — prevalence, effect of vitamin therapy, and outcome evidence — is summarized as follows: Approximately 30% of patients with PAD have elevated homocysteine compared with 1% in the general population, and folic acid and cobalamin (vitamin B12) reduce serum homocysteine levels by 25% and 7%, respectively. However, there are no data demonstrating that lowering homocysteine reduces adverse cardiovascular events; pending trial results, treating hyperhomocysteinemia with folic acid to reduce serum levels to < 10 μmol/L is generally safe and well tolerated but is of no proven benefit.

### Homocysteine, neurodegenerative biomarkers, and APOE ε 4 in neurodegenerative diseases [^113dZmSJ]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Homocysteine (Hcy) is a non‐proteinogenic sulfur‐containing amino acid produced in the course of biological methylation reactions, which involve vitamins such as B9 (folate) and B12 (cobalamin). Elevated Hcy levels are a cardiovascular risk factor, being associated with atherosclerotic disease, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease (CVD). The concentrations of Hcy vary depending on age and sex, generally increasing after between 40 to 50 years of age and generally being higher in males than in females.

Elevated Hcy levels have also been associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), although precise mechanisms are not known. It has been proposed that Hcy may promote endothelial dysfunction and loss of blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity, resulting in the development of cerebral small vessel disease and leading to neurodegeneration. Other potential neurodegenerative mechanisms include post‐translational modification of proteins via homocysteinylation, promoting oxidative stress, causing neuroinflammation, and direct neurotoxicity via activation of glutamate receptors. Furthermore, studies on Hcy and brain atrophy suggest that Hcy may be associated with neurodegeneration in healthy individuals. Post mortem studies further indicated that Hcy was associated with increased AD pathology, especially in the presence of CVD pathology. Supplementation of vitamins B6 (pyridoxine), B9, and B12 lowers Hcy levels as these vitamins act as cofactors in the reactions that convert Hcy into other sulfur‐containing amino acids, thus providing a straightforward method of treating hyperhomocysteinemia.

### New evidence for homocysteine lowering for management of treatment-resistant hypertension [^114uuQb3]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

THE CONTROVERSY

As early as 2002, papers recommending the reduction of plasma homocysteine levels as an approach to managing treatment-resistant hypertension appeared in the literature. Shortly afterwards, studies criticizing the efficacy of folic acid for homocysteine reduction to prevent death from cardiovascular disease and stroke were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), leading to general skepticism of the value of this treatment for cardiovascular and neurovascular disease. In fact, as Spence has noted, Bonaa, at the 2005 meeting of the European Society for Cardiology, essentially proclaimed that there was no future for homocysteine and vitamin research, i.e. that this research was dead. However, Bonaa's pronouncement, and its flawed interpretation, continue to meet with many objections.

Spence, in a landmark editorial, declared that the funeral for homocysteine lowering treatment is premature. We agree. Lowering homocysteine does not currently receive the attention it deserves for treatment-resistant hypertension.

A recent review by Smith and Refsum summarized the major problems with antifolate argument, which argues against the efficacy of homocysteine reduction: (i) the study periods were too short; (ii) the studies were limited to individuals with preexisting vascular disease; (iii) homocysteine levels were often estimated rather than measured and insufficiently lowered; and (iv) positive outcomes of stroke prevention were a priori discounted and downplayed.

In addition to taking issue with studies arguing against efficacy of homocysteine, Smith and Refsum muster an impressive array of papers indicating that supplements, with sufficient amounts of nondietary sourced vitamins B2, B6, folate, and B12 are associated with lowering of homocysteine levels safely, and that this is associated with reduction of adverse cardiovascular and neurologic events, as well as improved cognitive performance in the cognitively impaired.

### Vitamin supplementation can markedly reduce the homocysteine elevation induced by fenofibrate [^114iDSc4]. Atherosclerosis (2001). Low credibility.

Elevated homocysteine concentrations are a risk factor for atherosclerotic disease. Recently it was reported that lipid lowering with fibrates increases homocysteine by up to 40%. Since elevated homocysteine concentrations can readily be lowered by vitamin supplementation, a randomized, double-blind crossover study was performed to investigate the effect of fenofibrate plus folic acid, vitamin B6 and B12 versus fenofibrate plus placebo in hyperlipidemic men. The crossover study comprised a run-in period of 6 weeks, a first treatment phase of 6 weeks, a washout phase of 8 weeks and a second treatment phase of 6 weeks. Vitamins were given at doses of 650 microg folic acid, 50 microg vitamin B12 and 5 mg vitamin B6 per day for a period of 6 weeks. After fenofibrate plus placebo the increase in homocysteine concentration was 44 ± 47%. After fenofibrate plus vitamins it was 13 ± 25%, being significantly lower than without vitamins. The increase in homocysteine in response to fenofibrate may counteract the cardioprotective effect of lipid lowering. The addition of vitamins involved in homocysteine metabolism can prevent most of the homocysteine increase seen after fenofibrate plus placebo. Addition of these vitamins to fenofibrate may therefore be warranted for routine use.

### No effect of B vitamins on ADMA levels in patients at increased cardiovascular risk [^1121PjbX]. Clinical Endocrinology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a recently identified potent cardiovascular risk factor. ADMA levels are increased in hyperhomocysteinaemia and the metabolism of ADMA is linked with that of homocysteine in several ways. Treatment with B vitamins effectively reduces homocysteine levels, but studies investigating the effect on ADMA levels are scarce and show conflicting results. In this study we evaluated the effect of treatment with B vitamins on ADMA levels in two high cardiovascular risk populations.

Methods

In study I, 110 siblings of patients with clinical atherosclerotic disease and postmethionine hyperhomocysteinaemia were treated with 5 mg of folic acid and 250 mg of pyridoxine or placebo, and were analysed after 1 year. In study II, 41 patients with type 2 diabetes and mild hyperhomocysteinaemia were analysed after 6 months treatment with 5 mg of folic acid or placebo.

Results

A correlation between baseline homocysteine and ADMA levels was found, which was partly due to confounding by renal function. Homocysteine levels decreased by 43% in study I and by 28% in study II. In both studies, treatment with B vitamins had no effect at all on ADMA, arginine/ADMA ratio and SDMA levels. This result was confirmed in multiple linear regression analyses with adjustment for baseline values and gender.

Conclusions

Our studies indicate that B vitamins, despite causing a substantial reduction in plasma homocysteine levels, have no beneficial effect on ADMA levels.

### Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111a6qn9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

McCully postulated in 1969 that homocysteine affected atherosclerotic processes. 1 Since that time, prospective observations and genetic studies have suggested a causal role of blood homocysteine in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Observational studies indicated that for each 5‐μmol/L rise in serum homocysteine levels, there was a 32% increased risk of ischemic heart diseases and a 59% increased risk of stroke. 4 The potential causal role of homocysteine in CVD was supported by Mendelian randomization studies using the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), an enzyme involved in homocysteine metabolism, as an instrumental variable. Compared with people who were homozygous for the wild‐type allele (CC) of MTHFR, those who were homozygous for the mutant allele (TT) had 1.93‐μmol/L 5 or 25% 6 higher homocysteine concentrations, a 26% higher risk of stroke, 5 and a 16% higher risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). 6

Evidence from these studies provided the rationale for conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of folic acid supplementation and CVD prevention, given that supplementation with folic acid is an inexpensive and effective method of lowering blood homocysteine concentrations. 7, 8 The introduction in 1998 of mandatory fortification of enriched cereal grain products with folic acid in North America, with the original impetus to reduce the occurrence of neural tube birth defects, 9 was associated with a significant reduction of the mean homocysteine concentration by ≈7% in middle‐aged and older adults. 7 RCTs documented that daily dietary supplementation with 0.5 to 5 mg folic acid reduced plasma homocysteine concentrations by ≈25%. 8

The inconsistent results of the effects of folic acid supplementation on CVD risk called into question the causal relationship between increased homocysteine and CVD risk. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Several meta‐analyses of RCTs have been conducted to summarize the available evidence, but the pooled results have been inconclusive. 20, 21, 22, 23 With the recent publications of several new RCTs, 24, 25, 26 we performed a meta‐analysis of RCTs to quantify the relationship between folic acid supplementation and CVD risk.

### Folic acid effect on homocysteine, sortilin levels and glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients [^115qtMEQ]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is one of the extremely common chronic ailments in nearly all countries and major health care problem worldwide.

Multiple risk factors have been recognized as potential contributors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in diabetic patients including hyperglycemia, elevated glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and smoking.

In addition to these factors, it is known that elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels can be associated with cardiovascular disease and increased atherosclerosis risk, peripheral vascular disease, ischemic heart disease, and stroke.

In diabetic patients, hyperhomocysteinemia is correlated with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and poor control of the disease. Hyperhomocysteinemia results in the worsening of T2DM by induction of reversible β-islet cell dysfunction and insulin secretion inhibition. Levels of circulating Hcy are raised in patients with T2DM in contrast to non-diabetic individuals.

Folic acid is an essential factor in determining plasma Hcy concentrations. Therefore, folic acid supplementation (FAS) lowers the Hcy level by increasing the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate intracellular pool, which may improve the overall management of diabetic patients and may decrease cardiovascular events. Hcy level may be a useful predictor of end-organ damage, including cardiac, carotid, and renal diseases, in newly diagnosed T2DM patients.

Insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction, poor glucose tolerance, and mitochondrial dysfunction have all been linked to oxidative stress. Because of its antioxidant capabilities, the folic acid treatment improved the glycemic profile significantly. Inflammation is linked to the development of insulin resistance. Proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and IL-6 have been shown to affect insulin signaling, which can lead to insulin resistance. FAS has also been shown to reduce NF-kB activity, which inhibits the proinflammatory process.

### Modification of vitamin B6 on the associations of blood lead levels and cardiovascular diseases in the US adults [^115Wbfvi]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death in the US population. Lead exposure is an important risk factor of CVDs, as is associated with elevated homocysteine level and oxidative stress. We aim to examine whether vitamin B6, which has been shown to reduce homocysteine level, can modify the relationship between blood lead and the risk of CVDs.

Methods

Cross-sectional data on ever-report CVDs (congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, heart attack and stroke), blood lead level (BLL) and vitamin B6 in the form of plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate were obtained from US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2006 for adults ≥ 20 years old. The association between CVDs and quartiles of BLL was estimated using multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for demographics factors, lifestyle variables, stress variables, comorbidities and CVD biomarkers (C reactive protein, homocysteine, cholesterol) and was stratified by vitamin B6 deficiency level (< 20 nmol/L) and median value of vitamin B6 (42.5 nmol/L).

Results

Positive associations between BLL and CVDs only appeared in the vitamin B6 deficiency group, with quartile 2 to quartile 4 of BLL showing higher risk of CVDs (OR = 3.1, 95% CI 0.9 to 10.6; OR = 6.5, 95% CI 1.4 to 30.8; OR = 5.5, 95% CI 1.4 to 21.7) compared with quartile 1. When stratified by median value of vitamin B6, a significant association between higher CVD risk with higher BLL was only observed in subjects with low vitamin B6 (p trend = 0.004).

Conclusions

Vitamin B6 could modify the association between BLL and CVDs, which suggests a potential value of vitamin B6 in influencing the effects of lead exposure on the cardiovascular system.

### Homocysteine levels and treatment effect in the PROspective study of pravastatin in the elderly at risk [^116WZ6Zr]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of cardiovascular risk management is to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events in high-risk populations. Clinical cardiovascular risk scores, such as the Framingham Risk Scoreand the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE), are used worldwide to select those with high cardiovascular risk, but their accuracy to predict risk of cardiovascular outcomes declines with advancing age.–Because the prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) increases exponentially with age,–some have suggested that preventive treatment be offered to everyone over a specified age without measuring other risk factors, but others emphasize the need for risk stratification in old age. Recently, the Leiden 85-plus Study (and others) showed that homocysteine is predictive of cardiovascular events in old age.–

Because risk predictors are clinically meaningful only when effective preventive treatment is available, which treatment possibilities exist (and are appropriate) for older persons with high homocysteine to lower their cardiovascular risk needs to be established. Large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses show that lowering plasma homocysteine using treatment with folate has no beneficial effect on the incidence of cardiovascular events. The PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER)has shown that pravastatin lowers the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in older people in general, but not the risk of fatal or nonfatal stroke. The current study was designed to determine whether older persons with high homocysteine levels would benefit more from this conventional preventive treatment than those with lower levels.

A post hoc subanalysis was performed in PROSPER (a large double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial) to assess the effect of pravastatin on CHD risk and mortality in older persons, stratified according to plasma level of homocysteine.

### Effects of lowering homocysteine levels with B vitamins on cardiovascular disease, cancer, and cause-specific mortality: meta-analysis of 8 randomized trials involving 37 485 individuals… [^111SgfHY]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Elevated plasma homocysteine levels have been associated with higher risks of cardiovascular disease, but the effects on disease rates of supplementation with folic acid to lower plasma homocysteine levels are uncertain. Individual participant data were obtained for a meta-analysis of 8 large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of folic acid supplementation involving 37 485 individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Dietary supplementation with folic acid to lower homocysteine levels had no significant effects within 5 years on cardiovascular events or on overall cancer or mortality in the populations studied. eg, 15 vs 10 μmol/L) was associated with a 70% higher risk of CHD. 2 Subsequently, however, prospective cohort studies of homocysteine reported more modest associations.

3, 4 In 2002, a collaborative meta-analysis involving individual data from prospective studies reported that, after adjustment for known cardiovascular risk factors, a 25%-lower usual plasma total homocysteine level was associated with an 11% lower risk of CHD and 19% lower risk of stroke.
4. In patients with homocystinuria, supplementation with B vitamins has been shown to lower homocysteine levels and the risk of CVD. 5, 6 A meta-analysis of randomized trials found that, in populations without folic acid fortification, supplementation with folic acid lowered homocysteine levels by 23. Investigators were also asked to confirm summary data for each treatment group on the number of randomized patients; on plasma levels of total homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B12 before and after starting treatment; and on the numbers of patients who developed each of the predefined outcomes.

All events were prespecified and defined using standard criteria in the protocol for this meta-analysis. 21 The main outcomes were major vascular events, cancer incidence, and total and cause-specific mortality. The doses of folic acid ranged from 0. 8 to
5. 0 mg/d, except in 1 trial that used 40. 0 mg/d. 12 All but 1 trial8 added vitamin B12 to the folic acid, and all but 28, 15 also added vitamin B6.

### The effect of homocysteine-lowering therapy with folic acid on flow-mediated vasodilation in patients with coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112TXPZt]. Atherosclerosis (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

High level of homocysteine induces injury of endothelial cells and predicts adverse cardiovascular events. The objective was to assess the effect of homocysteine-lowering therapy with folic acid on flow-mediated vasodilation in patients with coronary artery disease.

Methods and Results

We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials identified from PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library. Eight studies were included. Homocysteine-lowering therapy with folic acid in patients with coronary artery disease significantly improve FMD as compared with placebo using random-effect model (SMD = 1.65 with 95% CI 1.12–2.17, p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis of subjects revealed that lipid-lowering therapy, study duration, and Delphi criteria had no effects on FMD.

Conclusion

Our meta-analysis demonstrated that folic acid supplementation can significantly improve endothelial dysfunction as assessed by FMD in the brachial artery in patients with coronary heart disease.

### Effect of homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid and B vitamins on risk of type 2 diabetes in women: a randomized, controlled trial [^114HJZF1]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

Homocysteinemia may play an etiologic role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes by promoting oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. We investigated whether homocysteine-lowering treatment by B vitamin supplementation prevents the risk of type 2 diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The Women's Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study (WAFACS), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 5,442 female health professionals aged ≥ 40 years with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or three or more CVD risk factors, included 4,252 women free of diabetes at baseline. Participants were randomly assigned to either an active treatment group (daily intake of a combination pill of 2.5 mg folic acid, 50 mg vitamin B6, and 1 mg vitamin B12) or to the placebo group.

RESULTS

During a median follow-up of 7.3 years, 504 women had an incident diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Overall, there was no significant difference between the active treatment group and the placebo group in diabetes risk (relative risk 0.94 [95% CI 0.79–1.11]; P = 0.46), despite significant lowering of homocysteine levels. Also, there was no evidence for effect modifications by baseline intakes of dietary folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12. In a sensitivity analysis, the null result remained for women compliant with their study pills (0.92 [0.76–1.10]; P = 0.36).

CONCLUSIONS

Lowering homocysteine levels by daily supplementation with folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 did not reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes among women at high risk for CVD.

### The effect of folic acid based homocysteine lowering on cardiovascular events in people with kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116SeK1u]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Impact of background fortification on homocysteine lowering

The relative risk of cardiovascular events was 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.02) in trials where controls had no exposure to folic acid based regimens, compared with 0.99 (0.93 to 1.06) in trials where controls did have some level of exposure, either through fortification or through comparator treatment. The difference was not significant (P = 0.24 for heterogeneity). The individual patient data meta-analysis of eight large trials found that folic acid based therapy had no impact on major vascular events, whether administered against a background of fortification (relative risk 0.99 99% confidence interval 0.90 to 1.09) or not (1.02, 0.96 to 1.09). Short of further randomised trials, individual patient level data analysis of participants in all homocysteine lowering trials according to kidney disease status may increase analysis power providing greater clarity.

Strengths and limitations of the review

The strengths of this systematic review are its rigorous methodology, the importance of the clinical question, and the clear result. The findings have direct implications for the management of hundreds of millions of people with kidney disease around the world, including millions receiving dialysis for end stage kidney disease, many of whom are currently taking folic acid supplements. Limitations include the reliance on tabular data rather than individual patient level data. Some studies used different definitions for the primary outcome of cardiovascular events, although this did not seem to meaningfully impact the findings. We could only include results for people with kidney disease included in larger trials where these are reported, raising the possibility of reporting bias. However this would be expected to exaggerate any benefit and none was found. Furthermore, the definition of chronic kidney disease varied among the studies (see table).

Conclusion

In summary, folic acid based homocysteine lowering does not prevent cardiovascular events in people with kidney disease and consideration should be given to discontinuing its use for cardiovascular prevention in this population.

### Effect of homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid and B vitamins on risk of type 2 diabetes in women: a randomized, controlled trial [^115zthzR]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The WAFACS is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the effects of a combination pill of folic acid (2.5 mg/day), vitamin B6 (50 mg/day), and vitamin B12 (1 mg/day) in the secondary prevention of important vascular events among high-risk women with either a history of CVD or at least three cardiovascular risk factors. Briefly, the WAFACS began in 1998, when the folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 component was added to the Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study (WACS), an ongoing 2×2×2 factorial trial of three antioxidant vitamins (vitamins C and E and β-carotene), which expanded it to a four-group factorial trial. Details of the overall trial design and the main results from the WAFACS and WACS have been reported previously. The study was sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. The study vitamins and matching placebo were provided by BASF Corporation (Mount Olive, NJ). The trial was approved by the institutional review board of Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, MA), and all patients provided written informed consent. An external independent data and safety-monitoring board monitored the safety of the participants and the overall quality and scientific integrity of the study.

### The homocysteine controversy [^1128mgtT]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia has been identified as a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease, independent from classical atherothrombotic risk factors. In the last decade, a number of large intervention trials using B vitamins have been performed and have shown no benefit of homocysteine-lowering therapy in high-risk patients. In addition, Mendelian randomization studies failed to convincingly demonstrate that a genetic polymorphism commonly associated with higher homocysteine levels (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677 C > T) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Together, these findings have cast doubt on the role of homocysteine in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis, and the homocysteine hypothesis has turned into a homocysteine controversy. In this review, we attempt to find solutions to this controversy. First, we explain that the Mendelian randomization analyses have limitations that preclude final conclusions. Second, several characteristics of intervention trials limit interpretation and generalizability of their results. Finally, the possibility that homocysteine lowering is in itself beneficial but is offset by adverse side effects of B vitamins on atherosclerosis deserves serious attention. As we explain, such side effects may relate to direct adverse effects of the B-vitamin regimen (in particular, the use of high-dose folic acid) or to proinflammatory and proproliferative effects of B vitamins on advanced atherosclerotic lesions.

### Homocysteine: a new cardiac risk factor? [^112b1pK3]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Elevated plasma homocysteine levels have recently been implicated as a new risk factor for coronary artery disease. In this article, homocysteine metabolism, secondary causes of elevated plasma homocysteine, and the potential mechanism of vascular damage in hyperhomocysteinemia are briefly reviewed. The current clinical evidence implicating hyperhomocysteinemia as a risk factor for coronary artery disease, as well as the data regarding the effects of B vitamin supplementation on homocysteine concentrations, are also reviewed. The current recommendation of the authors is to treat patients with known coronary artery disease or those who are considered to be at high risk for coronary artery disease with 400 microg of folate supplementation. Until prospective clinical trial data become available, this approach appears to be a safe and effective way to approach this patient population.

### Long-term homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid plus pyridoxine is associated with decreased blood pressure but not with improved brachial artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation or carotid artery stiffness: a 2-year, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^115ww3Rk]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2001). Low credibility.

Homocysteine is associated with atherothrombotic disease, which may be mediated through associations of homocysteine levels with blood pressure, endothelial function, or arterial stiffness. In a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, we measured blood pressure, brachial artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and common carotid artery stiffness in 158 clinically healthy siblings of patients with premature atherothrombotic disease at baseline and after 1 and 2 years of homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid (5 mg) plus pyridoxine (250 mg). Intention-to-treat analyses limited to participants (n = 130) who underwent at least 1 measurement after the baseline visit showed that compared with placebo, treatment with folic acid plus pyridoxine was associated with a 3.7-mm Hg (95% CI -6.8 to -0.6 mm Hg) lower systolic and a 1.9-mm Hg (95% CI -3.7 to -0.02 mm Hg) lower diastolic blood pressure over the 2-year trial period. Together with the decreased occurrence of abnormal exercise electrocardiography tests reported previously, our results support the hypothesis that homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid plus pyridoxine has beneficial vascular effects. Because no effects could be demonstrated on brachial artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation or on common carotid artery stiffness, the present study does not support the hypothesis that the cardiovascular effects of homocysteine are mediated through these factors, at least in clinically healthy individuals.

### Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112tvjB2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Because we included only RCTs in our meta‐analysis, our findings were unlikely to be affected by confounding factors. Other strengths included no evidence of heterogeneity and no detected publication bias. Our sensitivity analysis also showed minimal influence of any individual RCT on the combined results.

Several limitations warrant consideration. First, like any meta‐analysis, our findings may be constrained by the methodological rigor of the included studies. Although we assessed publication bias of the overall analysis with a funnel plot test, we could not completely exclude publication bias. Second, the included trials varied with respect to the characteristics of participants, the duration and intensity of treatment, and other design features; however, our stratified analyses and meta‐regression analyses did not identify any factors that would have influenced the summary estimates of the meta‐analysis. Third, the definitions of the CVD outcomes were somewhat heterogeneous in the selected trials, and that may influence the interpretation of the results; however, we examined the effect of folic acid supplementation on stroke and CHD separately, although there was no sufficient power to examine subtypes of stroke or CHD.

Compliance with treatment could be an important determinant of the outcome of RCTs. Although extent of homocysteine reduction could serve as a surrogate biomarker for the compliance of folic acid supplementation, not all RCTs provided data on homocysteine changes. Among a subgroup of RCTs with data of homocysteine changes, however, we observed a stronger intervention effect on CVD when the magnitude of homocysteine reduction was greater. Because the meta‐analysis was based on the result at the study level instead of individual data, we could not evaluate the intervention effects according to individual homocysteine change or treatment compliance. We found a dose‐response relationship between homocysteine reduction by folic acid supplementation and a reduction in risk of CVD but not of stroke. The lack of a dose‐response relationship between degree of homocysteine reduction and risk of stroke may not support a causal link between folic acid supplementation and stroke. A potential reason for the nonlinear relationship between homocysteine reduction and reduction in stroke risk could be related to threshold effects of high homocysteine levels on risk of stroke; a previous observational study observed significantly increased risk of stroke only in the group with serum homocysteine > 18.6 mmol/L (upper quintile). 68

### Effect of homocysteine-lowering therapy with folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 on clinical outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention: the Swiss heart study: a randomized controlled trial [^112NK4ds]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Plasma homocysteine level has been recognized as an important cardiovascular risk factor that predicts adverse cardiac events in patients with established coronary atherosclerosis and influences restenosis rate after percutaneous coronary intervention.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of homocysteine-lowering therapy on clinical outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial involving 553 patients referred to the University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland, from May 1998 to April 1999 and enrolled after successful angioplasty of at least 1 significant coronary stenosis (≥ 50%).

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned to receive a combination of folic acid (1 mg/d), vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin, 400 micro g/d), and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride, 10 mg/d) (n = 272) or placebo (n = 281) for 6 months.

Main Outcome Measure

Composite end point of major adverse events defined as death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and need for repeat revascularization, evaluated at 6 months and 1 year.

Results

After a mean (SD) follow-up of 11 (3) months, the composite end point was significantly lower at 1 year in patients treated with homocysteine-lowering therapy (15.4% vs 22.8%; relative risk [RR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48–0.96; p = 0.03), primarily due to a reduced rate of target lesion revascularization (9.9% vs 16.0%; RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40–0.97; p = 0.03). A nonsignificant trend was seen toward fewer deaths (1.5% vs 2.8%; RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.16–1.70; p = 0.27) and nonfatal myocardial infarctions (2.6% vs 4.3%; RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.24–1.51; p = 0.27) with homocysteine-lowering therapy. These findings remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounders.

Conclusion

Homocysteine-lowering therapy with folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 significantly decreases the incidence of major adverse events after percutaneous coronary intervention.

### Interventions for lowering plasma homocysteine levels in dialysis patients [^1131m6bY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

People with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) have high rates of cardiovascular events. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of homocysteine-lowering therapies have not shown reductions in cardiovascular event rates in the general population. However, people with kidney disease have higher levels of homocysteine and may have different mechanisms of cardiovascular disease. We performed a systematic review of the effect of homocysteine-lowering therapies in people with ESKD.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of established homocysteine lowering therapy (folic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin B12) on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular event rates in patients with ESKD.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 25 January 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Studies conducted in people with ESKD that reported at least 100 patient-years of follow-up and assessed the effect of therapies that are known to have homocysteine-lowering properties were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data using a standardised form. The primary outcome was cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, incident cardiovascular disease (fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary revascularisation), cerebrovascular disease (stroke and cerebrovascular revascularisation), peripheral vascular disease (lower limb amputation), venous thromboembolic disease (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), thrombosis of dialysis access, and adverse events. The effects of homocysteine-lowering therapies on outcomes were assessed with meta-analyses using random-effects models. Prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted.

Main Results

We included six studies that reported data on 2452 participants with ESKD. Interventions investigated were folic acid with or without other vitamins (vitamin B6, vitamin B12). Participants' mean age was 48 to 65 years, and proportions of male participants ranged from 50% to 98%. Homocysteine-lowering therapy probably leads to little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (4 studies, 1186 participants: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.22). There was no evidence of heterogeneity among the included studies (I² = 0%). Homocysteine-lowering therapy had little or no effect on all-cause mortality or any other of this review's secondary outcomes. All prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses demonstrated little or no difference. Reported adverse events were mild and there was no increase in the incidence of adverse events from homocysteine-lowering therapies (3 studies, 1248 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.47; I(2) = 0%). Overall, studies were assessed as being at low risk of bias and there was no evidence of publication bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Homocysteine-lowering therapies were not found to reduce mortality (cardiovascular and all-cause) or cardiovascular events among people with ESKD.

### Homocysteine as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in patients treated by dialysis: a meta-analysis [^112JDMK9]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In the general population, increased homocysteine concentrations are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. However, it is not known whether this also applies to patients with end-stage renal disease.

Study Design

Meta-analysis of retrospective (11 studies including 1,506 individuals), prospective observational studies (12 studies including 1,975 individuals), and intervention trials (5 studies including 1,642 dialysis patients). Analyses were carried out separately, according to the study design.

Setting & Population

Studies of patients with end-stage renal disease treated by means of hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

Selection Criteria For Studies

Studies investigating the association between total homocysteine level and cardiovascular disease or total mortality or the influence of vitamin supplementation on cardiovascular or mortality risk.

Intervention

In intervention studies, vitamin preparations with folic acid alone or in combination with other vitamins, such as vitamin B(12) and B(6), were used.

Outcomes

In retrospective studies, cases are patients with cardiovascular diseases. Outcomes for prospective observational and intervention studies are cardiovascular events and total mortality.

Results

In retrospective studies, there was no significant overall difference in homocysteine concentrations between cases and controls (weighted mean difference in homocysteine, 2.82 micromol/L; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.22 to 7.86; P = 0.3). The pooled overall risk estimate for prospective observational studies suggests no association between homocysteine level (5-micromol/L increase) and total mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.12; P = 0.7), but there was an association with cardiovascular events (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.14; P = 0.001). In subgroup analysis of patients not receiving vitamins, an increase in homocysteine level was associated with increased mortality (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.13; P = 0.01). For intervention trials with B vitamins, there was a significant risk reduction for cardiovascular disease (relative risk, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.94; P = 0.02), but no risk reduction for total mortality or the composite end point including total mortality (relative risk, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.15; P = 0.9).

Limitations

Many studies are small, which may lead to the observed heterogeneity. Some intervention trials are neither placebo controlled nor randomized. Separate analyses for specific end points and patients treated by means of hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis were not possible.

Conclusion

Total homocysteine level may be a risk factor for cardiovascular events and total mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease not receiving vitamin supplementation or folic acid food fortification. There may be a potential for reducing cardiovascular disease in this population by folic acid supplementation.

### Pyridoxine improves endothelial function in cardiac transplant recipients [^1173e8qV]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Endothelial dysfunction is common in cardiac transplant recipients and predicts the development of transplant coronary artery disease. Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with endothelial dysfunction in the general population, is common in transplant recipients, and has been associated with transplant coronary artery disease. Thus therapy that decreases homocysteine concentrations might also improve endothelial function and decrease the risk of transplant coronary artery disease. Folate and pyridoxine are important cofactors in distinct aspects of homocysteine metabolism. The purpose of this study was to determine whether folate or pyridoxine supplementation improves endothelial function in cardiac transplant recipients.

Methods and Results

This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. We assigned 31 transplant recipients to either pyridoxine (n = 11:100 mg/day), folate (n = 12:5 mg/day), or placebo (n = 8) for 10 weeks. Fasting and post-methionine-load (methionine 100 mg/kg orally) homocysteine concentrations were determined. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation was used as a measure of endothelial function. At follow-up, we noted no significant changes in homocysteine concentrations in any of the groups. However, pyridoxine supplementation was associated with a significant improvement in endothelial function (2.8 ± 6.7 to 6.9 ± 6.3, p = 0.05). No significant changes were seen in patients treated with folate or placebo.

Conclusions

Pyridoxine, but not folate supplementation, significantly improves endothelial function in cardiac transplant recipients.

### Water-soluble vitamins in people with low glomerular filtration rate or on dialysis: a review [^113sca58]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Homocysteine and Cardiovascular and Mortality Outcomes

Because the intrinsic factor pathway is saturable and independent of intrinsic factor absorption has limited capacity, leading to the absorption of about 1% of an oral dose, intravenous therapy has the potential to raise B12 levels to a larger extent than achievable with oral therapy. It has been suggested that these pharmacologic effects may lead to more dramatic homocysteine lowering than therapeutic or near-therapeutic replacements. Intravenous hydroxycobalamin given to vitamin B12-replete patients on dialysis led to 14-fold increases in B12 and 23% reductions in homocysteine. In a randomized crossover trial, hydroxycobalamin 1 mg intravenously every 4 weeks resulted in a 40-fold increase in serum B12 levels in patients on hemodialysis, whereas cyanocobalamin levels increased 10-fold; however, reduction in homocysteine was similar with both treatments, around 33%. Oral vitamin B12 combined with folic acid and pyridoxine has been shown, in randomized controlled trials, to reduce total homocysteine levels by 30–50% in patients with low glomerular filtration rate or end-stage renal disease.

In a recent, multicenter, randomized trial, 650 patients with end-stage renal disease who had average homocysteine levels of 28.2–30.0 μmol/l were randomized to two B vitamin regimens given postdialysis. The active regimen consisted of 5 mg folic acid, 50 μg cobalamin, and 10 mg vitamin B6, whereas the placebo regimen consisted of 0.2 mg folic acid, 4 μg cobalamin, and 1 mg vitamin B6. Homocysteine levels fell significantly with active treatment (−10.4 μmol/l vs. −1.8 μmol/l). However, there was no difference in all-cause mortality (31% vs. 28%) or cardiovascular events (25% vs. 30%). Interestingly, the change in cobalamin levels from baseline was similar in both groups despite differing doses of cobalamin supplementation (100–125 pmol/l rise).

Multiple studies have demonstrated similar effects of vitamin B12 therapy on homocysteine levels and a lack of efficacy with regard to cardiovascular outcomes in patients with low glomerular filtration rate and on dialysis–.

Cognitive Effects

As in the nonrenal population, supplementation has not been shown to improve cognitive outcomes. A 1-year study involving patients with low glomerular filtration rate and patients on dialysis found that supplementation with a vitamin B complex reduced homocysteine levels in the treatment group, but had no beneficial outcomes on cognitive functioning in comparison with placebo.

### Efficacy of homocysteine-lowering therapy with folic acid in stroke prevention: a meta-analysis [^117CMh8A]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Although a lower serum homocysteine concentration is associated with a reduced risk of stroke in epidemiologic studies, randomized, controlled trials have yielded mixed findings regarding the effect of therapeutic homocysteine lowering on stroke prevention. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials to assess the efficacy of folic acid supplementation in the prevention of stroke.

Methods

Salient trials were identified by formal literature search. Relative risk (RR) with 95% CI was used as a measure of the association between folic acid supplementation and risk of stroke, after pooling data across trials in a fixed-effects model.

Results

The search identified 13 randomized, controlled trials that had enrolled 39 005 participants for folic acid therapy to reduce homocysteine in which stroke was reported as an outcome measure. Across all trials, folic acid supplementation was associated with a trend toward mild benefit that did not reach statistical significance in reducing the risk of stroke (RR = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.85–1.03; P = 0.16). The RR for nonsecondary prevention trials was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.79–0.99; P = 0.03). In stratified analyses, a greater beneficial effect was seen in the trials testing combination therapy of folic acid plus vitamins B6 and B12 (RR = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71–0.97; P = 0.02) and in the trials that disproportionately enrolled male patients (men:women > 2; RR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74–0.94; P = 0.003).

Conclusions

Folic acid supplementation did not demonstrate a major effect in averting stroke. However, potential mild benefits in primary stroke prevention, especially when folate is combined with B vitamins and in male patients, merit further investigation.

### Homocysteine-lowering trials for prevention of cardiovascular events: a review of the design and power of the large randomized trials [^116qYLVC]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12 lowers blood homocysteine concentrations by about 25% to 30% in populations without routine folic acid fortification of food and by about 10% to 15% in populations with such fortification. In observational studies, 25% lower homocysteine has been associated with about 10% less coronary heart disease (CHD) and about 20% less stroke.

Methods

We reviewed the design and statistical power of 12 randomized trials assessing the effects of lowering homocysteine with B-vitamin supplements on risk of cardiovascular disease.

Results

Seven of these trials are being conducted in populations without fortification (5 involving participants with prior CHD and 2 with prior stroke) and 5 in populations with fortification (2 with prior CHD, 2 with renal disease, and 1 with prior stroke). These trials may not involve sufficient number of vascular events or last long enough to have a good chance on their own to detect reliably plausible effects of homocysteine lowering on cardiovascular risk. But, taken together, these 12 trials involve about 52,000 participants: 32,000 with prior vascular disease in unfortified populations and 14,000 with vascular disease and 6000 with renal disease in fortified populations. Hence, a combined analysis of these trials should have adequate power to determine whether lowering homocysteine reduces the risk of cardiovascular events within just a few years.

Conclusion

The strength of association of homocysteine with risk of cardiovascular disease may be weaker than had previously been believed. Extending the duration of treatment in these trials would allow any effects associated with prolonged differences in homocysteine concentrations to emerge. Establishing a prospective meta-analysis of the ongoing trials of homocysteine lowering should ensure that reliable information emerges about the effects of such interventions on cardiovascular disease outcomes.

### Homocysteine-lowering interventions for preventing cardiovascular events [^112jmaDy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (including coronary artery disease, stroke and congestive heart failure), is a leading cause of death worldwide. Homocysteine is an amino acid with biological functions in methionine metabolism. A postulated risk factor is elevated circulating total homocysteine levels, which are associated with cardiovascular events. This is an update of a review previously published in 2009.

Objectives

To assess the clinical effectiveness of homocysteine-lowering interventions in people with or without pre-existing cardiovascular disease.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1950 to Feb week 2 2012), EMBASE (1980 to 2012 week 07), and LILACS (1986 to February 2012). We also searched ISI Web of Science (1970 to February 2012). We handsearched the reference lists of included papers. We also contacted researchers in the field. There was no language restriction in the search.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of homocysteine-lowering interventions for preventing cardiovascular events with a follow-up period of one year or longer. We considered myocardial infarction and stroke as the primary outcomes. We excluded studies in patients with end-stage renal disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction in duplicate. We estimated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using I(2). We used a random-effects model.

Main Results

In this updated systematic review, we identified four new randomised trials, resulting in a total of 12 randomised controlled trials involving 47,429 participants. In general terms, the trials had a low risk of bias. Homocysteine-lowering interventions compared with placebo did not significantly affect non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction (pooled RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10, I(2) = 0%), stroke (pooled RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.0, I(2) = 11%) or death by any cause (pooled RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.07, I(2): 6%)). Homocysteine-lowering interventions compared with placebo did not significantly affect serious adverse events (cancer) (1 RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.13; I(2) = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

This updated Cochrane review found no evidence to suggest that homocysteine-lowering interventions in the form of supplements of vitamins B6, B9 or B12 given alone or in combination should be used for preventing cardiovascular events. Furthermore, there is no evidence suggesting that homocysteine-lowering interventions are associated with an increased risk of cancer.
