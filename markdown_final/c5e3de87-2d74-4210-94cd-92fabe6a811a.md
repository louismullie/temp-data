Cough

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evaluation and management of cough, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify cough by duration and why that matters. Then, I should verify red flags and immediate safety issues. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis by duration, including special populations and exposures. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach, including when to image and when to use empiric trials. Finally, I will examine treatment principles, follow-up, and when to refer, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the foundational step: classifying cough by duration, because this anchors the differential and testing strategy. Acute cough is less than 3 weeks, subacute is 3 to 8 weeks, and chronic is more than 8 weeks; I should double-check that these thresholds align with CHEST and primary care summaries, and yes, they do, with the caveat that pediatric definitions sometimes use a 4-week threshold for chronic cough, which I will keep in mind for children [^115h3E4f] [^114z828C] [^113dD3d4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before ensuring safety. I need to screen for red flags that mandate urgent evaluation: hemoptysis, new or changing cough in smokers older than 45 years, prominent dyspnea at rest or at night, hoarseness, systemic symptoms such as fever or weight loss, recurrent pneumonia, and abnormal lung exam or chest radiograph. I should also remember to consider tuberculosis in endemic areas or high-risk populations even with a normal chest radiograph, and I must not forget COVID-19 in the right epidemiologic context [^1175Tb97] [^115LeAdp] [^117B5dj6] [^115srJRm].

> Next, I will examine acute cough, which is most often viral and self-limited. Wait, let me verify the evidence base for acute bronchitis management: guidelines consistently advise against routine antibiotics, antitussives, beta-agonists, corticosteroids, and NSAIDs for immunocompetent adults, emphasizing education on expected duration and supportive care; I should confirm that this aligns with CHEST and CDC messaging, and it does, with explicit warnings about antibiotic harms and minimal benefit [^1134dJJY] [^115JpTfU] [^117PueHE]. But wait, what if pertussis is suspected in a prolonged or paroxysmal cough? I should consider clinical features such as paroxysms, post-tussive vomiting, and inspiratory whoop, recognizing that paroxysmal cough and absence of fever are sensitive but nonspecific, whereas whoop and post-tussive vomiting are more specific; if suspected, I should test and treat to reduce transmission even if the patient is beyond the early treatment window [^111zU7JA] [^111yJXpL] [^112QvZaw].

> I will now examine subacute cough, which is commonly post-infectious. Let me think about the likely etiologies: lingering bronchial hyperresponsiveness, upper airway cough syndrome, and pertussis should be prioritized; I should confirm that guidelines suggest managing post-infectious cough supportively while reassessing for asthma, UACS, or GERD if symptoms persist, and that routine imaging is not indicated unless new red flags emerge. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to obtain a chest radiograph for all subacute cough, but I should correct that impulse; imaging is reserved for concerning features or lack of improvement, not routine in otherwise uncomplicated cases [^11552WaB].

> For chronic cough, I need to ensure I follow the classic adult algorithm in nonsmokers not on ACE inhibitors with a normal chest radiograph: upper airway cough syndrome, asthma including cough-variant asthma, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease are the four most common causes. I should double-check that this remains the cornerstone approach and that sequential, additive therapy is reasonable when more than one cause is present, which it is [^114J56zG] [^112TQUjk]. Let me verify pediatric nuances: in children, protracted bacterial bronchitis is a leading cause of chronic wet cough, and habit cough presents with a loud, barking cough that disappears during sleep; I should avoid adult-centric empiricism in children and instead tailor evaluation to pediatric etiologies and guidelines [^113dD3d4] [^114Q1znu] [^114Jz5tR].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. I need to check when imaging is warranted: for chronic cough persisting beyond 8 weeks, a chest radiograph is appropriate. If symptoms persist despite initial evaluation and empiric therapy, chest CT may be considered, but routine CT for all chronic cough is not recommended, especially when the chest radiograph and exam are normal. I should confirm this with ACR and ERS guidance, which advise CXR first and caution against routine CT [^112fGGXP] [^116axL4A] [^115K7n6U]. For adults with suspected asthma or cough-variant asthma, spirometry with bronchodilator response and, if needed, bronchoprovocation testing are appropriate. FeNO can support eosinophilic inflammation but is not diagnostic in isolation. I should confirm that GINA and CHEST endorse this pathway, and they do [^113V9MNm] [^112Fobu6]. For GERD-suspected cough, I need to remember that acid suppression alone is no longer recommended. Lifestyle measures and, in refractory cases, esophageal pH-impedance testing or swallow evaluation may be needed. I should verify that CHEST updated this stance, and yes, it did [^114vDBiZ] [^117GsJis].

> Let me consider empiric therapy and the principle of limited trials. I should confirm that guidelines support targeted empiric treatment based on the most likely etiology, with predefined response windows to confirm or refute the hypothesis; for example, a therapeutic trial of inhaled corticosteroids for suspected cough-variant asthma or UACS-directed therapy for rhinitis, with reassessment at 4 to 6 weeks, is reasonable; in children, empiric polypharmacy without supportive features is discouraged, reinforcing a diagnostic-first approach [^112TQUjk] [^116zhZPm] [^1174isjq]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with CHEST's sequential and additive strategy when multiple causes coexist, which it does [^112TQUjk].

> I need to ensure I address medication-induced cough. ACE inhibitors and, less commonly, sitagliptin can cause chronic cough. I should stop these agents for at least 4 weeks and reassess before pursuing invasive workups, documenting the trial clearly in the chart [^116zhZPm] [^114vDBiZ].

> Next, I should review follow-up and outcome assessment. I should double-check that guidelines recommend routine follow-up at 4 to 6 weeks after initial evaluation and after any empiric intervention, using validated cough severity or quality-of-life tools to quantify response; if cough persists, I should escalate evaluation or refer to a cough clinic, especially for refractory or unexplained chronic cough [^114RWfLw] [^11552WaB] [^114vDBiZ]. Let me verify that this structured follow-up reduces missed alternative diagnoses and helps close the loop on empiric trials, which is supported by CHEST algorithms [^114RWfLw].

> I will now examine special populations and exposures. In immunocompromised patients, I should maintain a lower threshold for imaging and consider opportunistic infections, including TB in endemic settings, even with a normal chest radiograph. I need to ensure the evaluation is contextualized to the immune defect and geography, as suggested by CHEST expert panels [^115PbcHt]. In pregnancy, I should avoid teratogenic imaging and prioritize ultrasound or MRI when necessary, and favor nonpharmacologic strategies for symptom control. In older adults, I should have a high suspicion for malignancy, aspiration, and medication effects. In smokers, I must consider COPD, lung cancer, and ECOPD phenotypes, using GOLD frameworks to guide exacerbation management and differential diagnosis [^111HmkaQ] [^116fHtS7].

> But wait, what if the cough remains unexplained after appropriate evaluation and therapeutic trials? I should confirm that the diagnosis of unexplained chronic cough is reserved for cases persisting beyond 8 weeks, with negative workup and failure of guideline-based treatment; in such patients, referral to a specialized cough clinic, consideration of speech therapy, and carefully selected neuromodulator trials may be appropriate, recognizing the concept of cough hypersensitivity syndrome [^1139hkdW] [^115Jo8Wi] [^117EKXxC].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient education and infection control are addressed. For acute viral cough, I should counsel on expected duration, avoidance of unnecessary antibiotics, and supportive measures. I should also reinforce cough hygiene to reduce transmission, particularly for pertussis, COVID-19, and influenza, aligning with public health guidance [^115JpTfU] [^113sEQYB].

> In summary, I should anchor management to duration, screen aggressively for red flags, pursue a focused differential by time course, use imaging judiciously, apply targeted empiric trials with predefined checkpoints, and embed systematic follow-up with validated tools. If I catch myself drifting toward low-yield testing or shotgun therapy, I should pause, verify alignment with guideline-based care, and recalibrate the plan accordingly [^111TB45w].

Cough is a protective reflex that clears the airways, but persistent or severe cough can signal underlying disease. Acute cough (< 3 weeks) is most often viral and self-limited, while **subacute (3–8 weeks) and chronic (> 8 weeks) cough** require structured evaluation for causes such as asthma, upper airway cough syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux, and infection (including pertussis) [^111TB45w] [^111yJXpL]. Red flags (hemoptysis, weight loss, night sweats, dyspnea, smoking history) **warrant urgent workup** [^1175Tb97]. Management is cause-specific: treat infections when confirmed, avoid routine antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^1134dJJY], and use guideline-directed therapy for asthma, UACS, or GERD [^114J56zG]; consider speech therapy for refractory cough [^114N3FZR]. Most acute cough resolves spontaneously, but chronic cough needs **targeted evaluation and follow-up** to prevent complications and improve quality of life [^112LUXdu].

---

## Classification by duration

Cough is classified by duration to guide evaluation and management [^111TB45w]:

| **Category** | **Duration** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute | < 3 weeks | Viral URIs, acute bronchitis, pneumonia, pertussis, COVID-19 [^112LUXdu] |
| Subacute | 3–8 weeks | Post-infectious cough, pertussis, upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) [^112ux3cj] |
| Chronic | > 8 weeks | Asthma, UACS, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB), chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, medication-induced (ACE inhibitors), malignancy [^114J56zG] |

---

## Common causes of cough

### Acute cough

- **Viral upper respiratory infections (URIs)**: Most common cause of acute cough [^112LUXdu].
- **Acute bronchitis**: Typically viral; antibiotics are not routinely recommended [^1134dJJY].
- **Pneumonia**: Bacterial infection requiring antibiotic therapy.
- **Pertussis**: Whooping cough, especially in unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals [^111yJXpL].
- **COVID-19**: Persistent dry cough is a common symptom [^115srJRm].

---

### Subacute cough

Subacute cough often follows a recent respiratory infection; **post-infectious cough** is common, and pertussis should be considered when cough is paroxysmal with post-tussive vomiting [^111zU7JA].

---

### Chronic cough

- **Asthma**: Cough-variant asthma presents primarily with cough [^1171qkfh].
- **Upper airway cough syndrome (UACS)**: Postnasal drip from rhinitis or sinusitis [^114J56zG].
- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Acid reflux causing chronic cough [^114yRrxS].
- **Non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB)**: Eosinophilic inflammation without asthma [^112Fobu6].
- **Chronic bronchitis**: Associated with smoking or occupational exposures [^notfound].
- **Bronchiectasis**: Chronic productive cough with recurrent infections [^114GPPkU].
- **Medication-induced cough**: ACE inhibitors are common culprits [^116zhZPm].
- **Malignancy**: Lung cancer or metastatic disease [^114sJXAC].

---

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough clinical evaluation is essential to identify the underlying cause:

- **History**: Onset, duration, character (dry vs. productive), associated symptoms (fever, wheeze, heartburn, nasal congestion), smoking history, occupational exposures, medication use (ACE inhibitors), travel history, and red flags (hemoptysis, weight loss, night sweats, dyspnea) [^112LUXdu].
- **Physical examination**: Respiratory, ENT, cardiovascular, and abdominal exams to identify signs of underlying disease [^112LUXdu].
- **Diagnostic tests**: Chest X-ray, spirometry, allergy testing, sputum analysis, esophageal pH monitoring, and imaging (CT scan) as indicated [^112fGGXP] [^115K7n6U].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **identified cause**:

- **Acute cough**: Supportive care, hydration, humidification, and antitussives if necessary. Antibiotics are not routinely recommended for acute bronchitis [^1134dJJY].
- **Subacute cough**: Address post-infectious inflammation, consider pertussis testing and treatment if suspected [^1154pf7d].
- **Chronic cough**: Treat underlying conditions (asthma, UACS, GERD, NAEB), discontinue offending medications (ACE inhibitors), and consider speech therapy for refractory cough [^114J56zG] [^114N3FZR].

---

## Potential complications

Persistent cough can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Respiratory infections**: Recurrent or chronic infections.
- **Musculoskeletal pain**: Rib fractures, muscle strain.
- **Urinary incontinence**: Particularly in women.
- **Sleep disturbance**: Fatigue, impaired quality of life.
- **Social embarrassment**: Anxiety, depression.

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis varies with the **underlying cause**. Acute cough typically resolves spontaneously, whereas chronic cough requires targeted therapy and may persist if the cause is not adequately addressed [^112LUXdu].

---

Cough is a common symptom with a broad differential; **structured evaluation by duration and cause** enables effective management and improves patient outcomes [^111TB45w].

### Chest cold (acute bronchitis) basics… [^115JpTfU]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Cough keeping you up at night. Soreness in your chest and feeling tired. You could have a chest cold, often called acute bronchitis.
- A virus usually causes chest colds.
- Antibiotics will not help you get better if you have a chest cold.
- If you're healthy without heart or lung problems or a weakened immune system, this information is for you. Overview
- A chest cold, often called acute bronchitis, occurs when the airways of the lungs swell and produce mucus in the lungs. That's what makes you cough. Signs and symptoms The most common symptom of acute bronchitis is coughing with or without mucus. Symptoms of acute bronchitis last less than 3 weeks. Other symptoms can include:

- Soreness in the chest
- Feeling tired
- Mild headache
- Mild body aches
- Sore throat. When to seek medical care
- Temperature of 100. 4 °F or higher.
- Cough with bloody mucus.
- Shortness of breath or trouble breathing.
- Symptoms that last more than 3 weeks.
- Repeated episodes of bronchitis. This list is not all-inclusive. Please see a healthcare provider for any symptom that is severe or concerning. Talk to a healthcare provider right away. Treatment Acute bronchitis usually gets better on its own — without antibiotics. When antibiotics aren't needed, they won't help you, and their side effects could still cause harm. Side effects can range from mild reactions, like a rash, to more serious health problems. These problems can include severe allergic reactions, antimicrobial-resistant infections and C. diff infection. C. diff causes diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and death. How to feel better
- Get plenty of rest.
- Drink plenty of fluids.
- Use a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer.
- Use saline nasal spray or drops to relieve a stuffy nose.
- For young children, use a rubber suction bulb to clear mucus.
- Breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water or shower.
- Use throat lozenges or cough drops.

Do not give lozenges to children younger than 4 years of age.
- Use honey to relieve cough for adults and children at least 1 year of age or older.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115L1UNf]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Cough in children 5 years and younger — features supporting asthma and differential cues: Cough due to asthma is generally non-productive, recurrent and/or persistent, and is usually accompanied by wheezing episodes and breathing difficulties, while allergic rhinitis may be associated with cough in the absence of asthma. A nocturnal cough (when the child is asleep) or a cough that occurs with exercise, laughing or crying, in the absence of an apparent respiratory infection, supports a diagnosis of asthma, though the common cold and other respiratory illnesses including pertussis are also associated with coughing. Prolonged cough in infancy, and cough without cold symptoms, are associated with later parent/caregiver-reported physician-diagnosed asthma, independent of infant wheeze, and characteristics of cough in infancy may be early markers of asthma susceptibility, particularly among children with maternal asthma.

### Methodologies for the development of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^11781PdA]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST cough guideline development framework — living guidelines and evidence grading states that CHEST has embarked on a model of creating living guidelines to continually update recommendations as new evidence, pharmacotherapies, or medical technologies become available and now uses a more rigorous approach to grading evidence resulting in the downgrading of much of the cough research in some clinical areas. Where there are insufficient levels of evidence to create recommendations based on a systematic search of the literature, consensus suggestions are developed and revised using a modified Delphi approach, and CHEST's consensus-based approach combined with the evidence-based model results in a hybrid process supported by both evidence and expertise. The 2006 guidelines called for an empirical integrated approach to the diagnosis and management of cough, proposed future directions for research, and defined two new terminologies: upper airway cough syndrome and unexplained cough.

Exacerbations of COPD

A New Definition

Exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) negatively affect health status, disease progression, and prognosis. The previous GOLD definition of ECOPD was highly non-specific ("acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy ").

Besides, the severity of ECOPD was determined post facto (mild, moderate, or severe) based on the use of healthcare resources, which is useless to guide treatment at the point of care.

To address these limitations, GOLD 2023 has adopted the recent consensus Rome proposal, which defines ECOPD as: " an event characterized by dyspnea and/or cough and sputum that worsen over ≤ 14 days, which may be accompanied by tachypnea and/or tachycardia and is often associated with increased local and systemic inflammation caused by airway infection, pollution, or other insult to the airways".

Differential Diagnosis

Patients with COPD are at increased risk of other acute events, particularly decompensated heart failure, pneumonia, and/or pulmonary embolism that may mimic or aggravate an ECOPD (Figure 8). Thus, while worsening of dyspnea, particularly if associated with cough and purulent sputum, and no other symptoms or signs in a patient with COPD, may be diagnosed as an ECOPD, other patients may have worsening of respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnea without the classic characteristics of ECOPD, that should prompt careful consideration and/or search of those potential confounders, or contributors.

### Cough-variant asthma: a review of clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and pathophysiology [^1171qkfh]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough is among the most common symptoms prompting medical care. Cough-variant asthma (CVA) is an asthma subset where cough is the primary symptom, without wheezing, chest tightness, or dyspnea. It is an important cause of chronic cough, estimated to account for 25% to 42% of cases, but likely underdiagnosed due to delayed recognition and pitfalls of diagnostic testing. Early recognition and treatment can reduce morbidity and delay its progression to more typical asthma. This review details the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of CVA and contrasts it with classic asthma and other causes of chronic cough.

### Are otolaryngologists seeing more cough? Longitudinal trends and patterns [^115sFBAQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Cough is a very common chief complaint in outpatient medicine. While typically self‐limited and benign, it can significantly affect quality of life and has been found to be the most frequent ambulatory visit complaint across all ages in the United States.

Acute cough (< 3 weeks) is most commonly caused by upper respiratory infection, while subacute cough (lasting 3‐8 weeks) could point to a lingering infection or postinfectious inflammation such as postviral bronchitis. Cough persisting over 8 weeks is classified as chronic and warrants further investigation; common etiologies for chronic cough include benign conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux, asthma, and allergies, but chronic cough can also be a sign of more serious underlying conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or malignancy. Understanding the nuance of cough characterization allows clinicians to direct patients appropriately within the spectrum of medical specialties, if specialist management is needed.

This broad differential diagnosis is likely related to the wide range of medical and surgical specialties involved in cough evaluation and management, including primary care, pulmonology, gastroenterology, neurology, and otolaryngology. Otolaryngologist evaluation, in particular, has been recommended in prior studies to treat complex etiologies of cough such as those rooted in neurogenic or rhinologic processes. However, the care of most patients with cough likely does not require the relatively high‐cost and procedure‐intensive involvement of a specialist. According to guidelines from the New England Journal of Medicine and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), common causes of cough should typically be addressed before considering subspecialty evaluation. A recent review by Dicpinigaitis et al. further highlights the importance of primary care physicians (PCPs) in the initial work‐up of cough, emphasizing their role before referring patients to specialists for interdisciplinary collaboration in the diagnosis and management of chronic cough.

### Managing chronic cough due to asthma and NAEB in adults and adolescents: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114AR4Ko]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for asthma, more specifically with respect to patients with chronic cough, ACCP 2020 guidelines recommend to consider stepping-up the dose of ICSs and administering a therapeutic trial of a leukotriene inhibitor after reconsideration of alternative causes of cough in adult and adolescent patients, if response is incomplete in patients with cough variant asthma or if cough is the remaining isolated symptom in patients with cough as one of the symptoms of asthma.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^113CTiKv]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may suffer from acute episodes of worsening dyspnea, often associated with increased cough, sputum, and/or sputum purulence. These exacerbations of COPD (ECOPDs) impact health status, accelerate lung function decline, and increase the risk of hospitalization. Importantly, close to 20% of patients are readmitted within 30 days after hospital discharge, with great cost to the person and society. Approximately 25% and 65% of patients hospitalized for an ECOPD die within 1 and 5 years, respectively. Patients with COPD are usually older and frequently have concomitant chronic diseases, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, interstitial lung diseases, bronchiectasis, asthma, anxiety, and depression, and are also at increased risk of developing pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and pneumothorax. All of these morbidities not only increase the risk of subsequent ECOPDs but can also mimic or aggravate them. Importantly, close to 70% of readmissions after an ECOPD hospitalization result from decompensation of other morbidities. These observations suggest that in patients with COPD with worsening dyspnea but without the other classic characteristics of ECOPD, a careful search for these morbidities can help detect them and allow appropriate treatment. For most morbidities, a thorough clinical evaluation supplemented by appropriate clinical investigations can guide the healthcare provider to make a precise diagnosis. This perspective integrates the currently dispersed information available and provides a practical approach to patients with COPD complaining of worsening respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnea. A systematic approach should help improve outcomes and the personal and societal cost of ECOPDs.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^111HmkaQ]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Management of exacerbations — definition and differential diagnosis: An exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ECOPD) is defined as an event characterized by increased dyspnea and/or cough and sputum that worsens in < 14 days and is often associated with increased local and systemic inflammation caused by infection, pollution, or other insult to the airways; as symptoms are not specific to COPD, relevant differential diagnoses should be considered, particularly pneumonia, congestive heart failure and pulmonary embolism.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116zhZPm]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough algorithm — management scope and initial assessment are for patients ≥ 15 years of age with cough lasting ≥ 8 weeks, with history to include red flags, occupational/environmental issues, travel exposures, physical exam, and chest radiograph; clinicians are instructed to always screen for red flags and to evaluate whether sitagliptin or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are contributing to cough, and for the branch labeled "Smoking ACEi Sitagliptin" the action is "Discontinue for at least 4 weeks" with review at "No response at 4–6 week follow up", and follow-up is also stated as "routinely follow patients at 4 to 6 weeks after the initial visit".

### Treatment of unexplained chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111aVzsR]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Unexplained chronic cough (UCC) — epidemiology and clinical characterization indicates that persistent cough of unexplained origin is a significant health issue that occurs in up to 5% to 10% of patients seeking medical assistance for a chronic cough and from 0% to 46% of patients referred to specialty cough clinics. UCC represents a clinically significant chronic cough that persists despite appropriate investigation and treatment. It can occur under three different circumstances: (1) chronic cough with no diagnosable cause (UCC), (2) explained but refractory chronic cough, and (3) unexplained and refractory chronic cough. When patients with chronic cough undergo investigation and the results of these investigations do not identify a cause of their cough, this condition is termed UCC.

### Tools for assessing outcomes in studies of chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112Nnti6]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic cough, more specifically with respect to tussigenic challenges, ACCP 2015 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining tussigenic challenges in research settings to understand the mechanisms of cough in adult and adolescent patients with cough of any duration.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113StUWX]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — quality assessment methods required that articles be published during 2006 or later, define acute, subacute, or chronic cough based on duration with actual durations reported, and report the spectrum and frequency of causes based on response to treatment; randomized controlled trials were assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, observational studies with the Cochrane risk of bias tool for cohort studies, and systematic reviews with the Documentation and Appraisal Review Tool.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115LeAdp]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute cough algorithm — adult initial management, red flags, and follow-up: The figure applies to "patients ≥ 15 years of age with cough lasting ≤ 3 weeks" and instructs to "Always screen for the presence of red flags as a clue to a potentially life-threatening condition". Listed life-threatening causes include "Pneumonia, severe exacerbation of asthma or COPD, PE, heart failure, other serious disease". It also advises to "Always consider the presence of TB in endemic areas or high-risk populations even if chest radiographs are normal" and to "Remember to routinely assess cough severity or quality of life before and after treatment and routinely follow patients 4–6 weeks after initial visit". Red flags include "Hemoptysis", "Smoker > 45 years of age with a new cough, change in cough, or coexisting voice disturbance", "Adults aged 55–80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or who have quit within the past 15 years", "Prominent dyspnea, especially at rest or at night", "Hoarseness", "Systemic symptoms" (with "Fever", "Weight loss", "Peripheral edema with weight gain"), "Trouble swallowing when eating or drinking", "Vomiting", "Recurrent pneumonia", and "Abnormal respiratory exam and/or abnormal chest radiograph coinciding with duration of cough".

Miscellaneous Morbidities

Anxiety and Depression

In patients with ECOPD, the prevalence of depression and anxiety ranges between 9% and 58%, depending on the assessment method. Furthermore, patients with COPD who have depression and/or anxiety are at increased risk of ECOPD and hospitalizations compared with nondepressed individuals. In addition, nearly 10% of current and former smokers have concomitant anxiety and depression, which independently predict the risk of exacerbations. This vicious cycle worsens with every exacerbation, as each episode leads to symptom worsening, aggravates muscle weakness, and decreases functional capacity (limiting activity), consequently worsening anxiety and depression.

The causal role of anxiety/depression in ECOPDs has not been systematically studied. Panic attacks and anxiety may cause tachypnea that, in COPD, may result in hyperinflation and culminate in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. Furthermore, hypercapnia triggers panic attacks because of the activation of specific brainstem reflexes, causing hyperventilation, hyperinflation, and aggravating panic symptoms. In patients with COPD who have a panic attack, the lack of increase in cough and sputum in the absence of either an inflammatory burst or another explanatory morbidity for dyspnea and tachypnea can help establish a diagnosis.

Pneumothorax

Pneumothorax is a potentially life-threatening event that occurs in some patients with COPD, resembles an ECOPD, and requires prompt recognition. Subpleural blebs and bullae are frequent in older males with more severe emphysema and cigarette or marijuana smoke exposure. In patients with COPD who present with pneumothorax, dyspnea is associated with chest pain, often accompanied by hypoxemia, and occasionally, acute respiratory failure. A pneumothorax diagnosis is usually confirmed by chest X-ray, being careful to avoid misinterpretation with bullae. Lung ultrasound may also be diagnostic and more readily available in the ICU or emergency room settings.

Pleural Effusion

Large pleural effusions may contribute to worsening dyspnea in patients with COPD, as they alter lung and chest wall elastic equilibrium, creating a restrictive ventilatory defect. If the effusion is large and associated with elevated natriuretic peptides, the causes are more likely cardiovascular in origin, particularly acute HF, whereas if it is associated with high CRP concentrations, it likely reflects a parapneumonic effusion or empyema because of underlying infection and occasionally lung cancer. Chest X-rays, ultrasound imaging, and chest CT are all useful in determining the presence, size, and complexity of pleural effusion in a patient with ECOPD.

### Does this coughing adolescent or adult patient have pertussis? [^111yJXpL]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

Pertussis is often overlooked as a cause of chronic cough, especially in adolescents and adults. Several symptoms are classically thought to be suggestive of pertussis, but the diagnostic value of each of them is uncertain.

Objective

To systematically review the evidence regarding the diagnostic value of 3 classically described symptoms of pertussis: paroxysmal cough, posttussive emesis, and inspiratory whoop.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

We searched MEDLINE (January 1966-April 2010), EMBASE (January 1969 to April 2010), and the bibliographies of pertinent articles to identify relevant English-language studies. Articles were selected that included children older than 5 years, adolescents, or adults and confirmed the diagnosis of pertussis among patients with cough illness (of any duration) with an a priori-defined accepted reference standard. Two authors independently extracted data from articles that met selection criteria and resolved any discrepancies by consensus.

Data Synthesis

Five prospective studies met inclusion criteria; 3 were used in the analysis. Presence of posttussive emesis (summary likelihood ratio [LR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4–2.2) or inspiratory whoop (summary LR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.6) increases the likelihood of pertussis. Absence of paroxysmal cough (summary LR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.27–1.0) or posttussive emesis (summary LR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44–0.77) reduced the likelihood. Absence of inspiratory whoop was less useful (summary LR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66–0.93). No studies evaluated combinations of findings.

Conclusions

In a nonoutbreak setting, data to determine the diagnostic usefulness of symptoms classically associated with pertussis are limited and of relatively weak quality. The presence or absence of posttussive emesis or inspiratory whoop modestly change the likelihood of pertussis; therefore, clinicians must use their overall clinical impression to decide about additional testing or empirical treatment.

### My approach to interstitial lung disease using clinical, radiological and histopathological patterns [^115GBwk3]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

THE THREE CLINICAL PATTERNS OF DIFFUSE PARENCHYMAL LUNG DISEASE (ACUTE, SUBACUTE AND CHRONIC)

All successful diagnostic strategies begin with the patient. Before examining the lung biopsy specimen, it is an absolute requirement to know the "tempo" or pace of the patient's respiratory symptoms. Breathlessness is the main clinical complaint when ILD is present, often accompanied by cough. Knowing whether these symptoms are acute (hours to a several days), subacute (a few weeks to a few months) or chronic (many months to years) allows inclusion of some diseases and exclusion of others from the differential diagnosis. This knowledge also helps us to determine the nature of the critical pathology for this patient (ie, what we should be focusing on in the specimen). Table 1 presents my view of the diseases most commonly associated with these three clinical presentations.

Table 1
The three clinical patterns of diffuse lung disease and their differential diagnosis

In the patient with acute clinical manifestations, further knowledge about immune status is very helpful, as the index of suspicion for infection is always higher in the immunocompromised host, and the biopsy specimen always requires additional studies to exclude an infectious organism (cultures and special stains for micro-organisms).

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113dD3d4]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Classification and evaluation of pediatric cough — at first presentation, specific cough overlaps with non-specific cough and the latter overlaps with 'expected cough'. 'Expected cough' refers to coughing illness reflective of common upper respiratory viral infections in an otherwise child where the cough duration is usually < 2 weeks but may be longer in a small minority. Children with a chronic cough should be reevaluated until a diagnosis is found with resolution of the cough (if possible). The presence of any specific cough pointer indicates an etiology of chronic cough and when any of these symptoms and signs are present, the cough is referred to as 'specific cough'. In some children, the quality of cough is recognizable and suggestive of specific etiology. Non-specific cough is more likely to resolve without specific treatment and it is characterized by a dry/nonproductive cough in the absence of specific cough pointers with normal CXR and spirometry. Contributing exacerbating factors such as tobacco smoke exposure and parental expectations should also be evaluated, irrespective of the underlying etiology.

### Unexplained cough in the adult [^114N3FZR]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Unexplained cough is a diagnosis of exclusion that should not be made until a thorough validated diagnostic evaluation is performed, specific and appropriate validated treatments have been tried and failed, and uncommon causes have been ruled out. When chronic cough remains troublesome after the initial work up, determine that a protocol has been used that has been shown to lead to successful results. If such a protocol has been used, next consider whether or not pitfalls in management have been avoided. If they have been, the frequency of truly unexplained chronic cough usually should not exceed 10%. While patients with truly unexplained coughs have an overly sensitive cough reflex, the mere presence of an overly sensitive cough reflex does not by itself explain why they do not get better, because most patients with chronic cough, even those who respond to treatment and get better, have demonstrable heightened cough sensitivity. Management options include referral to a cough clinic with interdisciplinary expertise, speech therapy, and self-limited trials of drugs, preferentially with those shown to be effective in randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials in patients with unexplained chronic cough.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111zU7JA]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Pertussis-associated cough in adults — clinical feature-based diagnosis: For adult patients with acute cough (< 3 weeks in duration) or subacute cough (3–8 weeks), we suggest that clinicians should specifically assess paroxysmal cough, posttussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever to help rule in or out a clinical diagnosis of pertussis; paroxysmal cough and absence of fever had high sensitivity and low specificity, whereas inspiratory whoop and posttussive vomiting had a low sensitivity but high specificity, and for adult patients with acute or subacute cough, we suggest that clinicians consider that the cough is unlikely to be due to pertussis if the patient has a fever or the cough is not paroxysmal in nature, with fever defined as any body temperature above the normal of 98.6°F (37°C).

### Diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111Ce61i]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) differential diagnosis and initial evaluation note that Other diagnoses should be considered on the basis of a detailed clinical history. Features overlap with cystic fibrosis (CF), as The otosinopulmonary features of PCD overlap with symptoms of CF, another genetic disorder of mucociliary clearance, and Children with CF typically do not have neonatal respiratory distress or chronic otitis media, nor do they have daily cough until lung disease has significantly progressed. For evaluation, Nonetheless, children being evaluated for PCD should undergo sweat chloride testing at a laboratory certified to perform sweat chloride measurements. Immune assessment is guided by manifestations because Depending on the clinical manifestations, a complete blood count with leukocyte differential, serum quantitative immunoglobulin levels, serological assays for specific antibodies as a measure of vaccine response, and total serum complement levels should be obtained as measured, and Further evaluation by an immunologist may be required in some cases. Additional considerations include aspiration and asthma, since Chronic aspiration may also manifest as chronic cough and recurrent pulmonary disease and Asthma and bronchial hyperreactivity may coexist with PCD, but they can be further explored with bronchial provocation testing or bronchodilator response testing.

### Cough in children: when does it matter? [^114m8yE5]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Cough is a common presenting symptom to paediatricians and paediatric respiratory physicians. The causes of chronic cough in childhood are significantly different from those in adults, and a different approach to diagnosis and management is needed. In most cases cause can be identified or a satisfactory label given. This review will cover the approach to cough in children and cover some specific causes of troublesome cough not discussed elsewhere in this mini-symposium.

### An empiric integrative approach to the management of cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112TQUjk]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Review the literature to provide a comprehensive approach, including algorithms for the clinician to follow in evaluating and treating the patient with acute, subacute, and chronic cough.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE (through May 2004) for studies published in the English language since 1980 on human subjects using the medical subject heading terms "cough", "treatment of cough", and "empiric treatment of cough". We selected case series and prospective descriptive clinical trials. We also obtained any references from these studies that were pertinent to the topic.

Results

The relative frequency of the disorders (alone and in combination) that can cause cough as well as the sensitivity and specificity of many but not all diagnostic tests in predicting the cause of cough are known. An effective approach to successfully manage chronic cough is to sequentially evaluate and treat for the common causes of cough using a combination of selected diagnostic tests and empiric therapy. Sequential and additive therapy is often crucial because more than one cause of cough is frequently present.

Conclusion

Algorithms that provide a "road map" that the clinician can follow are useful and are presented for acute, subacute, and chronic cough.

### Habit cough [^113A7V65]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review habit cough and its treatments to raise awareness of this condition as a potential cause of chronic cough.

Data Sources

Relevant articles and references published between January 1, 1962, and April 30, 2008, were found through a PubMed search using the following keywords: habit cough, psychogenic cough, chronic cough, and tic cough.

Study Selection

All key relevant articles were reviewed, and the most relevant were selected for inclusion in this review.

Results

Habit cough is a diagnosis of exclusion and can occur in children and adults with chronic cough. Characteristic features of habit cough include a loud honking or barking cough, disruption of normal activities, and the frequent presence of a secondary gain (such as school absence). Successful treatment has been described in several case reports and involves mostly nonpharmacologic measures.

Conclusions

It is important to consider habit cough in the differential diagnosis of chronic cough because early diagnosis can help to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and potential iatrogenic complications.

### Methodology and grading of the evidence for the diagnosis and management of cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116YQJ6G]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assemble a multidisciplinary, geographically diverse panel of experts in the diagnosis and treatment of cough with the intention of developing clinically relevant practice guidelines for pulmonary and primary care physicians, including recommendations covering many etiologies of cough, adult and pediatric evaluation and treatment, and empiric yet integrative algorithms for the management of the patient with cough.

Methods

The Duke University Center for Clinical Health Policy Research was selected to review and summarize the current evidence in this area. The expert panel established clinical recommendations and algorithms founded on the synthesis of this evidence.

Conclusions

This section describes the approach used to develop the guidelines, including identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing the evidence, assessing the strength of evidence pertinent to individual guidelines, and grading the guideline recommendations.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^1128uXE6]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis background and prior evidence indicate that currently, the diagnosis is clinical with emphasis on excluding differential diagnoses, and the CHEST 2006 guidelines recommended that acute bronchitis be diagnosed only if there was no evidence of pneumonia, the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD. Previous retrospective cohort studies found that at initial presentation just over one-third would also meet criteria for asthma, and that 3 years after diagnosis 34% fulfilled criteria for either asthma or chronic bronchitis; in a retrospective study of 46 patients with at least two similar physician-diagnosed episodes of acute bronchitis, 65% episodes were found to have mild asthma. It is not known whether routine ordering of investigations such as chest x-rays, sputum cultures, or serum inflammatory markers at initial presentation adds value, and although acute bronchitis is considered self-limiting, there remains data to suggest that practitioners frequently prescribe both antibiotics and other medication.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic cough [^112EoMEf]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough is defined by a duration lasting at least 8 weeks. The most common causes of chronic cough include smoking-related lung disease, upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. The etiology of chronic cough in some patients may be difficult to localize to an isolated source and is often multifactorial. The complex pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and variable manifestations of chronic cough underscore the challenges faced by clinicians in the evaluation and management of these patients. Imaging plays a role in the initial evaluation, although there is a lack of high-quality evidence guiding which modalities are useful and at what point in time the clinical evaluation should be performed. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Practical tips in bronchiectasis for primary care [^114GPPkU]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are the most common chronic inflammatory airway diseases. They have been estimated to affect more than 5–10% of the world population –. Although both asthma and COPD remain clearly underdiagnosed, it is very important to consider that they are not the only existing chronic inflammatory airway diseases that can be clinically suspected in Primary Care, and therefore a good differential diagnosis must be made with respect to other entities. It must be borne in mind that a diagnosis is not necessarily always going to be COPD (or only COPD) in a male smoker with airflow obstruction, or asthma (or only asthma) in a non-smoking female with airflow obstruction, even though these diagnoses are correct most of the time. It is always necessary to think that these same symptoms and signs can appear in other airway diseases, and if these are correctly diagnosed a patient's follow-up and treatment may have to be altered.

Bronchiectasis is the third most common chronic inflammatory airway disease, after COPD and asthma. Its prevalence is not known, but it is estimated to be around 350–500 cases/100,000 inhabitantsand it increases rapidly with age. Its symptoms can easily be confused with those of COPD and asthma. Bronchiectasis can be caused by dozens of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary diseases (although in up to 30–50% of cases the cause is unknown), and, as in COPD and asthma, a variable number and severity of exacerbations can appear throughout its natural history, usually with an infectious profile. A global consensus of experts recently defined bronchiectasis as a clinical-radiological disease consisting of dilation of the bronchial lumen accompanied by compatible symptoms (usually chronic cough plus expectoration with a purulent component). This dilation of the bronchial lumen is produced by a vicious circle of inflammation and chronic infection that injures the bronchial wall, producing irreversible destruction. Bronchial inflammation and infection are therefore two key points in the management of these patients –, and, as in COPD and asthma, chronic airflow obstruction is their most frequent functional pattern. In severe cases, systemic inflammation, (predominantly neutrophilicbut sometimes with a significant eosinophilic profile) is present –. In this article, we will try to offer a series of important concepts (Box 1) and practical tips (Box 2) on the diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis in Primary Care. However, it is important to highlight that these recommendations could vary according to the geographical area and the resources available in each respective setting.

### Children with cough and fever: up-to-date imaging evaluation and management [^1117erMc]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Cough and fever in infants and children are frequent but nonspecific symptoms. Several usual differential diagnoses are under consideration and imaging is often necessary to help arrive at an accurate diagnosis and ensure proper management. A broad spectrum of underlying disorders may be present. Radiologists must remain cognizant of the potential for immune dysfunction and underlying structural abnormalities. A clear understanding of up-to-date imaging evaluation recommendations and characteristic imaging features can assist radiologists and clinicians in arriving at the most accurate diagnosis in a timely manner and help ensure proper management and necessary follow-up imaging assessment.

### Healthy habits: coughing and sneezing… [^113sEQYB]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Cover coughs and sneezes using a tissue or your elbow.
- Wash your hands immediately after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
- Covering coughs and sneezes and keeping hands clean can prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses. Overview Covering coughs and sneezes and keeping hands clean can help prevent the spread of serious respiratory illnesses like influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, pertussis, and COVID-19. Germs can be easily spread by:

- Coughing, sneezing, or talking
- Touching your face with unwashed hands after touching contaminated surfaces or objects
- Touching surfaces or objects that may be frequently touched by other people. Recommendations Stop the spread of germs
- Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze
- Throw used tissues in the trash
- If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hands.

Wash your hands Remember to immediately wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. Washing your hands is one of the most effective ways to prevent yourself and your loved ones from getting sick, especially at key times when you are likely to get and spread germs.
- Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
- If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol to clean hands. Avoid sick people To help prevent the spread of respiratory disease, you can also avoid close contact with people who are sick. If you are ill, you should try to distance yourself from others so you do not spread your germs. Distancing includes staying home from work or school when possible.

### Cough in ambulatory immunocompromised adults: CHEST expert panel report [^115PbcHt]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cough is a common symptom prompting patients to seek medical care. Like patients in the general population, patients with compromised immune systems also seek care for cough. However, it is unclear whether the causes of cough in immunocompromised patients who are deemed unlikely to have a life-threating condition and a normal or unchanged chest radiograph are similar to those in persons with cough and normal immune systems.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review to answer the question: What are the most common causes of cough in ambulatory immunodeficient adults with normal chest radiographs? Studies of patients ≥ 18 years of age with immune deficiency, cough of any duration, and normal or unchanged chest radiographs were included and assessed for relevance and quality. Based on the systematic review, suggestions were developed and voted on using the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodology framework.

Results

The results of the systematic review revealed no high-quality evidence to guide the clinician in determining the likely causes of cough specifically in immunocompromised ambulatory patients with normal chest radiographs.

Conclusions

Based on a systematic review, we found no evidence to assess whether or not the proper initial evaluation of cough in immunocompromised patients is different from that in immunocompetent persons. A consensus of the panel suggested that the initial diagnostic algorithm should be similar to that for immunocompetent persons but that the context of the type and severity of the immune defect, geographic location, and social determinants be considered. The major modifications to the 2006 CHEST Cough Guidelines are the suggestions that TB should be part of the initial evaluation of patients with cough and HIV infection who reside in regions with a high prevalence of TB, regardless of the radiographic findings, and that specific causes and immune defects be considered in all patients in whom the initial evaluation is unrevealing.

For 12–39 years, consider chronic upper airway cough syndrome for "Sneezing, itching, blocked nose, throat-clearing", inducible laryngeal obstruction for "Dyspnea, inspiratory wheezing (stridor)", hyperventilation, dysfunctional breathing for "Dizziness, paresthesia, sighing", and bronchiectasis for "Productive cough, recurrent infections".

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^115iaYzu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Infectious Diseases

Pneumonia

In patients with COPD, the symptoms of pneumonia and ECOPD may be similar (worsened cough, sputum production, dyspnea, and fever). Physical examination may help in the differentiation, with signs of consolidation (localized crackles, crepitus, and dullness on percussion) more frequent in patients with pneumonia. However, because a diagnosis of COPD increases pneumonia risk (by 1.3- to 13.5-fold) and severity, pneumonia should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with symptoms of ECOPD.

If the clinical assessment deems the ECOPD to be mild or moderate and there are no signs of lung consolidation, no further diagnostic testing to differentiate the two diseases is indicated. However, if the episode is severe and/or prolonged, and there are abnormal chest exam findings, a proper diagnosis of pneumonia should be undertaken. Mortality after hospitalized pneumonia is higher than after hospitalized ECOPD. Although most patients without severe ECOPD can be safely treated on the basis of chest X-ray results alone, opacities not visible on a chest X-ray may be seen with more sensitive CT scans.

Clinical presentation of COPD symptoms — Chronic dyspnea is the most characteristic symptom of COPD. Cough with sputum production is present in up to 30% of patients. These symptoms may vary from day-to-day and may precede the development of airflow obstruction by many years. Individuals, particularly those with COPD risk factors, presenting with these symptoms should be examined to search for the underlying cause(s). Airflow obstruction may also be present without chronic dyspnea and/or cough and sputum production and vice versa.

Asthma is a heterogeneous syndrome of cough, wheeze, dyspnea, and chest tightness. However, in a subset of patients, these symptoms may indicate a different underlying disease process with variable responsiveness to classic asthma therapies. Disease may progress while practitioners attempt conventional asthma therapy. Additionally, some types of asthma may require alternative approaches to relieve symptoms successfully. This article describes the differential diagnosis of asthma and discusses some of the more common asthma variants and asthma mimickers.

Evaluation principles in children with chronic cough: For children aged ≤ 14 years, we recommend that (a) common etiologies of chronic cough in adults are not presumed to be common causes in children and (b) their age and the clinical settings (eg, country and region) are taken into consideration when evaluating and managing their chronic cough (Level 1B). Initial evaluation entails performing a thorough clinical assessment, a chest radiograph (CXR) and/or spirometry, followed by deciding whether any investigations and/or treatment are appropriate and/or required.

Definition, Description, and Diagnosis of Asthma

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease defined by the history of respiratory symptoms (e.g. wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough) that vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation. Airflow limitation may later become persistent.

Asthma is usually associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation, but these are not necessary or sufficient for diagnosis. Clinical phenotypes (e.g. childhood onset vs. late onset, allergic vs. nonallergic) do not correlate strongly with specific pathological processes or treatment responses.

The diagnosis of asthma is based on a history of characteristic symptom patterns and evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation obtained from bronchodilator reversibility testing or from other tests, such as a positive bronchial provocation test result, excessive variability during PEF monitoring, excessive variation in FEV₁ between visits, or a significant increase in FEV₁ after ICS treatment (see Table E1 in the online supplement). Explain to patients that often, more than one of these tests is needed. Evidence for the diagnosis of asthma should be confirmed before starting controller treatment, if possible, to avoid inappropriate treatment or missing other important diagnoses and because diagnosis is often more difficult later. Results from clinical examination, including chest auscultation, may be completely normal.

The concentration of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (F NO) is higher in asthma with type 2 airway inflammation but is also higher in atopy, allergic rhinitis, eczema, and eosinophilic bronchitis, and it is lower during bronchoconstriction and in some asthma phenotypes (e.g. neutrophilic asthma). It can be increased or decreased by viral respiratory infections.

Additional strategies may be needed to confirm the diagnosis of asthma in particular populations, including patients already on controller treatment (see Box 1–3 in Reference), the elderly, smokers, and those in low-resource settings. The differential diagnosis of asthma varies by age (Box 1–5 in Reference).

### Clinical updates in women's health care summary: acute cough: primary and preventive care review [^116VAif4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute cough is a common presenting symptom in the ambulatory care setting in the United States. It imposes a significant symptom burden on patients and financial burden on the health care system. In most cases, acute cough is caused by a benign viral infection that will resolve without intervention. When needed, there are few evidence-based interventions to hasten the resolution of cough symptoms. Patients may request antibiotics or prescription cough syrups; however, these medications have little evidence of benefit and can be potentially harmful to the patient. It can be challenging for the clinician to provide reassurance while minimizing unnecessary prescriptions. The health care provider also must be alert to signs and symptoms that could signal a high-risk diagnosis that requires urgent evaluation. This monograph provides a review of the differential diagnosis for acute cough, an algorithmic approach to the evaluation of cough, and evidence-based treatment recommendations. Also, it highlights warning signs and symptoms that should trigger an emergent referral and special clinical considerations in more vulnerable patient populations, including pregnant patients and geriatric patients.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^111rd2CZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Selection bias is present when selective and non‐random inclusion and exclusion of participants applies and the resulting association between exposure and outcome (here the accuracy of the test) differs in the selected study population compared to the eligible study population, and it has been shown that this may decrease estimates of diagnostic accuracy (Rutjes 2006). For the diagnosis of COVID‐19, rapidly and constantly changing, and widely variable test criteria have influenced who was referred for testing and who was not. Inclusion in the study of only a fraction of eligible patients can give a biased estimate of the real accuracy of the index test when measured against the reference standard and real disease status. Griffith 2020 have reported on the problematic presence of collider stratification bias in the published studies on COVID‐19. Appropriate sampling strategies need to be applied to avoid conclusions of spurious relationships, more specifically in our case, the biased accuracy estimates of signs and symptoms for the diagnosis of COVID‐19. Selection of participants based on the presence of specific pre‐set symptoms, such as fever and cough, leads to biased associations between these symptoms and disease, and sensitivity and specificity estimates that differ from their true values. The example of collider bias for cough is illustrated in Figure 31. Grouping studies by diagnostic criteria for selection might clarify this issue, but studies do not clearly describe them, with study authors referring to the guidelines in general that were applicable at the time.

Directed acyclic graph on cough

Another form of selection bias is spectrum bias, where the patients included in the studies do not reflect the patient spectrum to which the index test will be applied. The inclusion of hospitalised patients can lead to such a bias, when in these patients both the distribution of signs and symptoms differ and assessment with the reference standard is differential. In addition, the distribution and severity of alternative diagnoses may be different in hospitalised populations than in patients presenting to ambulatory care settings.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^1134dJJY]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

CHEST Expert Panel suggestions — management of cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients state there is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the efficacy of prescribed treatments for cough due to acute bronchitis. For immunocompetent adult outpatients with cough due to acute bronchitis, we suggest no routine prescription of antibiotic therapy, antiviral therapy, antitussives, inhaled beta agonists, inhaled anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, oral NSAIDs or other therapies until such treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For immunocompetent adult outpatients with cough due to acute bronchitis, if the acute bronchitis worsens, we suggest consideration for treatment with antibiotic therapy if a complicating bacterial infection is thought likely (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), and remarks note that differential diagnoses, such as exacerbations of chronic airways diseases (COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis) that may require other therapeutic management (such as with oral corticosteroids) should also be considered.

The guidelines contain 48 recommendations agreed upon the consensus and 16 statements, which are explained in the background text in the following nine chapters: epidemiology, physiology, classification, acute, subacute or chronic cough, diagnostics and therapy; an extra chapter was dedicated to chronic idiopathic/refractory cough. Further emphasis of the guidelines is the physiology of cough in anticipation of the introduction of new drugs, as well as detailed treatment for cough triggered by affectations of the upper respiratory tract or gastroesophageal reflux. The guideline should provide the pneumologist with the latest knowledge for neighboring disciplines required for diagnosis and therapy of cough. The clinical chapters also contain a short summary, practical recommendations and a bibliography of their own. Three new simplified algorithms for acute, subacute and chronic cough, round off the diagnostics chapter.

### Cough: a worldwide problem [^112ux3cj]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Cough is a common and important respiratory symptom that can produce significant complications for patients and be a diagnostic challenge for physicians. An organized approach to evaluating cough begins with classifying it as acute, subacute, or chronic in duration. Acute cough lasting less than 3 weeks may indicate an acute underlying cardiorespiratory disorder but is most commonly caused by a self-limited viral upper respiratory tract infection (eg, common cold). Subacute cough lasting 3 to 8 weeks commonly has a postinfectious origin; among the causes, Bordetella pertussis infection should be included in the differential diagnosis. Chronic cough lasts longer than 8 weeks. When a patient is a nonsmoker, is not taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and has a normal or near-normal chest radiograph, chronic cough is most commonly caused by upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, or gastroesophageal reflux disease alone or in combination.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112QvZaw]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The decision to treat a suspected case of pertussis with antibiotics is usually based on a clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation. The current guideline focuses on making the clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough in adults and children.

Methods

The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework were used. The Expert Cough Panel based their recommendations on findings from a systematic review that was recently published on the topic; final grading was reached by consensus according to Delphi methodology. The systematic review was carried out to answer the Key Clinical Question: In patients presenting with cough, how can we most accurately diagnose from clinical features alone those who have pertussis-associated cough as opposed to other causes of cough?

Results

In adults, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 4 clinical features: paroxysmal cough, post-tussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever. Both paroxysmal cough and absence of fever had high sensitivity (93.2% [95% CI, 83.2–97.4] and 81.8% [95% CI, 72.2–88.7], respectively) and low specificity (20.6% [95% CI, 14.7–28.1] and 18.8% [95% CI, 8.1–37.9]). Inspiratory whooping and posttussive vomiting had a low sensitivity (32.5% [95% CI, 24.5–41.6] and 29.8% [95% CI, 18.0–45.2]) but high specificity (77.7% [95% CI, 73.1–81.7] and 79.5% [95% CI, 69.4–86.9]). In children, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 1 clinical feature in children (0–18 years): posttussive vomiting. Posttussive vomiting in children was only moderately sensitive (60.0% [95% CI, 40.3–77.0]) and specific (66.0% [95% CI, 52.5–77.3]).

Conclusions

In adults with acute (< 3 weeks) or subacute (3–8 weeks) cough, the presence of whooping or posttussive vomiting should rule in a possible diagnosis of pertussis, whereas the lack of a paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever should rule it out. In children with acute (< 4 weeks) cough, posttussive vomiting is suggestive of pertussis but is much less helpful as a clinical diagnostic test. Guideline suggestions are made based upon these findings and conclusions.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^114Jz5tR]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Definitions, causes, and diagnosis of chronic cough

Chronic pediatric cough is generally defined as a cough lasting for > 4 weeks. The exception is the BTS, which defines chronic pediatric cough as lasting for > 8 weeks, while acknowledging that there is a gray area between acute and chronic, and that 'relentlessly progressive' cough should be investigated after 3 weeks. Certain pediatric cough guidelines recommend characterizing chronic cough into wet/productive or dry, because this distinction affects diagnosis and treatment pathways, with wet cough often having an infectious etiology. Guidelines also make the distinction between 'specific' cough, which is associated with a condition recognized to cause cough, thereby forming the basis for specific treatment, and 'non-specific' cough, in which no underlying condition has yet been found.

The most common causes of chronic pediatric cough are generally thought to be protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), asthma, and post-infectious cough. In a study of children with acute respiratory illness and cough presenting at an emergency department, 20.4% had persistent cough 4 weeks later; 6.6% were subsequently diagnosed with PBB, and 4.3% with a new chronic respiratory disease. PBB is most common in children aged < 6 years, and, in many cases, onset of symptoms occurs before the age of 1 year. Less common, but more serious, are lung disorders (such as cystic fibrosis) and immune deficiency. Habit cough is a repetitive, chronic cough with no identified underlying organic reason; habit cough is more common in older children, peaking at around 10 years of age. Chronic cough may also be caused or exacerbated by exposure to airborne irritants, such as tobacco smoke, allergens, and traffic pollution.

With regard to diagnosis, chronic cough in children should be seen as a symptom of an underlying disease and, therefore, should be subject to careful and systematic evaluation for the presence of specific diagnostic indicators. Diagnosis should involve a detailed patient history, thorough physical examination, chest X-ray, and, if the child is old enough and cooperative, spirometry. Sputum cultures should be attempted in cases of wet chronic cough; further investigations (such as bronchoscopy and serological laboratory assessments) may be required, after giving consideration to patient discomfort and the potential for adverse events. Habit cough can be diagnosed from clinical characteristics; the key diagnostic feature is that coughing stops when the child is asleep.

### Cough: diagnosis and management… [^1154pf7d]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Acute Cough Acute cough is most commonly associated with the common cold, but it also can be associated with life-threatening conditions. The first step in the treatment of acute cough is to determine if the cause of the cough is one of these serious conditions or an acute upper respiratory infection, lower respiratory tract infection, or an exacerbation of a preexisting condition. If the cough is due to the common cold, a first-generation antihistamine plus a decongestant should be prescribed. It has been shown that naproxen favorably affects cough. Newer-generation nonsedating antihistamines are not effective for reducing cough.

Patients must be symptomatic for a least one week before a diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis is made, because prior to that point bacterial overgrowth is unlikely. Subacute Cough The first step in diagnosing subacute cough is to determine whether the cough has followed a respiratory infection. If the cough does not appear to be postinfectious, it should be managed as if it were a chronic cough. If the cough began with an upper respiratory tract infection and has lingered, it is usually considered a postinfectious cough. It is most probably caused by postnasal drip, upper airway irritation, mucus accumulation, or a manifestation of branchial hyperresponsiveness that may be associated with asthma. Ongoing allergen or irritant exposure, lingering effects of an infection, pneumonia, and acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis should also be considered. Patients suspected of being infected with B. pertussis should have a nasopharyngeal swab for culture.

Patients with confirmed whooping cough should receive macrolide antibiotics and should be isolated for five days beginning on the first day of treatment. If the cough is not caused by bacterial sinusitis or. Evidence of infection should be followed by attempts to make a microbial diagnosis. Most patients with chronic cough are otherwise healthy, and in these patients the four most common causes of cough are upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis.

### What is chronic cough? Terminology [^117EKXxC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Terminology used to define clinical cough is based on features such as duration, underlying causes, and associated characteristics such as whether the cough is "dry" or "productive". Terms such as "refractory chronic cough", "unexplained chronic cough", and "idiopathic cough" are commonly used to describe a cough that persists despite extensive investigation and therapeutic trials. The use of these terms, sometimes interchangeably, has led to a degree of confusion and with the emergence of the new clinical and mechanisitic concept associated with cough, "cough hypersensitivity syndrome", there is a need for some clarity in the nomenclature used to describe this condition.

### Overview of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114tMyKL]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST (American College of Chest Physicians) guideline overview — cough pathophysiology, measurement, and clinical significance are summarized as follows: Cough arises following activation of a complex sensorimotor reflex arc, and its distinctive sound is generated by the explosive release of trapped and pressurized intrathoracic air from the sudden opening of the vocal folds. Because cough is an easily described and recognizable physical act, patient surveys on the prevalence of cough have credibility, enabling development of cough-specific, patient-reported outcome tools by which physicians can assess the impact of cough on patients. Because the sound resulting from coughing has a typical acoustic waveform profile, software detection algorithms for automatic monitoring have been developed for cough counting. While cough in healthy individuals is physiologically important, it typically is of little clinical importance because it is normally a very uncommon event, yet it assumes importance as a defense mechanism when it helps clear excessive secretions and foreign material from the airways and as a factor in the spread of infection. The report states that cough is a common and potentially expensive health-care problem and that the panel's purpose is to synthesize current knowledge to aid clinical decision-making for the diagnosis and management of cough across disciplines and to identify gaps in knowledge and treatment options.

### The incidence, duration, risk factors, and age-based variation of missed opportunities to diagnose pertussis: a population-based cohort study [^113YUd2o]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results demonstrate that patients with pertussis often experience diagnostic delays. For example, 18% of pertussis patients had a delay of at least 20 days, and the average delay was 12 days. These delays have important implications for patient health because, if caught quickly, pertussis is treatable, and early treatment can also prevent transmission of the disease. On average, patients had almost 2 visits prior to diagnosis, and some had many more visits. At each of these visits, multiple healthcare professionals and other patients were potentially exposed to pertussis, and between these visits, many community and household exposures undoubtably occurred.

The frequency and duration of diagnostic delays varied across age groups. In general, the percentage of patients experiencing a delay tended to increase with age from 2–4 years up to adulthood (≥ 18 years). Both the number of missed opportunities per patient and the duration of delays increased monotonically from age < 2 years through adulthood. Thus, diagnostic delays for pertussis among adults appear to be both longer and more frequent compared to younger children. Pertussis has long been viewed as a childhood illness. Thus, it is not surprising that older individuals are more likely to experience a diagnostic delay. Although most hospitalizations and deaths occur among infants, – in the postvaccination era, cases commonly occur among adolescents and adults. Indeed, diagnosing pertussis in adults is more difficult because these cases may present with mild cough and other respiratory symptoms. This is further complicated because cough is a leading cause of outpatient visits. Up to 17% of adolescents and adults with a prolonged history of cough (eg, > 2 weeks) have pertussis. Thus, pertussis should be part of the differential diagnosis for patients with prolonged cough. While patients with symptoms longer than a few weeks may no longer benefit from treatment themselves, identification of these cases will help the public health response. Specifically, more timely diagnosis can facilitate contact tracing, help minimize contacts, and inform the administration of chemoprophylaxis among exposures.

### Chronic cough due to asthma: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116JkxSr]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is among the most common causes of chronic cough in adult nonsmokers. Although cough usually accompanies dyspnea and wheezing, it may present in isolation as a precursor of typical asthmatic symptoms, or it may remain the predominant or sole symptom of asthma. The latter condition is known as cough-variant asthma (CVA).

Methods

Data for this review were obtained from a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search, performed in April 2004, of the English language literature from 1975 to 2004, limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough" and "asthma".

Results

The diagnosis of cough not associated with typical asthmatic symptoms (ie, CVA) presents a challenge, because physical examination and spirometry findings may be entirely normal. Methacholine inhalation challenge testing can demonstrate the presence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness; however, the diagnosis of cough due to asthma is only confirmed after the resolution of cough with antiasthmatic therapy. In general, the therapeutic approach to asthmatic cough is similar to that of the typical form of asthma. Most patients will respond to inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. A subgroup of patients will require the addition of leukotriene receptor antagonists and/or a short course of oral corticosteroids.

Conclusions

Asthma should be considered as a potential etiology in any patient with chronic cough, because asthma is a common condition that is commonly associated with cough. Because the subgroup of asthmatic patients with CVA presents with no other symptoms of asthma, clinical suspicion must remain high. Cough due to asthma responds to standard antiasthmatic therapy.

### 'Dry' and' wet' cough: how reliable is parental reporting? [^1122w1vz]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Eliciting a description of the nature of the cough is a key component of taking a good cough history, but it is important to recognise that by itself the nature of the cough is not diagnostic. It is simply one of a number of components in trying to reach an informed differential diagnosis. Young patients with a viral lower respiratory tract infection often have a wet cough due to the secretions in the airways which are similar in nature to the accompanying snotty nose. While asthma is classically associated with a 'dry' nocturnal cough, some patients with poorly controlled or untreated asthma can have a wet cough in the morning. It is a common observation to note that patients with asthma have a wet cough following a significant acute exacerbation of asthma often accompanied by harsh sounds on auscultation attributable to residual secretions after resolution of the acute bronchospasm. In contrast, most patients with a persistent bacterial bronchitis will have a daily wet cough, although some patients with relatively mild disease may appear to have a dry cough particularly in the summer. We have also seen children with an unequivocally dry irritating cough who have had thick secretion associated with chronic endobronchial infection on bronchoscopy. Several studies have now established persistent bacterial bronchitis as the most likely diagnosis when a persistent (> 6 weeks) wet cough is reported, yet this diagnosis is frequently missed and misdiagnosis as asthma is common. The diagnostic challenge is compounded on occasions when bacterial bronchitis and asthma coexist, presumably secondary to the impaired mucociliary clearance and mucus plugging. Hence there are a number of reasons why the nature of a cough cannot be interpreted in isolation, one of which being uncertainty among some parents as to whether a cough is 'wet/moist' or 'dry'. We often find it more helpful in getting a true picture to ask more general questions, such as 'does he sound like a 60 a day smoker first thing in the morning?'

### Pertussis in an elderly Asian-American man: a case report [^116nXCCt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Cough is a frequent presenting complaint in the Emergency Department. The differential diagnosis for cough is variable depending on patient age and symptom duration. We report the case of an elderly gentleman with a history of asthma who presented with cough, with the ultimate diagnosis of Bordetella pertussis infection. The management of the patient in the Emergency Department placed hospital staff at risk for infection from a virulent pathogen. Details regarding typical and atypical presentations of pertussis and the establishment of transmission-based precautions are discussed.

### Office management of the patient with chronic cough [^112oAzPy]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic cough is a common complaint in the ambulatory setting and can result in significant compromise in quality of life and, uncommonly, is a presenting symptom of serious or life-threatening disease. Although there are many potential causes, an organized approach to diagnosis that may include therapeutic trials of select medications can establish the diagnosis in over 90% of presenting patients. Management hinges on accurate etiologic diagnosis. Consultation with a pulmonologist, otolaryngologist, or allergist is indicated in selected cases where diagnosis is unclear or specific therapy is mandated.

### Somatic cough syndrome (previously referred to as psychogenic cough) and tic cough (previously referred to as habit cough) in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111xmmdc]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Somatic cough disorder — terminology and differentiation — states that the Committee believes that the term psychogenic cough should be abandoned in favor of somatic cough disorder and clarifies that somatic cough disorder is not to be confused with malingering, which is considered separately from psychogenic disorders because it implies direct gain (financial or emotional) due to feigning of an illness, nor with a conversion disorder because conversion implies that a quasi-neurologic symptom is present that cannot be explained by an underlying neurologic disorder; to be consistent with the DSM-5 classification of diseases, the panel believes the closest diagnosis of a somatizing patient with a cough is "somatic cough disorder".

### Patient information: cough… [^112LUXdu]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Walter K. Cough. JAMA. 2021; 325:

2322. doi: 10.1001/jama.2021.2323 A cough is the forceful release of air from the lungs against closed vocal cords, which results in its characteristic sound. Coughing helps expel inhaled particles, irritants, fluids, or microorganisms and helps clear secretions from the lungs. A cough can also spread viral or bacterial infections to other people. Evaluation by a medical specialist is recommended for coughing that is accompanied by any of the following symptoms: fever, shortness of breath, bloody mucus, hoarse voice, vomiting, weight loss, leg swelling, and difficulty swallowing. Smokers older than 45 years or former smokers aged 55 to 80 years who develop a new cough also should seek medical evaluation. An acute cough is defined as lasting less than 3 weeks and is one of the most frequent symptoms evaluated by primary care clinicians.

For a person with an acute cough, a clinician performs a physical examination and asks about environmental, occupational, and travel exposures. The most frequent cause of acute cough is a common cold, a short-lived viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. Infections of the lower airways, including acute viral bronchitis, pertussis, and tuberculosis, are also potential causes of acute cough. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is a new cause of acute cough and may lead to severe respiratory failure and death. Acute cough may also be due to a worsening underlying medical condition, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, other chronic lung conditions, or heart failure. A subacute cough, defined as lasting 3 to 8 weeks, is most often due to a recent respiratory infection. If a cough does not improve in 4 to 6 weeks, patients should seek further medical evaluation.

The 3 most common causes of chronic cough in nonsmokers who are not taking an ACE inhibitor are asthma, acid reflux, and postnasal drip. Initial treatment should target the most likely cause of chronic cough based on a patient's medical history and physical examination. If a cough persists after the initial treatment, medications can be added because patients may have more than 1 condition that causes cough.

### Chronic cough: state-of-the-art review [^112gKJvB]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Cough is the most common presenting complaint in adults seeking medical treatment in an ambulatory setting. Chronic cough (persisting greater than 3 weeks) can be associated with myriad diseases that may overlap multiple medical specialties. For this reason, a thorough assessment of the patient with chronic cough relies on a multidisciplinary approach and close cooperation between pulmonary medicine, gastroenterology, and otolaryngology. Despite this daunting task, success can be achieved in up to 90% of patients with chronic cough if a systematic and thorough approach is used. The purpose of this review is to summarize the state-of-the-art in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough for the practicing otolaryngologist.

### Acute bronchitis: rapid evidence review [^117PueHE]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis and accounts for more than 3 million outpatient office visits in the United States annually. The differential diagnosis includes exacerbations of preexisting conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure or other causes of acute cough, including pertussis, COVID-19, influenza, and community-acquired pneumonia. Acute cough may present with or without sputum production. Diagnostic testing is not indicated unless there is concern for other potential causes, such as community-acquired pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19. Acute bronchitis is a self-limiting disease. Evidence does not support the use of antitussives, honey, antihistamines, anticholinergics, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Antibiotics do not contribute to the overall improvement of acute bronchitis; although they may decrease the duration of cough by approximately 0.5 days, their use exposes patients to antibiotic-related adverse effects. Therefore, symptom relief and patient education regarding the expected duration of cough (2–3 weeks) are recommended for the management of acute bronchitis. Strategies shown to decrease antibiotic prescribing include delayed antibiotic prescriptions and describing acute bronchitis as a chest cold.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1125JggK]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

How to make the diagnosis of asthma in other contexts — Patients presenting with persistent cough as the only respiratory symptom may have cough‑variant or cough predominant asthma, but common causes of an isolated non‑productive cough also include chronic upper airway cough syndrome (often called 'postnasal drip'), cough induced by angiotensin‑converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, gastroesophageal reflux, chronic sinusitis, post‑infectious cough, inducible laryngeal obstruction, and eosinophilic bronchitis. In cough variant asthma, a persistent cough is the only symptom, or, in cough predominant asthma, the most prominent symptom, and the cough may be worse at night or with exercise, and in some patients it is productive. Spirometry is usually normal, and the only abnormality in lung function may be airway hyperresponsiveness.

### Contemporary topics in pediatric pulmonology for the primary care clinician [^112bjtg6]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2013). Low credibility.

Disorders of the respiratory system are commonly encountered in the primary care setting. The presentations are myriad and this review will discuss some of the more intriguing or vexing disorders that the clinician must evaluate and treat. Among these are dyspnea, chronic cough, chest pain, wheezing, and asthma. Dyspnea and chest pain have a spectrum ranging from benign to serious, and the ability to effectively form a differential diagnosis is critical for reassurance and treatment, along with decisions on when to refer for specialist evaluation. Chronic cough is one of the more common reasons for primary care office visits, and once again, a proper differential diagnosis is necessary to assist the clinician in formulating an appropriate treatment plan. Infant wheezing creates much anxiety for parents and accounts for a large number of office visits and hospital admissions. Common diagnoses and evaluation strategies of early childhood wheezing are reviewed. Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases of children and adults. The epidemiology, diagnosis, evaluation, treatment, and the patient/parent education process will be reviewed. A relatively new topic for primary care clinicians is cystic fibrosis newborn screening. The rationale, methods, outcomes, and implications will be reviewed. This screening program may present some challenges for clinicians caring for newborns, and an understanding of the screening process will help the clinician communicate effectively with parents of the patient.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^115srJRm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Index test(s)

Signs and symptoms

Signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19 disease, and to identify people with COVID‐19 pneumonia. Symptoms are what is experienced by patients, for example cough or nausea. Signs are what can be evaluated by clinical assessment, for example lung auscultation findings, blood pressure or heart rate.

Key symptoms that have been associated with mild to moderate COVID‐19 disease include: troublesome dry cough (for example, coughing more than usual over a one‐hour period, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours), fever greater than 37.8 °C, diarrhoea, headache, breathlessness on light exertion, muscle pain, fatigue, and loss of sense of smell and taste. Red flags indicating possible pneumonia include breathlessness at rest, loss of appetite, confusion, pain or pressure in the chest, and temperature above 38 °C.

Clinical pathway

Important in the context of COVID‐19 is that the pathway is multifaceted because it is designed to care for the diseased individual and to protect the community from further spread. Decisions about patient and isolation pathways for COVID‐19 vary according to health services and settings, available resources, and stages of the epidemic. They will change over time, if and when effective treatments and vaccines are identified. The decision points between these pathways vary, but all include points at which knowledge of the accuracy of diagnostic information is needed to be able to inform rational decision making.

Prior test(s)

In this review on signs and symptoms, no prior tests are required because signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19 disease. Patients can, however, self‐assess before presenting to healthcare services based on their symptoms. This is in contrast to contact tracing, in which patients or participants are tested based on a documented contact with a SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive person and may themselves be asymptomatic.

Role of index test(s)

Signs and symptoms are used as triage tests, that is, to rule out COVID‐19 disease, but also to identify patients with possible COVID‐19 who may require further testing, care escalation or isolation.

Alternative test(s)

Chest X‐ray, ultrasound, and computed tomography (CT) are widely used diagnostic imaging tests to diagnose COVID‐19 pneumonia. Availability and usage varies between settings. We address these radiological tests in a separate review.
