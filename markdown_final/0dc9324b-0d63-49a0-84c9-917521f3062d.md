## Question

My body fat is 5%, and I've never had snoring issues before, but I'm now taking testosterone, Benadryl, and trazodone to help me sleep. What should be the next step in my workup and treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage new-onset snoring after initiating testosterone therapy in a very lean patient who is using trazodone and diphenhydramine for insomnia, including risk-benefit analysis of medications, appropriate screening, diagnostic testing, interim management, and follow-up strategy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the red-flag implications of testosterone on sleep-disordered breathing. Then, I should verify which insomnia agents to stop and which alternatives are safer in suspected OSA. Next, I will review validated screening tools and decide on the most appropriate diagnostic test. After that, I need to plan immediate mitigation steps while awaiting testing. Then, I will outline treatment pathways based on possible PSG outcomes, including OSA, central sleep apnea, or primary insomnia. Finally, I will address longitudinal monitoring of testosterone therapy and sleep outcomes and consider special caveats given the patient's low body fat percentage.

> Let me first confirm the red flag: exogenous testosterone can potentiate obstructive sleep apnea independent of adiposity, so new-onset snoring temporally linked to testosterone initiation warrants expedited evaluation and counseling about this risk, with shared decision-making regarding continuation versus dose adjustment pending workup [^112SrdSh] [^117KbkG9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about insomnia pharmacotherapy in this context; I need to check the guideline stance on trazodone and its actual efficacy. The VA/DoD 2025 guideline recommends avoiding trazodone for chronic insomnia disorder, and in the Sleep-HD RCT, trazodone produced only borderline and nonsustained ISI improvements, which does not justify its risk in a patient now suspected of sleep-disordered breathing, so trazodone should be discontinued with patient counseling about limited benefit and potential adverse effects on sleep architecture and safety [^1115Mv1c] [^116VLkhq].

> Wait, let me verify how to handle diphenhydramine; while we do not have a direct OSA-specific label here, first-generation antihistamines are sedating and anticholinergic, which can reduce upper airway tone and worsen sleep-disordered breathing, so I should recommend stopping diphenhydramine and avoid other CNS depressants because concomitant sedatives can impair ventilatory control and upper airway patency, a principle reinforced by data on benzodiazepine–opioid combinations and healthy-volunteer studies showing altered ventilation and frequent snoring when sedatives are combined with opioids, even though this patient is not on opioids [^111bUL2V] [^113UEqVu] [^113zZPw1].

> Next, I should review validated screening to quantify risk while arranging diagnostic testing. I will use STOP-BANG adapted for non-obese phenotypes and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to estimate sleepiness burden, and I should also quantify insomnia severity with the Insomnia Severity Index, consistent with VA/DoD recommendations to screen patients with sleep complaints for OSA and insomnia using validated tools before deciding on definitive testing and therapy [^113jun74] [^112nbDnU].

> I will now examine the diagnostic pathway. At first glance, a home sleep apnea test might seem convenient for a lean, otherwise healthy patient, but hold on, I should verify whether HSAT will capture the diagnostic nuances here; given the need to distinguish obstructive from possible central events, evaluate REM-related phenomena, and assess the impact of sedatives, in-laboratory attended polysomnography remains the reference standard and is preferred over limited-channel testing in this scenario, particularly when a medication trigger like testosterone is suspected and the pretest probability includes non-obese OSA or mixed phenotypes [^1168AZWr] [^notfound].

> I need to ensure we do a concurrent medication and cardiometabolic assessment aligned with testosterone risks. I should confirm formulation, dose, and timing of testosterone relative to symptom onset; check blood pressure, volume status, and edema because androgens can promote sodium and water retention; and obtain a CBC to monitor hematocrit given TRT's association with erythrocytosis and the AAFP recommendation for annual hematocrit and PSA monitoring in men on TRT aged 40 or older, using these data to inform risk-benefit discussions about continued therapy if sleep-disordered breathing is confirmed or worsened [^112SrdSh] [^117KbkG9].

> While awaiting PSG, I should implement immediate interim management. Let me reconsider the safest pharmacologic option for insomnia when OSA is suspected; orexin receptor antagonists are reasonable because randomized crossover data in untreated mild–moderate and severe OSA demonstrated no clinically meaningful short-term worsening of AHI with daridorexant, though long-term respiratory effects cannot be excluded, and labeling for lemborexant also emphasizes careful evaluation of comorbidities and complex sleep behaviors, so I will prefer a low-dose orexin antagonist if medication is necessary after counseling about risks and monitoring, alongside strict sleep hygiene, avoidance of alcohol and other CNS depressants, and positional strategies that reduce supine sleep pending definitive therapy [^116UmyjY] [^111C7Bmv] [^113bygcR].

> If PSG confirms OSA, I should double-check first-line therapy and TRT implications. Continuous positive airway pressure remains first-line and should be initiated with adherence support, and I should discuss testosterone dose reduction or temporary interruption if OSA is moderate to severe or if CPAP adherence is poor, balancing symptomatic hypogonadism relief against cardiometabolic and neurocognitive risks; repeat hematocrit after stabilization and manage erythrocytosis if present as it may compound nocturnal hypoxemia and viscosity-related risks during untreated OSA [^115CMkHn] [^117KbkG9].

> If PSG excludes OSA but insomnia persists, I need to ensure we follow guideline-concordant care. CBT-I is the first-line therapy, and I should screen again for contributing medical or psychiatric conditions because labels for hypnotics and dual orexin receptor antagonists emphasize that persistent insomnia may signal an unrecognized disorder; medication, if still needed, should be minimal, time-limited, and aligned with patient values after shared decision-making and reassessment of response and adverse effects [^112nbDnU] [^111ZLjss].

> But wait, what if central sleep apnea is identified or suspected on PSG. I should verify contributors such as opioid exposure and other CNS depressants and reduce or taper offending agents when feasible; I would also consider reducing testosterone if ventilatory control instability is suspected, and for persistent CSA despite optimization, I should discuss advanced PAP modalities with a sleep specialist to individualize therapy based on event morphology and comorbidities [^111bUL2V].

> For longitudinal monitoring, I need to check that follow-up is timely and comprehensive. A 4–6 week reassessment after initial interventions should review snoring, daytime sleepiness, insomnia severity, and adherence to any PAP or pharmacologic therapy, and if testosterone is continued, I should follow AAFP guidance for annual monitoring of serum testosterone, hematocrit, and PSA in men aged 40 years or older, while also counseling about edema and hepatic symptom vigilance noted in oral testosterone labeling, even though Jatenzo is not known to cause the severe hepatic complications listed for certain alkylated androgens [^117KbkG9] [^112SrdSh].

> Critical caveat time: the patient's 5% body fat might tempt me to downplay OSA risk, but I should not; non-obese OSA occurs and can be driven by craniofacial anatomy, neuromuscular control, or medication effects, so the temporal association with testosterone initiation keeps OSA high on the differential until definitively excluded by appropriate testing and clinical correlation, reinforcing the choice of full polysomnography and careful medication rationalization in this case [^1168AZWr] [^112SrdSh].

---

The next step is to **stop Benadryl and trazodone immediately** because they can cause or worsen snoring and sleep apnea by relaxing upper airway muscles and depressing respiration. Then, **order a home sleep apnea test (HSAT) or polysomnography** to assess for obstructive sleep apnea [^1168AZWr], which can be triggered or unmasked by testosterone therapy even in lean patients [^112SrdSh]. If OSA is confirmed, initiate CPAP therapy [^115CMkHn] and reassess testosterone use [^117KbkG9]; if OSA is not present, consider alternative non-sedating sleep aids or behavioral strategies [^112nbDnU].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic workup

### Step 1: immediate medication review and adjustment

During the immediate medication review, **discontinue Benadryl and trazodone**, as both can cause or worsen snoring and sleep apnea by relaxing upper airway muscles and depressing respiratory drive. Consider **alternative sleep aids** such as melatonin or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) [^112nbDnU].

---

### Step 2: clinical assessment and screening

Obtain a **detailed sleep history** — including the onset, duration, and severity of snoring; daytime sleepiness; and witnessed apneas — and use **validated questionnaires** such as STOP-Bang or the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to assess the risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [^113jun74].

---

### Step 3: objective sleep testing

For objective testing, a **home sleep apnea test (HSAT)** is appropriate to evaluate for OSA given the recent-onset snoring and testosterone use; if HSAT results are inconclusive or central sleep apnea is suspected, proceed with in-laboratory **polysomnography (PSG)** [^1168AZWr].

---

## Potential mechanisms linking testosterone therapy to snoring

Testosterone therapy can contribute to **snoring and sleep-disordered breathing** via several mechanisms [^112SrdSh]:

- **Upper airway muscle relaxation**: Testosterone may increase upper airway collapsibility, leading to obstruction during sleep.

- **Fluid retention**: Testosterone-induced fluid retention can cause upper airway edema, narrowing the airway and increasing snoring risk [^114LyxL1].

- **Weight gain**: Although the patient currently has low body fat, testosterone therapy can lead to increased muscle mass and potential weight gain, further contributing to airway obstruction [^117KbkG9].

---

## Management strategies

### Step 4: management of confirmed obstructive sleep apnea

If OSA is confirmed on objective testing, implement the following **management strategies**:

- **Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)**: CPAP therapy is the gold standard treatment for OSA and should be initiated promptly [^115CMkHn].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Encourage weight maintenance, regular exercise, and avoidance of alcohol or sedating medications before bedtime [^113bygcR].

- **Reevaluation of testosterone therapy**: Consider adjusting or discontinuing testosterone therapy if it significantly contributes to OSA severity [^112SrdSh].

---

### Step 5: follow-up and monitoring

For follow-up, schedule **regular follow-up** appointments to monitor sleep quality, adherence to CPAP therapy, and testosterone levels [^115CMkHn] [^117KbkG9]. Provide **patient education** about the potential risks associated with testosterone therapy and the importance of adhering to the treatment plan [^112SrdSh].

## Summary of recommended next steps

| **Step** | **Action** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Discontinue Benadryl and trazodone | Medications can exacerbate snoring and sleep apnea |
| 2 | Conduct clinical assessment and screening | Identify risk factors and symptoms of OSA [^113jun74] |
| 3 | Perform HSAT or PSG | Objective diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing [^1168AZWr] |
| 4 | Initiate CPAP therapy if OSA confirmed | Gold standard treatment for OSA [^115CMkHn] |
| 5 | Reevaluate testosterone therapy | Adjust or discontinue if contributing to OSA [^112SrdSh] |
| 6 | Regular follow-up and monitoring | Ensure adherence and monitor treatment effectiveness [^115CMkHn] [^117KbkG9] |

---

The next step in the evaluation and treatment of new-onset snoring in a patient with 5% body fat taking testosterone, Benadryl, and trazodone is to **discontinue Benadryl and trazodone**, conduct a clinical assessment, and **perform objective sleep testing** to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea [^1168AZWr]. If OSA is confirmed, initiate CPAP therapy and reevaluate testosterone therapy [^115CMkHn] [^112SrdSh].

### Jatenzo [^112SrdSh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Potential for adverse effects on spermatogenesis**: With large doses of exogenous androgens, including Jatenzo, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary FSH, possibly leading to adverse effects on semen parameters, including sperm count [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use Jatenzo.

- **Hepatic adverse effects**: Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g. methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects such as peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice. Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. Jatenzo is not known to cause these adverse effects. Nonetheless, patients should report any signs or symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (e.g. jaundice). If these occur, promptly discontinue Jatenzo while the cause is evaluated.

- **Edema**: Androgens, including Jatenzo, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required.

- **Gynecomastia**: Gynecomastia may develop and persist in patients being treated for hypogonadism.

- **Sleep apnea**: The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in patients.

### Quazepam [^116NuZuf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions**: Rare cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis, or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including Quazepam tablets. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with Quazepam tablets should not be rechallenged with the drug.

- **Abnormal thinking and behavior changes**: Abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported in patients treated with sedative-hypnotics, including Quazepam tablets. Some of these changes include decreased inhibition (e.g. aggressiveness and extroversion that seemed out of character), bizarre behavior, and depersonalization. Visual and auditory hallucinations have also been reported. Amnesia and other neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur. Paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, agitation, increased muscle spasticity, and sleep disturbances may occur unpredictably. Complex behaviors such as "sleep-driving" (i.e. driving while not fully awake, with amnesia for the event) have been reported with the use of sedative-hypnotics. These behaviors can occur with initial treatment or in patients previously tolerant of Quazepam tablets or other sedative-hypnotics. Although these behaviors can occur with use at therapeutic doses, risk factors…

### Effect of midazolam co-administered with oxycodone on ventilation: a randomised clinical trial in healthy volunteers [^113UEqVu]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, although midazolam co-administered with oxycodone did not further decrease hypercapnic ventilation compared with oxycodone alone, it decreased tidal volume, increased ventilatory frequency, and increased resting end-tidal P2 in healthy subjects, which suggests that the combination influences ventilation by inducing relaxation of the respiratory muscles. This is an important foundation for understanding the underlying mechanisms. However, additional investigations are necessary to elucidate the potential for upper airway obstruction when benzodiazepines and oxycodone are co-administered, especially in at-risk populations.

### Incidence of skin sensitivity following Dermabond application in pediatric orthopedic surgery [^117DLqrc]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). High credibility.

Dermabond (Dermabond; Ethicon, Sommerville, NJ), is a skin adhesive commonly utilized in pediatric orthopedic surgery for postoperative wound care. Few studies have examined outcomes of Dermabond exposure in children. The purpose of this study is to estimate the incidence of skin reactions following Dermabond exposure in pediatric orthopedic surgery and investigate potential risk factors associated with Dermabond sensitivity.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective study of a level-one pediatric trauma center. All orthopedic surgeries in 2019 were screened for Dermabond application. Three surgeons with the highest rates of Dermabond application defined our cohort. Out of 2,990 surgeries in 2019, the three surgeons performed 234 surgeries with Dermabond. Postoperative reactions and repeat Dermabond exposures were collected for these 234 patients. Subjects with known allergies to Dermabond were excluded. Reactions were defined as discoloration, irritation, and wound dehiscence. Significant differences between patients with repeat Dermabond exposures and those without were determined using χ² analysis. Associations between patient characteristics and sensitivity were determined using logistic regression analysis. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

- **Results**: In all, 234 patients were included for analysis. The mean age at surgery was 12.5 years (SD 6.1), and 39% (92/234) of the cohort was male. Thirty-two patients (14%) experienced skin reactions during the study period (95% CI = 7%-19%). Reactions most frequently included erythema (10/32; 31%) and itching.

### Metoclopramide [^1119rSXS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The preferred parenteral solution is sodium chloride injection (normal saline), which, when combined with metoclopramide injection, USP, can be stored frozen for up to 4 weeks. Metoclopramide injection, USP is degraded when admixed and frozen with dextrose-5% in water. Metoclopramide injection, USP diluted in sodium chloride injection, dextrose-5% in water, dextrose-5% in 0.45% sodium chloride, Ringer's injection, or lactated Ringer's injection may be stored up to 48 hours (without freezing) after preparation if protected from light. All dilutions may be stored unprotected from light under normal light conditions for up to 24 hours after preparation.

- **Acute dystonic reactions**: If acute dystonic reactions occur, inject 50 mg Benadryl® (diphenhydramine hydrochloride) intramuscularly. The symptoms usually will subside.

- **Prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting**: Metoclopramide injection, USP should be given intramuscularly near the end of surgery. The usual adult dose is 10 mg; however, doses of 20 mg may be used.

- **Facilitate small bowel intubation**: If the tube has not passed the pylorus with conventional maneuvers in 10 minutes, a single (undiluted) dose may be administered slowly by the intravenous route over a 1 to 2 minute period. The recommended single dose is as follows:
	- Pediatric patients above 14 years of age and adults – 10 mg metoclopramide base.
	- Pediatric patients (6 to 14 years of age) – 2.5 to 5 mg metoclopramide base.
	- Pediatric patients under 6 years of age – 0.1 mg/kg metoclopramide base.

- **Aid in radiological examinations**: In cases where delayed gastric emptying interferes with radiological procedures, administer as directed.

### Sleep-disordered breathing-year in review 2024 [^1138Ekyn]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

It is acknowledged that nocturnal PSG provides crucial information in challenging cases, such as in children with comorbidities, those younger than 2 years, or when the diagnosis of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (oSDB) is uncertain. An increasing number of experts, however, are questioning the value of the AHI, which, according to official guidelines, is used to guide treatment decisions for children with oSDB. Notably, leading experts on oSDB in adults have argued for several years that the AHI is "neither adequate nor sufficient to diagnose and characterize oSDB severity".

An important publication by Solano-Pérez E. et al. in 2023 echoes these concerns in children. There are several reasons for questioning the relevance of the AHI to diagnose the presence and severity of oSDB in children. First, computing the AHI is challenging: while identifying obstructive apneas on PSG recordings is usually straightforward, distinguishing central from obstructive hypopneas remains difficult, as emphasized again recently. This distinction is crucial for accurately calculating the obstructive AHI, especially in children, where obstructive hypopneas are more frequent than obstructive apneas, unlike in adults. Furthermore, the AHI ignores the duration of breathing cessations and the severity of associated desaturations or arousals, which are critical in determining the long-term consequences of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea, such as cardiovascular disease. As a result, children with similar AHIs may experience different harmful consequences.

### Sex differences in sleep and sleep-disordered breathing [^112pGT7U]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

When examining various sleep disorders — particularly insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, and sleep-related movement disorders — consistent findings reveal sex differences in prevalence, symptom presentation, and, occasionally, treatment outcomes. There is increasing attention on sex differences in sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), focusing on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea (CSA) syndromes, and obesity-related hypoventilation. These differences are partially attributed to variations in upper airway collapsibility, respiratory control, and comorbidities, though they remain largely unexplained and insufficiently studied, especially in non-OSA SDB.

- **Cardiovascular and metabolic consequences**: There are notable sex differences in the consequences of sleep disorders, particularly concerning cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes. However, women are generally underrepresented in most randomized controlled intervention studies on SDB, complicating the assessment of potential differences in treatment outcomes.

This review briefly highlights known sex differences in sleep and control of ventilation and discusses the evidence base and recent findings on sex differences in SDB.

### Association between the triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio and diabetes mellitus likelihood in patients with chronic kidney disease [^113BMHjK]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Trained physicians conducted in-person interviews using standardized questionnaires. The comprehensive assessment encompassed participants' demographics, socioeconomic status, dietary patterns, lifestyle factors, personal and family medical histories, substance use, physical activity, sleep characteristics, financial backgrounds, and education levels. However, the dataset utilized in this secondary analysis lacked detailed information on socioeconomic status, dietary patterns, lifestyle factors, personal and family medical histories, substance use, physical activity, sleep characteristics, and financial backgrounds, representing a limitation of the available data source. All data collection procedures adhered to rigorous protocols and were executed by a team of specially trained healthcare professionals.

- **Anthropometric measurements**: Height and weight were recorded with participants in light clothing, barefoot, and without head covering. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a portable stadiometer, while weight was assessed to the nearest 0.1 kg with calibrated platform scales.

- **Blood pressure measurement**: Blood pressure was measured with a calibrated mercury sphygmomanometer while participants were seated. Two readings were taken, and the average of these readings was utilized for analysis.

- **Classification of smoking status and alcohol intake**: Smoking status was classified as 'never smokers' versus 'ever smokers' (or former). Alcohol intake was categorized as 'never drinkers' versus 'ever drinkers' (or former).

- **Education level stratification**: Education level was stratified into two categories: middle school or below (≤ 9 years).

### Dayvigo [^113bygcR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise patients and their families that Dayvigo may cause sleep paralysis, which is an inability to move or speak for several minutes during sleep-wake transitions, despite being aware of surroundings. Hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, including vivid and disturbing perceptions, and symptoms similar to mild cataplexy may also occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Complex sleep behaviors**: Instruct patients and their families that Dayvigo may cause complex sleep behaviors, including sleep-walking, sleep-driving, preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or engaging in sexual activity while not being fully awake. Tell patients to discontinue Dayvigo and notify their healthcare provider immediately if they develop any of these symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Worsening of depression/suicidal ideation**: Tell patients to report any worsening of depression or suicidal thoughts immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Pregnancy**: Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to Dayvigo during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Concomitant medications**: Ask patients about alcohol consumption, medicines they are taking, and drugs they may be taking without a prescription. Advise patients not to consume alcohol in combination with Dayvigo [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Tolerance, abuse, and dependence**: Tell patients not to increase the dose of Dayvigo on their own, and to inform you if they believe the drug "does not work" [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)].

### Arakoda [^111h7Ctp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Methemoglobinemia**: Asymptomatic elevations in methemoglobin have been observed in the clinical trials of Arakoda [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Institute appropriate therapy if signs or symptoms of methemoglobinemia occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Carefully monitor individuals with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-dependent methemoglobin reductase deficiency. Advise patients to discontinue Arakoda and seek medical attention if signs of methemoglobinemia occur.

- **Psychiatric effects**: In patients receiving Arakoda in clinical trials, psychiatric adverse reactions included sleep disturbances (2.5%), depression/depressed mood (0.3%), and anxiety (0.2%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Arakoda was discontinued in a subject with an adverse reaction of suicide attempt (0.1%). Subjects with a history of psychiatric disorders were excluded from three of five Arakoda trials in which mefloquine was included as a comparator.

	- Psychosis was reported in three patients with a history of psychosis or schizophrenia who received tafenoquine doses (350 mg to 500 mg single dose, or 400 mg daily for 3 days) different from the approved Arakoda regimen. Safety and effectiveness of Arakoda have not been established at doses or regimens other than the approved regimen. Use of Arakoda at doses or regimens other than a 200-mg weekly dose is not approved by the FDA.

	- Arakoda is contraindicated in patients with a history of psychotic disorders or psychotic symptoms [see Contraindication (4)]. If psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, or grossly disorganized thinking) occur, discontinuation of the medication is recommended.

### Quviviq [^111ZLjss]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The need to evaluate for co-morbid diagnoses arises because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a medical and/or psychiatric disorder. Treatment of insomnia should be initiated only following a careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new cognitive or behavioral abnormalities may result from an unrecognized underlying psychiatric or medical disorder and can emerge during the course of treatment with sleep-promoting drugs such as Quviviq.

### Impact of Alzheimer's disease on sleep in adults with Down syndrome [^1147ktH7]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Down syndrome (DS) represents the largest genetic form of Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting millions worldwide. The triplication of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21 is the main driver that accelerates amyloid beta (Aβ) production, resulting in early accumulation of amyloid plaques and subsequent tau deposition in the brains of individuals with DS before their fourth decade of life. Notably, AD biomarker changes during the preclinical stage strikingly mirror those observed in both sporadic AD and autosomal dominant AD (ADAD). The age of AD dementia onset in adults with DS is, on average, 54 years, which is 20 to 30 years younger compared to sporadic AD. However, there remains considerable variability in the age of symptom onset among individuals with DS-associated AD (DSAD), and the factors underlying this variability are still unknown. Sleep disorders have been proposed as a potential modifiable factor contributing to this variability.

The triplication of chromosome 21 also confers other phenotypic and physiological traits, such as a small oropharynx and hypotonia, predisposing individuals with DS to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is the most common sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) disorder in individuals with DS, characterized by repeated episodes of upper airway collapse, leading to sleep fragmentation and chronic intermittent hypoxia. The high incidence of OSA in DS is primarily driven by anatomical abnormalities like midfacial and mandibular hypoplasia, macroglossia, glossoptosis, and adenotonsillar hypertrophy, which narrow the airway.

### Treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder with trazodone: report of 3 cases [^113wWiqK]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder is a sleep disturbance characterized by the absence of regular paralysis during REM sleep, accompanied by dream enactment behavior. The available pharmacotherapy options for treating REM sleep behavior disorder are limited, and the utilization of antidepressants has yielded mixed results. We report three cases of isolated REM sleep behavior disorder improved with trazodone. Doses of 50–100 mg of trazodone at bedtime over 4–6 months resulted in significant clinical improvement. These cases highlight that trazodone could serve as a treatment for isolated REM sleep behavior disorder that does not respond to traditional treatments at submaximal dosages.

### Cobenfy [^115KYHva]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Inform patients about the **risk of use in patients with biliary disease**: COBENFY can increase liver enzymes, necessitating specific monitoring of liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. Patients should report symptoms such as dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, or upper abdominal pain to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Inform patients about **decreased gastrointestinal motility**: COBENFY can delay or slow the emptying of food in the stomach. Patients should inform their healthcare provider about symptoms of gastrointestinal obstructive disorders and conditions such as ulcerative colitis, intestinal atony, and myasthenia gravis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Advise patients about the **risk of angioedema**: Hypersensitivity reactions to COBENFY may result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should seek medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. If such symptoms occur, discontinue COBENFY and seek immediate medical attention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Inform patients about the **risk of use in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma**: Pupillary dilation may occur with COBENFY use, and in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle-closure glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Firmagon [^112yfwtP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Females and males of reproductive potential**: Based on findings in animals and the mechanism of action, degarelix may impair fertility in males and females of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

- **Geriatric use**: Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Firmagon, 82% were age 65 and over, while 42% were age 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; however, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

- **Renal impairment**: No pharmacokinetic studies in renally impaired patients have been conducted. At least 20–30% of a given dose of degarelix is excreted unchanged in the urine. A population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from the randomized study demonstrated that there is no significant effect of mild renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCL) 50–80 mL/min] on either the degarelix concentration or testosterone concentration. Data on patients with moderate or severe renal impairment is limited; therefore, degarelix should be used with caution in patients with CrCL < 50 mL/min.

- **Hepatic impairment**: Patients with hepatic impairment were excluded from the randomized trial. A single dose of 1 mg degarelix administered as an intravenous infusion over 1 hour was studied in 16 non-prostate cancer patients with either mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. Compared to non-prostate cancer patients with n.

### Cobenfy [^1119Hkae]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In clinical studies with Cobenfy, transient increases in liver enzymes with rapid decline occurred, consistent with transient biliary obstruction due to biliary contraction and possible gallstone passage [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Cobenfy is not recommended for patients with active biliary disease such as symptomatic gallstones. Assess liver enzymes and bilirubin prior to initiating Cobenfy and as clinically indicated during treatment. The occurrence of symptoms such as dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, or upper abdominal pain should prompt assessment for gallbladder disorders, biliary disorders, and pancreatitis, as clinically indicated. Discontinue Cobenfy in the presence of signs or symptoms of substantial liver injury such as jaundice, pruritus, or alanine aminotransferase levels more than five times the upper limit of normal or five times baseline values.

- **Decreased gastrointestinal motility**: Cobenfy contains trospium chloride. Trospium chloride, like other antimuscarinic agents, may decrease gastrointestinal motility. Administer Cobenfy with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)]. Use Cobenfy with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, intestinal atony, and myasthenia gravis.

- **Risk of angioedema**: Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with Cobenfy and trospium chloride, a component of Cobenfy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Effectiveness of existing insomnia therapies for patients undergoing hemodialysis: A randomized clinical trial [^116VLkhq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The Sleep-HD (trazodone) study, published by Rajnish Mehrotra and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, focuses on insomnia and chronic kidney disease. The core research question is: what is the role of trazodone in patients undergoing hemodialysis with mild or moderate chronic insomnia? This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT) involves a population of 83 patients (41 female, 42 male).

Inclusion criteria include patients undergoing hemodialysis with an Insomnia Severity Index score ≥ 10, experiencing sleep disturbances on ≥ 3 nights per week for ≥ 3 months. Key exclusion criteria encompass severe cognitive impairment, severe depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, alcohol or substance misuse, severe restless legs syndrome, pregnancy/lactation, and anticipated life expectancy of less than 3 months.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Trazodone group (n = 42)**: Starting dose of 50 mg nightly, titrated to 100 mg for 6 weeks
	- **Placebo group (n = 41)**: Matching placebo for 6 weeks

- **Primary outcome**: There was a borderline significant increase in the reduction of the Insomnia Severity Index score at week 7 (4.2 points vs. 3.1 points; AD 1.08 points, 95% CI -1.34 to 3.49).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was a borderline significant decrease in the reduction of the Insomnia Severity Index score at week 25 (4 points vs. 4.3 points; AD -0.34 points, 95% CI -3.17 to 2.49). There was no significant difference in reduction.

### Transgender and gender diverse patients' experiences with pregnancy-related genetics discussions: A qualitative study [^114851TX]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

Medical guidelines advise against the use of testosterone during pregnancy due to inadequate safety data and the potential for androgenic effects on the fetus (Hahn et al; Hoffkling et al.) Exposure to exogenous testosterone during pregnancy can result in varying degrees of virilization of the genitalia, potentially leading to intersex variations. The medicalization of intersex variations, particularly the term "ambiguous genitalia", highlights the discomfort with intersex variations within healthcare settings. Historically, non‐binary genitalia have been pathologized, leading to unnecessary interventions to enforce binary norms. This stigma is evident in medical guidelines that contraindicate testosterone use during TGD patients' pregnancies, implying that intersex traits are undesirable due to concerns about potential androgenic effects on the fetus. Queer theory challenges these cisnormative and heteronormative practices by advocating for the acceptance of bodily diversity and questioning why certain bodies are deemed problematic or in need of correction (Watson et al.) When counseling TGD patients, providers should begin by reviewing guidelines and practices related to exogenous testosterone use as part of their preparation. During the session, it is essential to openly discuss the limitations of existing literature and clearly outline both the known and unknown effects of testosterone during pregnancy, while also being careful to avoid pathologizing intersex traits. This approach provides TGD patients with accurate information.

### Pre-morbid sleep disturbance and its association with stroke severity: Results from the international INTERSTROKE study [^113rGqMX]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Methods and materials**: INTERSTROKE was a large case–control study that recruited participants with acute stroke and age/sex-matched controls from 32 countries between 2007 and 2015. Eligible stroke patients were those admitted to the hospital with a clinical diagnosis of first acute stroke, as defined by the World Health Organization, with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging available or planned within one week of presentation. Patients were recruited within 72 hours of hospital admission.

- **Population**: A standardized questionnaire was administered by trained research staff, and clinical measurements (e.g. vital signs, anthropometric measurements) were recorded at the time of the interview and/or from the participant's notes. A valid proxy respondent (spouse or first-degree relative living in the same home or aware of the participant's medical history and therapies) was employed for those unable to complete the questionnaire due to severe stroke and/or aphasia. For the analysis, a subset of participants (stroke cases) was included who completed a supplementary questionnaire incorporating questions about sleep practices (n = 2361). This questionnaire was introduced in July 2012 to consecutive participants in participating centers.

- **Sleep disturbance**: Participants (or proxy respondents) were administered a series of standardized questions about sleep in the month prior to stroke, which have been described previously. In brief, nocturnal sleep duration, self-reported sleep quality, nocturnal awakening, sleep onset latency (SOL), and daytime sleeping habits were ascertained.

### AmbienCR [^11121PYd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Need to evaluate for comorbid diagnoses**: Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only following a careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative-hypnotic drugs, including zolpidem.

- **Severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions**: Cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis, or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including zolpidem. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the throat, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with zolpidem should not be rechallenged with the drug.

- **Abnormal thinking and behavioral changes**: Abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported in patients treated with sedative-hypnotics, including AmbienCR. Some of these changes included decreased inhibition, such as aggressiveness and extroversion, that seemed out of character.

The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative/hypnotic drugs, including eszopiclone. Because some of the important adverse effects of eszopiclone appear to be dose-related, it is important to use the lowest possible effective dose, especially in the elderly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

- **Severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions**: Rare cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis, or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including eszopiclone. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with eszopiclone should not be rechallenged with the drug.

Dendrites are pseudo-coloured in yellow and axons in green. Synapse number quantification of the hippocampal CA1 neuropil indicates a decrease in prion disease (orange bars) and partial but significant restoration with trazodone treatment (green bars).

- **Mitochondrial analysis**: (B) Representative SEM images from (i) control (NBH); (ii) prion; and (iii) prion + trazodone from CA1 pyramidal neuron somata, with mitochondria perimeter coloured in pink. The numbers of mitochondria/neuron are reduced in prion disease (orange bars) and restored to wild-type levels with trazodone treatment (green bars). (C) Mitochondria counted within synapses increase with trazodone treatment.

- **Protein and stress test results**: (D) Immunoblots and quantification (bar graph, right) of oxidative phosphorylation proteins (I, II, III, IV and V) show restoration with trazodone treatment. (E) Mitochondrial stress test on isolated mitochondria from control (NBH), prion, and prion + trazodone treatment groups at 10 weeks post-inoculation (wpi) as before shows oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) from 0 to 65 minutes, with time points of stressor addition (ADP, oligomycin, FCCP, and rotenone + antimycin A) labelled. Basal respiration is defined as the initial OCR value minus the rotenone + antimycin A OCR value; maximal respiratory capacity was defined as the OCR value.

### The prevalence of central sleep apnea in new referrals to a sleep surgery clinic [^111pDyUU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a complex sleep disorder characterized by upper airway collapse despite respiratory effort, leading to drops in oxygen levels or arousals. Untreated OSA has been associated with an increased risk of both cardiovascular and neurocognitive comorbidities and mortality. The gold standard treatment option for OSA has historically been positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy; however, many patients struggle to tolerate or adhere to using PAP adequately and turn to alternative therapies. Patients often will be referred to a "PAP Alternative Clinic" or a "Sleep Surgery Clinic" to learn about and pursue other treatment options, including mandibular advancement devices or oral appliance therapy, positional therapy, and upper airway surgery (including upper airway stimulation, pharyngeal surgery, and skeletal surgery). Interest in sleep surgery has increased over the years due to enhanced awareness of alternatives through marketing and research, newer techniques and additional treatment options, notably hypoglossal nerve stimulation therapy.

Although OSA is the most common type of sleep apnea, other types, including central sleep apnea (CSA), exist. CSA has a considerably lower prevalence than OSA, accounting for around 5% to 10% of sleep medicine clinic patients and 1% of diagnoses on polysomnography. CSA, however, is far more prevalent in patients with heart failure, occurring in 30% to 40% of this population. CSA patient presentation can be similar to that of an OSA patient, with complaints of gasping, intermittent snoring, sleep fragmentation, and sleepiness.

### Testosterone replacement therapy for male hypogonadism [^117KbkG9]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Testosterone deficiency, or male hypogonadism, is a clinical syndrome characterized by persistently low serum testosterone levels accompanied by symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency. Studies suggest that testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) may improve sexual function, depressive symptoms, bone density, and lean body mass. However, the evidence is conflicting regarding its effect on cardiovascular events and mortality. Although prior studies suggested that TRT increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, a large randomized trial showed that it does not increase the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, even in patients at high risk.

After a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and risks through shared decision-making, TRT should be considered for men with testosterone deficiency to correct selected symptoms and induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics.

- **Treatment method**: Consider patient preference, pharmacokinetics, potential for medication interactions, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost.
- **Monitoring requirements**: Clinicians should monitor men receiving TRT for symptom improvement, potential adverse effects, and adherence. Serum testosterone, hematocrit, and prostate-specific antigen levels should be measured at baseline and at least annually in men 40 years or older receiving TRT.

### Arava [^117PFCVx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of Arava in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was demonstrated in three controlled trials, showing a reduction in signs and symptoms, as well as inhibition of structural damage. In two placebo-controlled trials, efficacy was demonstrated for improvement in physical function. In these trials, efficacy was evaluated by:

- **Reduction of signs and symptoms**: Relief of signs and symptoms was assessed using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 Responder Index, a composite of clinical, laboratory, and functional measures in rheumatoid arthritis. An "ACR20 Responder" is a patient who had ≥ 20% improvement in both tender and swollen joint counts and in 3 of the following 5 criteria: physician global assessment, patient global assessment, functional ability measure (Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire [MHAQ]), visual analog pain scale, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. An "ACR20 Responder at Endpoint" is a patient who completed the study and was an ACR20 Responder at the completion of the study.

- **Inhibition of structural damage**: Inhibition of structural damage compared to control was assessed using the Sharp score, a composite score of x-ray erosions and joint space narrowing in hands/wrists and forefeet.

- **Improvement in physical function**: Improvement in physical function was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form (SF-36).

In all Arava trials, participants of at least 18 years of age and in ARA functional class of I, II, or III received an initial loading dose.

### Dimenhydrinate [^112s6Rww]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Dimenhydrinate in the injectable form is indicated when the oral form is impractical.

- **Adults**: Nausea or vomiting may be controlled for approximately 4 hours with a 50 mg dose, which can be repeated every 4 hours to prevent symptoms. Administration may cause drowsiness in some patients. In conditions where drowsiness is acceptable or desirable, a dose of 100 mg every 4 hours may be given. For intramuscular administration, inject each milliliter (50 mg) of solution as needed. For intravenous administration, dilute each milliliter (50 mg) of solution in 10 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, and inject over 2 minutes.

- **Pediatric**: For intramuscular administration, administer 1.25 mg/kg of body weight or 37.5 mg/m² of body surface area four times daily. The maximum dosage should not exceed 300 mg daily (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever the solution and container allow.

### Mitigo [^111bUL2V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders, including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Risks from concomitant use with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants**: Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of MITIGO® with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g. non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Use of neuroleptics in conjunction with neuraxial morphine may increase the risk of respiratory depression. Observational studies have demonstrated that the concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to the use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risks with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Beyfortus [^111uwYz2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Refer to Figure 1 for pre-filled syringe components.

- **Administration instructions for single-dose pre-filled syringe**: Holding the Luer lock in one hand (avoid holding the plunger rod or syringe body), unscrew the syringe cap by twisting it counter-clockwise with the other hand. Attach a Luer lock needle to the pre-filled syringe by gently twisting the needle clockwise onto the pre-filled syringe until slight resistance is felt. Hold the syringe body with one hand and carefully pull the needle cover straight off with the other hand. Ensure not to hold the plunger rod while removing the needle cover or the rubber stopper may move. Do not touch the needle, let it touch any surface, recap the needle, or detach it from the syringe. Administer the entire contents of the Beyfortus pre-filled syringe as an IM injection, preferably in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. The gluteal muscle should not be used as an injection site because of the risk of damage to the sciatic nerve. Discard the syringe into a sharps container. If two injections are required, repeat the above steps at a different injection site.

### Sleep-disordered breathing-year in review 2024 [^1145DzeE]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

The spectrum of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (oSDB) in children ranges from primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Primary snoring is characterized by snoring occurring more than three nights per week with normal overnight polysomnography (PSG) and is present in 6%–17% of all children. OSAS is defined by an increased apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) — the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour — during PSG and is present in 1%–5% of all children. It is widely acknowledged that an AHI of at least 5 per hour warrants consideration of treatment, most commonly adenotonsillectomy. However, when the AHI is less than 5 per hour and there are no clinical signs of complications related to oSDB, watchful waiting may be a valid approach. Official guidelines generally recommend performing an overnight PSG in all children with a history of chronic snoring to measure the AHI, assess the severity of oSDB, and determine the need for treatment. In practice, however, most children do not have access to overnight PSG due to the limited availability of sleep laboratories worldwide.

My personal review of last year's literature on oSDB in children focuses on publications dealing with the recognition of children who require treatment for oSDB, including the place of overnight PSG in their management.

### Quviviq [^116UmyjY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients with compromised respiratory function, specifically those with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), were studied to assess the respiratory depressant effect of Quviviq. The evaluation occurred after one night and after five consecutive nights of treatment with Quviviq 50 mg in a randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover study involving 25 patients with mild to moderate OSA. These patients, with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 5 to 30 events per hour of sleep and not using CPAP, received once-daily dosing of 50 mg in the evening. On Day 5, the mean treatment difference (daridorexant – placebo) for AHI was 0.74 (90% CI, -1.43 to 2.92).

Quviviq was also evaluated after 5 consecutive nights of treatment in a similar study involving 16 patients with severe OSA (AHI ≥ 30 events per hour of sleep, with a studied range of 30.8–82.2 events per hour) who were not using CPAP. Following once-daily dosing of 50 mg in the evening, the mean treatment difference (daridorexant – placebo) on Day 5 for AHI was -3.74 (90% CI, -11.71 to 4.23). Due to study limitations, including the short duration of the studies, clinically meaningful respiratory effects of Quviviq in OSA cannot be excluded, including for long-term treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

For patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the respiratory depressant effect of Quviviq was evaluated after one night and after five consecutive nights of treatment with Quviviq 50 mg in a randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover study involving 25 patients with moderate COPD (FEV1/FVC ratio ≤ 70% and 40% ≤ FEV1 < 80% of predicted).

### Sleep disruption and atrial fibrillation: evidence, mechanisms and clinical implications [^112X9SL2]. Circulation Research (2025). Low credibility.

This was further clarified in an elegant study by the same group when they evaluated 24 patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who underwent right atrial electrophysiological mapping. The patients were then randomized to either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy — the recommended treatment for OSA — or no OSA therapy. After more than six months, these patients underwent a repeat invasive right atrial mapping study. They demonstrated that effective CPAP therapy resulted in faster atrial conduction velocity and improved atrial bipolar voltage than no CPAP therapy, independent of changes in systemic blood pressure or weight. This study, although not powered for atrial fibrillation outcomes, clearly demonstrated the impact of OSA on atrial tissue characteristics and showed a positive change with CPAP therapy. It will be interesting to see changes in the left atrium with a similar strategy.

- **Need to evaluate for co-morbid diagnoses**: Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new cognitive or behavioral abnormalities may result from an unrecognized underlying psychiatric or physical disorder and can emerge during the course of treatment with hypnotic drugs such as BELSOMRA.

### The whimsical nature of airway obstruction during drug-induced sleep endoscopy [^111nDWy5]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Low credibility.

A 47-year-old male patient diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) sought alternatives to positive airway pressure, prompting evaluation with drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE). He underwent a specialized DISE with nasal airflow and pharyngeal pressure monitoring. During obstructive apneas, airflow and pressure signals demonstrated dynamic, multilevel upper airway collapse, with shifting sites of airflow obstruction as respiratory effort increased. This case report illustrates how quantitative airflow and pressure measurements can complement the standard DISE exam and aid in surgical decision-making.

### Feasibility and clinical efficacy of focal pulsed field ablation in patients with non-pulmonary vein triggered atrial arrhythmia from the superior caval vein [^114EVd8w]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

In patients with atrial arrhythmias originating from the superior vena cava (SVC), the use of radiofrequency energy to isolate the SVC is associated with a significant risk of injury both to the phrenic nerve and the sinus node. Pulsed field ablation (PFA) may overcome the disadvantages of thermal energy and improve both ablation efficacy and safety.

- **Objective**: We report the feasibility, safety, and clinical efficacy of focal monopolar PFA in patients with the origin of their atrial arrhythmia in the SVC.

- **Methods**: Nine patients (7 men, age 66 ± 8 years) with SVC-induced paroxysmal AF (n = 3), persistent AF (n = 5), or frequent premature atrial beats (n = 1) underwent SVC isolation using focal monopolar PFA.

- **Results**: Acute circumferential SVC isolation was achieved in all cases, using 22 Ampere (A) or 25A in areas with or without phrenic capture, respectively. The safety profile was excellent: two patients had transient sinus arrest and two had transient phrenic nerve stunning. Sinus node and phrenic nerve function recovered during the procedure, and no permanent damage was observed at follow-up. Coronary vasospasm occurred (and quickly resolved after injection of nitroglycerin) in one patient during additional ablation of a focal atrial tachycardia at the coronary sinus ostium. Kidney function remained stable before and after ablation in all patients.

- **Conclusions**: In this patient cohort with SVC-triggered atrial arrhythmia, isolation using focal monopolar PFA was feasible, effective, and safe. No permanent injury to the phrenic nerve or sinus node was observed.

### Diagnosis and management in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome: first international consensus statement [^116Me7w4]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2024). Low credibility.

Otolaryngology and anaesthesiology

- **Hearing**: The typical facial characteristics in individuals with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) include a small chin and a small oral cavity, which can result in airway difficulties. Together with gastro-oesophageal reflux, these features can lead to complications such as middle ear infections. Conductive, sensorineural, and mixed hearing loss may result. Therefore, regular auditory evaluation is recommended.

- **Sleep**: Abnormal facial anatomy and increased collapsibility of the laryngeal walls predispose individuals with RTS to higher rates of sleep-disordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Sleep disorders are frequent in children and occur in 62% of adults. OSA is typically characterized by snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness, affecting 25% of adults with RTS. If present in children, the facial anatomy is often markedly abnormal and accompanied by obesity, hypotonia, and adenotonsillar hypertrophy. As with the general population, management should consider various causal factors and potential difficulties in treating both children and adults with RTS. Assessment of sleep patterns using a validated questionnaire, such as the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children, may offer information on both sleep patterns and response to therapy. Before major surgical intervention, polysomnography should be considered. Management of sleep disorders aims to implement healthy sleep practices, particularly concerning sleep position, behavioral strategies, and education on pharmacological interventions.

### Clinical utility of limited channel sleep studies versus polysomnography for obstructive sleep apnoea [^1168AZWr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common cause of sleep disturbance, characterized by repetitive upper airway obstruction during sleep. OSA is associated with daytime sleepiness, reduced quality of life, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. It can be diagnosed using several different strategies. The reference test is fully supervised polysomnography, which is expensive and time-consuming. Other diagnostic tests, known as limited channel sleep studies, include fewer parameters than polysomnography and are less resource-intensive. However, these tests may have varying diagnostic performances, leading to differences in clinical outcomes.

- **Objectives**: To assess the clinical impact (outcome on a participant level) of a strategy where treatment follows diagnostic testing (test-treatment combination) using limited channel sleep studies compared to polysomnography in people with suspected obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).

- **Search methods**: We searched two databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE) up to 11 May 2023 using search terms related to OSA and polysomnography developed by our information specialist.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials that compared any limited channel sleep studies with Level I fully supervised polysomnography in adults (aged 18 years and older) with suspected OSA. Our primary outcome was sleepiness, and our secondary outcomes were quality of life, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events and correlating risk factors, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) usage, and serious adverse events.

### The prevalence of central sleep apnea in new referrals to a sleep surgery clinic [^115W35BM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

As home sleep study testing and referrals to sleep surgery clinics have increased, particularly in older patients since the advent of hypoglossal nerve stimulation, all providers should be aware of the possibility of patients with CSA (i.e. not isolated OSA) being referred. The percentage of such "incorrect" referrals has not been previously studied nor reported. As such, the goal of the present manuscript was to comprehensively evaluate a prospective sample referred to a sleep surgery clinic for the presence of clinically significant CSA, defined as having more than 25% central or mixed events, and to assess specific characteristics of these patients.

### Results of the solriamfetol's effect on cognitive health in apnea participants during a randomized placebo-controlled study (SHARP): A randomized placebo-controlled double-blind repeated-measures crossover phase IV clinical trial of the effect of the wake-promoting agent solriamfetol on cognitive function in OSA with excessive daytime sleepiness and cognitive impairment [^1146d7Yh]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

The SHARP study, published in the journal *Chest* in 2025, investigates the impact of solriamfetol, an NDRI, on patients with cognitive impairment associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and excessive daytime sleepiness. This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) included a population of 59 patients (21 female, 38 male), with inclusion criteria focused on cognitive impairment linked to OSA and excessive daytime sleepiness.

- **Exclusion criteria**: The key exclusion criteria were usual bedtime later than 1:00 am, shift work, use of medications that could affect excessive daytime sleepiness, contraindication for solriamfetol, use of positive airway pressure machines without downloadable adherence data, sleep disorders other than OSA, excessive caffeine use, and clinically relevant medical, behavioral, or psychiatric disorders associated with impaired cognitive function.

- **Interventions**: The study interventions included 30 patients receiving solriamfetol (75 mg daily for 3 days, then 150 mg daily for 2 weeks) and 29 patients receiving a matching placebo each morning for 2 weeks.

- **Primary outcome**: The primary outcome demonstrated a significant increase in improvement as measured by the postdose average Digit Symbol Substitution Test scores from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (6.49 points vs. 4.74 points; MD 1.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 3.04).

### Management of persistent, post-adenotonsillectomy obstructive sleep apnea in children: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111yP91x]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

This guideline was developed to inform clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders regarding the management of persistent obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), focusing on questions that address significant management issues. As the first guideline for children with persistent OSA, we also highlighted known gaps in the literature to encourage further research in this area.

These guidelines are not intended to impose a standard of care but provide the basis for rational decisions in the management of persistent OSA in children. Clinicians, patients, third-party payers, institutional review committees, other stakeholders, and/or the courts should never view these recommendations as dictates. No guidelines and recommendations can take into account all of the often-compelling unique individual clinical circumstances. Therefore, no one charged with evaluating clinicians' actions should attempt to apply the recommendations from these guidelines by rote or in a blanket fashion.

Statements about the underlying values and preferences, as well as qualifying remarks accompanying each recommendation, are integral parts and serve to facilitate more accurate interpretation. They should never be omitted when quoting or translating recommendations from these guidelines.

- **Definition of persistent OSA**: It is debatable whether a single parameter can determine the severity of OSA. Nevertheless, obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (oAHI) cutoffs from in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) are often used to dictate care. The oAHI corresponds to the sum of obstructive apneas, mixed apneas, and hypopneas per hour of total sleep time.

### Xyosted [^114LyxL1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Potential for adverse effects on spermatogenesis**: With large doses of exogenous androgens, including XYOSTED, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters, including sperm count [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or continue using XYOSTED.

- **Hepatic adverse effects**: Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g. methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects, such as peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice. Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate, which elevates blood levels for prolonged periods, has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. XYOSTED is not known to produce these adverse effects. Nonetheless, patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (e.g. jaundice). If these occur, promptly discontinue XYOSTED while the cause is evaluated.

- **Edema**: Androgens, including XYOSTED, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required.

- **Gynecomastia**: Gynecomastia may develop and may persist in patients being treated for hypogonadism.

### Novel perspective of 'poor sleep' in public health: A narrative review [^115PFzv8]. BMJ Public Health (2024). Low credibility.

The identification of poor sleepers in primary care can be informed by certain criteria, which are illustrated in Figure 2B. The potential detection tools and their characteristics are detailed in Figure 2C. Ideally, a tool for detecting poor sleepers should effectively combine the ability to capture subjective measures, such as a patient's perception of their sleep experience, with objective parameters, like sleep quantity. Furthermore, it should be open-ended, concise, and adaptable for self-assessment.

Self-assessment methods could encourage poor sleepers to seek medical care. However, it is important to note that the correlation between self-reported and objectively measured sleep is moderately biased; only healthcare professionals can diagnose poor sleep. Five self-rated questionnaires are of interest because they focus on sleep quality and quality of life, which may aid in assessing poor sleepers:

1. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index assesses sleep quality and disturbances.
2. The Mini-Sleep Questionnaire investigates both sleep quality and daytime sleepiness.
3. The Jenkins Sleep Scale evaluates common symptoms in the general population, such as trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night (with or without trouble falling back asleep), and feeling tired after sleep.
4. The Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire assesses sleep onset, quality of sleep, awakening from sleep, and behavior following wakefulness.
5. The National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System is a validated questionnaire associated with these measures.

### Orgovyx [^114vpRZP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Relugolix is a nonpeptide GnRH receptor antagonist that competitively binds to pituitary GnRH receptors, thereby reducing the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and consequently testosterone.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Relugolix reduced LH, FSH [see Figure 1], and testosterone concentrations after oral administration of the recommended loading dose of 360 mg and a 120 mg dose once daily. Out of 622 patients, 56% had testosterone concentrations at castrate levels (280 ng/dL) or baseline at 90 days was 55% [see Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Figure 1**: Mean (± 95% CI) follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations over time in HERO.

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled (open-label moxifloxacin), parallel-group thorough QT/QTc study, no increase in mean QTc interval > 10 ms was identified after administration of a single 60 mg or 360 mg (0.2 or 1 times the recommended loading dose, respectively) relugolix dose.

### Effect of midazolam co-administered with oxycodone on ventilation: a randomised clinical trial in healthy volunteers [^113zZPw1]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepines can exacerbate opioid-induced respiratory depression by furthering the decrease in central respiratory drive and causing loss of upper airway patency, potentially leading to airway obstruction. This study aimed to determine if co-administration of benzodiazepines and opioids significantly decreases hypercapnic ventilation compared with opioids alone.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomised, double-blind, four-period crossover trial in 20 healthy participants to assess whether intravenous midazolam (0.0375 mg/kg in the first five participants; 0.075 mg/kg in 15 participants) plus oral oxycodone (10 mg), compared with oxycodone alone, decreases minute ventilation at an end-tidal carbon dioxide (Pco₂) of 7.3 kPa using modified Read rebreathing methodology.

- **Results**: Midazolam administered with oxycodone, compared with oxycodone alone, did not significantly decrease minute ventilation at an end-tidal Pco₂ of 7.3 kPa (23.5 vs. 25.2 L/min; mean difference -1.7 L/min, one-sided 95% confidence interval -∞ to 1.6; P = 0.21). However, midazolam plus oxycodone increased resting end-tidal Pco₂ compared with oxycodone alone (5.8 vs. 5.6 kPa; mean difference 0.2 kPa, 95% confidence interval 0.0–0.4). Nine of 15 (60%) participants fell asleep or snored on midazolam plus oxycodone, compared with 0 of 15 (0%) on oxycodone alone.

- **Conclusions**: Midazolam co-administered with oxycodone did not decrease hypercapnic ventilation compared with oxycodone alone but did affect tidal volume, ventilatory frequency, and resting end-tidal Pco₂. These findings support the assertion that the combination influences certain respiratory parameters.

### The Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): Validated clinical assessment instruments [^117Lyxm6]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

In evaluating a patient with cognitive or behavioral symptoms, a clinician should always ask questions about sleep. Instruments useful for this purpose include the Mayo Sleep Questionnaire or the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease (SCOPA). Sleep-related symptoms may be hallmarks of certain neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia, or sleep disorders may adversely impact overall function in any individual, particularly those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. Addressing sleep problems through lifestyle interventions improves general health. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder — with loss of REM-associated atonia resulting in acting out of dreams, often violently — has a strong association with Lewy body dementia (LBD). Symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorders are even more likely to be under-reported by informants and, almost never, by patients. REM sleep behavioral disturbances may precede by many years what ultimately evolves to become dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or Parkinson's-related dementia. In cognitively unimpaired persons, reduced slow-wave sleep activity and low sleep efficiency are both associated with an accelerated rate of cortical amyloid-beta plaque deposition, and hence accumulation of Alzheimer's disease-related neuropathological change.

Sleep disorders have multiple relationships with cognitive and behavioral syndromes. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is detrimental to optimal brain function and health. It is common in MCI and can exacerbate impairments in cognition, mood/behavior, and/or function. Treatment of OSA may reverse cognitive and behavioral decline in some patients.

### Atrial fibrillation and semaglutide effects in obesity-related heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: STEP-HFpEF program [^116EqHdD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Obesity is a key factor in the development and progression of both heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). In the STEP-HFpEF Program, which comprises the STEP-HFpEF (Research Study to Investigate How Well Semaglutide Works in People Living With Heart Failure and Obesity) and STEP-HFpEF DM (Research Study to Look at How Well Semaglutide Works in People Living With Heart Failure, Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes) trials, once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg improved HF-related symptoms, physical limitations, exercise function, and reduced body weight in patients with obesity-related HFpEF. Whether the effects of semaglutide in this patient group differ in participants with and without AF (and across various AF types) has not been fully examined.

- **Objectives**: The goals of this study were to evaluate baseline characteristics and clinical features of patients with obesity-related HFpEF with and without a history of AF, and to determine if the efficacy of semaglutide across all key trial outcomes are influenced by baseline history of AF (and AF types) in the STEP-HFpEF Program.

- **Methods**: This was a secondary analysis of pooled data from the STEP-HFpEF and STEP-HFpEF DM trials. Patients with heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45%, body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m², and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire–Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CSS) < 90 points were randomized 1:1 to receive once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg or matching placebo for 52 weeks.

### Prevalence and clinical aspects of obstructive sleep apnea in Parkinson disease: A meta-analysis [^116MfEUF]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Sleep disorders are common clinical features of Parkinson disease (PD), affecting nearly half of the patients and linked to more severe PD clinical phenotypes, such as cognitive dysfunctions, more severe neuropsychiatric manifestations, and reduced quality of life (QoL). Among these disorders, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea, irregular breathing, sleep-related hypoventilation, and hypoxemia, frequently occur in PD. This is likely due to centrally mediated respiratory problems and upper airway dysfunction.

The overall prevalence of OSA in the general population ranges from 9% to 38%, associated with older age, male sex, and a higher body mass index (BMI). Its occurrence is related to detrimental clinical consequences, such as impaired cognition and an increased risk of cardiovascular events, which heighten morbidity and mortality.

However, the prevalence of OSA in PD may be influenced by its clinical onset, as it might precede PD diagnosis due to causative factors such as overweight and older age. Conversely, OSA may develop and worsen during the course of the disease due to PD-related factors and shared pathogenetic mechanisms. OSA presentation is more frequent in PD patients with severe motor disabilities that can also affect the upper airway musculature. Nevertheless, some evidence suggests a possible protective role of dopaminergic therapy. This therapy increases nocturnal mobility, enabling patients to reduce the supine sleep position, which might mitigate OSA symptoms.
