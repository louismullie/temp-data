## Question

When to give atropine in asymptomatic bradycardia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when, if ever, atropine should be administered in cases of asymptomatic bradycardia and what the evidence-based reasoning is behind that decision. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how we define "asymptomatic bradycardia" and ensure there is truly no hemodynamic compromise. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (AHA/ACC/HRS, ESC) say about atropine use and whether they address asymptomatic cases. Next, I will review drug- and toxin-specific contexts to see if any indications exist for atropine in asymptomatic bradycardia. After that, I need to check special populations where atropine is ineffective or contraindicated. I will then distinguish prophylactic from therapeutic use because that's an easy place to conflate recommendations. Finally, I will weigh potential risks of unnecessary atropine and synthesize a practical clinical pathway, before giving a clear recommendation.

> Let me first confirm what constitutes "asymptomatic bradycardia". Clinically, I'm thinking heart rate less than 60 bpm with no symptoms such as syncope, presyncope, chest pain, dyspnea, altered mentation, or exercise intolerance, and with preserved hemodynamics including adequate blood pressure, perfusion, and end-organ status; evaluation begins with a 12-lead ECG to characterize rhythm and exclude high-risk conduction disease, because persistent bradycardia without symptoms can still flag pathology that alters management, even if atropine is not warranted right now [^116uzyy5] [^112WE9tS].

> Wait, let me verify what the core guidelines say, because I should not jump to conclusions. The 2020 AHA ACLS guidance centers atropine on acute symptomatic bradycardia with hemodynamic compromise and on treating reversible causes; there is no recommendation to give atropine to asymptomatic patients who are stable [^111RYy9G] [^115bYzvr]. Likewise, the 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline recommends atropine for sinus node dysfunction or bradycardia when symptoms or hemodynamic compromise are present, and is silent on treating asymptomatic cases with atropine, which strongly implies observation and etiologic evaluation rather than empiric anticholinergic therapy when there are no symptoms [^112SWohe].

> I should double-check the acute coronary syndrome context, because sometimes bradycardia occurs in inferior MI with vagal tone and AV nodal ischemia. The 2023 ESC ACS guideline advises positive chronotropes such as epinephrine and atropine for sinus bradycardia with hemodynamic intolerance or for high-grade AV block without a stable escape rhythm, with pacing if there is no response; again, this frames atropine use around symptomatic or unstable presentations, not asymptomatic bradycardia [^113rpTFU].

> Next, I will examine drug-induced bradycardia in oncology and neurology agents to see if labels demand atropine in asymptomatic patients. Hold on, I should verify specifics: the alectinib (Alecensa) label instructs no dose modification for asymptomatic bradycardia and focuses intervention on symptomatic cases, implying no routine atropine for asymptomatic heart rate reductions [^112kLYE9]. Siponimod (Mayzent) reports that bradycardia during initiation is generally asymptomatic, rarely needs atropine, and usually resolves with monitoring, again arguing against atropine in asymptomatic cases [^116vAk6Z]. Crizotinib (Xalkori) emphasizes symptomatic bradycardia management and medication review rather than atropine for asymptomatic findings, aligning with a conservative approach; cardio-oncology guidance likewise stresses monitoring, causality assessment, drug adjustments, and pacing only if symptoms persist or alternatives are lacking, not routine atropine for asymptomatic bradycardia [^113r68NJ] [^111ATDF3].

> Now I need to check toxicology scenarios because it would be easy to overgeneralize from poisoning algorithms. In calcium channel blocker poisoning, expert consensus places atropine as a first-line consideration for symptomatic bradycardia or conduction disturbances, while asymptomatic patients are observed with supportive care and decontamination as indicated; that does not support atropine in the absence of symptoms or instability [^115qi93o] [^116UApcQ] [^116m1nrS]. For organophosphate or muscarinic mushroom toxicity, atropine is indicated to reverse the muscarinic toxidrome, not to treat an otherwise stable, asymptomatic bradycardia per se, which keeps the indication tied to clinical cholinergic manifestations rather than rate alone [^113SazTk] [^114VCUjo]. Even in manufacturer overdose guidance for diltiazem, atropine is suggested within a framework of clinical response and symptomatic bradycardia, reinforcing the principle that treatment is driven by hemodynamics and symptoms, not heart rate alone [^1158zTHq].

> Let me consider special populations in whom atropine is ineffective or discouraged. In post–heart transplant patients without evidence of autonomic reinnervation, atropine should not be used to treat sinus bradycardia because vagal blockade won't achieve the desired chronotropic effect in the denervated heart and could delay effective therapies; this is an explicit "do not administer" situation, irrespective of symptoms, until reinnervation is demonstrated. That reinforces the need to tailor the choice of therapy to underlying physiology rather than the number on the monitor [^114uUWKi].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost conflated prophylaxis with therapy. Some settings use atropine prophylactically to blunt anticipated vagal bradycardia, but that is fundamentally different from treating an existing, asymptomatic bradycardia. Carotid artery stenting protocols have used routine or selective prophylactic atropine before balloon inflation to prevent reflex bradycardia and hypotension, and pediatric airway literature has discussed atropine to prevent reflex bradycardia with laryngoscopy or certain sedation strategies; these are preventive strategies for predicted vagal events, not a rationale to treat an already present, asymptomatic bradycardia with atropine [^11181Pob] [^112L7gag] [^1158wyME]. So I should not extrapolate prophylactic use to justify therapeutic atropine in a stable, asymptomatic patient, and I'm glad I caught that distinction.

> Next, I should review potential harms of unnecessary atropine, because the risk–benefit calculus matters when there is no expected benefit. Case reports describe worsening ischemia or arrhythmias in acute coronary syndromes after atropine, and exacerbation of Takotsubo physiology with atropine, suggesting that indiscriminate vagolysis can have adverse cardiovascular consequences in susceptible patients; elderly pharmacokinetics also show prolonged half-life, increasing toxicity risk if given without clear indication [^111qiXiA] [^111vVq8o] [^116Euvno]. In peri-anesthesia settings, randomized data in older adults show more pronounced blood pressure fluctuations and ST-segment depression with atropine compared with glycopyrrolate during reversal, underscoring myocardial oxygen supply–demand concerns; comprehensive adverse event listings for atropine also include tachyarrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and blood pressure lability, which I should keep in mind before exposing an asymptomatic patient to these risks [^112vvHRj] [^115LD7q9] [^112NCXKa] [^115bA2Gf].

> I will now synthesize a clinical decision pathway, and I need to ensure I'm precise. For truly asymptomatic bradycardia with stable hemodynamics, evaluation and observation come first: confirm absence of symptoms, check vitals and perfusion, obtain an ECG to define the rhythm and look for high-risk conduction disease, review medications and reversible causes like ischemia, electrolyte disturbances including hyperkalemia, hypothyroidism, or sleep/athlete physiology, and monitor on telemetry if needed; atropine is not indicated here, and the management is etiologic and expectant rather than anticholinergic [^111RYy9G] [^112SWohe] [^116uzyy5]. But wait, what if "asymptomatic" includes high-grade AV block found on ECG? Even without symptoms, Mobitz II or complete heart block typically requires urgent pacing evaluation rather than atropine, which is often ineffective in infranodal block; when symptomatic or unstable, follow ACLS with atropine as an initial vagolytic trial while preparing for pacing, and remember to treat specific causes such as hyperkalemia when atropine fails to capture the mechanism [^112SWohe] [^1167sXcF] [^111RYy9G] [^112hmc6e].

> Let me reconsider any edge cases I might have missed. In acute MI with bradycardia, the threshold remains symptoms or hemodynamic compromise to justify atropine, with escalation to pacing if unresponsive; conversely, in transplant recipients without reinnervation, avoid atropine entirely and proceed to alternative chronotropic or pacing strategies as indicated, which I should double-check each time I encounter post-transplant bradycardia [^115iyQDG] [^113rpTFU] [^114uUWKi].

> Final check and recommendation: Based on guideline direction, drug- and toxin-specific guidance, and harm considerations, atropine is not indicated for truly asymptomatic bradycardia without hemodynamic compromise; management should focus on observation, ECG characterization, monitoring, and correction of reversible causes, reserving atropine for symptomatic or unstable bradycardia and avoiding it in denervated post–heart transplant patients without reinnervation; prophylactic atropine in procedures to prevent anticipated vagal bradycardia does not translate to therapeutic use for an existing asymptomatic bradycardia [^111RYy9G] [^112SWohe] [^113rpTFU] [^114uUWKi].

Atropine is **not indicated** for asymptomatic bradycardia. It is reserved for **symptomatic bradycardia** with **hemodynamic compromise** or high-risk features [^111RYy9G] [^112SWohe]. In asymptomatic patients, management is **observation**, **monitoring**, and treating **reversible causes**; atropine is only considered if **symptoms or instability** develop [^111RYy9G] [^112SWohe].

---

## Indications for atropine administration

Atropine is **indicated** for **symptomatic bradycardia** with **hemodynamic compromise**, including:

- **Hypotension**: Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg.

- **Altered mental status**: Confusion, dizziness, syncope, or decreased consciousness.

- **Signs of shock**: Cool, clammy skin, delayed capillary refill, or organ hypoperfusion.

- **Ischemic chest discomfort**: Suggesting myocardial ischemia.

- **Acute heart failure**: New or worsening pulmonary edema or respiratory distress.

These indications **align with AHA and ACC/AHA/HRS guidance** [^111RYy9G] [^112SWohe].

---

## Management of asymptomatic bradycardia

For **asymptomatic bradycardia**, management is **observation**, **monitoring**, and addressing **reversible causes**:

- **Observation and monitoring**: Continuous ECG, frequent vital signs, and clinical reassessment.

- **Identify and treat reversible causes**: Hypoxia, electrolyte disturbances, medication effects, or underlying medical conditions [^115bYzvr].

- **No immediate pharmacological intervention**: Atropine is not indicated unless symptoms or instability develop.

---

## Situations where atropine may be considered in asymptomatic bradycardia

Although **generally not indicated**, atropine may be **considered in specific scenarios**:

- **Procedural prophylaxis**: To prevent reflex bradycardia during procedures such as carotid angioplasty, carotid sinus massage, or ocular surgery [^116zQjE7] [^112GgB1H].

- **Drug-induced bradycardia**: When bradycardia is anticipated from agents like neostigmine or clonidine, atropine may be given prophylactically [^115GhUtz].

- **Pediatric intubation**: Historically used to prevent reflex bradycardia during pediatric intubation, though recent data suggest limited benefit [^1158wyME].

---

## Risks and contraindications of atropine administration

Atropine has **important risks and contraindications**. Risks include tachycardia, arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, hypertension, and anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, confusion) [^112NCXKa]. Contraindications include hypersensitivity to atropine or derivatives, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, and certain cardiac conditions (e.g. tachyarrhythmias).

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines consistently **recommend atropine only for symptomatic bradycardia** with **hemodynamic compromise** or high-risk features [^111RYy9G] [^112SWohe]. For **asymptomatic bradycardia**, observe and treat **reversible causes**; reserve atropine for when **symptoms or instability** develop [^111RYy9G] [^112SWohe].

### The effect of glycopyrrolate vs. atropine in combination with neostigmine on cardiovascular system for reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade in the elderly: a randomized controlled trial [^112vvHRj]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). High credibility.

A total of 96 patients were evaluated for eligibility, and 28 patients were excluded before randomization. As a result, 68 patients were included in this study and were equally randomized into two groups: group G (n = 34) and group A (n = 34). Two patients in group G and four in group A were excluded because their tracheal tubes were removed within 10 minutes after administration. Furthermore, two patients in group G were excluded because they received atropine as a remedy. Thus, 60 patients (30 in group G and 30 in group A) were included in the final analysis. The study procedure is shown in Figure 1.

The two groups were similar in terms of gender, age, BMI, ASA class, surgery duration, anesthesia duration, and cisatracurium dose.

### The effect of glycopyrrolate vs. atropine in combination with neostigmine on cardiovascular system for reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade in the elderly: a randomized controlled trial [^112DV1qV]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). High credibility.

- **Randomization and blinding**: Using a computer-generated randomization table, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the glycopyrrolate group (Group G) or the atropine group (Group A). Group assignments were secured in a sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelope, which was then handed to a nurse who was not involved in the study. Test drugs were prepared in identical 10 mL syringes by the same nurse. The anesthesiologists involved in anesthesia management and postoperative follow-up were blinded to the group assignments.

- **Anesthetic and surgical management**: Once in the operating room, all subjects underwent standard monitoring, including electrocardiogram (ECG), non-invasive blood pressure (NBP), pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), and bispectral index (BIS). After inducing general anesthesia with alfentanil (0.03–0.08 mg/kg), etomidate (0.2–0.3 mg/kg), and cisatracurium (0.15 mg/kg), tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation initiated. The appropriate depth of anesthesia (BIS value 40–60) was maintained by micropump infusion of propofol (2–4 mg/kg/h), remifentanil (0.05–0.15 µg/kg/min), and 0.5–2 vol% sevoflurane/oxygen/air mix inhalation. Intraoperative blood pressure was kept within 20% of baseline, and heart rate was maintained at 45–90 beats per minute (bpm). One-third of the induction dose of cisatracurium was added intraoperatively as needed. There were no additional muscle relaxants administered for at least 30 minutes before the procedure ended. At the end of the surgical procedure, the administration of sevoflurane inhalation, propofol, and remifentanil pumping was discontinued.

### Diltiazem HCI [^1158zTHq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In cases of overdosage, the experience is limited. If an overdosage or exaggerated response occurs, appropriate supportive measures should be employed. The following measures may be considered:

- **Bradycardia**: Administer atropine (0.6 to 1 mg). If there is no response to vagal blockade, administer isoproterenol cautiously.

- **High-degree AV block**: Treat as for bradycardia above. Fixed high-degree AV block should be treated with cardiac pacing.

- **Cardiac failure**: Administer inotropic agents (isoproterenol, dopamine, or dobutamine) and diuretics.

- **Hypotension**: Administer vasopressors (e.g. dopamine or norepinephrine).

The effectiveness of intravenous calcium administration to reverse the pharmacological effects of diltiazem overdose has been inconsistent. In a few reported cases, overdose with calcium channel blockers associated with hypotension and bradycardia that was initially refractory to atropine became more responsive to atropine after the patients received intravenous calcium. In some cases, intravenous calcium has been administered (1 g calcium chloride or 3 g calcium gluconate) over 5 minutes and repeated every 10 to 20 minutes as necessary. Calcium gluconate has also been administered as a continuous infusion at a rate of 2 g per hour for 10 hours. Infusions of calcium for 24 hours or more may be required. Patients should be monitored for signs of hypercalcemia.

Actual treatment and dosage should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician.

Diltiazem does not appear to be removed by peritoneal or hemodialysis.

### Anticholinergic premedication to prevent bradycardia in combined spinal anesthesia and dexmedetomidine sedation: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^113aZW7z]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

When dexmedetomidine is used in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia, a high incidence of bradycardia in response to parasympathetic activation is reported. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of atropine premedication for preventing the incidence of bradycardia and the hemodynamic effect on patients undergoing spinal anesthesia with sedation by dexmedetomidine.

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

- **Setting**: Operating room.

- **Patients**: One hundred fourteen patients (age range, 2–65 years; American Society of Anesthesiology class I-II) participated in this study, willing to be sedated and to undergo spinal anesthesia.

- **Intervention**: The patients were divided into two groups: group A and group C. After performing spinal anesthesia, dexmedetomidine was infused at a loading dose of 0.6 μg/kg for 10 minutes, followed by an infusion at 0.25 μg/(kg h). Simultaneously with the loading dose of dexmedetomidine, patients in group A received an intravenous bolus of 0.5 mg atropine, whereas patients in group C received an intravenous normal saline bolus.

- **Measurement**: Data on administration of atropine and ephedrine were collected. Hemodynamic data, including heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean blood pressure (MBP), were also recorded.

- **Main Results**: The incidence of bradycardia requiring atropine treatment was significantly higher in group C than in group A (P = 0.035). However, the incidence of hypotension needing ephedrine treatment showed no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.7).

### Duraclon [^1111S6qz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Epidural clonidine frequently causes decreases in heart rate, with symptomatic bradycardia treatable by atropine. Rare cases of atrioventricular block greater than first degree have been reported. Clonidine does not alter the hemodynamic response to exercise but may mask the increase in heart rate associated with hypovolemia.

Clonidine administration may result in sedation through the activation of alpha-adrenoceptors in the brainstem. High doses cause usually mild sedation and ventilatory abnormalities. Tolerance to these effects can develop with chronic administration; they have been reported with bolus doses significantly larger than the infusion rate recommended for treating cancer pain.

Depression has been observed in a small percentage of patients treated with oral or transdermal clonidine. It commonly occurs in cancer patients and may be exacerbated by clonidine treatment. Patients, particularly those with a known history of affective disorders, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of depression.

In clinical investigations, Duraclon was most effective for well-localized, "neuropathic" pain characterized as electrical, burning, or shooting in nature and localized to a dermatomal or peripheral nerve distribution. Duraclon may be less effective, or possibly ineffective, in treating pain that is diffuse, poorly localized, or visceral in origin.

### Exercise echocardiography with addition of atropine [^113A9ion]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Exercise echocardiography with the addition of atropine was performed in 31 patients who had a very small probability of achieving submaximal heart rate. Conclusive tests were obtained in 77% of the patients with this protocol.

### SPL drug information for atropine sulfate [^1161bL6J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of atropine sulfate IM for the treatment of organophosphate poisoning in adults (mild) is 2 mg IM once, followed by 2 additional doses in rapid succession if the patient experiences severe symptoms after the first dose.

---

### Salagen [^114WQWNG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Management of overdose in patients prescribed Salagen should be approached with caution due to the potential for fatal overdosage with pilocarpine. Cases have been reported in the scientific literature of fatal incidents at doses presumed to be greater than 100 mg in two hospitalized patients. Specifically, 100 mg of pilocarpine is considered potentially fatal.

Treatment for overdosage should include atropine titration, administering 0.5 mg to 1.0 mg subcutaneously or intravenously, along with supportive measures to maintain respiration and circulation. In addition, epinephrine, ranging from 0.3 mg to 1.0 mg given subcutaneously or intramuscularly, may be beneficial in cases of severe cardiovascular depression or bronchoconstriction. It remains unknown if pilocarpine is dialyzable.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^116UApcQ]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For the treatment of patients who ingested a potentially toxic amount of calcium channel blockers (CCB), the workgroup recommends observation and consideration of decontamination following the position statements previously published jointly by the European Association of Poison Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT): "Based on volunteer studies, the administration of activated charcoal may be considered if a patient has ingested a potentially toxic amount of a poison within one hour previously. The potential for benefit after one hour cannot be excluded".

Based on case series, it is preferable to observe and monitor in a hospital setting for approximately 24 hours asymptomatic patients who ingested a potentially toxic amount of CCB, defined as more than a single therapeutic dose. This is to consider gastrointestinal decontamination and to intervene with other treatments if signs of toxicity develop. The workgroup deferred the indications for, and types of, decontamination to the AACT and the EAPCCT position statement (2005) instead of proposing new recommendations.

For first-line therapy of symptomatic CCB-poisoned patients, the workgroup recommends:

- **IV calcium (1D)**.

- **High-dose insulin therapy** with other first-line treatment(s) if evidence of myocardial dysfunction is present (1D).

- **Norepinephrine and/or epinephrine** in the presence of shock (even if myocardial function has not yet been assessed).

### A randomized controlled trial of intravenous aminophylline for atropine-resistant out-of-hospital asystolic cardiac arrest [^114nwmMk]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Myocardial ischemia during cardiopulmonary arrest can lead to atropine-resistant bradyasystole due to interstitial accumulation of endogenous adenosine. Aminophylline, a nonspecific adenosine receptor antagonist, is capable of reversing ischemia-induced bradyasystole in various settings. This study hypothesized that aminophylline improves the rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in atropine-resistant asystolic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest when administered early in the resuscitation effort.

The study was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial conducted in an urban emergency medical services system covering a population of 250,000. The trial included all non-pregnant, normothermic adults who suffered nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with asystole, from February 1999 to August 2000. Patients who remained in asystole after initial doses of epinephrine and atropine received either a 250 mg bolus of aminophylline or a matching placebo via a peripheral intravenous line. All other resuscitation efforts followed standard Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines. A sample size of 102 patients was calculated to provide an 80% power to detect an absolute improvement of 25% in ROSC. The aminophylline and control groups were compared using 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and data were analyzed using logistic regression.

The investigators enrolled 112 consecutive patients. One subject was excluded from the analysis due to missing data, leaving data from 111 patients for evaluation.

### Incidence of bradycardia and the use of atropine in pediatric rapid sequence intubation in the emergency department [^1158wyME]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Low credibility.

Bradycardia during rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is an uncommon but serious adverse effect encountered in pediatric intubations. Atropine has historically been used in the pediatric population as RSI premedication to prevent bradycardia, especially when using succinylcholine as an induction agent. The objective of this analysis was to identify the incidence of bradycardia with or without atropine use.

- **Methods**: This single-center, retrospective, observational case series reviewed pediatric patients up to 18 years old requiring intubation from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018. Bradycardia was determined by analyzing heart rates associated with time during and up to 5 minutes after intubation.

- **Results**: A total of 62 patients were included. Three (4.8%) patients experienced a bradycardic event during intubation. A total of 15 (24.2%) patients received atropine for pretreatment of RSI. The incidence of bradycardia was similar between those who received atropine and those who did not. An increasing trend in atropine use was shown throughout the assessment period, yet only 18 (29%) patients met criteria for atropine pretreatment based on the 2015 Pediatric Advanced Life Support guideline recommendations for RSI.

- **Conclusion**: Bradycardia incidence was low in pediatric patients undergoing RSI in our emergency department. The use of atropine or succinylcholine did not affect the incidence of bradycardia during pediatric intubation over this study period. Our results show a low incidence of bradycardia and support the 2015 Pediatric Advanced Life Support guideline recommendations.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^115qi93o]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for calcium channel blocker toxicity, particularly concerning atropine, the AAPCC/ACMT/CAEP/CAPCC/CCCS/CPS/EAPCCT/ESEM/ESICM/SCCM 2017 guidelines recommend considering the administration of atropine as first-line therapy in patients with CCB poisoning who present with symptomatic bradycardia or conduction disturbances.

### Deliberate fingolimod overdose presenting with delayed hypotension and bradycardia responsive to atropine [^116r5i2g]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Fingolimod is an immunomodulating agent used in multiple sclerosis (MS). It is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist prescribed for relapsing forms of MS to delay the onset of physical disability. As fingolimod is known to cause first-dose bradycardia, telemetry is recommended for the first 6 hours post-dose. We present the first reported case of deliberate fingolimod overdose requiring atropine administration for bradycardia and hemodynamic instability.

- **Case report**: A 33-year-old woman ingested 14 mg of fingolimod and 2 g of phenoxymethylpenicillin. After presenting to the emergency department 19 hours later, she was initially hemodynamically stable (heart rate (HR) 60, blood pressure (BP) 113/89 mmHg). Two hours later, she developed bradycardia (HR 48) and hypotension (87/57 mmHg). Despite intravenous fluids, stabilization was only achieved after the administration of atropine (300 μg). She was then admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further monitoring, where another episode of bradycardia and hypotension required atropine. She was monitored in the ICU for 48 hours and then discharged on day 5 with no further episodes.

- **Discussion**: Fingolimod is known to cause bradycardia in the first 6 hours post first therapeutic dose. Following intentional overdose, the onset of bradycardia occurred at 21 hours post-ingestion and was associated with hypotension. Atropine was successful in treating bradycardia and associated hypotension.

### Alecensa [^112kLYE9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Bradycardia**: Symptomatic bradycardia occurred in patients treated with Alecensa. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], bradycardia was reported in 11% of patients treated with Alecensa. Among the 521 patients who had serial electrocardiograms (ECGs) available, 20% experienced post-dose heart rates of less than 50 beats per minute (bpm).

Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. For asymptomatic bradycardia, dose modification is not required. In cases of symptomatic bradycardia that are not life-threatening, withhold Alecensa until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or a heart rate ≥ 60 bpm, and evaluate concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia, including anti-hypertensive medications. If bradycardia is attributed to a concomitant medication, resume Alecensa at a reduced dose (see Table 2) upon recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of ≥ 60 bpm, with frequent monitoring as clinically indicated.

Permanently discontinue Alecensa in cases of life-threatening bradycardia if no contributing concomitant medication is identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Permanently discontinue Alecensa for recurrence of life-threatening bradycardia.

### Signifor [^116vrVMv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Bradycardia and QT prolongation**: Bradycardia has been reported with the use of Signifor. Patients with cardiac disease and/or risk factors for bradycardia, such as a history of clinically significant bradycardia, high-grade heart block, or the concomitant use of drugs associated with bradycardia, should be carefully monitored. Dose adjustments of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or correction of electrolyte disturbances may be necessary.

- **QT prolongation**: Signifor is associated with QT prolongation. In two thorough QT studies with Signifor, QT prolongation occurred at therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses. Signifor should be used with caution in patients who are at significant risk of developing prolongation of QTc, such as those with congenital long QT prolongation or uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, or clinically significant bradycardia. Patients on anti-arrhythmic therapy or other substances that are known to lead to QT prolongation, or those with hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia, are also at risk.

A baseline ECG is recommended prior to initiating therapy with Signifor, and monitoring for an effect on the QTc interval is advisable. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to Signifor administration and should be monitored periodically during therapy.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for syncope, specifically concerning diagnostic criteria for carotid sinus syndrome, the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend confirming carotid sinus syndrome when carotid sinus massage causes bradycardia (asystole) and/or hypotension that reproduces spontaneous symptoms. Additionally, patients should have clinical features compatible with a reflex mechanism of syncope.

### Atropine [^112X5AFU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In the event of accidental ingestion or toxic overdosage with atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, supportive care may include a short-acting barbiturate or diazepam as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided, as central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended.

Physostigmine, given by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, necessitating repeated doses.

Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary, and cooling measures may be needed to help reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations.

The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal.

### The use of atropine in a nerve agent response with specific reference to children: Are current guidelines too cautious [^112cFnxV]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

This review examines the potential use of nerve agents by a terrorist organisation against a civilian population, which has become an increasingly apparent threat in the UK. Present guidelines for the use of atropine, particularly in children, following such an event are unclear. No precise agreement exists on the most appropriate dose of atropine or the frequency with which it should be administered. This uncertainty leaves children vulnerable, as potentially life-saving treatment may be crucially delayed. Guidelines must be standardised to allow rapid antidotal delivery and maximise the potential for survivors. This review examines the issues currently surrounding the use of atropine in children following a nerve agent attack and proposes strategies for treating exposed children.

### Use of atropine in patients with chronotropic incompetence and poor exercise capacity during treadmill stress testing [^1124U4mL]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Treadmill stress testing (TMST) is a valuable diagnostic test for ischemic heart disease. However, the inability to achieve the target heart rate due to either chronotropic incompetence or poor exercise capacity is a significant limitation to its utility. We evaluated the usefulness of atropine in decreasing the number of tests with inconclusive results in patients with a poor chronotropic response or exercise capacity during TMST.

- **Methods**: The study comprised 126 patients undergoing TMST. In subjects experiencing fatigue at submaximal exercise, atropine was administered in doses of 0.5 mg per minute until the test conclusion (positive test results or target heart rate achieved) or until a maximum dose of 2 mg was administered.

- **Results**: Thirty-three of the 126 patients (26%) required atropine (mean dose, 1 mg) during the study; 23 of the 33 patients (70%) proceeded to achieve their target heart rate (n = 17) or positive test results (n = 6). The mean increase in heart rate after atropine administration was 25 beats/min (range 3–53 beats/min). Atropine was required in 39% of patients receiving beta-blockers, versus 21% of patients not receiving beta-blockers (P = 0.02). Among patients receiving atropine, a conclusive test was achieved significantly more often in patients not receiving beta-blockers (94% vs. 46%, P = 0.01). No adverse events were associated with the use of atropine. Atropine administration resulted in conclusive tests more often in subjects with a poor chronotropic response than in subjects with poor exercise capacity (78% vs. 33%, P < .001).

- **Conclusion**: The study suggests atropine may decrease the number of inconclusive TMST results in patients with chronotropic incompetence or poor exercise capacity, especially among those not on beta-blockers.

### Atropine-resistant bradycardia due to hyperkalaemia [^112hmc6e]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Symptomatic sinus bradycardia is routinely treated in the emergency department with atropine and pacing. Two cases are presented that illustrate the importance of considering hyperkalaemia, particularly in the presence of atropine-resistant symptomatic bradycardia. The administration of calcium in such cases acts to stabilize the myocardium and resolve the bradycardia. Blood gas analysis provides a rapid estimate of serum potassium concentrations, facilitating timely treatment.

### Pediatric rapid sequence intubation: Incidence of reflex bradycardia and effects of pretreatment with atropine [^112L7gag]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2004). Low credibility.

The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) recommends atropine as adjunctive therapy to prevent reflex bradycardia prior to laryngoscopy/tracheal intubation (L/TI) in pediatric patients.

- **Objective**: To describe the incidence of reflex bradycardia and its relationship to the administration of atropine during L/TI in a Pediatric Emergency Department.

- **Design/methods**: A retrospective cohort study was designed through review of records of all patients who received L/TI in the ED at an urban children's hospital from January 1997 to March 2001. Patients meeting inclusion criteria were placed into cohorts defined by whether they had received atropine prior to L/TI or not.

- **Results**: One hundred sixty-three patients received L/TI during the study period. One hundred forty-three patients met inclusion criteria. Sixty-eight patients received atropine (atropine group) prior to L/TI. Seventy-two percent of atropine group patients met ACEP criteria for atropine pretreatment. Seventy-five patients did not receive atropine pretreatment (no-atropine group). Forty-three percent of no-atropine group patients met ACEP criteria for pretreatment with atropine. The atropine group was younger [mean 22.5 vs. 36.4 months, P = 0.003, 95% CI (-28.5, 0.70)], averaged the same number of intubation attempts [1.6 vs. 1.5, P = 0.941, 95% CI 0.1 (-0.3,0.4)], and had normal or elevated HR for age prior to L/TI (mean 159 bpm). Hypoxia occurred more often in the atropine group [28% vs. 16%, P = 0.046, 95% CI for difference (0.3, 27.1)]. Bradycardia was noted in 6 patients during L/TI; 3 in

The atropine group and three in the no-atropine group.

### Xalkori [^113r68NJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Symptomatic bradycardia can occur in patients receiving Xalkori. Across clinical trials in patients with NSCLC, bradycardia occurred in 13% of 1719 patients treated with Xalkori. Grade 3 syncope occurred in 2.4% of Xalkori-treated patients and in 0.6% of the chemotherapy-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In Study ADVL0912, among 121 patients ages 1 to ≤ 21 years treated with Xalkori, bradycardia was reported in 14%, including Grade 3 bradycardia in 0.8% of patients. Of the 26 patients with ALCL treated with Xalkori, bradycardia (all Grade 1) was reported in 19%. Of the 14 pediatric patients with IMT treated with Xalkori, bradycardia was reported in 14% of patients, including Grade 3 bradycardia in 7% of patients.

Avoid using Xalkori in combination with other medications known to cause bradycardia (e.g. beta-blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, clonidine, and digoxin) to the extent possible. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. If bradycardia occurs, re-evaluate the use of concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue Xalkori for bradycardia as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

### Percutaneous injection of lidocaine within the carotid body area in carotid artery stenting: an "old-new" technique [^11181Pob]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Severe bradycardia is a common untoward effect during balloon angioplasty when performing carotid artery stenting. Therefore, an atropine injection before dilatation, alongside the presence of an anesthesiologist, is advocated for all patients. In the surgical literature, the injection of a local anesthetic agent into the carotid sinus before carotid endarterectomy was performed in an attempt to ameliorate perioperative hemodynamic instability. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that percutaneous infiltration of the carotid sinus with local anesthetic immediately before balloon dilatation reduces bradycardia and ameliorates the need for atropine injection or the presence of an anesthesiologist.

The infiltration of the carotid sinus with 5 mL of 1% lidocaine, 3 minutes before dilatation, was performed in 30 consecutive patients. No one exhibited any significant rhythm change that required atropine injection. The anesthesiologist did not face any hemodynamic instability during the carotid artery stenting procedure.

### Modulation of QT interval during autonomic nervous system blockade in humans [^112gBW2X]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

It is thought that the autonomic nervous system modulates QT interval, but traditional autonomic blockade, combining propranolol and atropine, has produced conflicting results. We used the alternative approach of interrupting neurotransmission at the level of autonomic ganglia to determine its effect on the QT interval.

- **Methods and results**: We infused trimethaphan at increasing doses (0.5 to 10 mg/min IV) while monitoring heart rate, heart rate variability spectra, QT interval, and blood pressure in 10 normal volunteers, 9 patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), and 8 patients with pure autonomic failure (PAF). The QT interval was corrected for heart rate using Bazett's formula (QTc). Patients with PAF had very low heart rate variability and a prolonged QTc at baseline (465 ± 8 ms) compared with patients with MSA (448 ± 6 ms) and normal subjects (432 ± 6 ms). In normal subjects, trimethaphan dose-dependently prolonged QTc (to 469 ± 7 ms), decreased RR interval (995 ± 45 to 670 ± 35 ms), and abolished heart rate variability. In MSA patients, trimethaphan also prolonged QTc (to 463 ± 7 ms) and reduced heart rate variability but did not significantly change RR interval (from 813 ± 38 to 801 ± 39).

- **Conclusions**: Autonomic blockade prolongs QT interval in normal subjects to a similar duration as in PAF patients. Furthermore, blocking residual autonomic tone in PAF patients is associated with a further increase in QT interval length. Patients with MSA have greater residual sympathetic tone and greater prolongation of the QT interval during ganglionic blockade than observed in other groups.

- **Treatment of carbamate poisoning in adults (mild)**: It is also indicated for mild carbamate poisoning to mitigate adverse effects.
- **Treatment of organophosphate poisoning in adults (severe)**: In severe cases of organophosphate poisoning, atropine plays a critical role in reversing toxic effects.
- **Treatment of carbamate poisoning in adults (severe)**: Similarly, for severe carbamate poisoning, atropine is essential for reducing symptoms and improving patient outcomes.

### Neostigmine [^115GhUtz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**:
	- **Bradycardia**: Atropine or glycopyrrolate should be administered prior to neostigmine methylsulfate injection to lessen the risk of bradycardia. Neostigmine has been associated with bradycardia. Atropine sulfate or glycopyrrolate should be administered prior to neostigmine methylsulfate injection to lessen the risk of bradycardia [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

	- **Serious reactions with coexisting conditions**: Use with caution in patients with coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, recent acute coronary syndrome, or myasthenia gravis. Neostigmine methylsulfate injection should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, recent acute coronary syndrome, or myasthenia gravis. Because of the known pharmacology of neostigmine methylsulfate as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, cardiovascular effects such as bradycardia, hypotension, or dysrhythmia would be anticipated. In patients with certain cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, or recent acute coronary syndrome, the risk of blood pressure and heart rate complications may be increased. The risk of these complications may also be increased in patients with myasthenia gravis.

	- **Neuromuscular dysfunction**: This can occur if large doses of neostigmine methylsulfate injection are administered when neuromuscular blockade is minimal; reduce dosage if recovery from neuromuscular blockade is nearly complete.

### Comparison of current recommended regimens of atropinization in organophosphate poisoning [^116ePT1D]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Atropine is the mainstay of therapy in organophosphate (OP) toxicity, though research and consensus on dosing is lacking. In 2004, as reported by Eddleston et al. (J Toxicol Clin Toxicol 42(6):865–75, 2004), they noted variation in recommended regimens. We assessed revisions of original references, additional citations, and electronic sources to determine the variability in atropine dosing recommendations. Updated editions of references from Eddleston et al.'s work, texts of internal and emergency medicine, and electronic resources were reviewed for atropine dosing recommendations.

For comparison, recommendations were assessed using the same mean dose (23.4 mg) and the highest dose (75 mg) of atropine as used in the original paper. Recommendations were also compared with the dosing regimen from the World Health Organization (WHO). Thirteen of the original recommendations were updated, and 15 additional references were added, giving a convenience sample of 28. Sufficient information to calculate time to targeted dose was provided by 24 of these samples.

Compared to 2004, recommendations have greatly increased the speed of atropinization, with 13 out of 24 able to reach the mean and high atropine dose within 30 minutes compared to 1 out of 36 in 2004. In 2004, there were 13 regimens where the maximum time to reach 75 mg was over 18 hours, whereas now, there are 2. While only one recommendation called for doubling the dose for faster escalation in 2004, 15 of the 24 works include dose doubling.

### The oculocardiac reflex: A review [^114f7yL8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

When profound oculocardiac reflex (OCR) occurs, the primary concern for the strabismus surgical team is whether treatment could be more harmful than the bradycardia itself. In very young patients, cardiac output is primarily rate-dependent; thus, bradycardia can lead to hypo-perfusion. In older patients, sudden bradydysrhythmias may persist or be associated with counterproductive compensatory adrenergic responses. The literature reports instances of death associated with the oculocardiac reflex during strabismus or retinal surgery.

A notable case involved a 17-year-old strabismus patient who received intravenous atropine, halothane, and nitrous oxide. However, tension on the lateral rectus muscle led to a prolonged OCR, resulting in cyanosis, intensive care unit admission, and death, with a subsequent finding of viral myocarditis. Additionally, cases of asystole and pulmonary edema have been reported in association with the infestation of an extraocular muscle. There have also been reports of myocardial infarction linked to OCR treatment. Although death during strabismus surgery appears rare, a recent 10-year summary of anesthesia-related claims through OMIC insurance in the United States revealed only one claim from strabismus surgery and only five with general anesthesia out of 50 total claims.

Over 110 years ago, the oculocardiac reflex was independently described by Aschner in Germany and Dagnini in Italy as a vagal reflex elicited from manipulation of the eyes. Six years later, Petzetakis in France described cardiac and respiratory changes elicited from the eyes. An oculocardiac reflex during enucleation was reported in the American literature in 1935. In 1957, in the first of two papers, Kirsch et al. reported a 30% incidence of OCR, defined as any electrocardiograph (ECG) change in 50 patients.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for syncope, more specifically with respect to electrophysiological studies, ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines recommend considering obtaining an electrophysiology study in patients with symptoms suggestive of intermittent bradycardia (such as lightheadedness, syncope) with conduction system disease identified by ECG and no demonstrated AV block.

### Carotid angioplasty and stent-induced bradycardia and hypotension: Impact of prophylactic atropine administration and prior carotid endarterectomy [^116zQjE7]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

We compared the physiologic effect of selective atropine administration for bradycardia with routine prophylactic administration, before balloon inflation, during carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). We also compared the incidence of procedural bradycardia and hypotension for CAS in patients with primary stenosis versus those with prior ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy (CEA).

A total of 86 patients were treated with CAS at three institutions. Complete periprocedural information was available for 75 of these patients. The median degree of stenosis was 90% (range, 60%-99%). Indications for CAS were severe comorbidities (n = 49), prior CEA (n = 21), and prior neck radiation (n = 5).

Twenty patients with primary lesions were treated selectively with atropine only if symptomatic bradycardia occurred (nonprophylactic group). Thirty-four patients with primary lesions received routine prophylactic atropine administration before balloon inflation or stent deployment (prophylactic group). The 21 patients with prior CEA received selective atropine treatment only if symptomatic bradycardia occurred (prior CEA group) and were analyzed separately.

Mean age and cardiac comorbidities did not vary significantly either between the prophylactic and nonprophylactic atropine groups or between the primary and prior CEA patient groups. Outcome measures included bradycardia (decrease in heart rate > 50% or absolute heart rate < 40 bpm), hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg or mean blood pressure < 50 mm Hg), requirement for vasopressors, and cardiac morbidity.

### Administration of atropine in the setting of acute myocardial infarction: potentiation of the ischemic process [^111qiXiA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Atropine has also been suggested to potentially worsen the ischemic situation in patients who are in the midst of acute coronary ischemia. We report the case of a female patient with ischemic chest pain and third-degree atrioventricular block who developed acute myocardial infarction (AMI) immediately after atropine administration. The use of atropine in this instance remains a reasonable option and should be strongly considered — despite this apparent complication. Undoubtedly, in some cases, acute ischemia is intensified by hypoperfusion attributable to vagally mediated bradyarrhythmia; atropine is the antidote for such situations. An awareness of this potential adverse reaction, coupled with a prudent selection of candidates for atropine therapy, will show the risk/benefit ratio in each individual patient and, therefore, guide the clinician.

### Electrocardiogram essentials: Bradycardia [^116uzyy5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Bradycardia is a common finding in the emergency department (ED) and presents along a clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic to hemodynamic compromise and cardiac arrest.

- **Objective**: This manuscript evaluates the management of bradycardia through a discussion of several cases.

- **Discussion**: Bradycardia may result in severe hemodynamic compromise and is defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute (bpm). There are a variety of causes and associations, including physiologic, pathologic, and pharmacologic. Patients may present with a range of signs and symptoms, from no symptoms to hemodynamic collapse. Obtaining an electrocardiogram is essential, which will determine the severity of bradycardia and underlying rhythm, including first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, second-degree AV block, and third-degree AV block, among others. Management is based on the underlying etiology and patient hemodynamic status, aiming to improve the heart rate and address the underlying cause. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable require resuscitation with chronotropic agents and transcutaneous or transvenous pacing.

- **Conclusion**: Severe bradycardia requires emergent management, and a knowledge of the treatment strategies can optimize patient care.

### Sectral [^116Hq6g5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

No specific information on the emergency treatment of overdosage is available for Sectral. However, overdosage with other β-blocking agents has been accompanied by extreme bradycardia, advanced atrioventricular block, intraventricular conduction defects, hypotension, severe congestive heart failure, seizures, and in susceptible patients, bronchospasm and hypoglycemia. Although specific information on the emergency treatment of a Sectral overdose is not available, the following general measures should be considered based on the pharmacological actions and observations in treating overdoses with other β-blockers:

- **Empty stomach by emesis or lavage**
- **Bradycardia**: Intravenous atropine (1 to 3 mg in divided doses). If the antivagal response is inadequate, administer isoproterenol cautiously, as larger than usual doses of isoproterenol may be required.
- **Persistent hypotension in spite of correction of bradycardia**: Administer vasopressor (e.g. epinephrine, levarterenol, dopamine, or dobutamine) with frequent monitoring of blood pressure and pulse rate.
- **Bronchospasm**: Use a theophylline derivative, such as aminophylline, and/or parenteral β2-stimulant, such as terbutaline.
- **Cardiac failure**: Digitalize the patient and/or administer a diuretic. It has been reported that glucagon is useful in this situation.

Sectral is dialyzable.

### Atropine aggravates signs and symptoms of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^111vVq8o]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

We present a novel case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, associated with worsening chest pain and T-wave inversions on electrocardiogram after atropine use. Our patient was an 82-year-old woman who complained of substernal chest discomfort of five hours duration. Atropine 0.5 mg was administered intravenously by the emergency medical service for symptomatic bradycardia. The patient subsequently complained of worsening chest pain and developed new T-wave inversions on the electrocardiogram. Cardiac catheterization was diagnostic and revealed normal coronary arteries but akinesis of the apical segment.

Although the pathogenesis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is not completely understood, catecholamine-mediated myocardial stunning due to enhanced sympathetic activity is the most widely accepted underlying mechanism. The withdrawal of parasympathetic drive in such cases should exacerbate sympathetic activity, leading to the genesis or worsening of disease activity.

The role of atropine in relation to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been questioned before. However, this was always in the setting of general anesthesia induction, at which time atropine had been used for the reversal of symptomatic bradycardia; consequently, determining the exact role of atropine in the disease process was difficult. Our patient received only atropine and therefore illustrated its capacity to worsen signs and symptoms of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Because patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may present with chest pain, we would recommend caution against the use of atropine for symptomatic bradycardia.

Bradycardia can present with variations of severity, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening. In this paper, we present the case of an 89-year-old female with symptomatic bradycardia, which was found to be caused by ophthalmic timolol she had been taking for four years. Prompt recognition of potential causes of bradycardia is essential for the correct selection of treatment and disposition.

### Atropine sulfate [^115bA2Gf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents, or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine may also lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally, a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm.

Atropine sulfate injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the "blush" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine "fever" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children.

The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 minutes) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration, and both effects are nonlinear.

We studied the dose-response relationships for atropine-induced heart rate (HR) changes in 61 patients during propofol anesthesia. The control group (n = 15) received no propofol. Group P-5 (n = 22) received IV propofol 1.25 mg/kg over 1 minute followed by propofol at 5 mg/kg/h. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with propofol 5 mg/kg/h and 67% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Group P-10 (n = 24) received IV propofol 2.5 mg/kg over 1 minute followed by propofol at 10 mg/kg/h. The P-10 protocol was otherwise identical.

All patients received incremental doses of IV atropine 5 microg/kg over 5 seconds at 2-minute intervals until HR increased > 20 bpm from baseline values. Heart rate response to atropine 10 microg/kg was attenuated in Groups P-5 (12 ± 7 bpm) and P-10 (9 ± 6 bpm) compared with the control group (28 ± 13 bpm). A heart rate increase of > 20 bpm occurred in all patients of the control group, but in only 43% and 13% of patients in Groups P-5 and P-10, respectively (P < 0.05). These results indicate that decreased HR responsiveness to IV atropine in patients receiving propofol, which cannot be effectively overcome by a large dose of atropine, is possibly attributable to propofol-induced suppression of the sympathetic nervous system.

Heart rate response to IV atropine is attenuated during propofol anesthesia, and the decreased responsiveness to atropine cannot be effectively overcome by a large dose of atropine.

### Synergistic bradycardia from beta blockers, hyperkalemia, and renal failure [^111mxJ4i]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Bradycardia is a common vital sign encountered in the emergency department. These patients are often hemodynamically stable and require no emergent intervention. On occasion, bradycardia can cause hemodynamic instability, and there are established treatment pathways involving atropine, ionotropic and vasopressive infusions, and eventual mechanical pacing if necessary. However, these pathways fail to account for the many and varied causes of bradycardia and their treatment.

A 24-year-old man presented to our emergency department with syncope caused by symptomatic bradycardia. This was caused by a largely unrecognized synergistic bradycardia resulting from renal failure, AV nodal blocker use, and hyperkalemia. Our patient's worsening renal failure caused accumulation of both potassium and beta blockers, which resulted in bradycardia and hypotension, in turn worsening renal failure secondary to poor renal perfusion and potentiating his hyperkalemia and beta blocker toxicity.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this**: There is a growing number of cases that suggest this is an underrecognized synergistic and potentially lethal mechanism of hemodynamically unstable bradycardia, and the treatment falls outside of typical algorithms for handling bradycardia. Understanding the multiple causes of these patients' hemodynamically unstable bradycardia allows for maximal medical management and can prevent unnecessary invasive management for these patients.

### Mayzent [^116vAk6Z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In Study 1, bradycardia occurred in 4.4% of Mayzent-treated patients compared to 2.9% of patients receiving placebo. Patients who experienced bradycardia were generally asymptomatic. Few patients experienced symptoms, including dizziness or fatigue, and these symptoms resolved within 24 hours without intervention [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Heart rates below 40 bpm were rarely observed.

- **Atrioventricular conduction delays**: Initiation of Mayzent treatment has been associated with transient atrioventricular conduction delays that follow a similar temporal pattern as the observed decrease in heart rate during dose titration. These AV conduction delays manifested in most cases as first-degree AV block (prolonged PR interval on ECG), which occurred in 5.1% of Mayzent-treated patients and 1.9% of patients receiving placebo in Study 1. Second-degree AV blocks, usually Mobitz type I (Wenckebach), have been observed at the time of treatment initiation with Mayzent in less than 1.7% of patients in clinical trials. The conduction abnormalities typically were transient, asymptomatic, resolved within 24 hours, rarely required treatment with atropine, and did not necessitate discontinuation of Mayzent treatment.

If treatment with Mayzent is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought in patients with cardiovascular concerns.

### Bradyarrhythmias, temporary and permanent pacing [^115gLXxM]. Critical Care Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Bradycardia is common in critical care units. It may be transient, asymptomatic, and of little consequence, or it may be life-threatening. Bradycardia may result from abnormalities of the sinus node, atrioventricular node, or the His-Purkinje system. It may also be precipitated by drug effects or enhanced vagal tone. Proper diagnosis is pivotal to determining prognosis and management. Temporary and permanent pacing is now readily available, markedly improving the morbidity and mortality associated with bradyarrhythmias.

### 2020 APHRS/HRS expert consensus statement on the investigation of decedents with sudden unexplained death and patients with sudden cardiac arrest, and of their families [^1132hnVy]. Heart Rhythm (2021). High credibility.

Adenosine challenge has been used to unmask pre-excitation that may otherwise be missed. In the absence of other causes, it indicates the need for electrophysiological study to evaluate the risk of the accessory pathway (rapidity of antegrade conduction), followed by ablation therapy. However, electrophysiological study is not routinely included in the workup of unexplained cardiac arrest. Indeed, previous consensus guidelines proposed a Class 3 indication when assessing a suspected primary electrical disorder. It does not add additional diagnostic or prognostic value unless there is evidence to indicate otherwise. For example, pre-excited atrial fibrillation, bundle branch re-entrant ventricular tachycardia, and rapid supraventricular tachycardias that degenerate into ventricular fibrillation have all been described as culprits requiring an invasive approach to diagnosis and curative ablation therapy.

Electroanatomic voltage mapping of the right ventricle is a discretionary tool that may be considered to detect evidence of subclinical arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. More recently, extensive endocardial and epicardial mapping of unexplained cardiac arrest cases has been employed to identify cases with either Purkinje triggers and/or subtle depolarization abnormalities that may be suitable for ablation therapy.

- **Provocative testing**: Concealed Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome, CPVT, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, pre-excitation, and coronary vasospasm may be uncovered by provocative measures.

### The oculocardiac reflex: A review [^112GgB1H]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

The oculocardiac reflex (OCR) can still surprise practitioners. Approximately one in ten patients may experience bradycardia, with heart rates dropping to 50% or lower of the baseline. Interventions by the anesthesiologist, the surgeon, and patient-specific characteristics do not consistently predict which patients will experience a profound OCR.

Safe anesthesia for strabismus surgery may include adequate doses of anticholinergic medication or an orbital block, each carrying potential adverse side effects. Ensuring an adequate intravenous line and airway, coupled with sufficiently deep general anesthesia to prevent patient movement with ocular manipulation, is advisable. If an intravenous line is not available, atropine can be administered intramuscularly. An equivalent route is the intraglossal route, providing similar protection to intravenous administration, with a waiting period of 5 to 7 minutes before applying extraocular muscle (EOM) tension after the baseline heart rate shows anticholinergic-induced tachycardia. Before manipulating ocular tissue or applying tension to the extraocular muscles, stable heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation should be achieved. Gentle, gradual tension on the extraocular muscle tendons and releasing the tension if bradycardia occurs is one of the best therapies for OCR. Abrupt, prolonged tension on one or more EOM, particularly in the left eye and the inferior or superior rectus muscles, produces the most significant bradycardia.

Recent doses of opioids and dexmedetomidine can significantly augment OCR. Intravenous dexamethasone may also enhance OCR, warranting further study. Unlike the diving response, OCR does not have concomitant peripheral vasoconstriction, setting it apart from the strabismus surgical technique.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations: Diagnosis of atrioventricular block in the emergency department [^1167sXcF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with bradycardia are commonly encountered by the emergency physician. Of the possible bradydysrhythmias, atrioventricular blocks (AVB) represent a significant portion of these presentations. In this article, we provide four illustrative cases of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with AVB. We review the various types of AV block dysrhythmias (1st, 2nd, and 3rd degrees) and their underlying etiologies. This discussion also focuses on the presentation, clinical considerations, management, and acute treatment of AVB dysrhythmias in the emergent setting.

### Vosevi [^116zrsfD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The coadministration of amiodarone with sofosbuvir-containing regimens, such as Harvoni® (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir), has been associated with serious symptomatic bradycardia and incidents requiring pacemaker intervention. There have been reports of fatal cardiac arrest in patients on amiodarone who were also receiving these regimens. Bradycardia typically occurs within hours to days but can appear up to two weeks after starting HCV treatment. Patients taking beta blockers, or those with existing cardiac conditions or advanced liver disease, may be more susceptible to symptomatic bradycardia when amiodarone is coadministered. Generally, bradycardia resolves upon discontinuation of HCV treatment. The underlying mechanism of this effect remains unknown.

Coadministration of amiodarone with Vosevi is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other viable treatment options and will be coadministered Vosevi, the following precautions are advised:

- **Counseling**: Inform patients about the risk of symptomatic bradycardia.
- **Cardiac monitoring**: Initial in-patient cardiac monitoring is recommended for the first 48 hours of coadministration. Subsequent outpatient or self-monitoring of heart rate should be conducted daily for at least the first two weeks of treatment.

Patients taking Vosevi who need to initiate amiodarone therapy, due to the lack of other viable treatment options, should follow similar cardiac monitoring protocols as outlined above.

### Atropine sulfate for treatment of bradycardia in a patient with morbid obesity: What may happen when you least expect it [^112yyhmk]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 74-year-old morbidly obese man was scheduled for surgical repair of an incisional ventral hernia. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl, and maintained with desflurane. A second dose of fentanyl, 0.2 mg, given before starting surgery, resulted in sinus bradycardia and a mild decrease in arterial blood pressure. Atropine sulfate, 0.5 mg, was administered. One minute later, the ECG rhythm on the monitor changed to third-degree atrioventricular block with a ventricular response rate of 40 beats/min, associated with marked hypotension. Isoproterenol, 0.02 mg, reverted the atrioventricular block to sinus rhythm. Cardiac enzymes and ECG ruled out acute myocardial ischemia. The surgical procedure and the recovery from anesthesia were uneventful. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the fifth postoperative day.

For the treatment of bradycardia, atropine sulfate should be adjusted at least to lean body weight to avoid a paradoxical heart rate response in patients with obesity.

### Lopressor [^11772N9J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Signs and symptoms of overdosage - Overdosage of Lopressor may lead to severe bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiogenic shock. The clinical presentation can also include atrioventricular block, heart failure, bronchospasm, hypoxia, impairment of consciousness or coma, nausea, and vomiting.

Treatment - Consider treating the patient with intensive care. Patients with myocardial infarction or heart failure may be prone to significant hemodynamic instability. Beta-blocker overdose may result in significant resistance to resuscitation with adrenergic agents, including beta-agonists. On the basis of the pharmacologic actions of metoprolol, employ the following measures.

- **Hemodialysis**: Hemodialysis is unlikely to make a useful contribution to metoprolol elimination [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Bradycardia**: Evaluate the need for atropine, adrenergic-stimulating drugs, or pacemaker to treat bradycardia and conduction disorders.

- **Hypotension**: Treat underlying bradycardia. Consider intravenous vasopressor infusion, such as dopamine or norepinephrine.

- **Heart failure and shock**: May be treated when appropriate with suitable volume expansion, injection of glucagon (if necessary, followed by an intravenous infusion of glucagon), and intravenous administration of adrenergic drugs such as dobutamine, with α1 receptor agonistic drugs added in the presence of vasodilation.

- **Bronchospasm**: Can usually be reversed by bronchodilators.

### Is atropine needed with ketamine sedation? A prospective, randomised, double blind study [^116om6UB]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare atropine with a placebo as an adjunct to ketamine sedation in children undergoing minor painful procedures. Outcome measures included hypersalivation, side effect profile, parental/patient satisfaction, and procedural success rate.

Children aged between 1 and 16 years, requiring ketamine procedural sedation in a tertiary emergency department, were randomized to receive either 0.01 mg/kg of atropine or a placebo. All participants received 4 mg/kg of intramuscular ketamine. Tolerance and sedation scores were recorded throughout the procedure. Side effects were monitored from the start of sedation until discharge. Parental and patient satisfaction scores were obtained at discharge and three to five days after the procedure, with an opportunity to report side effects encountered at home.

The results showed that a total of 83 patients, aged 13 months to 14.5 years (median age 3.4 years), were enrolled over a 16-month period. Hypersalivation occurred in 11.4% of patients given atropine compared to 30.8% given placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.91). A transient rash was observed in 22.7% of the atropine group compared to 5.1% of the placebo group (OR 5.44, 95% CI 1.11 to 26.6). Vomiting during recovery occurred in 9.1% of atropine patients compared with 25.6% of placebo patients (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.02). There was a trend towards better tolerance in the placebo group. No patient experienced serious side effects.

In conclusion, ketamine sedation was successful and well-tolerated in all cases. The use of atropine as an adjunct for intramuscular ketamine sedation demonstrated varying side effect profiles while maintaining procedural efficacy.

### The effect of glycopyrrolate vs. atropine in combination with neostigmine on cardiovascular system for reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade in the elderly: a randomized controlled trial [^115LD7q9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). High credibility.

In the present study, although the blood pressure changes in both groups were within the clinically acceptable range, the blood pressure fluctuations in elderly patients in the atropine group were significantly higher than those in the glycopyrrolate group. Furthermore, ST segment depression in lead II was observed at multiple time points following A/N administration, and the ST segment still had not returned to baseline within 15 minutes. The ST depression may be a sign of coronary ischemia, which could be associated with the atropine-induced increase in heart rate. However, there was no significant depression in ST-II in the glycopyrrolate group, implying that low-dose G/N may not affect myocardial perfusion in elderly patients. This observation would be especially beneficial for the elderly with underlying myocardial ischemia or without a clinically confirmed diagnosis of coronary artery disease.

A large retrospective study found no significant correlation between G/N for neuromuscular blockade and the occurrence of cardiovascular complications 30 days postoperatively; however, its exploratory analysis identified an elderly population susceptible to cardiovascular side effects of G/N administration. In the study, two patients experienced a transient initial tachycardia (> 100 bpm) following A/N, for which only close observation was provided without treatment. In contrast, two patients in the glycopyrrolate group had severe bradycardia (< 45 bpm). There have been a few case reports of bradycardia and atrioventricular block following G/N, which may serve as a reminder to remain alert to the occurrence of bradycardia with G/N administration.

- **Mobitz II second- and third-degree AV block**.

- **Alternating LBBB and RBBB**.

- **VT or rapid paroxysmal SVT**.

- **Non-sustained episodes of polymorphic VT**: Long or short QT interval.

- **Pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator malfunction**: Associated with cardiac pauses.

### Atropine sulfate [^116Euvno]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment, following 4 mg doses, and heart rate are closely overlapped. However, the time course indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases its absorption due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases its clearance. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2–20 μg/mL concentration range. It readily crosses the placental barrier, enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver, with 13 to 50% excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides.

- **Specific populations**: The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (> 65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine.

Regarding the medical management of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, particularly in the context of managing bradyarrhythmias, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend administering intravenous positive chronotropic agents such as epinephrine, vasopressin, and/or atropine. This is advised for patients with sinus bradycardia who exhibit hemodynamic intolerance or have a high-degree AV block without a stable escape rhythm. Temporary pacing should be performed if there is a failure to respond to atropine.

### Amisulpride and symptomatic bradycardia: a case report [^113oVRUL]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Amisulpride is a second-generation antipsychotic agent indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and other major psychotic illnesses. Amisulpride-induced bradycardia is a rare condition of unknown etiology and mechanism. Asymptomatic bradycardia has been associated with amisulpride in only two cases. In our case, the association was rated as "probable" on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale.

- **Case report**: A 45-year-old male patient developed symptomatic bradycardia during usage of amisulpride (400–800 mg/day), which dramatically improved after the complete termination of amisulpride usage. The psychiatric condition remained relatively stable without bradycardia after the administration of another antipsychotic agent, risperidone (3 mg/day).

- **Conclusion**: This is the first case report of symptomatic bradycardia associated with the use of amisulpride. Although bradycardia is a rare adverse reaction to antipsychotics, this finding may alert psychiatrists and physicians to this antipsychotic drug side effect. Further study is needed to disclose the role of antipsychotics in bringing about symptomatic bradycardia.

### Cardiac arrhythmias in oncological patients-epidemiology, risk factors, and management within the context of the new ESC 2022 guidelines [^111ATDF3]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). High credibility.

Bradycardia episodes secondary to cancer treatment are usually asymptomatic, depending on the heart rate at the time of the episode. Possible symptoms include dizziness, fatigue, pre-syncope, or syncope. If the patient is symptomatic, Holter-ECG is recommended to assess the severity of the bradycardia and exclude long sinus pauses. A trial of withdrawing anticancer drugs should be performed to confirm the coincidence with the symptoms. A multidisciplinary team should discuss the risks and benefits of continuing the treatment at a lower dose and eventually consider alternative therapy. Pacemaker implantation is indicated when there is no substitution for the treatment. The final decision should take into account patients' preferences and should be made after consultation with both a cardiologist and an oncologist.

The management of arrhythmias in oncological patients should be based on clinical practice guidelines, especially the newest ESC Guidelines on Cardio-oncology. Careful patient observation for possible symptoms of the arrhythmia and ECG monitoring are the basis of the management during oncological treatment with high arrhythmogenic potential.
