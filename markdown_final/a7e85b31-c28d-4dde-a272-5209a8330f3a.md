## Question

Is reliable determine testosterone levels in a persons who is 57 years old. What result do you espect in this case

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether testosterone levels can be reliably determined in a 57-year-old person and what result to expect in this case. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the reliability of measurement techniques and pre-analytical factors that influence accuracy. Then, I should verify age-specific reference ranges and what constitutes "normal" at 57. Next, I will review diagnostic thresholds and how to interpret borderline values. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant approach and state a reasonable expected range for this age, while double-checking for pitfalls like diurnal variation and SHBG effects.

> Let me first confirm the reliability question. Yes, testosterone can be reliably determined in a 57-year-old man when proper sampling and validated assays are used; I need to ensure morning fasting blood draws, repeat testing to account for biological variability, and use accurate methods such as LC-MS/MS for total testosterone and equilibrium dialysis or a validated calculation for free testosterone when indicated [^111EqwUR] [^115LrmTB] [^1151yqMm] [^115dQsiH]. Wait, let me verify the variability point: up to 30% of older men with an initially low value normalize on repeat morning testing, so confirmation is essential to avoid misclassification [^115LrmTB] [^1122nN1A].

> Next, I should review age-specific expectations. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions using a single universal cutoff; testosterone declines gradually from the mid-30s at roughly 1–2% per year, so a typical 57-year-old often has lower values than a younger man, and population data show median total testosterone around the mid-300s to low-400s ng/dL in middle-aged men, with substantial interindividual variation [^113v2PYN]. I should double-check that this aligns with guideline framing: many high-quality trials and recommendations operationalize "low" as less than about 300–320 ng/dL for symptomatic men, acknowledging that age-related decline is expected but symptomatic, unequivocally low values are the target for diagnosis and treatment decisions [^114EC6JE] [^116Jn4us].

> Now, I will examine diagnostic thresholds and how to interpret results. I need to ensure I distinguish biochemical deficiency from age-related decline; the EAU 2025 guideline uses 12 nmol/L (about 346 ng/dL) as a reliable threshold for diagnosing late-onset hypogonadism, while the AUA advises confirming any value less than 300 ng/dL with a second early-morning fasting test and considering free testosterone when total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is abnormal [^1115QkK5] [^117Q5eXY] [^114mNUJU]. But wait, what if the value is borderline, say 8–12 nmol/L? In that zone, I should confirm with a repeat morning test and, if suspicion remains high, add SHBG and calculated or measured free testosterone to refine diagnosis and avoid missing SHBG-related discordance [^114mNUJU] [^1138udww].

> Let me consider pre-analytical pitfalls that could distort results. I should confirm the sample was drawn between 7–11 AM after an overnight fast because diurnal variation persists in older men, albeit attenuated, and nonfasting afternoon values can be 20–30% lower; acute illness, sleep disruption, and certain medications can transiently suppress testosterone, so testing should be deferred until recovery and off interfering agents when feasible [^111EqwUR] [^114TDV2U] [^114Pw7bk] [^117KjQL3]. Hold on, I should verify that repeat testing meaningfully reduces misclassification; indeed, two morning measurements reduce variability and improve diagnostic confidence compared with a single value [^114TDV2U] [^1122nN1A].

> I will now synthesize the expected result for a healthy 57-year-old man. Given the age-related decline and population data, a reasonable expected total testosterone range is approximately 350–500 ng/dL (about 12–17 nmol/L), acknowledging that values below about 350 ng/dL warrant confirmation and clinical correlation, and that some men at this age may fall just under 300 ng/dL without necessarily meeting criteria for symptomatic hypogonadism after confirmation [^notfound]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to anchor strictly to a 300 ng/dL cutoff, but I should correct that: while 300 ng/dL is commonly used in trials and guidelines, the EAU's 12 nmol/L threshold is slightly higher, and the AUA emphasizes confirmation and symptom integration rather than a single absolute value, so I should present a band that reflects both physiology and guideline thresholds rather than a rigid cutoff [^114EC6JE] [^1115QkK5] [^117Q5eXY].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical context is integrated. I should confirm symptoms such as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, low energy, or mood changes, and I should exclude secondary causes and medications that suppress the axis before labeling someone as hypogonadal; if total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is abnormal, I should add SHBG and calculated or measured free testosterone to clarify, and only consider therapy for confirmed deficiency with symptoms after shared decision-making and safety screening [^112qun1R] [^114mNUJU] [^11798Y7c]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overpromising benefits; guidelines suggest modest improvements in sexual function with therapy in appropriately selected symptomatic men, but evidence for vitality, cognition, and long-term cardiovascular outcomes remains limited, reinforcing the need for cautious, individualized decisions [^111u6X2r] [^114N8dPG].

Testosterone levels can be reliably measured in a 57-year-old man when testing is performed correctly [^115LrmTB]. The expected total testosterone range for a healthy 57-year-old is **264–916 ng/dL (9.16–31.8 nmol/L)** [^notfound], with a typical median around **400–500 ng/dL (13.9–17.3 nmol/L)** [^notfound]. Levels should be measured in the **morning (7–11 AM)** [^117KjQL3] on two separate days [^117Q5eXY] using a reliable assay [^1126QHXo], and interpreted with clinical context because age, comorbidities, and SHBG can affect results [^1171mA8L]. If total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is abnormal, **free testosterone** should be measured or calculated [^114mNUJU] to confirm hypogonadism [^111GBUFL].

## Reliability of testosterone measurement in a 57-year-old male

Testosterone measurement is reliable in a 57-year-old male when proper sampling and assay methods are used [^115LrmTB]. Key factors affecting reliability include:

- **Diurnal variation**: Testosterone levels peak in the morning and decline through the day; aging attenuates but does not eliminate this rhythm [^111EqwUR] [^114TDV2U].

- **Intra-individual variability**: Levels fluctuate day-to-day; two separate morning measurements reduce misclassification [^1122nN1A] [^117Q5eXY].

- **Assay accuracy**: Use validated, standardized assays (e.g. LC-MS/MS) to minimize analytical error [^115LrmTB] [^1126QHXo].

- **Clinical context**: Acute illness, medications, and comorbidities can transiently lower testosterone; interpret results accordingly [^114Pw7bk] [^113icLgp].

## Expected testosterone levels in a 57-year-old male

Total testosterone in healthy adult men follows a **normal distribution** [^notfound], with a reference range of 264–916 ng/dL (9.16–31.8 nmol/L) [^115LrmTB]. In a 57-year-old, **median total testosterone** is typically 400–500 ng/dL (13.9–17.3 nmol/L) [^notfound], though levels decline with age and vary with health and lifestyle factors [^113KnY62] [^1171mA8L].

## Factors influencing testosterone levels in a 57-year-old male

Several factors can **lower testosterone** in this age group:

- **Age-related decline**: Testosterone declines ~1–2% per year after age 30 [^1171UtFD] [^113v2PYN].

- **Comorbidities**: Obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease reduce testosterone [^115DMt7g] [^111RchU9].

- **Medications**: Opioids, glucocorticoids, and some antidepressants suppress testosterone [^113icLgp].

- **Lifestyle factors**: Smoking, alcohol, inactivity, and poor sleep lower testosterone [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines for testosterone measurement and interpretation

Guidelines recommend the following approach to **testing and interpretation**:

- **Timing**: Measure between 7–11 AM, ideally fasting [^111EqwUR] [^117KjQL3].

- **Confirmation**: Repeat on a separate day if the first value is low [^117Q5eXY] [^1126QHXo].

- **Assay selection**: Use validated assays; LC-MS/MS is preferred for total testosterone [^1151yqMm] [^1126QHXo].

- **Free testosterone**: Measure or calculate when total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is abnormal [^114mNUJU] [^111GBUFL].

- **Clinical correlation**: Diagnose hypogonadism only with consistent symptoms and low levels [^112oc1u4] [^112qun1R].

## Clinical significance of testosterone levels in a 57-year-old male

Testosterone levels in this age group carry **clinical implications**:

- **Symptoms**: Low testosterone is associated with fatigue, low libido, erectile dysfunction, mood changes, and reduced muscle mass [^116sJCKY] [^114DHNsa].

- **Health risks**: Low testosterone correlates with higher risks of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and metabolic syndrome [^115DMt7g] [^116mBpod].

- **Treatment considerations**: Testosterone therapy may benefit symptomatic men with confirmed low levels, but risks and benefits must be individualized [^114N8dPG] [^111u6X2r].

### 'What should I do with a 60-year old man with a slightly low serum total testosterone concentration and normal levels of serum gonadotrophins'? [^112kDkJD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

The fundamental question in assessing an older man with a slightly low total testosterone and normal gonadotrophin levels is to determine whether or not he has clinical hypogonadism. Hypogonadism is defined as a clinical syndrome complex, which comprises both symptoms as well as biochemical testosterone deficiency. As symptoms are nonspecific and there are no clear cut-off values for testosterone levels this invariably leads to a clinical dilemma. International guidelines have been published which provide recommendations to aid the clinician in making a diagnosis. Late-onset hypogonadism, the preferred terminology for age-related hypogonadism, can only be made once other causes have been excluded. Evidence shows that low testosterone levels are associated with several common male conditions including erectile dysfunction, osteoporosis and diabetes. Short-term studies have shown benefits of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) on body composition, bone metabolism, insulin resistance, sexual function and quality of life. Recommendations give clear advice on safety monitoring, specifically in relation to prostate health. If a diagnosis of hypogonadism is made with borderline testosterone levels then a 3-month trial of TRT can be considered. The diagnosis of hypogonadism associated with borderline testosterone levels and the decision to treat should only be made by an experienced clinician.

### What is a normal testosterone level for young men? Rethinking the 300 ng / dL cutoff for testosterone deficiency in men 20–44 years old [^113jmkXB]. The Journal of Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

There is an age-related decline in male testosterone production. It is therefore surprising that young men are evaluated for testosterone deficiency with the same cutoff of 300 ng/dL that was developed from samples of older men. Our aim is to describe normative total testosterone levels and age-specific cutoffs for low testosterone levels in men 20 to 44 years old.

Materials and Methods

We analyzed the 2011–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, which survey nationally representative samples of United States residents. Men 20 to 44 years old with testosterone levels were included. Men on hormonal medications, with a history of testicular cancer or orchiectomy, and with afternoon/evening laboratory values were excluded. We separated men into 5-year intervals and evaluated the testosterone levels of each age group, and for all men 20 to 44 years old. We used the American Urological Association definition of a "normal testosterone level" (the "middle tertile") to calculate age-specific cutoffs for low testosterone levels.

Results

Our final analytic cohort contained 1,486 men. Age-specific middle tertile levels were 409–558 ng/dL (20–24 years old), 413–575 ng/dL (25–29 years old), 359–498 ng/dL (30–34 years old), 352–478 ng/dL (35–39 years old), and 350–473 ng/dL (40–44 years old). Age-specific cutoffs for low testosterone levels were 409, 413, 359, 352, and 350 ng/dL, respectively.

Conclusions

Diagnosis of testosterone deficiency has traditionally been performed in an age-indiscriminate manner. However, young men have different testosterone reference ranges than older men. Accordingly, age-specific normative values and cutoffs should be integrated into the evaluation of young men presenting with testosterone deficiency.

American College of Physicians GRADE framework — grading certainty of evidence and recommendations is defined as follows: High certainty is described as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect", Moderate certainty is "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizeable possibility that it is substantially different", and Low certainty is "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". Recommendation strength includes Strong, where there is "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", it "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations should be considered as quality indicators to guide the development of accountability, reporting, and payment programs"; and Conditional, where "Benefits probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", it "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and "Policy making will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Quality indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

Values and preferences — older men with age-related low testosterone concentrations: The recommendation not to treat asymptomatic older men with age-related declines in testosterone concentration places a higher value on avoiding unknown long-term risks and a lower value on the limited evidence of potential benefits. Clinicians should recognize considerable expert disagreement due to incomplete evidence; nonspecific age-related symptoms and low testosterone often coexist without a clear causal link; although evidence suggests benefits for sexual function, anemia, vertebral and femoral bone mineral density, and possibly walking distance, the risks remain unknown, and long-term efficacy for patient-important outcomes (disability, falls, fractures, low-grade progressive depressive disorder, and progression to diabetes or dementia) is not known.

### New horizons in testosterone and the ageing male [^1167m2da]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

The fall in testosterone levels with age appears to be a real phenomenon. Declining testicular function and hypothalamic dysregulation appear to be the mechanisms explaining the fall in testosterone levels with age. The increased prevalence of obesity and chronic illness in ageing men both cause a large drop in testosterone levels independent of ageing. Age-related hypogonadism appears to be different to other 'classical' causes of hypogonadism. Testosterone levels are not unequivocally low and associated symptoms are non-specific. In frail older men with low testosterone levels, testosterone therapy appears to improve QOL and physical function. In less frail men, however, effects of testosterone therapy in the ageing male are small and/or inconsistent. There remains an urgent need for randomised clinical trials with sufficient size, duration and power to determine specific benefits and risks of testosterone therapy in older men.

### Are declining testosterone levels a major risk factor for ill-health in aging men? [^116mBpod]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2008). Low credibility.

As men grow older, testosterone levels fall, with a steeper decline in unbound or free testosterone compared with total testosterone concentrations. Lower testosterone levels have been associated with poorer cognitive function, and with impaired general and sexual health in aging men. Recently, lower testosterone levels have been linked with metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes, both conditions associated with cardiovascular disease, and shown to predict higher overall and cardiovascular-related mortality in middle-aged and older men. However, reverse causation has to be considered, as systemic illness may result in reduced testosterone levels. Thus, the strength of these associations and the likely direction of causation need to be carefully considered. Furthermore, these conditions may overlap, for example aging, lower testosterone levels, erectile dysfunction and cardiovascular disease are interrelated. Cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies may be informative. However, ultimately randomized controlled trials of testosterone therapy are needed to clarify its role in the maintenance of general and sexual health in aging men. Testosterone therapy should be considered in hypogonadal men who meet rigorous criteria for the diagnosis of androgen deficiency. Additional consideration should be given to designing and testing interventions that may prevent or ameliorate the age-related decline in testosterone levels in men.

### Testosterone and ill-health in aging men [^115DMt7g]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2009). Medium credibility.

As men age, testosterone levels decline, and decreased testosterone levels are associated with increased risks of osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus and mortality. Nevertheless, it is still uncertain whether reduced testosterone level is a cause of ill-health or a marker of pre-existing disease, as systemic illness lowers testosterone levels. Most circulating testosterone is bound to sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin, whereas a small proportion circulates as free testosterone. Decreased SHBG level is associated with increased risks for insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, although it would also be expected to be associated with increased free testosterone level. During male aging, total and free testosterone levels fall while SHBG level rises. Thus, associations between decreasing androgens and negative health outcomes might differ across men of various ages. Trials of testosterone therapy report benefits for body composition and BMD, but there are limited data on the effect of testosterone supplementation on cardiovascular risk. Whereas men who have androgen deficiency should be considered for testosterone therapy, the role of testosterone supplementation in older men who are not clearly hypogonadal requires further clarification. Further studies are also needed to establish whether the age-related decline in circulating testosterone level in men can be modified or prevented.

### Symptoms of late-onset hypogonadism in men [^116sJCKY]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

A small percentage of older men are hypogonadal for no apparent reason other than age, a condition called late-onset hypogonadism. This condition is accompanied by symptoms, especially sexual symptoms, most notably decreased libido. Testosterone treatment of men who have late-onset hypogonadism improves all aspects of sexual function and also mood, depressive symptoms, and self-reported walking ability. Testosterone treatment would not be expected to improve similar symptoms in men who are not unequivocally hypogonadal.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114BQU8J]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In the absence of clinically suspected hypothalamic-pituitary disease, measurement of serum prolactin is the only diagnostic test that is routinely recommended for evaluation of causes of secondary hypogonadism of men ≥ 50 years. Men with secondary hypogonadism and clinical or biochemical findings suggestive of a sellar mass or hypothalamic-pituitary disease, an elevated serum prolactin concentration, a very low serum total testosterone concentration, or serum gonadotropin concentration below the lower limit of normal should undergo sellar imaging. There is no well-defined threshold of total testosterone concentration for determining when to perform sellar imaging. The published literature, summarized by Hirsch et al, included 313 middle-aged and older men (mean age 57 years) with sexual symptoms and a mean total testosterone concentration of 190 ng/dL (6.6 nmol/L). Only 6 patients (1.9%) had a macroadenoma, all of whom had total testosterone concentrations of 104 ng/dL (3.6 nmol/L) or less. The Endocrine Society guidelines recommend pituitary imaging for men with symptoms of tumor mass effect (eg, visual impairment, visual field defect, or new-onset headache), panhypopituitarism, persistent hyperprolactinemia, or a serum total testosterone < 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L). Of note, if prolactin is not elevated, a pituitary lesion has to be relatively large to cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and therefore sellar computed tomography (CT) has sufficient sensitivity. A sellar CT involves a modest radiation exposure, but it is less likely to detect an incidental pituitary microadenoma. This lower sensitivity to detect a microadenoma might be an advantage compared to MRI scanning because nonsecretory pituitary microadenomas are common and are typically clinically inconsequential in older men.

AUA Guideline — testosterone therapy dosing target — 22. Clinicians should adjust testosterone therapy dosing to achieve a total testosterone level in the middle tertile of the normal reference range. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). The goal of testosterone therapy is the normalization of total testosterone levels combined with improvement in symptoms or signs, and the Panel recommends using the minimal dosing necessary to drive testosterone levels to the normal physiologic range of 450–600 ng/dL, which is the middle tertile of the normal range for most laboratories; the Panel notes that age-adjustments may be required, but from a practical standpoint, 450–600 ng/dL represents a viable range for all age-groups, and achieving testosterone levels in this window should ameliorate any symptoms that are genuinely associated with testosterone deficiency.

How Should the Clinical Suspicion of Androgen Deficiency Be Assessed Biochemically?

Reproducibly low serum total testosterone concentrations measured by an accurate testosterone assay on a sample drawn in the early morning (7–10 Am) in the fasting state are a cornerstone of the diagnosis of male hypogonadism. It is optimal to use a total testosterone assay that has been validated by an accuracy-based standardization or quality control program with a normal range of 264–916 ng/dL (9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in healthy, young men. Use of such an assay facilitates application of findings of the T-Trials, the largest randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing testosterone vs placebo with clinically important outcomes in men with low serum testosterone concentrations, and the soon-to-be-reported TRAVERSE study, a large RCT with cardiovascular outcomes; these trials used a standardized, harmonized total testosterone assay with this normal range.

If the initial serum total testosterone is low, confirmation is required. Without compelling evidence (eg, specific clinical features, such as very small testes and high serum gonadotropin concentrations), androgen deficiency should not be diagnosed with a single low testosterone concentration because of significant diurnal and day-to-day variation. Up to 30% of older men with a low serum testosterone concentration have a normal value on repeat testing. Overnight fasting increases serum testosterone by 9% to 16% and reduces the significant diurnal variability of serum testosterone concentrations. Most experts prefer to err in underdiagnosing very mild hypogonadism in older men over misdiagnosing eugonadal men as hypogonadal. The benefit of testosterone therapy on vitality and bone (and likely other parameters) is related to the change from baseline serum testosterone in older men; men with lower serum baseline testosterone concentrations are more likely to benefit from normalization of serum testosterone. Therefore, borderline low serum testosterone concentrations or multiple serum testosterone measurements that are discordant (eg, one result that is slightly low and one that is normal) should be interpreted cautiously and generally not as confirmatory evidence of hypogonadism.

Endocrine Society guideline — age-related testosterone changes and trial outcomes in older men summarizes that TT and FT concentrations fall with increasing age in men, and because SHBG increases with age the decline in FT is greater than in TT; the fall is gradual with higher rates of decline in men with adiposity and comorbid diseases. Initial RCTs in older men had relatively small sample sizes, included healthy men with low-normal T, and showed T treatment consistently increased LBM and vertebral BMD and decreased fat mass, with variable effects on other outcomes and no RCT large enough to evaluate risk. The TTrials found that T treatment of 1 year in symptomatic men ≥ 65 years of age yielded moderate improvements in sexual function and small improvements in walking distance, mood, and depressive symptoms with no improvements in vitality and cognitive function, and among anemic men a greater proportion assigned to T had hemoglobin increments ≥ 1 g/dL compared with placebo, with T administration associated with significantly greater increases in hemoglobin and PSA levels vs placebo.

### Benefits of testosterone replacement therapy in hypogonadal males [^115HR4kZ]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance

Hypogonadism is defined by consistently low serum testosterone levels in conjunction with clinical symptoms. Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can be used to achieve physiologic levels of testosterone. Testosterone deficiency is associated with increased mortality and poorer health outcomes.

Purpose

To compare rates of mortality, atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and prostate cancer in hypogonadal men who received TRT versus those who did not.

Methods

The TriNetX database was utilized to access deidentified, retrospective propensity matched EMR data from 57 participating health care organizations between 2005 to 2020. Cohorts included males 40 to 80years old diagnosed with hypogonadism who were prescribed TRT versus no TRT. Propensity matching was performed to reduce bias and balance confounding factors between the 2 groups. The following 3-year outcomes were analyzed: mortality, AF, stroke, MI, and prostate cancer.

Results

There were 163,456 male patients identified with hypogonadism, and 133,584 were included after propensity matching. There was a lower mortality rate, (3.1% vs 3.6%; RR, 0.886; P < .001), decreased risk of AF (3.6% vs 4.0%; RR 0.900; P < .001), less stroke (1.6% vs 1.8%; RR, 0.898; P < .011), and fewer cases of prostate cancer (1.9% vs 2.9%; RR 0.648; P < .001) for patients on TRT.

Conclusions

Using TRT is associated with moderately lower rates of mortality, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and prostate cancer in hypogonadal men versus no TRT. There is potential for missed cases of stroke, prostate cancer, and cardiovascular disease incidence not captured by the database. As prescriptions of TRT increase, understanding risks and benefits will help guide future practice.

Back to the Case

Although this man's initial serum total testosterone concentration was very low, he had a recent severe illness, (hospitalization for pneumonia 2 weeks prior to the initial testosterone measurement). Any significant acute systemic illness or flare of chronic systemic illness can transiently suppress the HPT axis and serum testosterone. Assessment for hypogonadism should not be done in men who are acutely unwell (and below their baseline health) or during hospital admission. Although there are no prospective data on the time frame of HPT axis recovery after an acute systemic illness, clinical experience indicates that the time to recovery is inversely related to the severity and duration of the illness. Because making a diagnosis of hypogonadism is not urgent, we recommend deferring testosterone measurements until the patient has recovered to their baseline health for at least 2 months. In patients with a protracted systemic illness lasting more than a few weeks, serial measurements of testosterone over several months are helpful; a pattern of increasing serum testosterone suggests that the HPT axis might fully recover.

In our patient, the initial measurement of serum testosterone was done on a nonfasting afternoon sample. Serum testosterone has a circadian rhythm with highest concentrations in the morning, and the normal range of serum testosterone is based on early morning blood samples. Although this circadian rhythm might be attenuated in many older men, male hypogonadism should be diagnosed based on an early morning testosterone concentration. Lastly, this man's low serum testosterone was not confirmed with a second measurement.

### Testosterone for' late-onset hypogonadism' in men? [^112a5twd]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Testosterone replacement therapy is indicated in men with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone due to classical primary or secondary hypogonadism.1–8 Of note, however, some testosterone preparations are also specifically licensed for "male climacteric symptoms like decreased libido".1–3 This indication is based on the concept of 'late-onset hypogonadism', a term used to describe the decline in testosterone concentrations with age plus associated symptoms (by analogy with the female menopause/climacteric).9 Other terms for 'late-onset hypogonadism' include 'partial androgen deficiency in the ageing male'. It has also been known as 'andropause' or, colloquially, 'male menopause', but these latter terms are not usually used by specialists nowadays. Here we discuss whether 'late-onset hypogonadism' is a distinct medical entity, and whether testosterone replacement has a role in older men with low testosterone concentrations but not classical hypogonadism.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111qnJmQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy — prostate cancer screening and monitoring when considering treatment: The baseline evaluation should identify and exclude men with a history of prostate cancer or those at high risk, and organizations strongly encourage shared decision making regarding screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and digital rectal examination (DRE). Clinicians should consider screening and monitoring for all hypogonadal men who are 55 to 69 years of age, are being considered for T-replacement therapy, are in excellent health, and have a life expectancy > 10 years. This should start at age 40 in higher-risk men (such as African Americans and those with a first-degree male relative with prostate cancer). Men < 40 years do not need prostate monitoring, and in men diagnosed > 70 years of age, the risk of death from prostate cancer is not high enough to warrant monitoring. Baseline risk assessment should consider age, family history, race, prior biopsy, elevated PSA, and examination findings; clinicians can estimate risk using a prostate cancer risk calculator.

Serum Free Testosterone Assessments

Accurate assessment of serum free testosterone might be helpful when serum total testosterone concentration approximates the lower limit of normal or when abnormalities in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) are suspected (Table 2; Fig. 1). A fasting early morning total testosterone concentration of > 350 ng/dL (12 nmol/L) measured by a reliable assay is generally consistent with a normal serum free testosterone and typically does not require assessment of free testosterone except in men with suspected or proven high SHBG concentrations (see below). The most common causes of the constellation of a low serum total testosterone, low serum SHBG, and normal free serum testosterone (ie, pseudohypogonadism; Fig. 1) are obesity and T2D (Table 2).

Table 2.
Causes of high and low circulating SHBG

There are no well-validated, outcome-based normal reference ranges for serum free testosterone concentration in older men. In addition, there is wide variation in the quality and the various methods used to measure or calculate serum free testosterone concentrations. Direct methods of measurement of free testosterone are inaccurate and should not be used.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116hpcDJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Screening for hypogonadism — because of the lack of consensus on the extent to which hypogonadism is an important public health problem, as well as the lack of data on the performance characteristics of candidate screening tools, we do not recommend population screening. Therefore, screening for hypogonadism does not fulfill the necessary criteria to justify population-level screening. For case detection in clinical settings, we suggest that clinicians not use the available case-finding questionnaires for detecting T deficiency in men receiving health care for unrelated reasons, and we suggest that clinicians consider using TT concentration measurements for case detection in men with certain clinical disorders in whom the prevalence of hypogonadism is high and T treatment might be indicated. The recommendation not to routinely screen men in the general population places a high value on avoiding labeling, testing, treating, and monitoring healthy men for whom the benefits and risks are unclear, and places a low value on the potential benefits of early detection and treatment of T deficiency in men who have not sought medical attention.

### Testosterone therapy increases sexual desire in ageing men with low-normal testosterone levels and symptoms of androgen deficiency [^113AvGc8]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2008). Low credibility.

Although decline in sexual function is a common reason for ageing men to seek advice regarding testosterone therapy, placebo-controlled trial data have been unable to show a consistent, beneficial role for testosterone. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of testosterone therapy on sexual function in non-obese ageing men with symptoms of androgen deficiency and low-normal serum testosterone levels. A total of 60 men aged 55 years or older in good general health with total testosterone (TT) levels < 15 nM, and with symptoms suggestive of androgen deficiency, were randomized in a double-blinded protocol to transdermal testosterone patches or placebo for 12 months. Sexual function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function at weeks 0, 26 and 52. In men receiving testosterone TT levels increased by 30% (P = 0.01) and luteinizing hormone decreased by 50% (P < 0.001). Relative to placebo, testosterone therapy improved sexual desire (P = 0.04); however other parameters of sexual function including erectile function were unaffected by the treatment. Ageing men in good general health and with symptoms of androgen deficiency and low-normal serum testosterone levels receiving 12 months of transdermal testosterone therapy experienced, relative to placebo, improved sexual desire but no effect on other parameters of sexual function.

In young men (defined as age < 50 years) with classic hypogonadism caused by known diseases of the hypothalamus, pituitary or testes, testosterone replacement therapy induces a number of beneficial effects, for example, the development of secondary sex characteristics, improvement and maintenance of sexual function, and increases in skeletal muscle mass and BMD. Moreover, testosterone treatment in this patient population is associated with a low frequency of adverse events. Circulating testosterone levels decline progressively with age, starting in the second and third decade of life, owing to defects at all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis. In cohort studies, testosterone levels are associated weakly but consistently with muscle mass, strength, physical function, anaemia, BMD and bone quality, visceral adiposity, and with the risk of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, falls, fractures and mortality. However, the clinical benefits and long-term risks of testosterone therapy — especially prostate-related and cardiovascular-related adverse events — have not been adequately assessed in large, randomized clinical trials involving older men (defined as age > 65 years) with androgen deficiency. Therefore, a general policy of testosterone replacement in all older men with age-related decline in testosterone levels is not justified.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11798Y7c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the "Testosterone Therapy in Men With Androgen Deficiency Syndromes" guideline published in 2010.

Participants

The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of 10 medical content experts and a clinical practice guideline methodologist.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees and members and the cosponsoring organization were invited to review and comment on preliminary drafts of the guideline.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone-binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate formula. In men determined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of hypogonadism after discussing the potential benefits and risks of therapy and of monitoring therapy and involving the patient in decision making. We recommend against starting T therapy in patients who are planning fertility in the near term or have any of the following conditions: breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, prostate-specific antigen level > 4 ng/mL, prostate-specific antigen > 3 ng/mL in men at increased risk of prostate cancer (e.g. African Americans and men with a first-degree relative with diagnosed prostate cancer) without further urological evaluation, elevated hematocrit, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke within the last 6 months, or thrombophilia. We suggest that when clinicians institute T therapy, they aim at achieving T concentrations in the mid-normal range during treatment with any of the approved formulations, taking into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving T therapy using a standardized plan that includes: evaluating symptoms, adverse effects, and compliance; measuring serum T and hematocrit concentrations; and evaluating prostate cancer risk during the first year after initiating T therapy.

### Testosterone therapy in adult men with androgen deficiency syndromes: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113EYWFv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a professional writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

The Task Force used systematic reviews of available evidence to inform its key recommendations. The Task Force used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of recommendation and the quality of evidence, using the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation group.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during three group meetings, several conference calls, and e-mail communications. The drafts prepared by the panelists with the help of a professional writer were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Committee, and Council. The version approved by the Council was placed on The Endocrine Society's web site for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and in some patients by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using accurate assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for symptomatic men with androgen deficiency, who have low testosterone levels, to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 3 ng/ml without further urological evaluation, erythrocytosis (hematocrit > 50%), hyperviscosity, untreated obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) greater than 19, or class III or IV heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

### EAU guidelines on sexual and reproductive health [^113ykDc2]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for male hypogonadism, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to use a total testosterone value of 12 nmol/L (3.5 ng/mL) as a reliable threshold to diagnose late-onset hypogonadism.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^114TDV2U]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — testosterone measurement timing, variability, and illness effects — Among men with traditional (10p.m. to 6a.m.) sleep patterns, peak testosterone values occur around 8a.m., with 32–39% of the diurnal total decline occurring within the first 30 minutes of waking, and total testosterone values obtained at 4p.m. in men aged 30–40 years were 20–25% lower than measurements taken at 8a.m., while men aged 70 years experienced only a 10% decline between the two time points. Intra-individual testosterone variability is significant, as repeat measures can fluctuate 65–153% between tests and using 2 or 3 measures can reduce this variability by 30–43%, respectively; to minimize these effects, two morning draws for testosterone are recommended before any clinical intervention. In acute respiratory infections in young men, mean total testosterone levels declined by 10%, with some cohorts experiencing reductions of up to 30%.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1171UtFD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Testosterone assessment and related remarks — age effects, binding, and testing considerations: Testosterone levels demonstrate an age-related decline, with healthy men reaching the highest serum T levels around the age of 30 years and thereafter showing a gradual decline at a rate of 1–2% annually, and the level below which symptoms occur has not been clearly established; about 2% of circulating T is free, 44% is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and 54% is bound to albumin and other proteins. For borderline low T values, two measurements performed with the same assay are preferred. When assessing fertility is required, clinicians should perform semen analysis before starting T replacement, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) reduces circulating gonadotropins with reductions of up to 60% for FSH and 50% for LH.

### Serum androgen levels and their association to depression and Alzheimer dementia in a cohort of 75-year-old men over 5 years: results of the VITA study [^112HX5ps]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2009). Low credibility.

The role of androgens on cognitive function and mood is not well documented yet. We therefore evaluated all male participants (n = 247, mean age 75.7 years) of a population-based study regarding testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), depression and Alzheimer Dementia (AD) for 5 years using the DSM-IV and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. At study entry, low serum testosterone levels (< 350 ng per 100 ml) were present in 45 (30.8%), low DHEAS (< 50 microg per 100 ml) in 44 (30.1%), depression in 11 (7.5%) and AD in 7 (4.7%) men. After 5 years, the number of men with low testosterone levels increased to 52 (+15.5%), for low DHEAS to 57 (+29.5%) for depression to 34 (+219%) and for AD to 43 (+515%). Testosterone levels were not associated to prevalence or incidence of depression or dementia. Mean testosterone was 398.1 ng per 100 mL in depressive men and 431.7 ng per 100 mL in those without depression (P = 0.57) and 406.3 ng per 100 mL in those with AD versus 429.5 ng per 100 mL without AD (P = 0.66).

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116B6gbs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society testosterone therapy guideline — treatment goals and monitoring: We recommend testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of testosterone deficiency. We suggest that when clinicians institute T therapy, they aim at achieving T concentrations in the mid-normal range during treatment with any of the approved formulations. Clinicians should monitor men receiving T therapy using a standardized plan that includes: evaluating symptoms, adverse effects, and compliance; measuring serum T and hematocrit concentrations; and evaluating prostate cancer risk during the first year after initiating T therapy.

### Salivary testosterone levels and health status in men and women in the British general population: findings from the third national survey of sexual attitudes and lifestyles (natsal-3) [^112paZgC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

In men, T deficiency with pituitary or testicular disease (male hypogonadism) is known to cause a wide range of symptoms and conditions including sexual dysfunction, loss of vigor, poor physical performance, fractures, and low mood, which can be effectively treated with testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). However, the more general relationship between male T levels and ill-health is less well understood. Community-based studies in men have shown associations between lower average serum testosterone (serum-T) and poorer health outcomes, including frailty, obesity, insulin resistance, cardiovascular diseases, and mortality, although findings have not always been consistent. It is suggested that lower T levels in older men may contribute to these ageing-related conditions although questions remain about direction and causality. Some studies have also cast doubt as to whether there truly is an independent age-related decrease in T, or whether the observed decline is a biomarker of accumulated comorbidities. Currently, whether T treatment would benefit symptomatic older men with low T remains a subject of intense debate and research. Many of the existing studies have been carried out in middle-age or older men, and the health implications of lower T in younger men are unclear. In women, circulating concentrations of T are typically around 5–10% of those in men, with distinct age-related declines, independent of the menopause. The evidence for associations between T and health in women is even more equivocal than for men. Furthermore, research efforts in women have been seriously hampered by inadequate sensitivity of serum-T measurements, due to the low concentration of T and poor specificity of commonly used immunoassay methods.

### European Academy of Andrology (EAA) guidelines on investigation, treatment and monitoring of functional hypogonadism in males: endorsing organization: European Society of Endocrinology [^114Q8Rbn]. Andrology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for male hypogonadism, more specifically with respect to clinical and laboratory follow-up, EAA 2020 guidelines recommend to consider measuring on-treatment serum total testosterone concentrations at each clinic visit to ensure that average total testosterone concentrations achieve the targeted mid-normal range for young males.

### Male late-onset hypogonadism: pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^114DHNsa]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2011). Medium credibility.

Some aging men develop a condition of suppressed serum testosterone levels, which is associated with diffuse sexual, physical and psychological symptoms. Several terms are used for this syndrome, but late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) is preferred. The diagnosis of LOH is often uncertain because symptoms (occurring in 20–40% of men) and low circulating testosterone (found in 20% of men > 70 years of age) seldom occur together. The strict diagnostic criteria for LOH include reproducibly low serum testosterone levels and sexual symptoms, including erectile dysfunction and reduced frequency of sexual thoughts and morning erections. Using these diagnostic criteria, only 2% of 40–80-year-old men have LOH. Obesity and impaired general health (including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and frailty) are more common reasons for low testosterone than advanced age per se. It seems logical, therefore, to begin by treating these conditions before testosterone replacement therapy is initiated. Even then, testosterone should only be used if there are no contraindications, such as unstable cardiac disease, serious prostate symptoms and high hemoglobin level. The long-term benefit of testosterone replacement therapy is uncertain, and the experimental nature of the treatment, and its associated risks, must be fully explained to the patient before treatment begins.

### Late-onset male hypogonadism: clinical and laboratory evaluation [^112Uxunn]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Late-onset male hypogonadism (LOH) is a clinical and biochemical syndrome associated with advancing age and characterised by low serum testosterone concentrations. An understanding of the physiology of androgens in the ageing man is essential for the appropriate diagnosis of LOH. Clinical assessment of androgen status relevant to clinical biochemists and chemical pathologists is outlined in this review. Laboratory investigations of androgen status in men are not without pitfalls and the authors highlight problems associated with measuring and calculating serum testosterone and its fractions, the interpretation of which can be problematic. Current clinical guidelines and recommendations regarding the diagnosis and monitoring of LOH are also summarised.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1176zTxe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In this article, we use a case-based approach to outline the assessment and management of men older than 50 years presenting with features of androgen deficiency and a low testosterone level, based on a review of the literature (PubMed), using the search terms " male hypogonadism", " testosterone deficiency", " androgen deficiency", " functional hypogonadism", " late onset hypogonadism", as well as the clinical experience of the authors. We will focus on the diagnosis and management of possible androgen deficiency (Fig. 1). Fertility will not be discussed. Many of the principles and recommendations that we discuss are pertinent to men under age 50. However, we focus on men ≥ 50 years old in this manuscript because of the following: 1) the prevalence of low serum testosterone concentrations without identifiable HPT pathology increases significantly in men starting at age 40–50; 2) most of the high-quality epidemiological and randomized controlled studies of men with low serum testosterone concentrations without identifiable HPT pathology were performed in men ≥ 50 years old; 3) the diagnostic evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years old differs from younger because a) evaluation for hypothalamic and pituitary disease with sellar imaging and evaluation for iron overload syndromes is often unnecessary in older men; b) infertility due to HPT dysfunction is less commonly important for men ≥ 50 years old; and c) long-term suppression of the HPT axis (iatrogenic androgen deficiency) is much more likely to occur with exogenous testosterone therapy in men ≥ 50 years old.

### Effects of testosterone treatment in older men [^1116jJ6V]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The study Testosterone Trial was published by Snyder PJ and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Male hypogonadism. In the Testosterone Trial study, the trial question was: what is the role of testosterone treatment in older men? In the Testosterone Trial study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Testosterone Trial study, the population was: 790 male patients. The inclusion criteria were men ≥ 65 years of age with serum testosterone concentration of < 275 ng/dL and symptoms suggesting hypoandrogenism. The key exclusion criteria were history of prostate cancer, a risk of all prostate cancer of > 35% or of high-grade prostate cancer of > 7% as determined according to the Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator, an IPSS (IPSS; range, 0–35, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms of BPH) of > 19, conditions known to cause hypogonadism, receipt of medications that alter the testosterone concentration, or high cardiovascular risk. In the Testosterone Trial study, the interventions were: n = 395 testosterone gel (AndroGel 1% with an initial dose of 5 g daily) n = 395 placebo (similar application and appearance to AndroGel). In the Testosterone Trial study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in change in score on the Psychosexual Daily Questionnaire (0.2 points vs. -0.1 points;). In the Testosterone Trial study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the percentage of patients achieving an improvement of at least 50 m in 6MWD (20.3% vs. 12.1%; OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.45) No significant difference in the percentage of patients achieving an improvement of least 4 points on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scale (72.4% vs. 62.8%; OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.84). In the Testosterone Trial study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in rates of adverse events. In the Testosterone Trial study, the conclusion was: in men ≥ 65 years of age with serum testosterone concentration of < 275 ng/dL and symptoms suggesting hypoandrogenism, testosterone gel was superior to placebo with respect to change in score on the Psychosexual Daily Questionnaire.

### Testosterone and estradiol among older men [^113KnY62]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Testosterone and estradiol levels decline with age in men. This change may affect multiple clinical outcomes, but there have been few reports of the distribution and correlates of testosterone and estradiol concentrations in elderly men.

Objective

The purpose of these studies was to assess sex steroid levels in a large cohort of older men.

Design

We conducted a cross-sectional cohort evaluation.

Setting

Community-dwelling men were studied at six academic medical centers in the United States.

Participants

The Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study is a prospective cohort of men aged at least 65 yr. In these studies, a randomly selected stratified subsample of 2623 participants was analyzed.

Main Outcome Measures

We assessed levels of total and free testosterone and estradiol and SHBG.

Results

Age was inversely associated with free testosterone and free estradiol levels (P for trend = 0.001 for both). Notably, at any age, there was substantial variation in levels of each hormone. Free testosterone levels were lower in men with greater body mass index, lower SHBG, and poorer self-reported health status and in those of Asian race. Free estradiol concentrations were lower in men with lower body mass index and higher SHBG levels. Free estradiol and free testosterone were modestly correlated (r = 0.20; P < 0.001), but at any level of free testosterone, there was considerable variation in free estradiol levels.

Conclusions

This is the largest cohort of older men in which sex steroid levels are available, and it demonstrates that testosterone and estradiol, and their free fractions, tend to decline with age even among older men. However, substantial variation is also present. The relationships between sex steroid levels and their consequences in aging are likely to be complex.

### Testosterone therapy in men with androgen deficiency syndromes: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114N7HCt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to update the guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men published previously in 2006.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and, in some men in whom total testosterone is near the lower limit of normal or in whom SHBG abnormality is suspected by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using validated assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for men with symptomatic androgen deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 4 ng/ml or greater than 3 ng/ml in men at high risk for prostate cancer such as African-Americans or men with first-degree relatives with prostate cancer without further urological evaluation, hematocrit greater than 50%, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score above 19, or uncontrolled or poorly controlled heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^113fE35g]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for testosterone deficiency — mechanism and clinical evidence: hCG is an LH analog usually prescribed to treat a deficiency in LH production, and in a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial of older men with androgen deficiency (mean age 67 years), hCG therapy produced a 150% increase in total testosterone level. Combination therapy with low dose hCG has been described to maintain intratesticular testosterone levels and preserve spermatogenesis for men on exogenous testosterone, hCG alone or with SERMs has been shown to facilitate recovery of testosterone production and spermatogenesis in men with prior exogenous testosterone use or anabolic steroid abuse, and return of sperm to the ejaculate can be highly variable, taking up to two years after cessation of exogenous testosterone in some cases with some men never experiencing return of sperm.

Endocrine Society testosterone therapy guideline — diagnosis of hypogonadism: We recommend diagnosing hypogonadism in men with symptoms and signs of testosterone deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum total testosterone and/or free testosterone concentrations (when indicated). We recommend against routine screening of men in the general population for hypogonadism. In men who have hypogonadism, we recommend distinguishing between primary (testicular) and secondary (pituitary–hypothalamic) hypogonadism by measuring serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations. In men with hypogonadism, we suggest further evaluation to identify the etiology of hypothalamic, pituitary, and/or testicular dysfunction.

Testosterone testing confirmation — because serum testosterone (T) concentrations vary significantly due to diurnal, circadian and circannual rhythms, episodic secretion, and assay variations, it is important to confirm low T concentrations since 30% of men with an initial T concentration in the hypogonadal range have a normal T concentration on repeat measurement, and a small fraction of healthy young men can fall below the normal range during a 24-hour period.

### The prevalence of and risk factors for androgen deficiency in aging Taiwanese men [^111RchU9]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Androgen deficiency in aging men has attracted much medical interest. Most studies on androgen deficiency have been conducted in Caucasian populations, and data from other ethnicities are lacking.

Aim

To evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for androgen deficiency and symptomatic androgen deficiency in Taiwanese men over 40 years old.

Methods

From August 2007 to April 2008, a free health screening was conducted by a medical center in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and 819 men participated in this health screening. All participants completed a health questionnaire, received a detailed physical examination, and blood samples were drawn between 8:00 and 12:00 am.

Main Outcome Measures

Serum total testosterone (TT), albumin, and sex hormone-binding globulin levels were measured. The level of free testosterone (FT) was calculated. Clinical symptoms of androgen deficiency were assessed using the Androgen Deficiency in the Aging Male (ADAM) questionnaire.

Results

Seven hundred thirty-four men who met the inclusion criteria (mean age 57.4 ± 6.7 years; range: 43–87 years) were included in this study. The prevalence of androgen deficiency was 24.1% based on the criterion of TT level < 300 ng/dL, and 16.6% based on the criterion of both TT < 300 ng/dL and FT < 5 ng/dL. The prevalence of symptomatic androgen deficiency was 12.0%. Both prevalence of androgen deficiency and symptomatic androgen deficiency increased with age. Older age, obesity, and diabetes mellitus were independent risk factors for androgen deficiency and symptomatic androgen deficiency.

Conclusions

In a sample of aging Taiwanese men, a substantial proportion had androgen deficiency and symptomatic androgen deficiency, and the prevalence increased with age. Older age, obesity, and diabetes mellitus were independent risk factors for androgen deficiency and symptomatic androgen deficiency. Those potentially modifiable risk factors like obesity and diabetes mellitus should be prevented to maintain normal testosterone levels during aging in men.

### The quantitative ADAM questionnaire: a new tool in quantifying the severity of hypogonadism [^115GqRhX]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2009). Low credibility.

We believe that the qADAM is a viable alternative to screening tools such as the ADAM and the AMS. The qADAM correlates with serum testosterone, indicating that it has potential as a screening as well as a diagnostic tool. Furthermore, the qADAM correlated with other instruments of sexual and hormonal function, such as the sexual and hormonal domains of the EPIC and the SHIM questionnaires.

Several aspects of our experimental design deserve further elaboration. We chose an experimental group composed of 57 men with prostate cancer scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy. We acknowledge that the diagnosis of prostate cancer may have had an impact on these patients' symptoms of hypogonadism and their qADAM responses. Additionally, our decision to measure testosterone levels over the course of the day may draw some scrutiny. It is known that younger males often show variability in their testosterone level over the course of the day. It is believed by some authors, however, that the diurnal variability in testosterone levels seen in younger males is absent in older males. 24 Given that our sample was composed entirely of men older than age 50, we did not feel that the variability in collection times altered the data significantly. Furthermore, we realize that the data presented do not validate the qADAM, but simply show significant correlations with serum testosterone and responses to other questionnaires, such as the ADAM, the SHIM, and the EPIC questionnaires.

Although these initial results have been promising, some aspects of the qADAM should be explored more thoroughly. In particular, future study will be conducted to evaluate the ability of the qADAM to monitor response to treatment over time. Further work to define the sensitivity and specificity of the qADAM using a larger group of patients will also be needed.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116F2R6D]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Monitoring of testosterone-replacement therapy — evaluation and laboratory schedule: In hypogonadal men who have started testosterone therapy, we recommend evaluating the patient after treatment initiation to assess whether the patient has responded to treatment, is suffering any adverse effects, and is complying with the treatment regimen (Ungraded Good Practice Statement). Clinicians should maintain serum testosterone concentrations during treatment in the mid-normal range for healthy young men, evaluate symptoms and formulation-specific adverse events at each visit, and measure testosterone and hematocrit at 3 to 6 months, at 12 months, and annually thereafter; for those who choose prostate monitoring, include PSA and DRE 3 to 12 months.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^113uQvHM]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) testosterone reference ranges and interpretation — due to methodological challenges there is considerable variability in testosterone reference ranges; as an example, a total testosterone value of 250 ng/dL may be considered low based on the current guideline but normal by a laboratory because reference laboratories often define normal as the 5th (or 2.5th) to the 95th (or 97.5th) percentiles. As the literature uses absolute values to define low testosterone, the absolute value is ultimately the most important factor to determine which patients may expect to achieve benefits with testosterone therapy, and in cases of discrepancy between laboratory reference ranges and this guideline, clinicians are recommended to utilize the absolute value, acknowledging variability across labs including CDC-certified LCMS.
