## Question

When Shoud I research subclinical atheromatosis with coronary calcium score in T2DM patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to use coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring to evaluate subclinical atheromatosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline risk in T2DM and whether universal CAC screening is justified. Then, I should verify guideline positions and the strength of evidence. Next, I will identify the specific subgroups where CAC meaningfully changes management. After that, I need to check how CAC results should guide therapy intensity, including statins and aspirin. Finally, I will consider limitations, alternatives like coronary CTA, and practical implementation details such as repeat intervals and cost.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk context. T2DM confers a 2–4 fold increase in cardiovascular risk, but risk is heterogeneous; many patients with diabetes are not "coronary risk equivalents", and a substantial fraction have low short-term risk, which means blanket CAC screening is not automatically indicated [^95f76e8c] [^3e73c108]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify how CAC performs in this population. Meta-analytic data show CAC ≥ 10 predicts all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events with high sensitivity but low specificity, and a CAC of 0 identifies a low-risk subgroup within diabetes, supporting selective rather than routine use [^cb1f0075] [^d0969529].

> Next, I should review guideline positions. The ADA advises against routine screening for coronary artery disease in asymptomatic patients with diabetes because it does not improve outcomes when ASCVD risk factors are optimally managed, so CAC should not be used as a default test in all T2DM patients [^4708f8e6] [^2e94cdcb]. Wait, let me verify the nuance here: while ADA does not recommend routine screening, it acknowledges that CAC can be considered in selected scenarios, which is where a targeted approach becomes valuable [^2e94cdcb].

> I will now examine the highest-credibility recommendations for selective CAC use. The National Lipid Association supports CAC to refine risk and guide statin intensity in adults 40–75 with T2DM, particularly when the decision to use high-intensity statins is uncertain or when CAC > 100 supports escalation; they also endorse CAC in adults 30–39 with long-standing diabetes or risk enhancers, and in adults > 75 when statin decisions are uncertain [^07156c4b] [^920f3d5f]. Let me double-check the strength of evidence: these are largely Class IIa/IIb recommendations with Level B/C evidence, reflecting expert consensus and observational data rather than randomized outcomes trials, which is important for shared decision-making [^07156c4b].

> Now, I should identify the specific subgroups where CAC most clearly changes management. Let me think about this carefully: CAC is most impactful when it can reclassify risk and alter therapy intensity. That includes patients with borderline or intermediate ASCVD risk by pooled cohort equations, younger patients with long-standing diabetes or microvascular disease, older adults where statin benefit is uncertain, and those with risk enhancers such as family history of premature ASCVD, chronic kidney disease, or persistent inflammatory conditions [^07156c4b] [^920f3d5f] [^840eae18]. Hold on, I should verify the "power of zero" in diabetes: yes, CAC = 0 identifies a subgroup with very low short-term event rates, allowing deferral of statins in select cases, though diabetes itself remains a risk enhancer and CAC = 0 does not absolutely negate risk [^d0969529] [^d612b1ae].

> Next, I should review how CAC results should guide therapy. If CAC is 0, it is reasonable to defer statins in some patients after clinician–patient discussion, especially if diabetes is well controlled and other enhancers are absent, with repeat CAC in about 3 years given faster progression in diabetes; if CAC is 1–99, moderate-intensity statins are generally reasonable; if CAC is 100–299, high-intensity statins are favored; if CAC is ≥ 300, treat as very high risk with high-intensity statins and consider aspirin if bleeding risk is acceptable, aligning with lipid society guidance and contemporary prevention frameworks [^07156c4b] [^920f3d5f] [^74dca980]. I need to ensure I emphasize that CAC augments, not replaces, global risk assessment and should be integrated with blood pressure, LDL-C, smoking, and diabetes-specific factors like duration and microvascular disease [^07156c4b].

> But wait, what if CAC underestimates plaque burden? I should confirm the limitation: in T2DM, noncalcified plaque is more prevalent, so a CAC of 0 does not exclude obstructive disease or high-risk plaque; in such cases, coronary CTA can detect noncalcified plaque and refine risk, though routine CTA screening is not endorsed and should be reserved for selected high-risk scenarios or when symptoms emerge [^b52a7d86] [^df2bd4f9] [^222b3c01]. Hold on, I should verify prognostic data: CCTA-derived plaque burden predicts events in diabetes, but randomized trials like FACTOR-64 did not show outcome benefit from routine CTA screening, reinforcing a selective, not universal, approach [^7ab110a7] [^8bb18a86].

> I need to check practical implementation details. CAC scoring is noncontrast, low-radiation, and typically costs $50–$500 depending on locale; repeat intervals after CAC = 0 are shorter in diabetes (about 3 years) due to faster progression, and results should be coupled with counseling to improve adherence and align therapy with patient preferences [^5db0ee77] [^0a9cd316] [^9a18d318]. Let me reconsider whether to repeat CAC in aggressively treated patients: guidelines advise against routine repeat testing in those already on high-intensity therapy, as CAC is not a treatment-efficacy marker, so serial CAC is best reserved for those in whom results would change management [^a088782d].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Do not order CAC for all T2DM patients; use it selectively to refine risk and guide intensity of prevention when baseline risk is borderline or intermediate, when age and diabetes duration create uncertainty, when risk enhancers are present, or when older adults and younger patients with long-standing diabetes face statin decisions; avoid CAC when the patient is already very high risk and on maximal therapy, or when the result is unlikely to change management [^4708f8e6] [^07156c4b] [^920f3d5f]. I should double-check that this aligns with evidence: yes, selective CAC use improves risk classification and can optimize statin intensity, aspirin use, and follow-up intensity, while CAC = 0 helps identify a low-risk subgroup within diabetes, all of which support a targeted, shared decision-making approach rather than routine screening [^5a004178] [^cb1f0075] [^d0969529].

---

In T2DM, **CAC scoring is most useful** when the decision to start or intensify statins is uncertain (e.g. borderline/intermediate risk) [^f090894c] or when risk appears discordant with clinical judgment [^5a004178]. It is also reasonable in **long-standing diabetes** (> 10 years), **younger patients with risk enhancers** (family history, chronic kidney disease, or metabolic syndrome) [^07156c4b], or when considering aspirin or advanced therapies (ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors) [^notfound]. Routine CAC is not recommended for all T2DM patients [^4708f8e6]; use it to refine risk and guide shared decision-making, not to screen asymptomatic patients without specific indications [^2e94cdcb].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **selective use** of CAC scoring in T2DM:

- **ADA 2025**: Do not routinely screen asymptomatic patients; reserve testing for atypical symptoms, ECG abnormalities, or vascular disease signs [^4708f8e6] [^2e94cdcb].
- **ACC/AHA 2019**: Consider CAC in adults 40–75 without diabetes, LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL, and intermediate risk (7.5–19.9%) when the statin decision is uncertain [^f090894c]; in T2DM, CAC can refine risk and guide therapy intensity [^07156c4b].
- **NLA 2020**: CAC is reasonable in T2DM to refine risk and guide statin intensity, especially when the decision is uncertain or risk enhancers are present [^07156c4b] [^920f3d5f].

---

## Clinical scenarios for CAC scoring in T2DM

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for cac scoring** |
|-|-|
| Borderline or intermediate ASCVD risk (7.5–19.9%) | Refine risk and guide statin intensity [^f090894c] [^5a004178] |
| Long-standing diabetes (> 10 years) or multiple risk enhancers | Identify high-risk patients needing intensive therapy [^07156c4b] [^920f3d5f] |
| Younger patients (30–39) with long-standing diabetes or risk enhancers | Inform early risk stratification and shared decision-making [^07156c4b] [^920f3d5f] |
| Uncertainty about statin initiation or intensity | Guide personalized therapy and improve adherence [^3301539e] [^43f629ca] |
| Considering aspirin or advanced lipid-lowering therapies | Identify high-risk patients who may benefit [^74dca980] [^f2ee3aa8] |

## Prognostic value of CAC scoring in T2DM

CAC scoring has **strong prognostic value** in T2DM:

- **Meta-analysis**: CAC ≥ 10 predicts all-cause mortality or CV events with high sensitivity (94%) and low specificity (34%) [^cb1f0075].
- **MESA**: CAC independently predicts CHD and ASCVD events in diabetes, improving risk classification beyond traditional risk factors [^5a004178].
- **Diabetes Heart Study**: CAC predicts CV mortality and reclassifies risk in T2DM, especially in intermediate-risk patients [^d8a58ebe] [^5179017d].

---

## Limitations and considerations

CAC scoring has important **limitations**:

- **Noncalcified plaque**: CAC may underestimate risk in younger patients or those with predominantly noncalcified plaque [^222b3c01] [^b52a7d86].
- **Radiation exposure**: Minimal but present; consider in younger patients or repeated testing [^5db0ee77].
- **Cost and access**: Not universally covered; consider availability and patient preferences [^5db0ee77].

---

## Alternative and complementary imaging modalities

CAC scoring can be complemented by **other modalities**:

- **Coronary CT angiography (CCTA)**: Detects noncalcified plaque and high-risk features; consider when CAC is zero but suspicion remains high [^b52a7d86] [^df2bd4f9].
- **Carotid ultrasound**: Assesses carotid plaque, a marker of systemic atherosclerosis; useful when CAC is unavailable or inconclusive [^c9a0ea77] [^892cd066].
- **Stress testing**: Reserved for symptomatic patients or those with high-risk features despite medical therapy [^2e94cdcb].

---

## Practical clinical approach

A **practical approach** is to use CAC scoring selectively:

- **Initial assessment**: Use traditional risk calculators (ASCVD Risk Estimator) to estimate baseline risk [^f090894c].
- **Selective CAC scoring**: Apply CAC when risk is borderline/intermediate, when risk enhancers are present, or when the patient prefers more information to guide therapy [^f090894c] [^07156c4b].
- **Interpretation and action**: Use CAC to guide statin intensity, consider aspirin if CAC ≥ 100 and bleeding risk is acceptable, and escalate prevention strategies if CAC is high [^74dca980] [^f2ee3aa8].
- **Follow-up**: Repeat CAC in 3–5 years if initial score is 0 or low, especially in high-risk patients or those with diabetes [^0a9cd316] [^3fb95f01].

---

CAC scoring is most useful in T2DM when risk is **borderline/intermediate**, when diabetes is long-standing or risk enhancers are present, or when the decision to start or intensify statins is uncertain. It is not for routine screening but for **selective risk refinement** and shared decision-making.

Subclinical atherosclerosis as a tool to refine CV stratification

While risk scores and biomarkers reflect a probabilistic estimate of the likelihood of developing CVD, imaging tests for atherosclerosis seek to measure disease directly in its subclinical stage. As such, imaging tests for subclinical atherosclerosis can integrate all of a patient's risk determinants — ranging from genetic to environmental to modifiable — into a single measure of disease and vulnerability (tissue impact) in the vascular bed of interest. Decades have studies have shown discordance between risk scores and subclinical disease burden, as some patients with no risk factors can have advanced disease, and some patients with multiple risk factors can live to old age without any detectable plaque. Across all risk scores ever tested, adding imaging tests for subclinical atherosclerosis substantial improve risk discrimination. Imaging tests for subclinical atherosclerosis tend to perform best in lower risk patients with risk modifiers or in intermediate risk patients where treatment decisions remain uncertain. The CAC score, which provides a measure of coronary plaque using non-contrast cardiac-gated CT, is the most researched tool for CV risk stratification and receives a Class IIA recommendation from many guidelines. Beyond its prognostic value, CAC scoring has several practical clinical applications. CAC = 0 is associated with very low short-to-intermediate term risk, and in such cases, it may be reasonable to defer pharmacologic interventions, focusing instead on lifestyle optimization, unless other high-risk features are present. A CAC score between 1 and 99 indicates subclinical atherosclerosis and may justify initiating or intensifying statin therapy in patients with borderline or intermediate estimated risk. Scores between 100 and 299 identify individuals at high risk, for whom guideline-directed therapies, including high-intensity statins, aggressive modifiable risk-factor control, and possibly aspirin in selected cases, should be strongly considered. CAC ≥ 300 reflects a very high-risk profile, akin to patients with established CAD, warranting comprehensive secondary-prevention-level therapy and closer clinical follow-up.

In the 2025 ESC/EAS focused update on dyslipidaemias, an increased CAC score is explicitly recognised as a risk modifier in individuals at moderate cardiovascular risk or those near treatment decision thresholds, helping to improve risk stratification (Class IIa, Level of evidence B).

However, other imaging tools are also effect. Carotid ultrasound, particularly when interpreted as a carotid plaque score, is a strong predictor of risk. Total plaque burden by coronary CTA is also an emerging tool in asymptomatic patients, particularly with new protocols that decrease ionizing radiation and AI-tools that automate volumetric quantification of non-calcified and calcified total coronary plaque burden.

### Coronary calcium score and prediction of all-cause mortality in diabetes: the diabetes heart study [^bcd2ba79]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a coronary heart disease risk equivalent. The associated high overall mortality is largely attributable to increased cardiovascular deaths. Most of the morbidity and mortality in this high-risk condition are driven by accelerated atherosclerosis, characterized by increased amounts of connective tissue, glycoproteins, and calcified plaque in the blood vessels. Imaging by computed tomography (CT) reveals that individuals afflicted with diabetes have extensive calcification of their vascular beds.

Several studies have shown that subclinical atherosclerosis, as measured by coronary artery calcium (CAC), predicts future cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and death, independent of conventional risk factors, in the general population. Whether higher CAC scores are associated with adverse clinical outcomes, in particular all-cause mortality, in diabetes has not been studied extensively. Because individuals with diabetes represent a group at high risk for cardiovascular events and death, risk stratification may be particularly useful in this population. This study examines the risk of death in participants with diabetes across higher levels of CAC scores.

### Screening for coronary artery disease in patients with diabetes [^898b3808]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) accounts for a large fraction of the morbidity, mortality, and cost of diabetes. Recognizing this, nearly 10 years ago the American Diabetes Association published a consensus recommendation that clinicians consider a risk factor-guided screening approach to early diagnosis of CAD in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Subsequent clinical trial results have not supported those recommendations. Since the prior consensus statement, newer imaging methods, such as coronary artery calcium scoring and noninvasive angiography with computed tomography (CT) techniques, have come into use. These technologies, which allow quantitation of atherosclerotic burden and can predict risk of cardiac events, might provide an approach to more widespread coronary atherosclerosis screening. However, over this same time interval, there has been recognition of diabetes as a cardiovascular disease (CVD) equivalent, clear demonstration that medical interventions should provide primary and secondary CVD risk reduction in diabetic populations, and suggestive evidence that percutaneous coronary revascularization may not provide additive survival benefit to intensive medical management in patients with stable CAD. This additional evidence raises the question of whether documenting asymptomatic atherosclerosis or ischemia in people with diabetes is warranted. More data addressing this issue will be forthcoming from the BARI 2-D (Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes) trial. Until then, for patients with type 2 diabetes who are asymptomatic for CAD, we recommend that testing for atherosclerosis or ischemia, perhaps with cardiac CT as the initial test, be reserved for those in whom medical treatment goals cannot be met and for selected individuals in whom there is strong clinical suspicion of very-high-risk CAD. Better approaches to identify such individuals based on readily obtained clinical variables are sorely needed.

### Coronary calcium score predicts cardiovascular mortality in diabetes: diabetes heart study [^3d36dc34]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a coronary heart disease risk equivalent because diabetes-affected individuals experience a poorer prognosis compared with nondiabetic subjects. The high overall mortality is largely driven by increased cardiovascular mortality. Diabetes is characterized by accelerated atherosclerosis, with increased amounts of connective tissue, glycoproteins, and calcified plaque in blood vessels. Imaging by computed tomography (CT) reveals that diabetes-affected individuals have extensive calcification of their vascular beds, reported as the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, reflecting significant cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden.

Several observational studies demonstrate that subclinical atherosclerosis, such as CAC, predicts and reclassifies future CVD events, independent of conventional risk factors in the general population. We have previously shown that a higher CAC score in diabetes predicts all-cause mortality. Whether higher CAC scores are associated with adverse clinical outcomes, in particular CVD mortality, in diabetes has not been studied extensively. One aim of this study was to examine the risk of CVD mortality in participants with diabetes across a range of CAC scores.

Pencina et al. introduced the concept of net reclassification improvement (NRI), which measures the extent to which individuals with and without events are appropriately reclassified into clinically accepted higher or lower risk categories with the addition of a new marker. A second part of this study was to evaluate the extent to which adding CAC to a model based on Framingham risk factors correctly reclassifies diabetes participant's risk of future CVD mortality.

Diabetes mellitus — In adults 40–75 years of age with diabetes mellitus and an LDL-C 70–189, a moderate or high intensity statin is indicated, regardless of CAC score (COR I, LOE A). In adults 40–75 years of age with diabetes mellitus in whom the decision has been made to initiate statin therapy, it is reasonable, for those with a CAC score > 100, to choose a high intensity statin (COR IIa, LOE C-LD). In adults 30–39 years of age with long-standing diabetes mellitus (type 1 diabetes of > 20 years duration or type 2 diabetes of > 10 years duration) and risk factors or microangiopathy, CAC scoring may be reasonable to aid in ASCVD risk stratification and statin treatment shared decision making (COR IIb, LOE C-LD).

Guidelines Recommendations for screening CAD in asymptomatic patients

The 2024 American Diabetes Association Guidelines section of Cardiovascular disease and risk management suggest that routine screening for ACAD is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals, as it does not improve outcomes when ACAD risk factors are properly managed, and consider investigating ACAD if any of the following are present: atypical cardiac symptoms; signs or symptoms of associated vascular disease, including carotid bruits, transient ischemic attack, stroke, claudication, PAD, or electrocardiogram abnormalities (e.g. Q waves) Table 2.

Table 2
Guidelines about screening ACAD in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes

Entries in bold correspond to the key information

According to these guidelines, screening for ACAD in asymptomatic individuals at high risk is not recommended, partly because these individuals should already be receiving intensive medical therapy, which provides benefits similar to those of invasive revascularization. There is also evidence suggesting that silent ischemia may resolve over time, which adds to the controversy surrounding aggressive screening strategies. In prospective studies, coronary artery calcium has been identified as an independent predictor of future ACAD events in individuals with diabetes, and it consistently outperforms both the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk engine and the Framingham Risk Score in predicting risk in this population.

The 2023 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the management of CV disease in patients with diabetes suggest that in diabetic patients with asymptomatic ASCVD (including documented ACAD confirmed by imaging) and elevated CV risk, the potential benefit of platelet inhibition with aspirin (ASA) may be greater, making it important to tailor therapy to the individual.

The 2024 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for Chronic Coronary Syndromes suggest about screening for ACAD in asymptomatic individuals when coronary artery calcification findings from prior chest CT scans are available. It may be beneficial to use these findings to improve risk stratification and guide the management of modifiable risk factors, (level of evidence IIa class C); CACS could be considered to enhance risk classification at treatment decision thresholds; Total risk estimation using a risk-estimation system such as SCORE is recommended for asymptomatic adults > 40 years of age without evidence of CVD (level of evidence I class C). CACS may be considered to improve risk classification around treatment decision thresholds (level of evidence IIb, class C).

Table 2
Characteristics of patients with diabetes with CAC 0–9 versus CAC ≥ 10: the DHS

A number of researchers, such as Qu et al. who studied 249 patients with diabetes did not report any statistically significant increase in adverse cardiovascular end points with increasing CAC scores. This divergence is probably a reflection of a smaller diabetic cohort compared with the DHS cohort and also the fact that the specific end points that were examined were cardiovascular end points and not all-cause mortality.

Diabetes is synonymous with CVD, as subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is similar to that of individuals with known coronary heart disease. This clinical observation also is reflected by the presence of extensive calcification in asymptomatic patients with diabetes, which is similar to nondiabetic subjects with known coronary heart disease on atherosclerosis imaging. However, among patients with diabetes, a subset of individuals without evidence of atherosclerosis has a lower short to intermediate risk for death, and here coronary imaging may serve as a worthwhile tool for risk stratification.

The mechanism for advanced atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes is almost certainly multifactorial. Hyperglycemia and glucosylated proteins lead to activation of genes and enzymes involved in calcification, atherogenesis and thrombosis, and medial artery calcification, which substantially increases the risk for coronary events.

There is an increasing prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes globally. Thus, timely diagnosis of atherosclerosis in this high-risk group is imperative to prevent future micro- and macrovascular complications. This risk-stratification strategy using CAC may lead to better, novel, and aggressive individualized therapy in this population, perhaps resulting in decreased mortality, which is not currently observed compared with the general population. Whether aggressive therapy needs to be directed at those with or without advanced calcification remains controversial in light of the recent Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial, where intensive lowering of risk factors in patients with diabetes led to harm rather than benefit. Our results also suggest that atherosclerosis is an independent predictor of mortality in diabetes independent of diabetes duration and diabetes control and conventional cardiovascular risk factors.

### Cardiovascular risk assessment in patients with diabetes [^95f76e8c]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Although patients with diabetes have 2 to 4 times increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than individuals without diabetes, recent studies indicate that a significant part of patients are in a lower cardiovascular risk category. Men younger than 35 years, women younger than 45 years, patients with diabetes duration of less than 10 years without other risk factors have a much lower risk than patients who have traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and subclinical or established coronary artery disease (CAD). These patients are not risk equivalent as stated in previous studies. On the contrary, when in the presence of traditional risk factors or evidence of subclinical coronary disease (e.g. high coronary calcium score), the coronary risk is much increased and patients may be classified at a higher-risk category. Recent guidelines do not anymore consider diabetes as a CAD risk equivalent and recommend cardiovascular risk stratification for primary prevention. Stratification of diabetic patients improves accuracy in prediction of subclinical CAD, silent ischemia and future cardiovascular events. Stratification also discriminates higher from lower risk patients who may need intensive statin or aspirin prevention, while avoiding overtreatment in lower risk cases. It may also allow the clinician to decide whether to intensify risk reduction actions through specific newer drugs for glucose control such as SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists, which recently have shown additional cardiovascular protector effect. This review addresses the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk using traditional and non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors. It also reviews the use of risk calculators and new reclassification tools, focusing on the detection of subclinical atherosclerosis as well as silent ischemia in the asymptomatic patients with diabetes.

### High-risk coronary artery plaque in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes: clinical risk factors and coronary artery calcium score [^3281aa30]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We found a high frequency of high-risk plaques in asymptomatic patients with T2D despite effective lipid-lowering treatment. HRP was significantly associated with male gender, increased number of pack years, and an increased HbA1c while the absence of coronary artery calcium did not exclude HRP. We believe CCTA could be used to risk stratify asymptomatic patient with T2D based upon the presence of HRP. Whether this improves patient outcome needs further investigation.

### High-risk coronary artery plaque in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes: clinical risk factors and coronary artery calcium score [^66d3c474]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is mainly caused by the rupture of a coronary artery plaque and subsequent coronary artery occlusion. Ruptured plaques are characterized as lipid-rich plaques with positive remodeling (PR) covered by a thin fibrous cap infiltrated by inflammatory cells. Beyond the assessment of coronary artery stenosis coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) enables evaluation of coronary artery plaque morphology and burden. Mounting evidence suggests, that plaque morphology assessed by CTTA, and by invasive coronary imaging, is an important prognostic factor. In particular, plaques with both low attenuation and positive remodeling have a strong association with cardiac events, and may be considered high-risk plaques (HRP). However, the characteristic of patients with high-risk plaque and the relation to atherosclerotic burden is less clear.

Large epidemiological studies have demonstrated that patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and no prior MI have the same cardiovascular risk as non-diabetics with a previous MI. Furthermore, patients with T2D have a 30% greater mortality when suffering a MI compared to patients without T2D. Despite effective risk-factor control, individuals with T2D still have twice the risk of MI as non-diabetics. This residual risk of MI implies that intrinsic properties of diabetes are involved in the atherosclerotic process. However, the mechanisms underlying the increased frequency of MI in T2D are not yet well understood. The objectives of this study were the following: (1) to examine the prevalence of HRP in asymptomatic T2D; (2) to investigate the relationship between HRP and cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes profile; (3) to investigate the relationship between HRP and the coronary artery calcium score (CACS).

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^39795999]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

CAC scoring in diabetes and/or the metabolic syndrome — because several intervention trials with moderate statin therapy in cohorts with mainly type 2 diabetes aged 40–75 years have shown benefit in reducing ASCVD events, this treatment is recommended for people with diabetes in this age group, although there have been no such trials in type 1 diabetes; ASCVD risk estimates in diabetes range from < 7.5% to > 20% by the PCE, and high-intensity statin therapy is preferred for primary prevention in higher risk individuals, defined as men 50 years of age and older, women 60 years of age and older, or those with multiple risk factors, even though there is no specific clinical trial evidence to support this recommendation in cohorts with diabetes. CAC scoring can be helpful in improving the accuracy of estimating ASCVD risk in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes; in type 2 diabetes the majority of individuals had CAC > 0, whereas the reverse was true in type 1 diabetes in younger individuals. In MESA (average age 62 years), among those with type 2 diabetes, CAC = 0 comprised 37% with a 10-year ASCVD risk of 8.2%, while CAC 1–99 had 10 year risk = 15% and CAC > 100 had 10 year risk > 20%; these data argue against the exclusive use of CAC to support withholding statin therapy, but it may be reasonable to use CAC to more precisely identify those with higher ASCVD risk (> 15% 10 year risk).

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^920f3d5f]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Recommendations — In adults 40–75 years of age with type 2 diabetes and an LDL-C 70–189, a moderate- or high-intensity statin is indicated, regardless of CAC score (COR I, LOE A). In adults 40–75 years of age with type 2 diabetes age in whom the decision has been made to initiate statin therapy, it is reasonable, for those with a CAC score > 100, to choose a high-intensity statin (COR IIa, LOE C-LD). In adults 30–39 years of age with long-standing diabetes (type 1 diabetes of ≥ 20 years duration or type 2 diabetes of ≥ 10 years duration) and risk factors or microangiopathy, CAC scoring may be reasonable to aid in ASCVD risk stratification and statin treatment shared decision making (COR IIb, LOE C-LD). In adults older than 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes, in whom the decision to employ a statin for primary prevention is uncertain, CAC scoring is reasonable to aid in statin treatment shared decision making (COR IIa, LOE C-LD).

### Coronary artery calcium test for heart disease risk assessment… [^5db0ee77]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Over time, these plaques can become hardened, or calcified. The calcium in plaques can be measured by a coronary computed tomographic scan. The scan takes 10 to 15 minutes and does not require any intravenous contrast or dye. People with coronary artery calcium have some plaque and are at increased risk of having a myocardial infarction, or heart attack, with the highest risk seen in people with a lot of CAC. Most people without any coronary calcium will not have a myocardial infarction or heart blockage in the next 5 years. Because it takes time to develop CAC, some people can still have heart artery blockages and not have any CAC. This is more common in young people and women. A CAC score of 0 does not mean you do not have any plaque, although it does make it less likely.

Some people with a CAC score of 0 may choose to defer statin treatment and repeat the scan in 5 years, especially those who do not have other heart disease risk factors such as diabetes, very high cholesterol levels, a history of smoking, or a family history of myocardial infarction. Physicians typically look at a number of factors to determine a person's individual risk of heart disease, such as cholesterol, blood pressure levels, diabetes, cigarette smoking, family history, and body weight. Many patients and physicians feel uncertain about starting medications for heart disease prevention, including people at borderline or intermediate risk of heart disease. In these cases, the CAC score can help guide treatment decisions. Because the computed tomographic scan of the heart also includes some pictures of the lung, there is a risk of incidental findings, for example, finding a nodule in the lung that needs to be followed up.

This can sometimes require more testing, which can cause stress and worry. The actual cost of the test ranges around $50 to $100 in many test centers to as high as $500 in others. It is usually not covered by insurance. If possible, shop around to find a reputable center that charges a low amount. Sources Lloyd-Jones DM, Braun LT, Ndumele CE, et al.

### High-risk coronary artery plaque in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes: clinical risk factors and coronary artery calcium score [^30ae964c]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This was a small observational study and is therefore prone to confounding and bias by design. We did not include a control group to compare asymptomatic patients with diabetes to individuals without diabetes. Furthermore, we did not report any prognostic information to back up the claim, that HRP is in fact associated with cardiovascular events, although this point has been supported by several trials in recent years. A general problem in plaque morphology studies is the lack of consensus on how to define high-risk plaque, which makes comparison of results between studies problematic. Finally, the proportion of patients with evidence of CAD and HRP was high in our study compared to other studies of asymptomatic diabetes which could indicate that this was in fact a selected high-risk population. The majority of patients were followed at the Endocrinology Outpatient Clinic rather than by their GP, which could reflect that these patients were more complex and challenging to treat. For this reason, the findings of the present study should be interpreted with caution. A major strength of this study is the thorough collection of patient characteristics collected "hands on" by the authors, which increases the reliability and uniformity of data compared to register based data.

Module 2: Screening of subclinical atherosclerosis

1. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) score is associated with cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with diabetes [I, A]

Summary of evidence

Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a marker for the presence and burden of atherosclerosis, as demonstrated in anatomical studies. The MESA and Heinz Nixdorf studies demonstrated that CAC is a predictor of coronary events and is useful for stratification of cardiovascular risk among patients in primary prevention. This is also true for patients with diabetes: the higher the CAC score, the higher the risk of cardiovascular events in subjects with diabetes.
Raggi et al. followed 10,377 asymptomatic individuals (903 with diabetes), who had been investigated with CAC at baseline, for a mean of 5 years. The mean CAC score was higher in patients with diabetes than in patients without diabetes (281 ± 567 vs. 119 ± 341, p < 0.0001). This study also showed that a higher CAC score was associated with a higher mortality rate, especially in patients with diabetes. However, the survival rate was similar to that observed in patients with and without diabetes (98.8% vs. 99.4% respectively, p = 0.5) when CAC was zero.
The PREDICT study followed 589 patients with diabetes without cardiovascular disease (mean age 63.1 years) for a median of 4 years. The greater the coronary calcium score, the greater the risk of cardiovascular outcomes. The area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) for risk determination using the UKPDS risk score was 0.63, and was increased to 0.73 when CAC was included (p = 0.03).

2. Coronary artery calcium score (CAC score) determination has the best net reclassification rate compared to other risk markers when added to clinical global risk score calculators alone. This can be especially useful to reclassify patients at INTERMEDIATE risk to higher or lower-risk categories. However, this Panel recognizes that, despite its utility, CAC score may not be easy to obtain in a large proportion of patients [IIa, B]

### Clinical indications for coronary artery calcium scoring in asymptomatic patients: expert consensus statement from the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^4cc7c327]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2017). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score 0 — long-term risk is very low across endpoints, with a summary risk ratio for long-term follow-up of 0.29 (p < 0.0001); for cardiovascular disease endpoints with absent CAC the summary risk ratio was 0.20 (p < 0.0001), and for > 10-year all-cause mortality it was 0.36 (p < 0.0001). Among aging individuals with CAC = 0, event rates were 0.407% for CVD and 2.2% for CHD after 10 years, and in MESA 38% of patients with diabetes had a CAC score of 0.

### Relationship between insulin resistance and subclinical atherosclerosis in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus [^9f8a6c25]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Atherogenesis initiates since early life stages and cardiovascular risk factors have been present for many years before the clinical atherosclerosis becomes evident. Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for atheroma formation and atherosclerosis progression.

Insulin resistance and the ensuing hyperinsulinemia/hyperglycemia are critically important in increasing CVD risk. In fact insulin resistance is a crucial link between diabetes and CVD. Systemic insulin resistance produces a proatherogenic lipid phenotype by increasing very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, which are metabolized to remnant lipoproteins promoting atherogenesis. Pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant states which are induced by insulin resistance, also play important roles in atherogenesis.

It is well established that patients with type 2 diabetes have a higher prevalence of atherosclerosis as assessed by carotid intima-media thickness. Coronary artery calcium score (CACS) is another surrogate atherosclerosis marker which predicts coronary heart disease (CHD) in both non-diabetics and diabetics, by visualizing coronary artery calcium. It is demonstrated that CACS has an added value to the established criteria of CHD identification. Patients with a CACS ≥ 10 are at higher risk of CHD than those with CACS < 10. The results of the Framingham Offspring Study revealed that subjects with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes had an increased burden of atherosclerosis as evidenced by higher CACS. On the other hand, data have indicated that alterations in endothelial function may be followed by morphological changes that could contribute to atherosclerosis progression. Endothelial dysfunction, proceeds by reduction of endothelium-derived nitric oxide. Physical stimuli such as shear stress and hypoxia could release nitric oxide from the endothelial cells. Flow mediated dilation (FMD) is a method for measurement of the severity of vasodilation in response to shear stress. FMD is usually measured by computing the percent increase of brachial artery diameter after inducing shear stress by closing a calf around the arm.

Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index, is widely used for the assessment of insulin resistance as a valid surrogate of the gold standard method hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. While not yet recommended for risk stratification, it is demonstrated that HOMA index is a reliable tool for prediction of the risk of coronary events. It is also valuable for risk stratification in patients with angographically documented CHD.

We aimed to evaluate the association between two surrogate markers of atherosclerosis (CACS and FMD) with HOMA index in non-diabetic and diabetic individuals. We enroled both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects because we thought that the effective factors affect subclinical atherosclerosis may be differnet.

### Noninvasive screening for coronary atherosclerosis and silent ischemia in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients: is it appropriate and cost-effective? [^25569337]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) accounts for 65% to 80% of deaths in diabetic patients. The merits of screening asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients for either (A) the presence of coronary atherosclerosis by imaging of coronary calcification using cardiac computed tomography or (B) silent ischemia by stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) remain controversial. Some observers have advocated for such noninvasive screening in at least the subset of the diabetic population who have significant clinical CAD risk factors, so that the highest risk patients for future cardiac events can be identified and offered more aggressive intensive medical therapy or coronary revascularization and optimum medical therapy. Computed tomography coronary calcium scanning could be the first noninvasive screening test in these clinically high-risk diabetic patients, followed by stress MPI to detect silent ischemia in those who exhibit high coronary calcium scores.

### Left main coronary artery calcium and Diabetes confer very-high-risk equivalence in coronary artery calcium > 1, 000 [^f2ee3aa8]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Although a coronary artery calcium (CAC) of ≥ 1,000 is a subclinical atherosclerosis threshold to consider combination lipid-lowering therapy, differentiating very high from high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in this patient population is not well-defined.

Objectives

Among persons with a CAC of ≥ 1,000, the authors sought to identify risk factors equating with very high-risk ASCVD mortality rates.

Methods

The authors studied 2,246 asymptomatic patients with a CAC of ≥ 1,000 from the CAC Consortium without a prior ASCVD event. Cox proportional hazards regression modelling was performed for ASCVD mortality during a median follow-up of 11.3 years. Crude ASCVD mortality rates were compared with those reported for secondary prevention trial patients classified as very high risk, defined by ≥ 2 major ASCVD events or 1 major event and ≥ 2 high-risk conditions (1.4 per 100 person-years).

Results

The mean age was 66.6 years, 14% were female, and 10% were non-White. The median CAC score was 1,592 and 6% had severe left main (LM) CAC (vessel-specific CAC ≥ 300). Diabetes (HR: 2.04 [95% CI: 1.47–2.83]) and severe LM CAC (HR: 2.32 [95% CI: 1.51–3.55]) were associated with ASCVD mortality. The ASCVD mortality per 100 person-years for all patients was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7–0.9), although higher rates were observed for diabetes (1.4 [95% CI: 0.8–1.9]), severe LM CAC (1.3 [95% CI: 0.6–2.0]), and both diabetes and severe LM CAC (7.1 [95% CI: 3.4–10.8]).

Conclusions

Among asymptomatic patients with a CAC of ≥ 1,000 without a prior index event, diabetes, and severe LM CAC define very high risk ASCVD, identifying individuals who may benefit from more intensive prevention therapies across several domains, including low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol lowering.

Fig. 2
Diagnostic framework for the detection of ACAD in asymptomatic patients with T2DM. The figure outlines a comprehensive approach to guide the decision of exploring the presence of atherosclerosis and/or ischemia in patients with diabetes without symptoms, integrating evaluation of SCORE2-Diabetes with subsequent risk refinement through the assessment of risk modifiers/enhancers, circulating biomarkers (e.g. hs-CRP, lipoprotein(a), 11-dehydro-TXB₂), subclinical atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcium score, carotid ultrasound, coronary CTA), and consideration of the overall plaque burden, with further granularity with functional imaging to assess microvascular dysfunction and ischemia. The phenotype of asymptomatic patient with diabetes encompasses silent ischemia, unrecognized CVD, and unrecognized myocardial infarction. Tools such as CAC score, CCTA, functional imaging (PET, stress CMR) and AI-driven analysis are emphasized for early detection and tailored preventive strategies, more aggressive monitoring and treatment intensity.

### High-risk coronary artery plaque in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes: clinical risk factors and coronary artery calcium score [^df2bd4f9]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Smoking is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular events. The exact role of smoking in plaque formation is less clear. In observational studies using intravascular ultrasound or optical coherence tomography, smoking was associated with increased lipid content in coronary plaque in patients with symptomatic CAD. A strong association between the number of cigarettes smoked in pack years and the presence of HRP was found. We suggest, that smoking may have an important role in the formation of high-risk plaques, and that pack years may be a superior risk marker compared to smoking as simple dichotomous risk factor.

We examined several diabetes-specific factors including HbA1c, diabetes duration, and presence of any diabetic complications in relation to HRP. The only significant association was found between HbA1c and HRP. It has been demonstrated in large registry trials, that increased levels of fasting blood glucose is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease. However, several studies intervening on blood glucose levels to improve patient-outcome have failed. In observational studies higher levels of HbA1c have been associated with an increased lipid content in coronary plaques and impaired regression of atheroma volume during statin therapy. In addition, autopsy studies have demonstrated that HbA1c is an independent predictor of necrotic core size. In our study patients with HRP were well treated with a mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 2.1 mmol/L. However, triglycerides and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, associated with the metabolic syndrome, T2D and insulin resistance, are less affected by statin treatment. These highly atherogenic lipoproteins may account for some of the residual risk in T2D with well-treated LDL-cholesterol and could explain the association of higher hbA1c in patients with HRP. The coronary artery calcium score (CACS) has been proposed as a relevant method to risk stratify asymptomatic high-risk patients due to widespread availability and low cost. While large registries like the MESA-study found higher CACS in patients with diabetes more recent propensity matched studies did not find any difference in the extent of coronary artery calcium in patients with T2D compared to patients without T2D. In addition, several studies using CCTA found non-calcified plaque in patients with zero CACS. In our study HRP was most frequently seen in patients with "mild CAD" (CACS = 11–100). More concerning, in 23% of the patients with zero CACS. HRP was present. These findings are similar to the findings by Min et. al. how found that atherosclerosis was present in one third of asymptomatic patients with diabetes a CAS of zero, and that 10% of these patients had obstructive CAD. In patients with no or minimal CACS who had HRP, the duration of lipid-lowering treatment was significantly shorter, and fewer of these patients were in fact treated with lipid-lowering medication. This finding may also reflect that the early atherosclerotic plaque formation does not involve calcification, or at most microcalcifications, that does not show on CT. The increased risk of acute events arising from non-calcified plaque compared to calcified plaque suggests that the progressive plaque calcification could be a stabilizing factor. In this respect, statins may play an important role facilitating plaque stabilization through plaque calcification. Despite these findings, the incidence of events in asymptomatic T2D with no CAD defined by CACS has been very low in several prognostic studies. However, the utility of CACS as screening tool in asymptomatic patients with diabetes has not yet been examined in a randomized trial and should therefore be used with caution.

### Coronary artery calcium score directed risk stratification of patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus [^29964cab]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

This study aimed to review the available data on the role of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring as the preferred adjunct modality to improve risk prediction and reduce the incidence of major adverse cardiac events and mortality in T2DM patients.

Methods

We reviewed the findings of 21 studies.

Results

This study revealed that the CAC scoring system could enhance cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification and positively affect the medical management of patients with T2DM.

Conclusion

A CAC scoring approach is necessary to reduce the incidence and prevalence of preventable CVD events in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Increased prevalence of significant coronary artery calcification in patients with diabetes [^12827b09]. Diabetes Care (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Coronary artery disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. Detection of coronary artery disease before the first myocardial infarction and before anginal symptoms will allow for strategies designed to reduce the cardiovascular event rate in this group of patients. Electron beam-computed tomography (EBCT) is a noninvasive technology for evaluating the extent of coronary artery atherosclerosis that relies on the detection of coronary artery calcium (CAC). We used EBCT to detect significant coronary artery atherosclerosis in diabetic patients without symptoms of heart disease.

Research Design and Methods

We used EBCT to evaluate calcium in the coronary arteries of 139 consecutive diabetic patients scanned over a 20-month period. The CAC scores in this group were compared with a randomly selected nondiabetic control group and a control group that was selected to match a number of established cardiovascular risk factors.

Results

Patients with diabetes had a significant increase in the prevalence of CAC scores ≥ 400 (25.9%) compared with the randomly selected (7.2%) and matched (14.4%) nondiabetic control groups. Scores in this range have been reported to be highly predictive for abnormal stress myocardial perfusion tomography and subsequent coronary events.

Conclusions

Our results, therefore, indicate a substantial prevalence of significant coronary artery disease in an asymptomatic diabetic patient population compared with nondiabetic control subjects. They also suggest that EBCT may be a useful approach for selecting a group of diabetic subjects who would benefit most from additional evaluation for subclinical coronary artery disease.

### Coronary artery calcium is a common finding in older adults… [^73c16dd9]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Kenny Lin, MD, MPH Posted on October 2, 2023 The 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol management guidelines advised that for patients with an intermediate 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, a coronary artery calcium score can be used to guide the decision to start or defer statin therapy: If the CAC score is zero, statin therapy should be withheld or delayed unless the patient is a cigarette smoker, has diabetes, or has a strong family history of premature ASCVD. A CAC score of 1 to 99 suggests statin therapy, particularly for patients 55 years and older. If the CAC score is 100 or greater or in the 75th percentile or greater, statin therapy is indicated for any patient unless otherwise deferred by the outcome of the physician–patient risk discussion. AFP editorial, Drs.

John Mandrola and Andrew Foy argued that "it is unclear if knowing the coronary artery calcium score would improve decision quality or adherence to statin therapy. " However, a recent Diagnostic Tests article by Dr. Hu Ying Joanna Choi concluded that "CAC score is a strong predictor of coronary heart disease, CVD, and mortality risk and provides risk discrimination and stratification beyond that provided by traditional risk factor models". Incidental detection of CAC on chest computed tomography scans performed for other reasons in people without clinical ASCVD was demonstrated in a previous study to increase statin prescriptions, cardiology clinic visits, and stress tests. Until recently, however, the prevalence of CAC in asymptomatic adults was not known. Using data from the National Institutes of Health-sponsored Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis in people 45 to 84 years of age without ASCVD symptoms at baseline, Dr.

The study authors concluded the following: lthough CAC presence is associated with increased ASCVD risk regardless of age, CAC is common as age increases. Its detection provides an opportunity to discuss ASCVD risk but should avoid provoking unnecessary patient anxiety. Further, given the high prevalence of CAC at older ages, a finding of CAC on a CT scan should not reflexively result in a specialist referral or a prescription for a statin and/or aspirin, but rather a comprehensive ASCVD risk assessment with consideration of competing risks and patient preferences.

### Coronary calcium score predicts cardiovascular mortality in diabetes: diabetes heart study [^ed21aba9]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In conclusion, there is an epidemic of obesity and diabetes and its aftermath of micro- and macrovascular complications, necessitating multiple approaches that include better risk stratification strategies and novel therapies. This study indicates that CAC imaging can identify high- and low-risk diabetic individuals. Second, CAC scoring can be used to reclassify intermediate-risk diabetic subjects into higher- and lower-risk categories. Lastly, although diabetes is a CVD risk equivalent, there is residual cardiovascular risk that is amply captured by a CAC score above and beyond the traditional Framingham risk variables. In addition, CAC identifies a subgroup of patients with diabetes who are at low risk for CVD mortality. This may have therapeutic implications leading to individualized therapies. Further, the CAC score provides an objective quantifiable measure of disease severity to both patient and physician and has the potential to modify behavior. However, implementation of aggressive medical management in patients with diabetes with advanced calcification leading to decreased mortality remains to be determined. These issues, plus cost considerations and radiation exposure, underscore the need for further evaluation of imaging technology to maximize potential benefit in terms of identifying disease and instituting intensive therapy in this high-risk patient population.

### Presence, characteristics, and volumes of coronary plaque determined by computed tomography angiography in young type 2 diabetes mellitus [^d6c5191c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Prevention and management of coronary artery disease (CAD) is of great concern in patients with diabetes mellitus. Although the impact of coronary atherosclerosis is described well for subjects older than 40 years, the prevalence and types of coronary atherosclerosis in young patients are not well known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, extent, severity, and volumes of coronary plaque in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) population younger than of 40 years. This prospective study enrolled 181 subjects (25–40 year old) undergoing coronary computed tomography angiography, with 86 T2DM and 95 nondiabetic age/gender-matched subjects. Coronary artery calcium (CAC), plaque assessment including total segment stenosis (sum of individual segmental stenosis), total plaque scores (sum of semiquantitative segmental plaque burden), segment involvement scores (number of segments with plaque) were evaluated. In addition, we quantitatively measured plaque volumes in total, fibrous, fibrous fatty, dense calcified, and low-attenuation plaque using novel plaque software. Compared with nondiabetic patients, the prevalence of CAD, calcified, and noncalcified plaques was higher in patients with T2DM (19% vs 58%; p < 0.001). In patients with a zero CAC, T2DM had a higher prevalence (46%) of noncalcified plaque (p < 0.0001). In multivariate linear regression models after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, increased total segmental stenosis, total plaque scores, and segment involvement scores were associated with T2DM. Regarding quantitative plaque assessment, all volumes in noncalcified plaque type were approximately threefold higher in patients with T2DM. In conclusion, young patients with T2DM are susceptible to premature CAD with more calcified and noncalcified plaques. Early prevention program using computed tomography angiography might be helpful in identifying young diabetic patients with subclinical atherosclerosis.

### Assessing mortality risk in type 2 diabetes patients with prolonged ASCVD risk factors: the inclusive poh-Ai predictive scoring system with CAC score integration [^ac3dd303]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In asymptomatic patients, the presence of coronary artery calcification (CAC) serves as a well-established marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. CAC imaging offers numerous advantages over procedures like coronary computed tomography angiography, such as requiring minimal patient preparation, obviating the need for iodinated intravenous contrast, and exposing patients to low effective radiation doses. Clinically, CAC plays a vital role in predicting atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and can be instrumental in guiding the prevention and treatment of ASCVD, including recommending interventions like aspirin, statins, and advocating aggressive lifestyle modifications.

The intricate interplay between Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) and ASCVD significantly heightens the vulnerability to cardiovascular events and premature mortality. Early intervention and precise risk assessment are pivotal in the proficient management of this high-risk cohort. The introduction of predictive scores for all-cause mortality among asymptomatic individuals with concurrent T2DM and ASCVD risk factors extending over five years is undeniably indispensable. Many of these individuals may remain oblivious to their heightened mortality risk. Initiating an educational process and integrating a comprehensive risk assessment tool can expedite timely interventions. This may encompass optimizing diabetes control, instituting preventive strategies for heart disease, including aspirin or statin therapy, or implementing tailored lifestyle modifications, all aimed at the overarching objective of curbing all-cause mortality.

### United States pooled cohort cardiovascular disease risk scores in Adults with diabetes mellitus [^337e304c]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Strengths and Limitations

Our study had several strengths and limitations. Our risk score used 5 major cohorts representing major ethnic groups in the U.S. to develop DM-specific risk scores for macrovascular complications, thus providing greater generalizability than use of only a few cohorts. Our primary CVD endpoint included HF, which is among the most important clinical manifestations of CVD among DM patients. However, due to the limited number of available variables across our pooled cohorts, some potential predictors, including subclinical atherosclerosis measures, such as coronary artery calcium which has been demonstrated to effectively stratify risk among persons with diabetes, or novel biomarkers were not able to be examined as candidate variables. However, our focus was to include measures typically available at office visits to optimize clinical utility. Further, we relied on use of baseline risk factor information which does not reflect further changes in risk factors, which may worsen with time, or improve from treatment. Further efforts should be made using dynamic risk profiles to improve risk prediction. We did not distinguish between those with type 1 and type 2 DM in the derivation cohort as some studies did not specifically have this information. Peripheral vascular disease was not adjudicated in JHS and was not included as part of our composite outcome. Moreover, while our risk scores were designed for prediction of CVD outcomes over 10 years, prediction over a longer period, for example, 30 years, has been of recent interest, including with the PREVENT risk scores. Finally, our scores did not and were not designed to predict microvascular complications which should be considered in future research.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^33c6168e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes — coronary artery calcium (CAC) stratifies 5-year major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) risk, with CAC = 0 associated with 2.5%, 1–99 with 2.8%, 100–300 with 13.9%, and > 300 with 18.2%. Thus, it may be reasonable in selected type 1 diabetic adults in this age group to obtain CAC scoring to refine risk assessment and to inform statin and other preventive treatment decision making.

### Rates and determinants of coronary and abdominal aortic artery calcium progression in the veterans affairs diabetes trial (VADT) [^896fcf45]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Atherosclerosis is accelerated in patients with type 2 diabetes and underlies their higher incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Noninvasive imaging of atherosclerosis, as measured by coronary (CAC) and abdominal aortic artery calcification (AAC), provides a useful tool to assess coronary and systemic atherosclerosis burden. Although both CAC and AAC scores have been shown to be strong predictors of subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, only a few studies have investigated the association of calcium progression with future events, and there is less certainty about the implications of progression of vascular calcification. In a study of asymptomatic subjects, CAC progression ≥ 15% was a strong predictor of future myocardial infarction. In addition, monitoring of CAC and AAC progression has been suggested as a possible method for assessing the treatment efficacy of medicines to reduce CVD risk. Therefore, an understanding of the determinants of progression of vascular calcium may provide insight into atherogenesis and development and treatment of CVD.

Although the relationship of risk factors with extent of vascular calcification is relatively well recognized, determinants of progression, particularly in type 2 diabetes, have been less well studied. The large Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) reported that most standard cardiovascular risk factors were modestly associated with progression of CAC in individuals without known CVD, and diabetes and the baseline calcium score were strong predictors of CAC progression. In patients with diabetes, baseline CAC, blood pressure, central adiposity, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), and suboptimal glycemic control have been reported as predictors of CAC progression. However, AAC progression has been investigated only in patients with end-stage renal disease. In addition, although there are strong correlations between cross-sectional measures of CAC and AAC and they share associations with several standard risk factors, clear differences in association of risk factors with the extent of CAC and AAC exist. Whether determinants of CAC and AAC progression differ in those with or without type 2 diabetes is not known, as previous studies have not addressed this question within the same cohort. Moreover, although mounting evidence supports the role of inflammation in atherogenesis, the relationship of subclinical inflammatory markers with the burden and progression of calcified atherosclerosis is still unclear. Finally, although the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) showed that intensive glycemic treatment was associated with lower incidence of CVD over time, the effect of intensive glycemic control on progression of calcified atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes has not been directly examined.

### Diabetes and the associated incidence of subclinical atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease: implications for management [^b15cf964]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

We sought to examine the prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity of coronary calcium (CC), a marker of atherosclerosis, in a population of symptomatic and asymptomatic diabetic persons.

Methods

We used electron beam tomography (EBT) to quantitate CC in 168 symptomatic (chest pain or anginal equivalent) persons with diabetes who underwent coronary angiography and then compared this with a cohort of 155 asymptomatic persons with diabetes.

Results

In the 168 symptomatic diabetic persons, 124 (74%) had obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) by angiography. Receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis was used to maximize sensitivity and specificity for obstructive CAD (> 50% stenosis), which established a CC score of 102 as optimal. With use of this cut point, EBT has a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 77% for detecting obstructive CAD. Of the 155 asymptomatic diabetic persons, 72% had CC and 48% had a CC score > 102. The presumed prevalence of obstructive disease (on the basis of EBT scores and prevalence of CC) among asymptomatic diabetic persons is quite high (as high as symptomatic persons without diabetes). Analyzing the 323 diabetic patients demonstrated no significant age difference in CC scores between women and men.

Conclusions

This study confirms that higher CC scores should be used in diabetic patients to improve the specificity of CC to determine obstructive disease. EBT can allow a noninvasive diagnosis of CAD before clinical presentation, allowing for more therapy for those in which CC is detected. These results suggest that asymptomatic diabetic persons have the same atherogenic burden of those patients with CAD without diabetes. The high prevalence of CC in asymptomatic persons with diabetes supports the need for aggressive management of diabetes and associated risk factors.

### Comparison of coronary computed tomographic angiographic findings in asymptomatic subjects with versus without diabetes mellitus [^f1611d6b]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

There are limited data on the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the risk of subclinical atherosclerosis. Therefore, we sought to investigate the impact of DM on the risk of subclinical atherosclerosis in asymptomatic subjects. We analyzed 2,034 propensity score-matched asymptomatic subjects who underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography (mean age 55.9 ± 8.2 years; men 1,725 [84.8%]). Coronary artery calcium score, degree and extent of coronary artery disease (CAD), and clinical outcomes were assessed. High-risk CAD was defined as at least 2-vessel coronary disease with proximal left anterior descending artery involvement, 3-vessel disease, or left main disease. Compared with subjects without DM, those matched with DM had higher coronary artery calcium score (89.9 ± 240.4 vs 62.8 ± 179.5, p = 0.004) and more significant CAD (≥ 50% diameter stenosis, 15.2% vs 10.2%, p = 0.001), largely in the form of 1-vessel disease (10.8% vs 7.3%, p = 0.007). However, there were no significant differences between matched pairs in significant CAD in the left main or proximal left anterior descending artery (5.3% vs 3.8%, p = 0.138), multivessel disease (4.4% vs 2.9%, p = 0.101), and high-risk CAD (4.3% vs 2.7%, p = 0.058). During the follow-up period (median 21.8, interquartile range 15.2 to 33.4 months), there was no significant difference in the composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, and coronary revascularization between 2 groups (hazard ratio 1.438, 95% confidence interval 0.844 to 2.449, p = 0.181). In asymptomatic subjects, those matched with DM have more subclinical atherosclerosis, mainly confined to non-high-risk CAD, than those matched without DM, and there are no differences in high-risk CAD and clinical outcomes.

### Diabetic retinopathy as an independent predictor of subclinical cardiovascular disease: baseline results of the PRECISED study [^892cd066]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

The high prevalence of type 2 diabetes precludes implementing a generalized screening for CVD in asymptomatic patients. On the other hand, the traditional risk factors associated with diabetes (ie, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity) are estimated to contribute in less than 40% of CV events. In fact, these factors are not useful for identifying the coronary asymptomatic patients in which the screening could be cost-effective. Therefore, cheap and routinely available measures that identify those patients at high risk of developing CVD are needed.

Carotid ultrasound to measure carotid intima–media thickness (CIMT) and a coronary artery calcium scan to quantify coronary calcification have been used as non-invasive techniques to identify subclinical atherosclerosis.CIMT has been widely used as a marker to identify subclinical atherosclerosis, as increased CIMT has been associated with a high prevalence of CAD and future CV events. A recent study has found that carotid plaque is predictive of underlying silent coronary atherosclerosis prevalence, severity, and extent in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients. Extensive data indicate a close relationship between the coronary artery calcium score (CACs) and clinical coronary events among individuals with and without diabetes. In addition, it has been shown that the prognostic significance of elevated CACs in predicting coronary events appears to be greater in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes, and it can further enhance the predictions provided by established risk models. Moreover, the CACs has been related to moderate to large perfusion defects assessed by scintigraphy. For all these reasons, the Imaging Council of the American College of Cardiology concluded that CAC screening is the most sensitive risk stratification tool among asymptomatic persons with diabetes. Patients are typically stratified by Agatston units (AU), yielding a CACs < 100 (low risk), 100 to 400 (moderate risk), and > 400 (high risk). Notably, the finding of a CACs of < 10 AU may facilitate risk stratification by enabling the identification of people at very low risk within the overall high-risk population of diabetic patients. In this regard, it should be noted that the absence of coronary calcium portends a remarkably favorable prognosis despite the presence of DM, with no patients experiencing adverse cardiac events during 5 years of follow-up. Nevertheless, widespread screening for silent CAD in diabetes cannot be recommended at this timeand, consequently, the identification of a more targeted population in which the CACs would be more cost-efficient seems warranted.

### Coronary calcium in patients with and without diabetes: first manifestation of acute or chronic coronary events is characterized by different calcification patterns [^3e176917]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a well established surrogate marker of the total burden of coronary atherosclerosis. Large prospective studies consistently demonstrated that higher CAC scores are associated with increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) related events and that addition of CAC score to traditional risk factors improves risk stratification. Previously, we and others have suggested that subjects with extensive CAC (ECAC) are at increased risk of stable angina but not of acute coronary syndrome, compared to the those with the lower CAC scores. Diabetes mellitus (DM) represents a strong risk factor for CAD, albeit its association with CAC is controversial. While a number of studies have found significant relationship between high CAC and DM, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) did not confirm this association. In an aim to elucidate these controversies we sought to investigate the long-term CAD outcome (stratified according to chronic or acute events) in relation to degree of CAC in patients with and without DM undergoing our annual cheek-up outpatient clinic.

### Coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography as a predictor of cardiac and noncardiac vascular events in asymptomatic type 2 diabetics: a 7-year population-based cohort study [^dcc2eb38]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

While the current study was not designed to test any specific intensive therapy, the identification of a particularly high‐risk cohort should allow a more focused clinical trial of intensive therapy in diabetics in the highest 10% to 20% of risk. A stepwise approach of screening by clinical risk and CAC score followed by CTA in those deemed to be at higher risk would allow characterization of a high‐risk group in whom an intensive preventive regimen directed at lipids, blood pressure, HbA1c, and possibly selective revascularization would be more likely to have clinical benefit, although revascularization may only rarely be indicated. 28, 29, 30 Table 10 indicates the potential for early initiation of more comprehensive prophylactic medical therapy in the highest‐risk quartile, by showing increases at late follow‐up in the proportion of subjects receiving selected therapies.

In the current study, a simple scoring system defining site and degree of stenosis (Gensini score) predicted outcome at least as well as more detailed assessments of atherosclerotic burden, leading to improvement in prediction, discrimination, and patient classification. A limited extent of nonobstructive plaque was a relatively benign finding (Tables 4 and 5) in keeping with prior findings in a primarily nondiabetic cohort. 31 There were no CHD primary outcome events in individuals who had no coronary plaque whatsoever or in those with plaque limited to a single vessel (Table 4).

The importance of CAC in diabetics was demonstrated in a study of 10 377 patients (903 diabetics) that examined mortality over 5 years in relation to CAC in asymptomatic subjects and found a stepwise increase in mortality in diabetics compared to nondiabetics across all CAC categories, while diabetics with low or zero calcium (nearly 40% versus 20.6% in the current study) had an excellent prognosis. 7 Atherosclerosis has been reported in the absence of calcium (in 6–20% of patients) mostly in symptomatic individuals with a low prevalence of diabetes mellitus. 32, 33, 34 In the Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography Evaluation For Clinical Outcomes: An International Multicenter Registry (CONFIRM) study, 12% of individuals with zero calcium had obstructive disease due to noncalcified plaque on CTA. 35 Coronary calcium is more prevalent in diabetics, 7 and in the current study there were relatively few patients with purely noncalcific plaque (33, 5.2%, of the total cohort and 22.1% of patients with CAC score zero).

### Relationship between carotid atherosclerosis and coronary artery calcification in asymptomatic diabetic patients: a prospective multicenter study [^c9a0ea77]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The value of screening sub-clinical atherosclerosis in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains controversial.

Hypothesis

An integrated model incorporating carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and carotid plaque with traditional risk factors can be used to predict prevalence and severity of coronary artery calcification in asymptomatic T2DM patients.

Methods

A cohort of 262 asymptomatic T2DM patients were prospectively studied with carotid ultrasound to evaluate CIMT and carotid plaque and also a computed tomography coronary artery calcium (CT-CAC) scan.

Results

Carotid plaque was detected in 124 (47%) patients and mean CIMT was 0.75 ± 0.14 mm. Two hundred (76%) patients had a CAC score > 0, of whom 57 (22%) had severe coronary atherosclerosis (> 400 Au). In this group, carotid plaque was present in 40 (70%) patients (p < 0.001). Univariable analysis revealed significant associations between non-zero CAC score and age (p < 0.001), hypertension (p = 0.01), gender (p = 0.003) and duration of diabetes (p = 0.004). Carotid plaque and mean CIMT were also significantly associated with non-zero CAC score (odds ratios [95% CI], 3.12 [1.66–5.85] and 2.98 [0.24–7.17], respectively). After adjusting for traditional risk factors, carotid plaque continued to be predictive of non-zero CAC score (2.59 [1.17–5.74]) and CIMT was borderline significant (p = 0.05). When analysed with binary logistical regression, the prevalence of carotid plaque significantly predicted severe CAC burden (CAC > 400 Au; 3.26 [2.05–5.19]). Upper CIMT quartiles showed a similar association (2.55 [1.33–4.87]).

Conclusion

Carotid plaque is more predictive of underlying silent coronary atherosclerosis prevalence, severity and extent in asymptomatic T2DM patients.

### Risk stratification in uncomplicated type 2 diabetes: prospective evaluation of the combined use of coronary artery calcium imaging and selective myocardial perfusion scintigraphy [^2e1e8ff9]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine the prevalence and clinical predictors of subclinical atherosclerosis and myocardial ischaemia in uncomplicated type 2 diabetes and assess their relationship to short-term outcome.

Methods and Results

Established risk factors and coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores were prospectively measured in 510 asymptomatic type 2 diabetic subjects (mean age 53 ± 8 years, 61% males) without prior cardiovascular disease. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) was performed in all subjects with CAC > 100 Agatston units (AU) (n = 127), and a random sample of the remaining patients with CAC ≤ 100 AU (n = 53). Significant CAC (> 10 AU) was found in 46.3%. Twenty events occurred (two coronary deaths, nine non-fatal myocardial infarctions, three acute coronary syndromes, three non-haemorrhagic strokes, and three late revascularisations) during a median follow-up of 2.2 years (25th-75th percentile = 1.9–2.5 years). The age, systolic blood pressure, the duration of diabetes, United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study risk score, CAC score, and extent of myocardial perfusion abnormality were significant predictors of time to cardiovascular events in a univariable Cox proportional hazard model. No cardiac events or perfusion abnormalities occurred in subjects with CAC ≤ 10 AU up until 2 years of follow-up. CAC and MPS findings were synergistic for the prediction of short-term cardiovascular events.

Conclusion

Subclinical atherosclerosis, measured by CAC imaging, is superior to the established cardiovascular risk factors for predicting silent myocardial ischaemia and short-term outcome. Further studies evaluating the impact of CAC imaging on clinical outcomes and its cost effectiveness are warranted.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^3fb95f01]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) repeat testing intervals — it is reasonable to repeat CAC scoring in adults with CAC = 0 according to baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk: low risk (< 5% 10 year risk) at 5–7 years, borderline to intermediate risk (5–19.9% 10 year risk) at 3–5 years, and high risk or diabetes at 3 years. In adults with CAC scores 1–99, it may be reasonable to repeat CAC scoring in 3–5 years if the results might change treatment decisions. In adults with CAC scores ≥ 100 and an LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL, repeat CAC scoring at 3 years may be reasonable to assess for accelerated progression (> 20–25% per year) and/or an increase to a CAC score > 300, findings that may favor more aggressive LDL-C lowering.

AHA/ACC/Multi-society guideline — coronary artery calcium (CAC) measurement and statin decisions: CAC may be obtained in adults 40–75 years without diabetes mellitus, LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL, and a 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5%–19.9% when the statin decision is uncertain (COR IIa; LOE B-NR). For therapy, CAC = 0: it is reasonable to withhold statins and reassess in 5–10 years if higher-risk conditions are absent; CAC 1–99 and < 75th percentile: it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; CAC ≥ 100 and/or ≥ 75th percentile: it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy (unless deferred by clinician–patient risk discussion) (COR IIa; LOE B-NR).

### Coronary calcium score and prediction of all-cause mortality in diabetes: the diabetes heart study [^b6e52672]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The strength of this study is the inclusion of a large high-risk population of only patients with diabetes with metabolic syndrome with meticulous standardized measures of CAC and data collection leading to generalizability in the diabetic population. However, several limitations need to be acknowledged. We excluded insulin-dependent patients with diabetes from the analysis, but previous studies show that both forms of disease have increased coronary calcification compared with nondiabetic subjects. Thus, the results of the current analysis may be applicable in insulin-dependent patients with diabetes as well. Selection of participants from a single center may limit the generalizability of results. Finally, the choice of all-cause mortality rather than cardiovascular end points may result in different outcomes. However, the majority of fatal events in patients with diabetes are cardiovascular in nature, and it is now preferred as an outcome in cardiovascular research. In addition, in patients with diabetes, the risks for CVD-only mortality and all-cause mortality are similar.

In conclusion, coronary artery calcification can serve as a tool for risk stratification in a high-risk population of patients with diabetes. In addition, patients with diabetes free of coronary calcification remain at a lower risk for cardiovascular deaths. Whether implementation of aggressive medical management in patients with diabetes with advanced calcification leads to decreased mortality remains to be determined. Furthermore, whether aggressive management of patients with diabetes with absent coronary calcification leads to further risk reduction also remains to be seen.

### Coronary artery calcium score for long-term risk classification in individuals with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome from the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^5a004178]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Although the risk of type 2 diabetes is considered to be equivalent to coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, there is considerable heterogeneity among individuals for CHD and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. It is not known whether coronary artery calcium (CAC) assessment at baseline in individuals with established metabolic syndrome (MetS) or diabetes identifies CHD and ASCVD prognostic indicators during a long follow-up period.

Objective

To compare improvement in long-term prognostication of incident CHD and ASCVD using CAC scores among those with diabetes, MetS, or neither condition.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study included participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a prospective cohort study of 6814 males and females aged 45 to 84 years without known CVD from 4 race/ethnicity groups (white [38.5%], African American [27.5%], Hispanic [22.1%], and Chinese [11.9%]) recruited from 6 US communities from July 2000 through August 2002. Follow-up for each participant extended to the first occurrence of an incident event, other death, loss to follow-up, or the last follow-up call through December 31, 2013. Data analysis was performed from June 1, 2016, to September 12, 2017. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs). Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve and net reclassification improvement were used to compare incremental contributions of CAC score when added to the Framingham risk score, ethnicity/race, and socioeconomic status.

Main Outcomes and Measures

CHD events, including myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or CHD death.

Results

Of 6814 MESA participants, 6751 had complete risk factor and follow-up data and were included in this study (mean [SD] age, 62.2 [10.2] years; 3186 [47.2%] male). A total of 881 (13.0%) had diabetes, 1738 (25.7%) had MetS, and 4132 (61.2%) had neither condition. After 11.1 mean years of follow-up, CHD events occurred in 84 participants with diabetes (135 ASCVD events), 115 with MetS (175 ASCVD events), and 157 with neither (250 ASCVD events). The CAC score was independently associated with incident CHD in multivariable analyses in those with diabetes (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.19–1.43), MetS (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.20–1.41), and neither condition (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.27–1.47). For incident CHD, net reclassification improvement with addition of CAC score was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.10–0.37) in those with diabetes, 0.22 (95% CI, 0.09–0.35) in those with MetS, and 0.25 (95% CI, 0.15–0.35) in those with neither condition. The CAC score was also a prognostic indicator of CHD and ASCVD after controlling for diabetes duration of 10 years or longer at baseline, insulin use, and glycemic control.

Conclusions and Relevance

In a large multiethnic cohort, the addition of CAC score to global risk assessment was associated with significantly improved risk classification in those with MetS and diabetes, even if diabetes duration was longer than a decade, suggesting a role for the CAC score in risk assessment in such patients.

### Assessment of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with single photon emission computed tomography and coronary computed tomography angiography [^99496235]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

We evaluated the characteristics of coronary artery disease in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA). A total of 116 patients with DM without abnormal electrocardiographic findings or evidence of peripheral arterial disease (number of risk factors ≥ 2; 62 ± 7 years, 59% men) underwent CCTA and SPECT. Of the 116 patients with DM, 88 (76%) had a normal single photon emission computed tomographic findings, and 28 (24%) had abnormal perfusion defects. Of the 116 patients, 92 (79%) had atherosclerotic plaques (2 ± 2 segments per subject), and 20 (17%) had significant stenosis seen on CCTA. Patients with DM and normal findings on SPECT had a similar prevalence of atherosclerotic plaque (78% vs 82%), significant stenosis (15% vs 25%), severe stenosis (7% vs 7%), and calcified (40% vs 43%), mixed (49% vs 57%), and noncalcified plaques (26% vs 29%) and a high (> 100) coronary artery calcium score (32% vs 29%; all p > 0.05) compared to those with abnormal findings on SPECT. During the mid-term follow-up (24 ± 4 months), 5 cardiac events occurred in patients with DM and normal findings on SPECT, only in those with occult CAD on CCTA: 1 sudden cardiac death and 4 revascularization procedures. In conclusion, a significant percentage of patients with DM and normal eletrocardiographic findings, no peripheral arterial disease, and normal findings on SPECT have evidence of occult CAD on CCTA. Furthermore, a small percentage had had a cardiac event by mid-term follow-up. SPECT showed limited capability to differentiate the coronary risks between patients with DM and no coronary plaque and from those with a certain degree of disease; 2 circumstances that represent different coronary risks.

### Screening for coronary artery disease in diabetic patients: a commentary [^aa3c61c1]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

As current medical therapy is reducing the risk of cardiac events in the average asymptomatic diabetic patient, adjustments are now necessary to redefine a sufficiently high-risk asymptomatic diabetic subgroup that will benefit from stress imaging for ischemia. In this regard, the application of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scanning by noncontrast computed tomography (CT) may represent an important vehicle by which to achieve this objective.CT coronary calcium scanning is an inexpensive test with no injections and very low radiation exposure. Since CAC is almost exclusively a marker of atherosclerosis, its assessment provides information regarding the extent of coronary plaque burden. A substantial body of evidence has definitively established that the Agatston coronary calcium score (CCS) — a widely used measure of the extent of CAC — provides risk stratification in the asymptomatic general population,-with superiority to other imaging screening tests, such as carotid intima-medial thickness scanning.

Specific to the assessment of diabetes, CAC measurement provides potent risk stratification for asymptomatic diabetics. In a large study of 10,377 patients (903 diabetics, age 57 ± 10 years) who underwent CAC scanning and were then followed for 5 years for all-cause mortality, Raggi et al found that for any category of CAC over zero, there was a stepwise increased mortality risk in individual with diabetes compared to those without, as shown in Figure 1. Notwithstanding the ability of CAC to predict incident cardiac risk, the converse also appears to hold true; namely, individuals with diabetes with a low CAC score have a very favorable prognosis. Within this study, among the 39% of diabetics with a CAC score of < 10, the 5-year all-cause death rate was extremely low, and was similar to rates for those without diabetes with similar CAC scores.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^9c231a95]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) = 0 — statin initiation guidance and expected benefit: In adults 40–75 years of age with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 70–189 mg/dL and without diabetes, active cigarette smoking or a family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), it is reasonable to defer statin initiation in those with CAC = 0, and in adults age 76–80 years in whom the statin decision is uncertain, it is reasonable to use CAC = 0 as a factor favoring avoidance of statin therapy. The absolute ASCVD risk reduction with statin therapy is proportional to the CAC score, and in an analysis projecting number needed to treat (NNT), for those with CAC = 0 the NNT with rosuvastatin 10 mg daily for 5.6 years was 206, compared to 50 for CAC ≥ 100; registry data indicate patients with CAC = 0 receive minimal to no near-term benefit, and key points state that in the absence of diabetes mellitus, active cigarette smoking or a family history of premature ASCVD, statin therapy in those with CAC = 0 is associated with limited short to intermediate-term ASCVD risk reduction benefit.

### Coronary calcium score predicts cardiovascular mortality in diabetes: diabetes heart study [^5179017d]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

These findings suggest that CAC is a more reliable indicator of CVD risk than the established cardiovascular risk factors, probably because measuring the atherosclerotic plaque burden takes into account risk factors (both known and unknown) and their possible interactions. We compared characteristics of patients with diabetes CAC 0–9 versus CAC ≥ 10 to examine other factors potentially contributing to this increased risk of mortality and found that patients with diabetes with higher CAC scores had longer diabetes duration, were older, more likely to be men (51% vs. 18%), and had higher mean systolic blood pressure (data not shown). However, even after adjustment for systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medications, diabetes duration and hemoglobin A 1c, results were qualitatively similar, highlighting the significance of CAC as an independent risk predictor.

The strength of this study is the inclusion of a large population of T2DM participants with meticulous standardized measures of CAC and data collection leading to generalizability in the diabetes population. In addition to showing high risk associated with high levels of CAC, we found a subset of T2DM participants with none or minimal CAC scores who had a low risk for CVD mortality. Another feature of this study is that the addition of CAC to traditional risk factors leads to a clinically and statistically significant overall reclassification of 28% of participants with a significant reclassification in the intermediate-risk category. However, limitations need to be acknowledged. The DHS does not include patients with type 1 diabetes, but previous studies show that both forms of the disease have increased coronary calcification compared with nondiabetic subjects. Thus, the results of the current analysis may be applicable in insulin-dependent diabetic patients as well. In addition, the selection of participants from a single center may limit the generalizability of results; however, studies from different regions have also reached similar conclusions.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score 0 and statins — In the absence of diabetes mellitus, active cigarette smoking or a family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), statin therapy in those with CAC = 0 is associated with limited expected benefit, and the absolute ASCVD risk reduction with statin therapy is proportional to the CAC score.

### Comparison of coronary artery calcium scores between patients with psoriasis and type 2 diabetes [^b15eae53]. JAMA Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Psoriasis is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with psoriasis has not been compared with other conditions associated with increased cardiovascular risk and more rigorous cardiovascular disease screening, such as type 2 diabetes.

Objective

To assess the burden of asymptomatic coronary atherosclerosis measured by coronary artery calcium score in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis compared with patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy controls.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Three single-center, cross-sectional studies were performed in patients recruited from specialty outpatient clinics with moderate to severe psoriasis without type 2 diabetes (recruited from November 1, 2013, through April 31, 2015), patients with type 2 diabetes without psoriasis or other inflammatory diseases (recruited from July 1, 2009, through June 20, 2011), and age- and sex-matched healthy controls without psoriasis, type 2 diabetes, or other inflammatory diseases (recruited from July 1, 2009, through June 20, 2011).

Exposures

Psoriasis, type 2 diabetes, and healthy control effect on coronary artery calcium score.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Coronary artery calcium measured by Agatston score.

Results

A total of 387 individuals participated in the study. Mean (SD) age was 51 (7.7), 52 (8.0), and 52 (8.0) years in the psoriasis, type 2 diabetes, and healthy control cohorts, respectively. There were 64 men (49.6%) in each group, and most patients were white (119 [92.2%], 123 [95.3%], and 128 [99.2%] in the psoriasis, type 2 diabetes, and healthy control cohorts, respectively). Patients with psoriasis had low cardiovascular risk measured by the Framingham Risk Score but had a high prevalence of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic risk factors, similar to patients with type 2 diabetes. In a fully adjusted model, psoriasis was associated with coronary artery calcium (Tobit regression ratio, 0.89; P < .001) similar to the association in type 2 diabetes (Tobit regression ratio, 0.79; P = 0.04). Likelihood ratio testing revealed incremental value for psoriasis in a fully adjusted model (χ2 = 4.48, P = 0.03) in predicting coronary artery calcium. Psoriasis was independently associated with the presence of any coronary artery calcium (odds ratio, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.12–4.94) in fully adjusted models, whereas the association of coronary artery calcium with type 2 diabetes was no longer significant after adding body mass index to the model (odds ratio, 2.18; 95% CI, 0.75–6.35).

Conclusions and Relevance

Patients with psoriasis have increased coronary artery calcium by mean total Agatston scores, similar to that of patients with type 2 diabetes, suggesting that patients with psoriasis harbor high rates of subclinical atherosclerosis beyond adjustment for body mass index. Major educational efforts for patients and physicians should be undertaken to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in patients with psoriasis.

### Coronary artery calcium score prediction of all cause mortality and cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^cb1f0075]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the association of coronary artery calcium score with all cause mortality and cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.

Data Sources

Studies were identified from Embase, PubMed, and abstracts from the 2011 and 2012 annual meetings of the American Diabetes Association, European Association for the Study of Diabetes, American College of Cardiology, and American Heart Association (2011).

Eligibility Criteria

Prospective studies that evaluated baseline coronary artery calcium score in people with type 2 diabetes and subsequent all cause mortality or cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal).

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted the data. The predictive value of the coronary artery calcium score was assessed by random effects model.

Results

Eight studies were included (n = 6521; 802 events; mean follow-up 5.18 years). The relative risk for all cause mortality or cardiovascular events, or both comparing a total coronary artery calcium score of ≥ 10 with a score of < 10 was 5.47 (95% confidence interval 2.59 to 11.53; I(2) = 82.4%, P < 0.001). The overall sensitivity of a total coronary artery calcium score of ≥ 10 for this composite outcome was 94% (95% confidence interval 89% to 96%), with a specificity of 34% (24% to 44%). The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.41 (95% confidence interval 1.20 to 1.66) and 0.18 (0.10 to 0.30), respectively. For people with a coronary artery calcium score of < 10, the post-test probability of the composite outcome was about 1.8%, representing a 6.8-fold reduction from the pretest probability. Four studies evaluated cardiovascular events as the outcome (n = 1805; 351 events). The relative risk for cardiovascular events comparing a total coronary artery calcium score of ≥ 10 with a score of < 10 was 9.22 (2.73 to 31.07; I(2) = 76.7%, P = 0.005). The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.67 (1.30 to 2.17) and 0.11 (0.04 to 0.29), respectively.

Conclusion

In people with type 2 diabetes, a coronary artery calcium score of ≥ 10 predicts all cause mortality or cardiovascular events, or both, and cardiovascular events alone, with high sensitivity but low specificity. Clinically, the finding of a coronary artery calcium score of < 10 may facilitate risk stratification by enabling the identification of people at low risk within this high risk population.

### Is ischemia the only factor predicting cardiovascular outcomes in all diabetes mellitus patients? [^69b9f20d]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease burden and DM

Compared to non-DM patients, DM is associated with a higher incidence of coronary artery calcium (CAC), an anatomic marker of increased coronary artery disease burden. Furthermore, non-invasive studies combining computerized tomography (CT) CAC scoring and a functional assessment of myocardial ischemia in the same patient, have shown that atherosclerotic burden despite normal ischemia studies predicts adverse cardiac events. Thus, there exists a strong linear relationship between increasing CAC scores and future adverse cardiac events, with a CAC score > 400 being a significant predictor, HR 3.55 (95% CI 1.78–7.09; p < 0.001). Alternatively, those patients with normal perfusion and without CAC have excellent outcomes.

The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) in which 6814 participants without a prior history of CAD underwent CT assessment to assess the incidence of CAC, showed that compared to non-DM patients, DM patients have double the incidence of CAC presence, RR 1.9 (95% CI 1.4–2.4, p < 0.01). Furthermore, DM was identified as the strongest risk factor for CAC progression, HR 26.8 (95% CI 19.5–34.2, p < 0.001). Conversely, 38% of DM patients had no CAC, and the absence of CAC was associated with a low annual rate (< 1%) of CHD events (7). Recently, Blanke et al. published 5-year follow up of the prognostic utility of coronary CT angiography in patients with DM from the CONFIRM (Coronary CT Angiography Evaluation for Clinical Outcomes: An International Multicenter) registry. In this study, 1823 DM were propensity-matched to 1823 patients without DM. In the absence of CAD, DM patients had similar outcomes to non-DM patients, HR 1.32 (95% CI 0.78–2.24; p = 0.30). However, strikingly patients with DM and non-obstructive (diameter stenosis 1–49%) and thus highly likely non-ischemic CAD, had significantly worse outcomes than non-DM patients with obstructive disease (diameter stenosis > 50%), both in terms of all-cause mortality, [HR 2.09 (95% CI 1.43–3.06, p < 0.001)] and MACE [HR 5.12 (95% CI 2.95–8.88, p < 0.001)]. These landmark findings strongly support the concept that DM is associated with therapy refractive, rapidly progressive coronary atherosclerosis and further supports the possibility that such progression may be as a result of significant differences in plaque composition between DM and non-DM patients, as described in the PROSPECT study.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^a088782d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) repeat testing intervals — In patients with an initial CAC of zero, a repeat CAC test should be considered to re-assess CAC and potential risk/treatment reclassification; based on Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis data, repeat intervals are: low-risk patient (10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD] risk < 5%) at 5 to 7 years, borderline-to-intermediate risk (10-year ASCVD risk 5% to 19.9%) at 3 to 5 years, and high-risk (10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 20%) or patient with diabetes at 3 years; CAC should generally not be repeated in already aggressively treated patients as it is not designed to measure lipid-lowering treatment efficacy.

### Cardiac computed tomography for personalized management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^95b96301]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus are increasing in the United States and worldwide. The individual-level risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events in primary prevention populations with type 2 diabetes mellitus is highly heterogeneous. Accurate risk stratification in this group is paramount to optimize the use of preventive therapies. Herein, we review the use of the coronary artery calcium score as a decision aid in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus without clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to guide the use of preventive pharmacotherapies, such as aspirin, lipid-lowering mediations, and cardiometabolic agents. The magnitude of expected risk reduction for each of these therapies must be weighed against its cost and potential adverse events. Coronary artery calcium has the potential to improve risk stratification in select individuals beyond clinical and laboratory risk factors, thus providing a more granular assessment of the expected net benefit with each therapy. In patients with diabetes mellitus and stable chest pain, coronary computed tomography angiography increases the sensitivity for coronary artery disease diagnoses compared with functional studies because of the detection of nonobstructive atherosclerosis. Most importantly, this anatomic approach may improve cardiovascular outcomes by increasing the use of evidence-based preventive therapies informed by plaque burden. We therefore provide an updated discussion of the pivotal role of coronary computed tomography angiography in the workup of stable chest pain in patients with diabetes mellitus in the context of recent landmark trials, such as PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), SCOT-HEART trial (Scottish Computed Tomography of the Heart), and ISCHEMIA trial (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches). Finally, we also outline the current role of coronary computed tomography angiography in acute chest pain presentations.

### Impact of subclinical atherosclerosis on cardiovascular disease events in individuals with metabolic syndrome and diabetes: the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^3e73c108]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Our data suggest CAC screening (with CIMT less useful) may improve CHD risk stratification in those with MetS and diabetes. While guidelines do not exist for treating subgroups of people with MetS or diabetes more aggressively than others (except in the presence of CHD), those with very high levels of CAC are at much higher risk than those without or with low levels of CAC and, thus, a more aggressive treatment approach in such individuals may be justified. This is still an open question, however, given the expense of such additional screening and limited availability of the technology at medical offices where most patient visits will occur. One can certainly debate that it is not clear whether more aggressive treatment in such subgroups will ultimately result in improved clinical outcomes; however, a large prospective trial recently demonstrated that those randomized to CAC scanning compared with no scanning have beneficial CHD RF effects without increased downstream medical procedures or costs. It is important to note that individuals with diabetes who have CAC scores < 100 or who have CIMT that is not significantly increased have levels of risk similar to most individuals without diabetes, providing further evidence that many people with diabetes are not CHD risk equivalents. Further investigation should determine whether there is a true benefit on clinical outcomes if we are to change our approach by intensifying treatment in higher risk individuals with MetS or diabetes or on improving patient adherence to treatment based on the level of subclinical atherosclerosis detected.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^2a705f33]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Repeat coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring — prognosis by serial CAC and expected conversion rates — Heinz Nixdorf Recall assessed CAC progression and ASCVD events a mean of 7.2 years after two serial CAC scans done 5.1 years apart and found that those with CAC = 0 on both examinations had a 10-year risk of hard cardiovascular events of 0.2%; baseline CAC 1–399 with follow-up < 400 had 10-year hard CVD 5.2% and total CVD 9.1%; baseline 1–399 with follow-up ≥ 400 had a 10-year risk of 19.1%; and baseline CAC ≥ 400 had a 10-year CVD risk of 13.5% and total CVD events of 30.9%. Strongly accelerated CAC progression was associated with higher overall mortality and CV events. In MESA after an initial CAC = 0, the warranty period varies by age, sex, baseline cardiovascular risk, and the desired yield of testing; in low risk patients (< 5% 10-year risk), about 20–25% will develop newly detected CAC in 5–7 years; in borderline to intermediate risk (5–19.9% 10-year risk), 20–25% develop new CAC > 0 in approximately 3–5 years; and in high risk (> 20% 10-year risk), 20–25% develop CAC in 3 years; the diabetes sub-group develops new CAC at a faster rate compared to those without diabetes, with rates similar to the general high-risk population with 10-year ASCVD risk > 20%.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^b3a2bafc]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Metabolic syndrome without diabetes — coronary artery calcium (CAC) can refine ASCVD risk among those at low or intermediate Pooled Cohort Equations risk. The 2018 Cholesterol Guideline identifies the metabolic syndrome as an ASCVD risk enhancer favoring statin initiation or intensification in those at 5–19.9% 10-year ASCVD risk, and about one third of adults have the metabolic syndrome. In MESA, 44.8% with metabolic syndrome but no diabetes had CAC = 0 with 10-year ASCVD risk < 5% whereas those with CAC > 0 had a 10-year ASCVD risk averaging at least 10% or higher. Thus, CAC may be of use in risk stratification in those with the metabolic syndrome.

### Differences in atherosclerotic plaque burden and morphology between type 1 and 2 diabetes as assessed by multislice computed tomography [^b52a7d86]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Plaque morphology and relation with CAC

In addition to increased severity of atherosclerosis, we also observed differences in relative plaque composition in patients with type 2 diabetes with a higher percentage of noncalcified plaques. This finding is in line with a previous study in which noncalcified plaques comprised 41% of atherosclerotic plaques in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes. In retrospective studies, a higher proportion of noncalcified plaques has been associated with unstable CAD. Preliminary prognostic data also suggest that the presence of substantial noncalcified plaque indeed confers a worse outcome. Accordingly, it has been suggested that these plaques represent more active stages of CAD and may be more prone to rupture. Notably, the distribution of coronary plaque phenotype has not been examined previously in type 1 diabetes. In contrast with patients with type 2 diabetes, we found a higher proportion of calcified plaques and a lower proportion of noncalcified plaques in patients with type 1 diabetes, despite similar CAC scores. As a result, plaque burden was higher for each CAC score category in type 2 compared with type 1 diabetic patients.

Assessment of CAC score has been suggested as a primary step in cardiovascular risk stratification and screening of asymptomatic diabetic patients because the presence of elevated CAC scores has been associated with a higher likelihood of myocardial ischemia. However, our current observations suggest that CAC score assessment may be more effective in identifying CAD in patients with type 1 diabetes. Indeed, the absence of coronary calcium accurately excluded the presence of obstructive coronary atherosclerosis in patients with type 1 diabetes. In contrast, this relation was distorted in patients with type 2 diabetes with a higher prevalence of obstructive CAD in patients without or only minor calcium. As both the prevalence of obstructive CAD and extent of CAD per CAC category were higher, it appears that CAC scores may underestimate CAD in patients with type 2 diabetes, in line with previous comparisons with nondiabetic patients. Accordingly, strategies using CAC scores to identify diabetic patients at higher risk should be developed with caution and should potentially be adjusted for type of diabetes.

### The prevalence of coronary artery calcium among diabetic individuals without known coronary artery disease [^b34f2369]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to examine the age and gender distribution of coronary artery calcium (CAC) by diabetes status in a large cohort of asymptomatic individuals.

Background

Among individuals with diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Electron-beam tomography (EBT) quantifies CAC, a marker for atherosclerosis.

Methods

Screening for CAC by EBT was performed in 30,904 asymptomatic individuals stratified by their self-reported diabetes status, gender, and age. The distribution of CAC across the strata and the association between diabetes and CAC were examined.

Results

Compared with nondiabetic individuals (n = 29,829), those with diabetes (n = 1,075) had higher median CAC scores across all but two age groups (women 40 to 44 years old and men and women ≥ 70 years old). Overall, the likelihood of having a CAC score in the highest age/gender quartile was 70% greater for diabetic individuals than for their nondiabetic counterparts.

Conclusions

Younger diabetic individuals appear to have calcified plaque burden comparable to that of older individuals without diabetes. These findings call for future research to determine if EBT-CAC screening has an incremental value over the current CAD risk assessment of individuals with diabetes.

### Prognostic implications of surrogate markers of atherosclerosis in low to intermediate risk patients with type 2 diabetes [^5ca9c21d]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at increased risk of developing adverse atherosclerotic events including acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and ischemic stroke. Various risk assessment algorithms, for example the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE), aim to predict the likelihood of developing cardiovascular events. Some of these scores have also been recalibrated based on the ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk profile and incidences of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Nonetheless only the Framingham Risk Score has been calibrated for use in the Chinese population. Although these algorithms are considered a useful tool for risk stratification in the general population, they do not have sufficient power and lack accuracy in patients with T2DM. Furthermore, whilst current guidelines provide clear recommendations on initiating anti-platelet therapy for primary prevention of CVD in diabetic patients with high cardiovascular risk, not those at low risk, there are no recommendations for those categorized as intermediate risk.

Surrogate markers of atherosclerosis, including brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), carotid artery atheroma burden, ankle-brachial index (ABI), arterial stiffness and computed tomography coronary artery calcium score (CACS) have been increasingly used for the prediction of cardiovascular events. Prior studies have demonstrated that such markers improve risk stratification of CVD in the general population when used in conjunction with the FRS. Recent studies also support the use of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and CACS in conjunction with traditional risk scores to improve risk stratification in diabetics asymptomatic for CVD. The prognostic values of surrogate markers of atherosclerosis in T2DM patients deemed low-intermediate risk is nevertheless currently unknown. The purpose of this prospective study was to compare the prognostic values of the FRS with a range of commonly used surrogate markers of atherosclerosis, used alone and in combination with the FRS, in Chinese T2DM patients identified as low-intermediate risk.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with coronary artery calcium score in diabetes patients with higher HbA1c [^1d6786d3]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease, with an estimated prevalence of 20–30% in the general population. In people with obesity or type 2 diabetes, the prevalence of NAFLD further increases to 70–90%. NAFLD is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, abdominal obesity, and insulin resistance. And NAFLD is also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, independent of the other metabolic syndrome risk factors. Coronary artery calcification is a well-established surrogate marker of subclinical coronary artery disease, and is known to reflect the atherosclerotic burden and risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes. Several previous studies demonstrated the association of coronary artery calcium score (CACS) with NAFLD, after adjustment for the other related factors.

Meanwhile, NAFLD is closely associated with diabetes. There have been conflicting results about the association between NAFLD and cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes. Some studies indicated that NAFLD is associated with a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease in type 2 diabetic patients. In contrast, another study showed no significant association between NAFLD and CACS in patients with diabetes. In addition, studies evaluating the association of NAFLD and carotid intima media thickness, another surrogate marker for cardiovascular disease, have also reported conflicting results about the association between carotid intima media thickness and NAFLD in diabetic patients.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between NAFLD and CACS, specifically in diabetic patients, after adjustment for other known risk factors of cardiovascular disease.

### Coronary artery calcification in type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance: the framingham offspring study [^24d27384]. Diabetes Care (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess risk for subclinical coronary atherosclerosis using electron beam- computed tomography in subjects with or without insulin resistance and with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT/impaired fasting glucose [IFG]) or type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

We categorized glucose tolerance by type 2 diabetes therapy (diagnosed diabetes) or with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (IFG, IGT, and OGTT-detected diabetes) and insulin resistance as an elevated fasting insulin level, in subjects attending the fifth examination (1991–1995) of the Framingham Offspring Study. A representative subset of subjects without clinical atherosclerosis was selected for electron beam computed tomography in 1998–1999 from age- and sex-stratified quintiles of the Framingham risk score. The presence of subclinical atherosclerosis was defined as the upper quartile of the Agatston score distribution (score > 170). We assessed risk for subclinical atherosclerosis using multivariable logistic regression.

Results

Of 325 subjects aged 31–73 years, 51% were men, 11.2% had IFG/IGT, and 9.9% had diabetes (2.8% with diagnosed diabetes); 14.5% had insulin resistance. Compared with NGT, subjects with IFG/IGT tended to be more likely (adjusted odds ratio 1.5, 95% CI 0.7–3.4) and those with diabetes were significantly more likely (2.7, 1.2–6.1) to have subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. In age- and sex-adjusted models, subjects with insulin resistance were more likely to have subclinical atherosclerosis than those without insulin resistance (2.1, 1.01–4.2), but further risk factor adjustment weakened this association. In adjusted models including insulin resistance, diabetes remained associated with risk for subclinical atherosclerosis (2.8, 1.2–6.7); diagnosed diabetes (6.0, 1.4–25.2) had a larger effect than OGTT-detected diabetes (2.1, 0.8–5.5).

Conclusions

Individuals with diabetes have an elevated burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. Aggressive clinical atherosclerosis prevention is warranted, especially in diagnosed diabetes.

### Differences in atherosclerotic plaque burden and morphology between type 1 and 2 diabetes as assessed by multislice computed tomography [^411d3623]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE It is unclear whether the coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden is similar in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. By using multislice computed tomography (MSCT), the presence, degree, and morphology of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes were compared. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Prospectively, coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring and MSCT coronary angiography were performed in 135 asymptomatic patients (65 patients with type 1 diabetes and 70 patients with type 2 diabetes). The presence and extent of coronary atherosclerosis as well as plaque phenotype were assessed and compared between groups. RESULTS No difference was observed in average CAC score (217 ± 530 vs. 174 ± 361) or in the prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis (65% vs. 71%) in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, the prevalence of obstructive atherosclerosis was higher in patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 24; 34%) compared with that in patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 11; 17%) (P = 0.02). In addition, a higher mean number of atherosclerotic and obstructive plaques was observed in patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, the percentage of noncalcified plaques was higher in patients with type 2 (66%) versus type 1 diabetes (27%) (P < 0.001), resulting in a higher plaque burden for each CAC score compared with that in type 1 diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS Although CAC scores and the prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis were similar between patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, CAD was more extensive in the latter. Also, a relatively higher proportion of noncalcified plaques was observed in patients with type 2 diabetes. These observations may be valuable in the development of targeted management strategies adapted to diabetes type.

### Hunting for a coronary artery disease diagnosis in asymptomatic patients with diabetes mellitus: if, how and when [^840eae18]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite extensive public health and clinical initiatives for primary CVD prevention, a significant proportion of individuals at 'high' and 'very high' risk remain unidentified and untreated.

In addition to the conventional CVD risk factors included in risk scores, other risk factors or types of individual information can also influence the calculated risk. The assessment of potential risk modifiers is especially important when an individual's risk is near a decision threshold. In low-risk or very-high-risk situations, additional information is less likely to influence management decisions. However, the number of individuals in this 'grey zone' is substantial. Caution should be exercised to ensure that risk modifiers are not used solely to increase risk estimates when the modifier profile is unfavorable, but also to decrease risk estimates when the profile is favorable. Risk modifiers are considered by ESC 2021 Guidelines:
Psychosocial factors, a recent prospective cohort study with a median follow-up of 8.4 years reported positive effects of depression screening on reducing major ACAD events;
Ethnicity, current risk scores may either under- or overestimate CVD risk in different ethnic minority groups; coronary artery calcium (CAC), CAC scoring is the most well-established imaging method for improving CVD risk stratification;
Frailty is a functional risk factor for both CV and non-CV morbidity and mortality. Frailty assessment is not used to determine eligibility for specific treatments, but rather to create an individualized care plan with established priorities. Family history should be routinely assessed, and a positive family history of premature ASCVD should prompt a comprehensive CVD risk evaluation. Socioeconomic determinants, the development and prognosis of ACAD are influenced by social gradients. Environmental exposure, Air pollution has a strong association with ACAD.
Body composition, the associations between BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio and CVD are maintained after adjustment for conventional risk factors. Arterial stiffness is generally measured using aortic pulse wave velocity or the arterial augmentation index. While studies suggest that arterial stiffness can predict future CVD risk and improve risk classification, difficulties in measurement and notable publication bias limit its widespread application. Ankle Brachial Index
Estimates suggest that 12–27% of middle-aged individuals have an ankle brachial index (ABI) < 0.9, with 50–89% of them not showing typical claudication symptoms. A meta-analysis of individual patient data found that the reclassification potential of ABI is limited, although it may hold more value for women at intermediate risk.
Carotid ultrasound, the routine use of intima-media thickness (IMT) for risk assessment is not recommended due to the lack of standardized methodology and its limited additional value in predicting future CV events, even in individuals at intermediate risk. Plaque is defined as focal wall thickening greater than 50% of the surrounding vessel wall or a focal region with an IMT measurement exceeding 1.5 mm that protrudes into the lumen. Carotid artery plaque assessment via ultrasonography may still help reclassify CV disease risk and could serve as a risk modifier for intermediate-risk patients.
To enable early intervention, a more precise identification of high-risk patients is essential.
Chronic Inflammatory Diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel diseases, are increasingly recognized as important contributors to CV risk. In patients with diabetes, the coexistence of chronic inflammation can further accelerate atherosclerosis and increase the risk of ACAD. Epidemiological studies have shown that systemic inflammation is associated with endothelial dysfunction, plaque instability, and higher rates of CV events, independent of traditional risk factors. Including chronic inflammatory disorders as non-traditional risk enhancers may help refine risk stratification in diabetic patients and support individualized screening strategies. Recognizing these conditions as modifiers of CV risk underscores the need for tailored approaches, potentially justifying more intensive monitoring or earlier imaging in selected high-risk subgroups.

### Performance of the 2019 ESC / EASD guideline strategy for the screening of silent coronary artery disease in patients with diabetes [^3850631f]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of diabetes has been increasing worldwide. Diabetes is associated with an increased but heterogeneous risk for developing cardiovascular (CV) disease. Early detection of CV disease is challenging as it may motivate a lot of explorations, the benefits of which have not been well established yet.

A new CV risk stratification was suggested in the guidelines on diabetes, pre-diabetes and cardiovascular disease published in 2019 by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in collaboration with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) to help practitioners deciding for investigations, setting treatment goals and choosing the most appropriate drugs for their patients with diabetes. This stratification includes well-known risk factors for CV events and emphasizes the role of some CV alterations, which may be considered as risk modifiers. According to these guidelines, very high risk in patients with diabetes includes (i) established CV disease or other target organ damage (TOD) including severe nephropathy, left ventricular hypertrophy or diabetic retinopathy; (ii) three or more major risk factors or (iii) early onset type 1 diabetes of duration > 20 years.

The atherosclerotic burden can also be estimated by calculating the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score on a computed tomography (CT) scan. A high CAC score is associated with a higher risk of CV events and mortality. Thus, this score may be considered as a risk modifier in patients with diabetes and no history of CV disease. In addition, some studies have shown an association between high CAC score and silent myocardial ischemia (SMI).

Screening for SMI in asymptomatic patients with diabetes might improve CV prognosis through intensive medical treatment and identification of coronary stenoses eligible for revascularization. However, such a screening is becoming controversial because of the decreasing prevalence of SMI over the last decades and because no strong evidence for a benefit could be demonstrated.

The ESC-EASD Task Force experts did not recommend routine coronary artery disease (CAD) screening in asymptomatic individuals but asserted that stress testing imaging or CT coronary angiography may be indicated in asymptomatic individuals with a very high CV risk, especially in those with major risk factors such as peripheral occlusive arterial disease (POAD), proteinuria and renal failure as well as in those with high CAC score. However, even if each of these situations is associated with an increased CV risk, the ability of this strategy to detect patients with silent CAD has never been evaluated.

Results

Study population

Of the 261 patients recruited for the study, 230 had a diagnostic CCTA and were included in the final analysis. Mean age was 62 ± 10 years and 73% of patients were men. The mean diabetes duration was 11 ± 8 years, and 54% of the patients had diabetic complications. Retinopathy was present in 52 patients (stage 1; n = 23, stage 2; n = 21, stage 3: n = 3, stage 4: n = 5). Albuminuria was present in 65 patients (microalbuminuria n = 61 and macroalbuminuria n = 4.) and neuropathy was present in 57 patient and 38 patients (17%) had two or more complications. In 144 (63%) of patients, diabetes care was managed by a specialist at the Endocrinology Outpatient Clinic, and the remaining patients were followed by their general practitioner (GP). We identified 161 high-risk plaques in 86 (37%) patients. Furthermore, we identified CAD without HRP in 117 (51%) patients, and 27 (12%) patients had no evidence of CAD.

### Relation of coronary calcium scoring with cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes: the CLARIFY registry [^43f629ca]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is not routinely performed in patients with diabetes based on an existing class I indication for statin therapy in these patients. However, CAC scoring may improve risk classification and prediction of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events beyond risk scores in asymptomatic individuals with prediabetes and diabetes, warranting CAC assessment in this population. The routine availability through provision of no-charge CAC as an alternative to routine probabilistic risk scores may improve utilization of preventive therapies especially in traditionally underserved populations.

Methods

Prospective observational study in a large health system offering no-charge CAC scoring for primary prevention risk prediction with available glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements between June 2015 and March 2019 were divided according to no diabetes (HbA1c < 5.7%), prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7%-6.4%), or diabetes (HbA1c ≥ 6.5% or charted history) and followed for major adverse cardiovascular events [myocardial infarction, stroke, death (MACE) or coronary revascularization]. Patient characteristics, health history, laboratory data, and statin prescription rates were measured at baseline and at one year after CAC scoring.

Results

A total of 12,194 subjects with available HbA1c underwent CAC scoring during the study period (6462 diabetes, 2062 prediabetes, and 3670 without diabetes). At a median follow-up of 1.2 years, there were 458 MACE events (71 patients without diabetes, 66 patients with prediabetes, and 321 patients with diabetes). Among patients with diabetes or prediabetes, increased CAC was associated with MACE (HR 1.38 [1.26–1.51], p < 0.001) and MACE or revascularization (HR 1.70 [1.57–1.85], p < 0.001). In patients with diabetes, CAC category was associated with greater statin initiation (89.6% for CAC ≥ 400 vs 60.1% for CAC = 0, p < 0.001) and high intensity statin initiation (42.2% for CAC ≥ 400 vs 16.8% for CAC = 0, p < 0.001) at one year post CAC scoring. Patients with diabetes had greater reductions in systolic blood pressure, LDL-C, total cholesterol, and triglycerides from baseline with a CAC ≥ 400 compared to a lower CAC category (p = 0.007).

Conclusions

CAC burden is associated with ASCVD risk in patients with diabetes. CAC scoring increases statin prescriptions and reduces ASCVD risk in patients with diabetes, potentially warranting routine CAC assessment in this population.

Zero CAC caveats and high-risk subgroups — In people with zero CAC, the presence of noncalcified plaque has been estimated at 10% (95% CI, 6%–13%), with substantially higher odds for people with > 2 risk factors. Thus, caution is advised when using CAC measurement in symptomatic individuals, particularly when discontinuing preventive therapies in high-risk patients (eg, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] ≥ 190 mg/dL). Younger patients are likely to have a higher ratio of noncalcified to calcified plaque, so CAC measurement may underestimate their true plaque burden. Long-term cardiovascular risk factor control should still be pursued even for individuals without CAC, especially young or middle-aged individuals with important risk factors. In prediabetes, CAC ≥ 100 is frequent and identifies a high ASCVD risk subgroup whose adjusted risk is similar to that in individuals with diabetes.

### Role of coronary artery calcium score in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^821044a8]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

First developed in 1990, the Agatston coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is an international guideline-endorsed decision aid for further risk assessment and personalized management in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This review discusses key international studies that have informed this 30 year journey, from an initial coronary plaque screening paradigm to its current role informing personalized shared decision making. Special attention is paid to the prognostic value of a CAC score of zero (the so called "power of zero"), which, in a context of low estimated risk thresholds for the consideration of preventive therapy with statins in current guidelines, may be used to de-risk individuals and thereby inform the safe delay or avoidance of certain preventive therapies. We also evaluate current recommendations for CAC scoring in clinical practice guidelines around the world, and past and prevailing barriers for its use in routine patient care. Finally, we discuss emerging approaches in this field, with a focus on the potential role of CAC informing not only the personalized allocation of statins and aspirin in the general population, but also of other risk-reduction therapies in special populations, such as individuals with diabetes and people with severe hypercholesterolemia.

### Assessment of coronary artery disease and calcified coronary plaque burden by computed tomography in patients with and without diabetes mellitus [^8b811862]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusion

CTCA in patients with diabetes and suspected CAD shows significantly more plaque and obstructive disease compared to patients without diabetes, which is independent of presenting symptoms and traditional risk factors. Contrary to non-diabetics, a low or negative calcium score does not rule out obstructive coronary artery disease in patients with diabetes mellitus.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^3dac286a]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

National Lipid Association scientific statement — coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk reduction — reviews evidence for use of CAC in clinical practice for adults seen for primary prevention and provides recommendations for optimal use, including in adults of various races/ethnicities and ages, such as those with a 10-year ASCVD risk < 20%, those with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome, and those with severe hypercholesterolemia; it also makes recommendations on optimal timing for repeat calcium scoring after an initial test, use of CAC scoring in those taking statins, and its role in clinician–patient discussions regarding the benefit of aspirin and anti-hypertensive drug therapy.

### Cardiovascular risk heterogeneity in adults with diabetes: selective use of coronary artery calcium in statin use decision-making [^3301539e]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association guidelines recommend statin therapy for all patients with diabetes between the ages of 40 and 75, including those without cardiovascular disease (CVD). While diabetes is a major CVD risk factor, not all patients with diabetes have an equal risk of CVD. Thus, a more risk-based approach warrants consideration when recommending statin therapy for the primary prevention of CVD. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a noninvasive imaging modality that can help risk stratify patients with diabetes for future CVD events. CAC has been extensively studied in large cohorts such as the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and found to outperform other novel risk stratification tools including carotid intima-media thickness. Moreover, a CAC score of 0 has been shown to be useful in downgrading the estimated risk of a CVD event in patients with diabetes and an intermediate Pooled Cohort Equation score. As clinicians weigh the recommendation for a lifelong therapy and the problem of statin nonadherence and patients weigh concerns about adverse effects of statins, the decision to initiate statin therapy in patients with diabetes is ideally a shared one between patients and providers, and CAC could facilitate this discussion.

### Stratifying cardiovascular risk in diabetes: the role of diabetes-related clinical characteristics and imaging [^e31dc5c7]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a major coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor and has traditionally been classified as a CHD risk equivalent. CVD risk, however, is heterogeneous among diabetic patients and thus further evaluation is warranted before initiating or titrating preventive pharmacotherapy. Prognostic clinical characteristics of diabetes such as age of onset, duration, and severity of diabetes, as well as concomitant cardiometabolic factors account for much of the variability in CHD and CVD risk. This heterogeneity can also be evaluated directly using non-invasive imaging, which allows for a more individualized risk assessment in order to minimize both under and overtreatment. In this paper, we review guideline recommendations for atherosclerotic CVD risk assessment driving the use of statins or aspirin for certain subgroups of patients with diabetes. We further discuss imaging techniques, such as stress myocardial perfusion imaging, coronary computed tomography angiography, and coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring that can guide the decision to treat high-risk patients. Among imaging tests, current guidelines consider CAC scoring the most appropriate risk stratification tool for asymptomatic individuals with diabetes that can guide initiating/intensifying or withholding the most aggressive pharmacological therapies among high-risk (CAC > 100) or low-risk (CAC = 0) individuals, respectively.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^67248905]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) for risk reclassification in metabolic syndrome (MetS) and diabetes — CAC reclassifies risk in patients with MetS and type 2 diabetes (T2D); in a Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis cohort with 1738 MetS and 881 T2D participants followed for a mean 11.1 years, the net reclassification index (NRI) for CAC was 0.22 in MetS and 0.23 in diabetes; CAC of zero corresponded to low event rates, while CAC ≥ 400 was associated with a 3.2- and 3.5-fold increased risk of ASCVD, respectively; prediction persisted after controlling for diabetes duration of 10 years or longer at baseline, insulin use, and glycemic control; CAC scoring also predicts risk in type 1 diabetes (T1D).

### Pragmatic clinic-based investigation of echocardiogram parameters in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes in routine clinical practice and its association with suggestive coronary artery disease: a pilot study [^05a509c3]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have cardiovascular diseases (CVD) as a major cause of mortality and morbidity. These includes arteriosclerotic diseases (coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease) and heart failure (HF). Despite recent improvements in the treatment of DM-related chronic complications, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) continue to die due to cardiovascular diseases. Screening for ischemic cardiovascular disease in patients with asymptomatic DM is not routinely indicated. Even though some studies have shown that may be already silent ischemia in one in five and severe ischemia in one in 15 cases of asymptomatic patients with DM. The proportion of myocardial ischemia varies from 22 to 44% among studies, and only few studies of silent myocardial ischemia (SMI) assess the incidence of the disease in this group of patients.

Screening for SMI in asymptomatic patients with T2DM is not well established, especially in those with intensive therapy addressed for comorbidities such as obesity, smoking, hypertension and dyslipidemia, despite having worse prognosis. Furthermore, an increased risk of cardiovascular death in patients with T2DM has been recently related to any degree of diabetic retinopathy (DR).

Regarding examinations, the Brazilian Diabetes Association and American Diabetes Association recommend performing only baseline electrocardiography (ECG) annually for patients with DM. Baseline electrocardiography is a simple and inexpensive test for routine investigation of CVD in DM. Although other tests such as: ergometric test, echocardiography with pharmacological stress, coronary angio-tomography, ankle-brachial index (ABI) and the coronary artery calcium score (CAC) can assess the positivity of myocardial ischemia and subclinical atherosclerosis, they can help stratify cardiovascular risk with traditional risk factors in asymptomatic patients. Whether the use of these more expensive tests alters the treatment and prognosis of asymptomatic patients remains unclear.

### Prognostic value of coronary artery calcium screening in subjects with and without diabetes [^d0969529]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

The study was done to determine the interaction of coronary artery calcium and diabetes mellitus for prediction of all-cause death.

Background

Diabetes is a strong risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) and is associated with an elevated overall mortality. Electron beam tomography (EBT) provides information on the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis and may be useful for risk stratification.

Methods

We followed 10,377 asymptomatic individuals (903 diabetic patients) referred for EBT imaging. Primary end point was all-cause mortality, and the average follow-up was 5.0 ± 3.5 years. Cox proportional hazard models, with and without adjustment for other risk factors, were developed to predict all-cause mortality.

Results

Patients with diabetes had a higher prevalence of hypertension and smoking (p < 0.001) and were older. The average coronary calcium score (CCS) for subjects with and for those without diabetes was 281 ± 567 and 119 ± 341, respectively (p < 0.0001). Overall, the death rate was 3.5% and 2.0% for subjects with and without diabetes (p < 0.0001). In a risk-factor-adjusted model, there was a significant interaction of CCS with diabetes (p < 0.00001), indicating that, for every increase in CCS, there was a greater increase in mortality for diabetic than for nondiabetic subjects. However, patients suffering from diabetes with no coronary artery calcium demonstrated a survival similar to that of individuals without diabetes and no detectable calcium (98.8% and 99.4%, respectively, p = 0.5).

Conclusions

Mortality from all causes is increased in asymptomatic patients with diabetes in proportion to the screening CCS. Nonetheless, subjects without coronary artery calcium have a low short-term risk of death even in the presence of diabetes mellitus.

### Coronary calcium score predicts cardiovascular mortality in diabetes: diabetes heart study [^d8a58ebe]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), it remains unclear whether coronary artery calcium (CAC) provides additional information about cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality beyond the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) factors.

Research Design and Methods

A total of 1,123 T2DM participants, ages 34–86 years, in the Diabetes Heart Study followed up for an average of 7.4 years were separated using baseline computed tomography scans of CAC (0–9, 10–99, 100–299, 300–999, and ≥ 1,000). Logistic regression was performed to examine the association between CAC and CVD mortality adjusting for FRS. Areas under the curve (AUC) with and without CAC were compared. Net reclassification improvement (NRI) compared FRS (model 1) versus FRS+CAC (model 2) using 7.4-year CVD mortality risk categories 0% to < 7%, 7% to < 20%, and ≥ 20%.

Results

Overall, 8% of participants died of cardiovascular causes during follow-up. In multivariate analysis, the odds ratios (95% CI) for CVD mortality using CAC 0–9 as the reference group were, CAC 10–99: 2.93 (0.74–19.55); CAC 100–299: 3.17 (0.70–22.22); CAC 300–999: 4.41(1.15–29.00); and CAC ≥ 1,000: 11.23 (3.24–71.00). AUC (95% CI) without CAC was 0.70 (0.67–0.73), AUC with CAC was 0.75 (0.72–0.78), and NRI was 0.13 (0.07–0.19).

Conclusions

In T2DM, CAC predicts CVD mortality and meaningfully reclassifies participants, suggesting clinical utility as a risk stratification tool in a population already at increased CVD risk.

### Screening of asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for silent coronary artery disease: combined use of stress myocardial perfusion imaging and coronary calcium scoring [^346d9563]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease constitute an ominous clinical combination. Rates of morbidity and mortality as a result of cardiovascular complications are high in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Screening for silent coronary artery disease, to detect the disease in an early stage and to be able to initiate early appropriate treatment, has recently become an important focus of clinical investigation. Recent prospective studies have shown that the overall prevalence of silent coronary artery disease in truly asymptomatic individuals with diabetes is about 20% to 25%. It is of practical and clinical importance to explore ways to "enrich" the target screening population. In this editorial point of view the relative roles of stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging and coronary calcium scoring are examined. The two methodologies appear to have complementary values for the screening of asymptomatic individuals with diabetes mellitus. A screening algorithm involving sequential use of coronary calcium scoring and subsequent stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging is proposed.

### Lifetime cardiovascular disease risk by coronary artery calcium score in individuals with and without diabetes: an analysis from the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^fe4a366a]. Diabetes Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess lifetime cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk by coronary artery calcium (CAC) score in individuals with diabetes from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and compare risk with that in individuals without diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

We developed a microsimulation model with well, diabetes, post-CVD, and death health states using multivariable time-dependent Cox regression with age as time scale. We initially used 10-year follow-up data of 6,769 MESA participants, including coronary heart disease (CHD) (n = 272), heart failure (n = 201), stroke (n = 186), and competing death (n = 619) and assessed predictive validity at 15 years. We externally validated the model in matched National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants. Subsequently, we predicted CVD risk until age 100 years by diabetes, 10-year pooled cohort equations risk, and CAC score category (0, 1–100, or 100+).

Results

The model showed good calibration and discriminative performance at 15 years, with discrimination indices 0.71–0.78 across outcomes. In the NHANES cohort, predicted 15-year mortality risk corresponded well with Kaplan-Meier risk, especially for those with diabetes: 29.6% (95% CI 24.9–34.8) vs. 32.4% (95% CI 27.2–37.2), respectively. Diabetes increased lifetime CVD risk, similar to shifting one CAC category upward (from 0 to 1–100 or from 1–100 to 100+). Patients with diabetes and CAC score of 0 had a lifetime CVD risk that overlapped with that of individuals without diabetes who were at low 10-year pooled cohort equations risk (< 7.5%).

Conclusions

Patients with diabetes carry a spectrum of CVD risk. CAC scoring may improve decisions for preventive interventions for patients with diabetes by better delineating lifetime CVD risk.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^d612b1ae]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) testing — statin withholding, reassessment, and exceptions: Caveats state that if patient is at intermediate risk and if a risk decision is uncertain and a coronary artery calcium score is obtained, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions, such as cigarette smoking, family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), or diabetes mellitus, are present and to reassess coronary artery calcium score in 5 to 10 years; moreover, if CAC scoring is recommended, it should be performed in facilities that have current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation dose. Clinicians should not downclassify risk in patients who have coronary artery calcium scores of zero but who are persistent cigarette smokers, have diabetes, have a family history of ASCVD, or, possibly, have chronic inflammatory conditions, and in the presence of these conditions, a coronary artery calcium of zero does not rule out risk from noncalcified plaque or increased risk of thrombosis.

### Metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and incidence and progression of coronary calcium: the multiethnic study of atherosclerosis study [^25137039]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to examine and compare the incidence and progression of coronary artery calcium (CAC) among persons with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and diabetes mellitus (DM) versus those with neither condition.

Background

MetS and DM are associated with subclinical atherosclerosis as evidenced by CAC.

Methods

The MESA (Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) included 6,814 African American, Asian, Caucasian, and Hispanic adults 45 to 84 years of age, who were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. Of these, 5,662 subjects (51% women, mean age 61.0 ± 10.3 years) received baseline and follow-up (mean 2.4 years) cardiac computed tomography scans. We compared the incidence of CAC in 2,927 subjects without CAC at baseline and progression of CAC in 2,735 subjects with CAC at baseline in those with MetS without DM (25.2%), DM without MetS (3.5%), or both DM and MetS (9.0%) to incidence and progression in subjects with neither MetS nor DM (58%). Progression of CAC was also examined in relation to coronary heart disease events over an additional 4.9 years.

Results

Relative to those with neither MetS nor DM, adjusted relative risks (95% confidence intervals [CI]) for incident CAC were 1.7 (95% CI: 1.4 to 2.0), 1.9 (95% CI: 1.4 to 2.4), and 1.8 (95% CI: 1.4 to 2.2) (all p < 0.01), and absolute differences in mean progression (volume score) were 7.8 (95% CI: 4.0 to 11.6; p < 0.01), 11.6 (95% CI: 2.7 to 20.5; p < 0.05), and 22.6 (95% CI: 17.2 to 27.9; p < 0.01) for those with MetS without DM, DM without MetS, and both DM and MetS, respectively. Similar findings were seen in analysis using Agatston calcium score. In addition, progression predicted coronary heart disease events in those with MetS without DM (adjusted hazard ratio: 4.1, 95% CI: 2.0 to 8.5, p < 0.01) and DM (adjusted hazard ratio: 4.9 [95% CI: 1.3 to 18.4], p < 0.05) among those in the highest tertile of CAC increase versus no increase.

Conclusions

Individuals with MetS and DM have a greater incidence and absolute progression of CAC compared with individuals without these conditions, with progression also predicting coronary heart disease events in those with MetS and DM.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^49bb6ea3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) in adults with endocrine disorders — shared decision-making, follow-up intervals, and statin initiation thresholds: in adults at borderline or intermediate risk (10-year ASCVD risk 5–19.9%) where the decision about statin treatment and/or other preventive interventions is uncertain, we suggest measuring CAC to inform shared decision-making; at present, we suggest measuring CAC as the preferred tool for assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis; CAC = 0 marks very low risk of ASCVD, and repeating a CAC scan is reasonable after 5 to 7 years in low-risk patients, 3 to 5 years in borderline-to-intermediate risk patients, and in 3 years for high-risk patients or those with diabetes; in patients without diabetes or ASCVD and with LDL-C > 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) and 10-year ASCVD risk > 7.5%, or 10-year ASCVD risk 5% to 7.4% plus 1 or more risk-enhancing factors, or CAC score over the 75th percentile for age, sex, and race, or CAC score > 100, the initiation of a statin, as adjunct to diet and exercise, is advised after a discussion of the risks/ benefits with the patient.

### Ethnicity should be included as a risk factor for coronary artery calcium score [^d2b667f7]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

We read with great interest the article by Shi et al. as this paper investigated the association between LDL-C status and coronary artery calcium score (CACs) in statin-treated diabetic patients. This study absolutely contributes to the current literature on diabetic population and cardiovascular risk assessment. Although the study methodology and result reporting are well conducted, we have concerns regarding the risk factors included within participants' demographics.

Taking in consideration CACs as one of the important variables investigated in this study, it is questionable why the authors did not take the ethnicity of participants into account. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) found significant difference between CAC score and ethnicity. MESA investigated four ethnicities (white, black, Hispanic and Chinese), and concluded that coronary calcification with an Agatston score > 0 was greatest among the white race and least in the black race. Furthermore, ethnicities have shown influence on other cardiovascular risk factors in diabetic patients. It was reported that diabetic patients with hypertriglyceridemia were more likely to be white and report Hispanic/Latino ethnicities than other patients with normal triglyceride levels. In addition, epicardial adipose tissue volume was found to be higher in diabetic patients of Caucasian ethnicity and it was independently associated with subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.

Gender differences in various ethnicities were also reported to affect lipoproteins impact on coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. It was found that lipoproteins, especially HDL, seem to reduce CAD risk in African American women and not in other women. Finally, a study by Nasir et al. concluded that ethnicities significantly influence the baseline CAC score and the prognostic value of CAC score on survival.

Neglecting ethnicities of participants affects multivariate analysis models used in this study. Since they are not adjusted for ethnicity, this could alter the findings of the study. Therefore, the use of ethnicity as a risk factor would have improved the analysis models, strengthen the study findings and made them more valid.

### Assessment of coronary artery disease and calcified coronary plaque burden by computed tomography in patients with and without diabetes mellitus [^5593bcdf]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

CT coronary angiography and calcium score in diabetic patients with suspected coronary artery disease

The assessment of suspected coronary heart disease is more challenging in diabetic patients because of the atypical nature or absence of chest pain symptoms, more frequent inability to perform an exercise tests and less reliable stress imaging in the presence of obesity or multivessel disease. Moreover, among the patients referred after a non-conclusive stress test, diabetic patients were overrepresented. CT coronary angiography is considered complementary to stress testing, and for the mentioned reasons may be particularly useful in diabetic patients. While it lacks the diagnostic and prognostic value of the aerobic performance, it adds value in terms of (non-obstructive) plaque imaging. However, the higher calcium may complicate severity assessment of individual lesions.

Since calcium deposition is related to the presence of atherosclerosis, coronary calcifications serve as a direct marker for CAD, and more severe plaques tend to have a greater amount of calcium. In our population-based study, about half of the patients in both groups with CCS > 100 had obstructive CAD. Furthermore, extensive CCS (> 400) was more prevalent in diabetic patients than non-diabetic control subjects (34% vs 11%). These findings are of interest, as a calcium score higher than 400 is associated with a high risk of myocardial perfusion impairment and a high risk of any cardiovascular event in the short term. Nevertheless, as recently pointed out, it remains important to recognise that for any extent of plaque burden, cardiovascular risk is higher in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic individuals.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^2d5db67d]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Diabetes at age extremes — coronary artery calcium (CAC) patterns support selective CAC use to guide statin decisions in younger and older adults. In younger adults, CARDIA reported in those aged 32–43 years that CAC > 0 was associated with increased ASCVD events over 12.5 years of follow-up and for CAC ≥ 20 the ASCVD event rate was > 8.0%; a small type 2 diabetes cohort aged 32–39 years had 24% with CAC 1–100 and 8% with CAC > 100, and CAC prevalence at 30–39 years was approximately 20% in women and 35% in men. Among older adults 75 to 84 years, about 85% had CAC > 0 and those with CAC = 0 had an event rate of 1.8%/10 years as compared to ≥ 21.3% with CAC > 100. As coronary calcification is uncommon in individuals < 30 years of age and as the presence of CAC identifies those with diabetes at higher ASCVD risk, CAC scoring may be useful to inform decision-making about initiation of statin treatment in individuals 30–39 years of age with diabetes, especially in whom the decision to initiate a statin is uncertain, and it is reasonable to employ CAC scoring to decide whether to newly initiate statin therapy in those > 75 years of age.

### Performance of the 2019 ESC / EASD guideline strategy for the screening of silent coronary artery disease in patients with diabetes [^d48a335a]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Among asymptomatic patients with diabetes and a very high CV risk profile, as defined by the 2019 ESC/EASD guidelines, our results suggest that SMI screening restricted to those with severe TOD or high CAC score — as suggested in guidelines — provides good sensitivity and leads to the identification of most patients with coronary stenoses. When using a CAC score threshold ≥ 100 AU, all the patients eligible to revascularization were identified. This strategy seems to be a good cost-effective compromise. In clinical practice, in patients with type 2 diabetes and very high CV risk, SMI assessment could be a two-step strategy: first, identify the patients with severe TOD and measure CAC score in those without severe TOD, and second, perform a stress imaging test in the presence of severe TOD or high CAC score.

### Relation of familial patterns of coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes to subclinical atherosclerosis: the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^4d815fd5]. Genetics in Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the possibility that family history beyond early-onset coronary heart disease might contribute to coronary heart disease susceptibility, we studied associations between additional family history and the coronary artery calcium score.

Methods

Associations between coronary artery calcium score and self-reports of coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes in first-degree relatives of 5264 nondiabetic subjects were assessed using logistic and linear regression adjusting for risk factors; adjusted mean coronary artery calcium score estimates were determined by pooling results.

Results

Family history of coronary heart disease alone and in combination with diabetes and/or stroke was significantly associated with a positive coronary artery calcium score compared with no family history with odds ratios ranging from 1.7 (95% CI: 1.3–2.3) to 1.9 (95% CI: 1.6–2.3) and adjusted mean coronary artery calcium score estimates ranging from 137 (95% CI: 101–173) to 184 (95% CI: 143–226). Associations between family history of coronary heart disease and coronary artery calcium score were significant regardless of age at onset, sex, lineage, or number of relatives with coronary heart disease. The association between family history of diabetes only and coronary artery calcium score was also significant (OR, 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1–1.7) with an adjusted mean coronary artery calcium score estimate of 122 (95% CI: 93–151). Generally, family history of stroke had nonsignificant associations with coronary artery calcium score.

Conclusions

Numerous family history variables in addition to early-onset coronary heart disease are associated with subclinical atherosclerosis. Our results have implications for improving coronary heart disease risk assessment.

### Prognostic relevance of subclinical coronary and carotid atherosclerosis in a diabetic and nondiabetic asymptomatic population [^3d8c668a]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

We sought to evaluate the incremental prognostic benefit of carotid artery disease and subclinical coronary artery disease (CAD) features in addition to clinical evaluation in an asymptomatic population.

Methods

Over a 6-year period, 10-year Framingham risk score together with carotid ultrasound and coronary computed tomography angiography were evaluated for prediction of major adverse cardiac events (MACE).

Results

We enrolled 517 consecutive asymptomatic patients (63% male, mean age 64 ± 10years; 17.6% with diabetes). Median (interquartile range) coronary artery calcium score (CACS) was 34 (0–100). Over a median follow-up of 4.4 (3.4–5.1) years, there were 53 MACE (10%). Patients experiencing MACE had higher CACS, incidence of carotid disease, presence of CAD ≥ 50%, and remodeled plaque as compared with patients without MACE. At multivariable analyses, presence of CAD ≥ 50% (HR: 5.14, 95% CI: 2.1–12.4) and percentage of segments with remodeled plaque (HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.03–1.06) independently predicted MACE (P < 0.001). Models adding CAD ≥ 50% or percentage of segments with remodeled plaque resulted in higher discrimination and reclassification ability compared with a model based on 10-year FRS, carotid disease, and CACS. Specifically, the C-statistic improved to 0.75 with addition of CAD and 0.84 when adding percentage of segments with remodeled plaque, whereas net reclassification improvement indices were 0.86 and 0.92, respectively.

Conclusions

In an asymptomatic population, CAD and plaque positive remodeling increase MACE prediction compared with a model based on 10-year FRS, carotid disease, and CACS estimation. In the diabetes subgroup, percentage of segments with remodeled plaque was the only predictor of MACE.

Introduction

Although type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor for cardiac and noncardiac vascular events, 1, 2 identification of asymptomatic diabetics at risk for cardiovascular events has proven difficult. Exercise stress testing and myocardial perfusion imaging are not currently recommended for routine screening of diabetics since their use has not led to improved patient outcomes, 3 and recent guidelines emphasize the need for further evidence to support screening in high‐risk patients with DM. 4

The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score improves primary risk prediction above that of standard clinical risk predictors both in non‐DM and DM populations 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and may be useful to select patients who may benefit from more intensive treatment of risk factors. 5, 10 Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) can define both calcified and noncalcified coronary plaque, providing a detailed analysis of distribution, extent, and characterization of plaque and has independent value for event prediction. 11 However, information from detailed CTA analysis in asymptomatic DM without known coronary heart disease (CHD) is limited, particularly over an intermediate or long‐term follow‐up period. 12, 13, 14, 15

The Lady Davis Carmel Medical Center Diabetic Cohort Study is a prospective, single‐center study of asymptomatic type 2 diabetics with no history of CHD who underwent CAC scoring and CTA and subsequent long‐term clinical follow‐up. We examined the additive value of coronary CTA over CAC and a clinical risk score (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study [UKPDS]) in the prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes and developed a model to define a high‐risk subgroup. In addition, since atherosclerosis is a systemic condition with manifestations in diverse vascular beds, particularly so in DM, we examined the relation of coronary arterial findings to noncoronary macro‐ and microvascular‐related events.

### Hunting for a coronary artery disease diagnosis in asymptomatic patients with diabetes mellitus: if, how and when [^918e52a9]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Among the above-mentioned items, if no or only one item is ticked, the patient is considered at moderate risk.

If two or more items are ticked, a CAC score may be recommended to further assess the risk.

CAC 0–10 AU: Moderate risk; 11–100 AU: Moderate risk if age is ≥ 50 years; high risk if age is < 50 years; 101–400 AU: high risk if age is ≥ 60 years; very high risk if age is < 60 years

> 400 AU: Very high risk

For patients identified as very high risk, screening for CAD should be carried out according to local protocols, such as ESC Guidelines. If the patients are at very high risk with ischemia or suspected significant CAD they may have a cardiological advice or coronary angiography. In particular:

Patients at very high risk

Regular screening: It is recommended to regularly perform diagnostic tests for coronary artery disease, such as coronary angiography, to identify potential issues early.
Intensive therapeutic interventions: These include lifestyle changes, strict control of blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and lipids, along with the use of antiplatelet therapies and, if indicated, revascularization interventions.

Patients at moderate risk

Individual assessment: It is important to carefully assess the individual risk, considering factors such as age, duration of diabetes, the presence of microangiopathies, and other cardiovascular risk factors.
Personalized screening: Screening should be conducted based on individual risk assessment, adopting targeted preventive strategies that include lifestyle changes and optimal control of risk factors.
Cosson et al. investigated the extent and direction in which CAC score may reclassify coronary risk in asymptomatic diabetic patients with high a priori coronary risk, and whether screening for asymptomatic MI or coronary stenosis in patients at very high coronary risk — either a priori or based on reclassification with CAC score — offers good sensitivity for detecting these conditions. They retrospectively selected 377 asymptomatic diabetic patients at high or very high a priori coronary risk. All patients had their CAC score measured and underwent stress myocardial scintigraphy to detect MI. Those found to have ischemia then underwent coronary angiography to identify coronary stenoses. Based on French guidelines, 66% of asymptomatic diabetic persons at high a priori coronary risk were reclassified into the moderate risk category, with consequent less tight prevention goals applied. At variance, 18% percent were reclassified into the very high-risk category.

Discussion

Primary CHD Outcome

This study showed that in a community‐based cohort of type 2 diabetics with no history of CAD followed for 5.4 to 7.5 years, the extent and location of coronary plaque, as assessed by coronary CTA, had important predictive value for CHD events over and above the UKPDS score and the CAC score. While the CAC score was an important outcome predictor independently of the UKPDS score, the extent of plaque on CTA, a more comprehensive measure of total coronary plaque, was a stronger predictor.

The risk of a CAD event in asymptomatic individuals with DM has been considered equivalent to that of nondiabetics after an acute myocardial infarction. 26 The findings of the current study clearly confirm that there is a marked heterogeneity of risk among diabetic patients 14 such that a significant proportion with no or very little coronary plaque are at very low risk and others with more extensive plaque at considerably higher risk for an acute coronary event. In diabetics at low risk, the intensity of preventive medical therapy and frequency of follow‐up may be reduced, particularly when there is intolerance to higher doses of statins or other preventive therapies. The study findings further refine risk assessment among those with coronary plaque by examining in detail the extent of plaque and extent of plaque calcification.

A recent randomized study of screening for CAD with CTA in asymptomatic diabetics (FACTOR 64) did not succeed in showing improvement in outcome when CTA findings, together with recommendations for subsequent medical therapy and revascularization, were provided to the treating physicians. 27 In that study the control group, without CTA scanning, also received particularly good preventive medical treatment so that differences in therapy between the screened and nonscreened groups were quite small. This is often the case in volunteers for participation in clinical trials, whereas the general population of diabetics may seek and receive less thorough medical care. When randomizing individuals to CTA screened or nonscreened cohorts the screened cohort, as the current study demonstrates, will include diabetics at all levels of risk including many at low risk who have little to gain by more intensive therapy, thus compounding the difficulty to demonstrate utility of generalized screening by CTA in diabetics. Indeed, in the FACTOR 64 study the event rate was only one quarter of that expected at the time of the study size calculation, leading to considerably lower power to detect differences in outcome between the screened and nonscreened cohorts. Thus the FACTOR 64 cohorts, despite an average duration of diabetes mellitus of more than 12 years, randomized individuals at much lower risk for CAD events than originally planned.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring with 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk — statin therapy guidance indicates the following: For patient's 10-year ASCVD risk estimate " < 5%", "Statin not recommended"; for "5–7.4%", "Consider statin"; and for "7.5–19.9%" and " ≥ 20%", "Recommend statin". With CAC incorporated, "If CAC score = 0", therapy is "Statin not recommended" at < 5%, "Statin generally not recommended" at 5–7.4% and 7.5–19.9%, and "Recommend statin" at ≥ 20%; "If CAC score > 0", "Statin may be considered" at < 5% and "Recommend statin" for 5–7.4%, 7.5–19.9%, and ≥ 20%. CAC's effect on planning is "X CAC less effective for this population" for < 5% and "X CAC not effective for this population" for ≥ 20%, while for 5–7.4% and 7.5–19.9% "✓ CAC can reclassify risk up or down". The note specifies "CAC = 0 should not be used as sole justification for use of lifestyle alone, to the exclusion of pharmacotherapy in familial hypercholesterolemia, advanced diabetes, and/or active smoking".

### Prognostic value of coronary computed tomographic angiography in diabetic patients without known coronary artery disease [^7ab110a7]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

Diabetic patients have a high prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD), but timely diagnosis of CAD remains challenging. We assessed the ability of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) to detect CAD in diabetic patients and to predict subsequent cardiac events.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

We analyzed 140 diabetic patients without known CAD undergoing CCTA; 1,782 patients without diabetes were used as a control group. Besides calcium scoring and the degree of the most severe stenosis, the atherosclerotic burden score counting the number of segments having either a nonstenotic plaque or a stenosis was recorded. The primary end point was a composite of hard cardiac events defined as all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization.

RESULTS

During a mean follow-up of 33 months, there were seven events in the diabetic group and 24 events in the control group. The best predictor in diabetic patients was the atherosclerotic burden score: the annual event rate ranged from 0.5% for patients with < 5 lesions to 9.6% for patients with > 9 lesions, resulting in a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.3 (95% CI 1.1–1.7) for each additional lesion (P = 0.005). For comparison, in nondiabetic patients the annual event rate ranged from 0.3 to 2.2%, respectively, resulting in an HR of 1.2 (95% CI 1.1–1.3, P < 0.001). The atherosclerotic burden score improved the prognostic value of conventional risk factors significantly (P < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS

In diabetic patients without known CAD, CCTA can identify a patient group at particularly high risk for subsequent hard cardiac events.

### Coronary artery calcium scoring to guide statin therapy by risk-enhancing factors… [^fb9f8e5a]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

In this cross-sectional study of a multiethnic sample of 1688 adults with an intermediate risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, most risk-enhancing factors had an absolute atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease incidence rate of less than 7. 5 events per 1000 person-years in the absence of subclinical atherosclerosis. The use of coronary artery calcium scoring was associated with significant improvements in the reclassification and discrimination of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events.

Meaning The study's findings suggested that, among individuals at intermediate risk with risk-enhancing factors, atherosclerotic cardiovascular event rates were generally lower than the recommended threshold to initiate statin therapy when the coronary artery calcium score was 0; for cases in which additional risk stratification is required or uncertainty exists regarding the utility of statin therapy, coronary artery calcium scoring may be used to further guide the clinician-patient risk discussion. Importance The 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol recommends the use of risk-enhancing factor assessment and the selective use of coronary artery calcium scoring to guide the allocation of statin therapy among individuals with an intermediate risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Main Outcomes and Measures Incident ASCVD over a median follow-up of 12. 0 years. Results.

The AHA/ACC guideline introduced the assessment of ASCVD risk-enhancing factors as a means to guide discussion regarding the initiation of statin therapy among individuals with intermediate or borderline risk when the decision to treat is uncertain.

1., leading to reclassification of individuals with borderline or intermediate risk into a higher risk category that favors the addition of statin therapy. 2 If the decision to initiate treatment with statin therapy remains uncertain, testing for coronary artery calcium may then be considered to further reclassify risk.

1.

The 2018 AHA/ACC blood cholesterol guideline1 introduced the concept of risk-enhancing factors to further guide the discussion on the initiation of statin therapy among individuals with an intermediate risk of ASCVD.

### Clinical indications for coronary artery calcium scoring in asymptomatic patients: expert consensus statement from the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^74dca980]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2017). Medium credibility.

Risk classification and lipid-lowering therapy by CAC — CAC scoring is used to guide the initiation and intensity of statin therapy. High intensity statin therapy is recommended in any patients with a CAC ≥ 300 or above the 75th percentile for age/gender/race, consistent with the 2013 ACC/AHA Prevention Guidelines. Moderate to high intensity statin treatment is recommended for patients with CAC 100–299; for CAC 1–99, moderate intensity statin therapy is recommended for those with CAC percentile < 75% and moderate to high intensity for those with CAC percentile ≥ 75%. Patients with CAC = 0 are considered to be at lowest risk and statins are not uniformly recommended, with the exception of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or diabetes.
