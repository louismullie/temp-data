## Question

What are the typical symptoms of uvulitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the typical symptoms of uvulitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core symptom cluster that consistently appears across case reports and series. Then, I should verify how often systemic features like fever accompany uvulitis. Next, I will examine the physical examination findings, especially uvular appearance and oropharyngeal context. After that, I need to consider red flags that suggest airway risk or deeper infection. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, prioritized list of typical symptoms and note important differentials and caveats, making sure I anchor each point to the best available evidence I can find in the provided sources.

> Let me first confirm the core symptom cluster. Across multiple case reports and series, patients with uvulitis consistently report sore throat, odynophagia, and a globus or foreign-body sensation, often with dysphagia and pooling of secretions or drooling when edema is marked, which aligns with the mechanical and inflammatory effects of a swollen uvula in the oropharynx [^116ATLU9].

> Wait, let me verify the frequency of fever and systemic symptoms. I initially thought fever was universal, but hold on, that's too strong. Fever is common in infectious uvulitis, particularly with streptococcal or pneumococcal etiologies, yet some cases, especially noninfectious or iatrogenic uvular edema, may present without fever, so I should qualify that fever is frequent but not invariant in infectious presentations [^112ACtFT].

> I will now examine the physical findings. The hallmark is uvular edema, often described as marked, pronounced, or even massive, with erythema of the uvula and surrounding soft palate; in some cases the uvula appears edematous and erythematous without exudate, while in others it may be covered by a whitish membrane or exudate depending on the pathogen and severity, and the oropharynx may show concurrent pharyngeal erythema or tonsillar involvement when uvulitis is part of a broader pharyngitis or epiglottitis complex [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about airway risk. I need to check for red flags that should heighten concern: stridor, muffled or "hot potato" voice, drooling with inability to handle secretions, and rapidly progressive swelling suggest impending airway compromise; importantly, uvulitis can coexist with epiglottitis, a life-threatening airway emergency, so any of these features mandates urgent airway evaluation and management rather than routine outpatient care [^111g3q7U] [^116ATLU9] [^113s5yXU].

> Let me consider associated symptoms that, while not universal, are frequently reported. Dysphagia beyond simple odynophagia, pooling of saliva or drooling when edema is severe, and a sense of choking or globus are common; nausea and vomiting can occur, particularly in children, and neck discomfort or cervical lymphadenopathy may accompany infectious etiologies, reflecting regional inflammatory spread [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the uvulitis is iatrogenic or allergic rather than infectious. I should double-check that the symptom profile still fits. Post-intubation or post-procedural uvular edema and necrosis present with severe sore throat, odynophagia, and dysphagia, often within 24 hours, and may include uvular necrosis with a similar foreign-body sensation; allergic or toxic etiologies can produce dramatic edema with minimal systemic features, reinforcing that the core symptom triad of pain, dysphagia/odynophagia, and globus applies across causes even if fever is absent [^115jt7zp] [^112PkWx8] [^114eLyRv].

> Let me synthesize the typical symptom profile, and I should confirm I'm not overstating anything. Typical uvulitis presents with sore throat, odynophagia, and a globus or foreign-body sensation, frequently accompanied by dysphagia and pooling of secretions or drooling when edema is marked; fever is common in infectious cases but not universal; on exam, the uvula is edematous and erythematous, sometimes with exudate or membrane, and the oropharynx may be diffusely erythematous; red flags include stridor, muffled voice, drooling with distress, and rapid progression, which should trigger urgent airway management and consideration of concomitant epiglottitis [^116ATLU9].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also note important differentials so we don't anchor on uvulitis alone. Angioedema, including hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor, can involve the uvula and cause isolated uvular edema without the classic infectious accompaniments; peritonsillar abscess can produce uvular deviation and overlapping pain but usually shows asymmetric tonsillar findings; and epiglottitis can coexist with uvulitis, so the presence of systemic toxicity, drooling, and respiratory distress should pivot the evaluation toward the airway first [^113jH3Q2] [^115k3Qzd] [^111g3q7U].

Uvulitis typically presents with **sore throat and odynophagia** [^112ACtFT], often with a **foreign-body sensation** or globus, and visible uvular edema and erythema [^116ATLU9]. Fever, drooling, and dysphagia are common, and **airway symptoms** (stridor, muffled voice, dyspnea) may occur with severe swelling [^113s5yXU]. Uvular deviation or a membrane can suggest complications such as peritonsillar abscess [^115k3Qzd] or epiglottitis [^116ATLU9], which require urgent evaluation [^113s5yXU].

---

## Local symptoms

- **Sore throat**: Persistent and often severe, typically localized to the posterior oropharynx [^notfound].
- **Odynophagia**: Painful swallowing, frequently severe enough to limit oral intake [^notfound].
- **Foreign-body sensation**: A feeling of something stuck in the throat or globus sensation [^notfound].
- **Dysphagia**: Difficulty swallowing due to mechanical obstruction from uvular swelling [^notfound].
- **Drooling**: Inability to manage secretions because of pain and obstruction [^notfound].

---

## Systemic symptoms

Systemic features are **more common in infectious uvulitis** and include:

- **Fever**: Common in bacterial etiologies such as Streptococcus pyogenes or Haemophilus influenzae [^notfound].
- **Malaise**: Generalized fatigue and discomfort [^notfound].
- **Headache**: Especially in pediatric patients with streptococcal infections [^notfound].

---

## Physical examination findings

On examination, the following are **typically observed**:

- **Uvular edema**: Marked swelling of the uvula, sometimes described as "massive" or "pale, translucent" edema [^notfound].
- **Erythema**: Redness of the uvula and surrounding oropharyngeal tissues [^notfound].
- **Exudate or membrane**: White or grayish coating on the uvula, particularly in bacterial infections [^notfound].
- **Uvular deviation**: Lateral displacement of the uvula, often associated with peritonsillar abscess [^115k3Qzd].
- **Palatal edema**: Swelling of the soft palate, occasionally with a "true membrane" covering the uvula [^116ATLU9].

---

## Severe or complicated presentations

In severe cases, particularly with **significant edema** or concurrent infections, the following may occur:

- **Airway obstruction**: Stridor, muffled voice, dyspnea, and respiratory distress [^notfound].
- **Epiglottitis**: Coexisting inflammation of the epiglottis, presenting with severe throat pain, drooling, and respiratory distress [^111g3q7U].
- **Uvular necrosis**: Rare complication from ischemia or trauma, presenting with severe pain and tissue breakdown [^112PkWx8].

### Infective uvulitis in a child [^114HrJLK]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Infective uvulitis is a rare condition in children. In this report, we describe the case of a 4-year old-patient who presented a group A Streptococcus pharyngitis with uvulitis. No signs of epiglottitis were detected at nasal fibroscopy. She recovered rapidly with intravenous antibiotic therapy and 2 days of corticosteroid. Uvulitis is usually caused by group A Streptococcus or Haemophilus influentiae, but also other bacteria can be detected. Uvulitis can be isolated, or it can occur with epiglottitis and become an emergency.

### Clinical guidance for group A streptococcal pharyngitis… [^112ACtFT]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Cause Group A streptococcal pharyngitis is an infection of the oropharynx caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. The incubation period of group A strep pharyngitis is approximately 2 to 5 days. Keep ReadingGroup A Strep Bacteria and How They Spread. Clinical features Acute pharyngitis symptoms It commonly presents with
- Fever
- Pain with swallowing
- Sudden onset of sore throat On clinical examination, patients with group A strep pharyngitis usually have
- Anterior cervical lymphadenopathy
- Palatal petechiae
- Pharyngeal and tonsillar erythema
- Tonsillar hypertrophy with or without exudates Patients with group A strep pharyngitis may also present with a scarlatiniform rash. The resulting syndrome is scarlet fever. Keep ReadingClinical Guidance for Scarlet Fever.

Less common symptoms Other symptoms, especially among children, may include:

- Abdominal pain
- Headache
- Nausea and vomiting Subacute illness Respiratory disease caused by group A strep infection in children younger than 3 years of age rarely manifests as acute pharyngitis. Instead, these children usually have what is called "streptococcal fever" or "streptococcosis, " which involves mucopurulent rhinitis followed by:

- Anorexia
- Fever
- Irritability. Complications Rarely, complications can occur after group A strep pharyngitis. Suppurative complications Suppurative complications result from the spread of group A strep bacteria from the pharynx to adjacent structures. They can include:

- Cervical lymphadenitis
- Mastoiditis
- Peritonsillar abscess
- Retropharyngeal abscess Other focal infections or sepsis are even less common. These complications are more likely to occur after an untreated infection.

Nonsuppurative sequelae Nonsuppurative sequelae of group A strep pharyngitis include: These complications occur after the original infection resolves and involve sites distant to the initial group A strep infection site. They're thought to be the result of the immune response and not of direct group A strep infection.

### Uvulitis following general anaesthesia [^115jt7zp]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Uvular necrosis following endotracheal general anaesthesia is a rare complication. We report two cases of uvular and soft palate necrosis after atraumatic intubation with endotracheal tube and, in the second case, laryngeal mask airway.

### Wound botulism presenting as dysphagia to an ENT ward [^112LHq84]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 44-year-old man with a background of heroin injection drug use was referred to the ear, nose and throat team with a sore throat and dysphagia. He was treated with intravenous antibiotics and steroids for suspected uvulitis. He developed progressive bulbar weakness and symmetrical descending weakness of the upper extremities over a 12-hour period and was intubated prior to transfer to the intensive care unit. Botulinum heptavalent antitoxin was administered, and subsequent PCR assay confirmed Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin B from his most recent injection site. He was found unconscious on the ward 3days following extubation. Postmortem confirmed he died from heroin intoxication. This case highlights the importance of considering wound botulism in injection drug users presenting with unexplained weakness, particularly of the lower cranial nerves. Botulism is not characteristically associated with signs of localised or systemic infection in contrary to other bacterial complications of injection drug use.

### Bilateral peritonsillar abscesses: case report and literature review [^113PYbM9]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2006). Low credibility.

Although unilateral peritonsillar abscesses (PTA) are a common complication of acute bacterial tonsillitis, bilateral PTA are quite rare. We present the case of a 14-year-old female teenager with a 1-week history of acute tonsillitis. Physical examination revealed significant trismus, symmetrically inflamed tonsils and soft palate, and a midline uvula. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck demonstrated bilateral PTA. After bilateral needle aspiration and administration of antibiotics, complete disease resolution was rapidly achieved. Patients with bilateral PTA present a diagnostic dilemma because they do not demonstrate the classic asymmetric signs and symptoms seen in the more prevalent unilateral PTA. Contrast-enhanced CT imaging can help diagnose bilateral PTA and should be considered in the presence of marked trismus but with the absence of unilateral inflammatory findings.

### Diagnosis and management of laryngopharyngeal reflux… [^116mcG3C]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux occurs in up to 10 percent of patients who consult an ear, nose, and throat subspecialist. It can account for more than 50 percent of patients presenting with hoarseness. LPR is caused by reflux into the larynx and often occurs in the absence of typical gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms, such as heartburn. Symptoms of LPR can include throat clearing, cough, and globus pharyngeus. Findings on laryngoscopy are nonspecific but can include redness, thickening, and edema in the posterior larynx. A medial edge concavity in the vocal fold, called pseudosulcus, is found in up to 90 percent of patients with LPR. Diagnosis can be confirmed by response to treatment, endoscopic observation of the injury, or through impedance and pH monitoring studies. However, pH monitoring is less reliable in detecting LPR than in detecting GERD.

Ford analyzed key articles, journals, and reference lists to determine a practical method for assessing and managing LPR cases. 2 blockers, prokinetic agents, and mucosal cytoprotectants. PPIs are the medical therapy of choice and should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before each meal. Longer and more aggressive treatment is required for LPR than for GERD. If an H. 2 blocker is used in treatment, ranitidine is preferred over cimetidine. If a prokinetic drug is used, tegaserod is the drug of choice because it decreases reflux and esophageal sphincter relaxation. Sucralfate may be used as an adjunct treatment to protect injured mucosa. However, antacids should not be used to treat LPR. Surgical intervention with partial or complete fundoplication is an option for patients resistant to medical management. Surgery is more effective than medical treatment in preventing Barrett's syndrome.

If the patient has not improved after aggressive medical management for three months, ambulatory pH monitoring or esophagoscopy should be performed to make a definitive diagnosis. The author concludes that because LPR is associated with aerodigestive malignancy, patients whose symptoms persist should be monitored closely.

### Unusual purpuric eruption in a child [^1159HG4c]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the preferred first-line treatment for mild cases of UV?
A. Omalizumab
B. Glucocorticoids plus antihistamines
C. Azathioprine
D. Colchicine
E. Rituximab

Answers:
A. Omalizumab – Incorrect. Although successful treatment of UV with biologics, including omalizumab, has been reported in multiple case studies, this treatment has not been robustly studied in the context of UV and is less cost-effective than other treatments.
B. Glucocorticoids plus antihistamines — Correct. Corticosteroids downregulate the inflammatory response and clear deposited immune complexes linked to the pathogenesis of the disease. They have been shown to be effective for the treatment of cutaneous findings of UV in 80% of patients. Antihistamines resulted in resolution of symptoms in less than 30% of patients, but given their low side effect profile and cost, they are commonly added to the treatment regimen.
C. Azathioprine – Incorrect. Azathioprine and other immunosuppressive agents are typically reserved for severe cases or cases refractory to first-line agents.
D. Colchicine – Incorrect. Colchicine is usually reserved for refractory cases. The addition of colchicine to otherwise ineffective corticosteroid monotherapy has been shown to lead to clinical remission of UV.
E. Rituximab – Incorrect. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against the CD20 antigen on B cells. This systemic immunosuppressive has a more severe side effect profile and is not a cost-effective method of treatment in mild UV. It has been reported as an effective treatment in severe, refractory, or relapsing cases of HUVS.

### Angioedema masqueraders [^114E7WZ2]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

Angioedema is a common reason for referral to immunology and allergy specialists. Not all cases are in fact angioedema. There are many conditions that may mimic its appearance, resulting in misdiagnosis. This may happen when a clinician is unfamiliar with conditions resembling angioedema or when there is a low index of clinical suspicion. In this article, we explore a list of differential diagnoses based on body parts, including the lips, the limbs, periorbital tissues, the face, epiglottis and uvula, as well as the genitalia, that may pose as a masquerader even to an experienced eye.

### Solar capillaritis as a cause of solar purpura [^115D3T33]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Appearance of purpura acutely after sun exposure is rare. We report a 51-year-old woman who repeatedly developed an asymptomatic petechial eruption on her legs after strong sun exposure. Investigation found an action spectrum within the ultraviolet A waveband, and histological examination of an evoked lesion found features of capillaritis. We briefly review the literature on solar purpura, and suggest that it is a feature of several distinct conditions, rather than a single condition.

### Bilateral peritonsillar abscess: case report and literature review [^117SkuSa]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2011). Low credibility.

Although uncommon, bilateral peritonsillar abscess (PTA) may still present with symptoms found in unilateral cases but lack hallmark findings such as an asymmetric tonsillar bulge and uvular deviation. We present the case of an 18-year-old woman deemed to have a bilateral PTA based on physical examination and radiographic imaging. She underwent successful surgical drainage with needle aspiration, followed by incision and drainage. A computed tomography with intravenous contrast should be obtained when a patient displays signs suggestive of a bilateral PTA but the diagnosis is not certain. To our knowledge, this is the first report of 2 different bacterial species cultured from contralateral abscesses during the same encounter.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^113SYV88]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Solar urticaria — clinical features and natural history describe rapid onset of wheals with sun exposure, generally within 1–3 minutes, with typical wheals developing within 1 to 3 minutes and a 1- to 3-hour delay reported but less typical. Symptoms usually resolve after stopping exposure, usually within 30 minutes and almost always within 24 hours, though in rare cases they can persist for more than 24 hours. It is initially present in pediatric and older adult (age > 65 years) patients, with a usual age of onset between 20 and 41 years, and retrospective studies suggest resolution in 15% to 86% of patients after 5 years of symptoms. Triggers include UVB (280–320 nm), UVA (320–400 nm), visible light (400–600 nm), and even infrared (> 600 nm) radiation.

### Burning urticarial plaques in a middle-aged woman [^116RPfzq]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Normocomplementemic UV – Correct. UV is a rare subtype of leukocytoclastic vasculitis that predominantly affects the skin. Individual hive-like lesions of UV characteristically persist longer than 24 hours, a trait distinguishing it from ordinary urticaria. A burning sensation often accompanies edematous plaques, which leave bruise-like patches upon resolution. Based on complement consumption, UV is categorized as normocomplementemic (80% of cases), hypocomplementemic, and rare hypocomplementemic UV syndrome. The serum levels of C3 and C4 should be checked to differentiate normocomplementemic UV from these.
B. NUD – Incorrect. There can be diagnostic and histologic overlap between NUD and UV, and workup for underlying systemic, autoimmune conditions is necessary in unclear cases. Most patients with NUD have fever, polyarthritis, leukocytosis, and associated systemic disease (Still disease, lupus, or Schnitzler syndrome). This patient's lack of systemic symptoms argues against NUD.
C. Adult-onset Still disease – Incorrect. Our patient's lack of fever and arthritis argues against adult-onset Still disease, which classically presents as evanescent salmon-colored papules.
D. Schnitzler syndrome – Incorrect. Although skin biopsy for Schnitzler syndrome most commonly exhibits neutrophilic urticaria (with leukocytoclastic vasculitis seen in 25% of patients), these patients also present with fever, arthralgias, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy, which were absent in this patient.
E. Hypocomplementemic UV syndrome – Incorrect. This is a severe syndrome defined by specific diagnostic criteria – urticaria for 6 months as well as hypocomplementemia and 2 of the following criteria: (1) vasculitis on biopsy, (2) arthralgia or arthritis, (3) uveitis or episcleritis, (4) glomerulonephritis, (5) recurrent abdominal pain, or (6) positive C1q precipitin test result with a low C1q level.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^115oa6Gz]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — herpes simplex virus (HSV) conjunctivitis is usually unilateral and can be bilateral, especially in atopic, pediatric, or immunocompromised patients, with bulbar conjunctival injection, watery discharge, mild follicular reaction of conjunctiva, and a palpable preauricular node; distinctive signs include vesicular rash or ulceration of eyelids, pleomorphic or excavated dendritic epithelial keratitis of cornea, and ulceration of the conjunctiva. Associated/predisposing factors include prior infection with HSV with triggers for reactivation such as stress, other acute viral or febrile illnesses, ultraviolet exposure, surgery, or trauma, and primary HSV infection with exposure to an infected individual. Natural history is that it usually subsides without treatment within 4 to 7 days unless complications occur. Potential sequelae include blepharitis, epithelial keratitis, corneal edema, endotheliitis, stromal keratitis, neovascularization, scarring, thinning, perforation, uveitis, trabeculitis, and retinitis.

### Intratonsillar abscess: a rare cause for a common clinical presentation [^116ZQo3H]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Intratonsillar abscess is a rare clinical condition in patients who present with odynophagia. We report the case of a 33-year-old man who presented with odynophagia, unilateral tonsillar enlargement with palatal fullness, and deviation of the uvula. Failed attempts at drainage of a presumptive peritonsillar abscess and a worsening of signs and symptoms led to a clinical suspicion of a parapharyngeal abscess. Computed tomography of the neck detected a 2.6 × 2.3-cm intratonsillar abscess. The abscess was drained, and the patient's signs and symptoms resolved. Our review of the current English-language literature revealed that only 8 such cases have been previously reported. We report this new case to increase awareness of this condition, to demonstrate the diagnostic difficulty in such cases, and to discuss the pathophysiology of intratonsillar abscess formation.

### Simultaneous uvulitis and epiglottitis… [^116ATLU9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

ACUTE swelling and inflammation of the uvula has rarely been reported in association with acute epiglottitis. 1–3 The classic reports of epiglottitis in childhood note that pharyngitis is frequently found, but do not describe the uvula specifically. 4–6 Rabe4 did note a "true membrane" covering the uvula in one of his patients. In a recent report of extraepiglottic complications of epiglottitis, tonsillitis was noted in 8% of patients but inflammation or swelling of the uvula was not mentioned. 7 Cellulitis of the tongue has recently been reported. 8 We saw a patient with pharyngitis and remarkable uvulitis whose underlying epiglottitis was nearly missed. This uncommon but potentially important association is the basis for this report. Report of a Case A 5-year-old girl was well until one week prior to admission when symptoms of mild upper respiratory infection developed for which she took no medication. On the day Rapkin RH.

### What's old is new: valacyclovir for the treatment of pityriasis rosea, a retrospective case series [^1165X4UU]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a common and self-limiting papulosquamous skin condition. It presents with the most distinguishable sign of a larger "herald" patch with a collarette of scale at the margins, followed by smaller, finer, bilateral erythematous scaly plaques. The lesions commonly occur over the trunk and extremities in a blaschkolinear "Christmas tree" distribution. PR is most encountered as a springtime eruption and typically affects children and adults (age, 10–35 years), with a peak in adolescence. The estimated prevalence of PR in the United States was found to be 0.3% to 3% at dermatologic centers and evenly distributed among both sexes as 0.13% in females and 0.14% in males.

Upon diagnosis of PR, patients may be informed that the condition is self-limiting, noncontagious, and unlikely to recur. A typical course develops and resolves on average within 6 to 8 weeks without therapy. However, the cutaneous eruption has been reported to last for 3 to 6 months. For some patients, the "watchful waiting" approach may not be sufficient due to symptomology and psychosocial distress associated with the appearance of lesions. Symptomatic treatments for symptoms such as pruritus include topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, and anti-itch lotions. Alternative potential treatments include UV-B phototherapy; antivirals, such as acyclovir; and macrolide antibiotics, with only modest success in clearing the eruption. Of the macrolides, a triple-blinded study on erythromycin 250 mg 4 times daily for 2 weeks resulted in remission after 2 weeks in 65% of patients. Gastrointestinal upset was observed in 10% of patients. A bilateral comparison study of UV-B in patients with PR notes clearance on the treated half of the body after an average of 4.7 to 6.8 treatments, with notable adverse effect in some patients of slight tenderness and dryness of the skin.

### Bilateral peritonsillar abscesses: not your usual sore throat [^111MAo5H]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

We describe a rare case of a previously healthy 30-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with bilateral peritonsillar abscesses. The clinical presentation of fever, trismus and odynophagia was consistent with pertonsillar abscess (PTA), but the presence of symmetric tonsillar swelling and midline uvula confounded the diagnosis. The true incidence of bilateral peritonsillar abscesses is unknown, but the incidence of unsuspected contralateral peritonsillar abscess identified at tonsillectomy has been reported to be between 1.9% and 24%. The diagnosis of bilateral peritonsillar abscesses should be considered when the clinical presentation suggests the diagnosis of PTA, but the physical examination reveals bilateral swollen tonsils with a midline uvula.

### Interventions for chronic palmoplantar pustulosis [^116G9iVf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Palmoplantar pustulosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which sterile, relapsing pustules appear on the palms and soles, possibly in conjunction with other symptoms. The previous Cochrane Review on this topic was published in 2006, before biological treatments were extensively used.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for chronic palmoplantar pustulosis to induce and maintain complete remission.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to March 2019: Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of the included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Selection Criteria

We considered RCTs including people with palmoplantar pustulosis or chronic palmoplantar pustular psoriasis assessing topical therapy, systemic therapy, combinations of topical or systemic therapies, or non-pharmacological therapies compared with placebo, no intervention, or each other.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our outcomes included 'Proportion of participants cleared or almost cleared', 'Proportion of participants with adverse effects serious or severe enough to cause withdrawal', 'Proportion of participants with at least 50% improvement in disease severity', and 'Proportion of participants with adverse effects'.

Main Results

We included 37 studies (1663 participants; mean age 50 years (range 34 to 63); 24% males). These studies reported condition severity differently. Around half of the included trials stated the setting (hospitals, community clinics, or both). More than half of the studies were at high risk of bias in at least one domain. Our included studies assessed mainly systemic treatments (retinoids, ciclosporin, biologics, etretinate + PUVA (combination of psoralens and long-wave ultraviolet radiation) therapy combined, and antibiotics), but also topical treatments (dermocorticoids, vitamin D) and phototherapy (PUVA, ultraviolet A1 (UVA1)). Other interventions were assessed by single studies. The most common comparator was placebo. All results presented in this abstract were assessed in the short term (mean treatment duration was 11 weeks (range 8 to 24 weeks)) and are based on participants with chronic palmoplantar pustulosis. All outcome time point measurements were taken from baseline and assessed at the end of treatment. Short-term and long-term outcomes were defined as measurement up to 24 weeks after randomisation and between 24 and 104 weeks after randomisation, respectively. One trial (188 participants) assessed the topical vitamin D derivative maxacalcitol versus placebo and found that maxacalcitol may be more effective than placebo in achieving clearance (risk ratio (RR) 7.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.85 to 33.12; low-quality evidence), and the risk of adverse effects (such as mild local irritation, pruritus, and haematological or urinary test abnormalities) is probably similar in both groups (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.19; moderate-quality evidence). Severity was not reported. Two trials (49 participants) assessed PUVA therapy versus placebo or no treatment, providing very low-quality evidence. Adverse effects were reported with oral PUVA (including nausea, ankle swelling, and non-purulent conjunctivitis) and with local PUVA (including blistering, erythema, and pruritus). With regard to the systemic retinoid alitretinoin, one trial (33 participants; moderate-quality evidence) showed that alitretinoin probably makes little or no difference in reducing severity when compared to placebo (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.30). A similar number of adverse events were reported in both treatment groups, including headache, cheilitis, nausea, arthralgia, and nasopharyngitis (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.17). Clearance was not reported. There may be little or no difference between etanercept and placebo in achieving clearance (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.08 to 34.28; 1 study; 15 participants; low-quality evidence); however, the 95% CI was very wide, showing there may be a difference between groups. Severity was not measured. More patients treated with placebo may achieve reduced severity than those treated with ustekinumab, but the wide 95% CI indicates there might be little or no difference between groups and there might be greater effect with ustekinumab (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.13; 1 study; 33 participants; low-quality evidence). Clearance was not reported. It is uncertain whether guselkumab increases clearance when compared to placebo (2 studies; 154 participants) because the quality of evidence is very low, but guselkumab probably better reduces disease severity (RR 2.88, 95% CI 1.24 to 6.69; 1 study; 49 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Secukinumab is probably superior to placebo in reducing severity (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.35; 1 study; 157 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but our clearance outcome was not reported. None of these trials reported on occurrence of adverse effects. Only two of the studies discussed above reported adverse effects serious or severe enough to cause withdrawal. Guselkumab may cause more serious adverse events when compared to placebo, but there is uncertainty due to the very wide 95% CI showing there may be little or no difference and showing more events with placebo (RR 2.88, 95% CI 0.32 to 25.80; 1 study; 49 participants; low-quality evidence). Secukinumab probably causes more serious adverse events than placebo (RR 3.29, 95% CI 1.40 to 7.75; 1 study; 157 participants; moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is lacking for major chronic palmoplantar pustulosis treatments such as superpotent corticosteroids, phototherapy, acitretin, methotrexate, and ciclosporin. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence. Maxacalcitol may be more effective than placebo in achieving clearance in the short term (low-quality evidence), and the risk of adverse effects is probably similar (moderate-quality evidence). Oral alitretinoin is probably no more effective than placebo in reducing severity, with a similar risk of adverse effects (moderate-quality evidence). Regarding biological treatments, we are uncertain of the effect of etanercept on clearance and the effect of ustekinumab on severity (low-quality evidence). Secukinumab and guselkumab are probably superior to placebo in reducing severity (moderate-quality evidence). Adverse events not requiring withdrawal were not reported for these treatments. Reporting of serious adverse effects was incomplete: compared to placebo, secukinumab probably caused more participant withdrawals (moderate-quality evidence), but we are uncertain of the effect of guselkumab (low-quality evidence). Future trials should assess commonly used treatments using validated severity and quality of life scales.

### Panniculitis with fever of unknown origin [^112auSmq]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Background

The term fever of unknown origin (FUO) was first used by Petersdorf and Beeson at Yale University in the 1960s. They studied 100 patients with a body temperature above 38.3°C for over 3 weeks without diagnosis despite a week of hospital evaluation. Most panniculitides present similarly, with tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules, typically where fatty tissue is prominent (eg, legs, thighs, buttocks and cheeks). Subtypes of panniculitis are linked to infections, trauma, cancer and inflammatory illnesses. Diagnosing panniculitis is challenging due to its rarity and similar clinical presentations. Diagnosis requires thorough clinical examination, considering patient risk factors, lesion distribution and related symptoms (eg, ulceration, sclerosis and atrophy). Histopathologic evaluation can aid diagnosis, but requires careful clinical correlation to avoid inaccuracies. The challenge increases with FUO, necessitating a comprehensive assessment. We describe a young child with panniculitis and recurring fevers, highlighting the diagnostic challenges and need for a multidisciplinary approach

### Polymorphous light eruption: clinic aspects and pathogenesis [^112Abpmi]. Dermatologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

Polymorphous light eruption is an immunologically mediated photodermatosis with high prevalence, particularly among young women in temperate climates, characterized by pruritic skin lesions of variable morphology, occurring in spring or early summer on sun-exposed body sites. A resistance to ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced immunosuppression and a subsequent delayed-type hypersensitivity response to a photoantigen have been suggested as key factors in the disease. Molecular and immunologic disturbances associated with disease pathogenesis include a failure of skin infiltration by neutrophils and other regulatory immune cells on UVR exposure linked to a disturbed cytokine microenvironment. Standard management is based on prevention.

5.14 Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity

Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions, the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (e.g., burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) involving areas exposed to light (typically the face, "V" area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, dorsa of the hands), can be associated with the use of fluoroquinolones after sun or UV light exposure. Therefore, excessive exposure to these sources of light should be avoided. Drug therapy should be discontinued if photosensitivity/phototoxicity occurs [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.15 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing levofloxacin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Comprehensive adult eye and vision examination [^111QB6AD]. AOA (2023). High credibility.

Ultraviolet radiation protection — adult patients: Since exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVA and UVB) is a risk factor for eye disorders, the consensus-based action statement says eye doctors should advise their adult patients about regular use of sunglasses that effectively block at least 99 percent of UVA and UVB radiation and the use of hats with brims when outdoors; patients should be advised about the need to protect their eyes from UV exposure because high levels can cause photokeratitis and photoconjunctivitis and chronic exposure to even low levels is a risk factor for cataracts, pterygium, squamous cell carcinoma of the cornea and conjunctiva, and skin cancer; evidence quality notes an evaluation of published research to support or refute this recommendation was not conducted for this guideline, and the benefits and harms assessment states implementation is likely to decrease patient risk of eye health problems from chronic UV exposure and is likely to increase patient's use of eye protection based on their personal risk factors, with benefits established by expert consensus opinion.

### Postoperative uvular necrosis: a case series and literature review [^112PkWx8]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Postoperative uvular necrosis is rare, but can be distressing to the patient when it unexpectedly occurs. Little has been published regarding its predisposing factors and pathophysiology. The purpose of this comprehensive review was to compile cases of postoperative uvular necrosis and identify risk factors and potential causes for this complication.

Study Design

Retrospective case series.

Methods

The study was performed at an academic tertiary care referral center. Clinical records from four patients treated for postoperative uvular necrosis from 2008 to 2018 were reviewed. A comprehensive literature review was also performed. The MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched, as well as the grey literature. All case reports and literature reviews in the English literature from 1978 to 2018 were systematically identified for review.

Results

Four cases of postoperative uvular necrosis diagnosed clinically at our institution were included. The comprehensive literature review identified 26 reports and seven case series, totaling 53 cases of this complication. Use of suction was reported in 19 cases, and six cases reported no use of suction. Ninety-four percent of cases were treated conservatively, whereas 6% underwent excision. Ninety-one percent resolved within 14 days.

Conclusions

Impingement with various devices and vascular trauma from suction each likely play a role in postoperative uvular necrosis. Male oropharyngeal anatomy may be a risk factor, but neither the type of instrumentation nor the type of procedure seem to predict this complication. Proper positioning of the patient and instruments and minimizing suction force help prevent uvular injury.

### Severe uvular edema and nasal mucosal necrosis due to ecbalium elaterium (squirting cucumber): an allergic reaction or direct toxic effect? [^114eLyRv]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Ecbalium elaterium or squirting cucumber is a plant growing in the Mediterranean region, belong to Cucurbitaceae family. Its juice has been used as an herbal medicine since ancient times because of its cathartic and anti-inflammatory effects. It has been reported to cause upper airway edema, especially after the administration of its undiluted form. It has generally been attributed to allergic reaction. In this case report we aimed to interrogate this anticipation by presenting a case of severe uvular edema and nasal mucosal necrosis after dripping undiluted Ecbalium elaterium juice that did not improved by anti-allergic therapies.

### Intraoral ultrasound in the diagnosis and treatment of suspected peritonsillar abscess in the emergency department [^115k3Qzd]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) can be a life-threatening disease and may lead to significant complications without drainage.

Objectives

To describe the utility of ultrasound (US) in the evaluation of potential PTA and US-guided PTA drainage.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective US quality assurance review of all patients over 18 years of age scanned by emergency physicians for possible PTA. All patients presenting with PTA signs and symptoms including erythema and swelling of the tonsillar pillar and uvular deviation were eligible to be scanned. Patients confirmed to have an abscess on US had US-guided drainage followed by intravenous antibiotics in the emergency department and discharge home on oral antibiotics. Scans were performed by credentialed attending emergency physicians and residents. Researchers recorded patient symptoms, US findings, results of abscess drainage if performed, and any complications of drainage. All US examinations were performed with sheathed endocavity broadband US transducers on minimum depth and maximum resolution settings. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics.

Results

Forty-three patients received intraoral US examinations for suspected PTA. Thirty-five (81%) were diagnosed as having abscess on US. All abscesses were drained with an 18- or 14-gauge needle under US guidance. There were no drainage complications. There was one false positive with a focal area of edema yielding no pus on needle aspiration under direct US visualization. No patient returned unexpectedly after drainage.

Conclusions

These data suggest that intraoral US of suspected PTA allows for reliable diagnosis and safe and accurate abscess drainage.

Pediatric rhinosinusitis — presentation and diagnostic considerations emphasize symptom patterns and practical examination limits. As to symptoms, cough is a prominent symptom. The frequency of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in children is higher than that in adults and therefore has a greater impact on rhinosinusitis in children. Some younger children might not tolerate nasal endoscopy, and clinicians are sometimes hindered in their physical examination and have to rely on history and on imaging studies for appropriate diagnosis. Unilateral nasal drainage in children should alert the clinician to the possible differential diagnosis of unilateral choanal atresia and nasal foreign body.

### Interventions for vitiligo [^113Hau7q]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Which interventions are associated with highest efficacy and fewest adverse events for treating vitiligo?

Bottom Line

Combination therapies, particularly those involving some form of light (ie, narrowband UV-B) were associated with more improved repigmentation than monotherapies. There was limited evidence to support the association of UV-A alone and UV-B alone with repigmentation for vitiligo. There was moderate evidence to support the association of UV-A and UV-B, when used in combination with psoralens, topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, fluorouracil, azathioprine, and oral prednisolone with improved outcomes for vitiligo. However, combination therapies were associated with more adverse effects.

Although sore throat is a very common complaint in the emergency department and is often associated with benign conditions, such as pharyngitis, it can be the early onset of something much more serious and even life threatening. A thorough history and examination are vital to the correct diagnosis but a high index of suspicion must be maintained to diagnose less common but serious pathology, such as epiglottitis and retropharyngeal abscess. Airway management is paramount to survival, and aggressive means should be taken early when epiglottitis is considered.

### Defining outcome measures in juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis by a systematic review analysis: do we need a consensus? [^1119oTdq]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis associated Uveitis (JIA-U), with an estimated incidence at 8.3%, represents its most frequent extra-articular manifestation and is the main cause of uveitis in pediatrics in developed countries. JIA-U is a serious and disabling sight-threatening disease, accounting for up to 10% of pathologies leading to blindness. Patients with JIA develop uveitis in approximately 50 and 90% within 3 months and 4 years, respectively, after the diagnosis of arthritis. Uveitis precedes the onset of arthritis in 2–7% of patients. Uveitis, usually affecting anterior chamber, is asymptomatic in the majority of JIA children, aside entesitis-related arthritis and late onset psoriatic arthritis JIA type, which may instead experience symptomatic uvea involvement. Any way, periodic ophthalmologic examination is mandatory required for screening. In JIA-U care, to define related and unified outcome measures are for sure quintessential to assess the effect of the treatment. Observations published worldwide on the outcomes of JIA-U are surprisingly diverse and different. The broad variety of outcome measures utilized makes the comparison of the disease course, risk for structural complications, levels of impairment in visual function, and responses to treatment quite difficult.

Pediatric Rheumatology 2023, 21(Suppl 2): P177

Introduction: Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is a rare cutaneous vasculitis of small vessels (SVV) characterized by wheal-like lesions that tend to last more than 24 hours, healing with a residual ecchymotic postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. The histopathologic pattern is definide as leukocytoclastic vasculitis. UV can be limited to the skin or may be associated with constitutional symptoms, including fever and arthralgias, and involvement of other organs such as kidneys, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and eyes. The Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) 2012 included the hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUV) (anti-C1q vasculitis) in the group of 'immune complex SVV'. HUV was defined as 'a form of vasculitis accompanied by urticarial and hypocomplementemia affecting small vessels and associated anti-C1q antibodies'. HUV is a rare disease in children.

Objectives: To describe a case of pediatric HUV.

Methods: A 2 years old male infant was admitted to our hospital with urticarial erythematous rash lasting 9 days, bilateral non-secreting conjunctivitis, erythema and cracking of lips. His recent medical history was remarkable for fever 5 days before (lasting 6 days). Blood tests showed elevation of inflammatory indexes and hypocomplementemia (reduced C3 and undosable C4). The clinic and blood tests were suggestive of hypocomplementemic ANCA-negative urticarial vasculitis. Urine tests, abdominal ultrasound, cardiac examination and ocular fundus excluded complications of vasculitis. Secondary forms were excluded with negative ANA, anti dsDNA, anti-cardiolipin, antiphospholipid antibodies, normal expression of immune system, absence of signs of acute Sars-COV-2 infection. Unfortunately, it was not possible to detect anti-C1q antibodies.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^112zVjz2]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

The diagnosis of an acute sore throat is based on signs and symptoms. The Centor clinical prediction rules can be used to help predict whether the sore throat is caused by a bacterial pathogen, and thus guide the decision whether to prescribe an antibiotic.

Most guidelines recommend paracetamol or ibuprofen as the first choice treatment. The use of corticosteroids is mentioned in few, and is generally discouraged (table 1). Antibiotics are probably not helpful for pain relief in an episode of acute sore throat caused by viruses, but may help those with a bacterial infection. Recommended management of sore throat varies widely, and table 1summarises current guidelines.

Photosensitivity disorders in childhood are rare, with the notable exception of overexposure as sunburn, and therefore require a more circumspect approach. Practitioners who treat children are key players in identifying and managing the many photosensitivity disorders that rarely present in childhood. A classic photodistribution of skin findings may suggest photosensitivity, but a correct diagnosis depends on a detailed history correlated with clinical findings.

### Diverticulitis: diagnosis and management… [^114tppWB]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Charles: Oh, thank you very much for having me. McDermott: So, I'd like to start off by having you tell us what is diverticulitis. Charles: Well, before we talk about diverticulitis, we have to really talk about what is a diverticula. And a diverticula is an outpouching of the submucosa and mucosa of a bowel wall that essentially bulges out the side. Diverticulitis is the inflammation of the diverticula. McDermott: What are the typical signs and symptoms of diverticulitis. Charles: So first of all, diverticulitis is typically more common in the descending and sigmoid column. The sigmoid column is perhaps the area that predisposes the most to diverticula disease. The common symptoms of diverticulitis include left lower quadrant pain, fever, and the patient typically will have a leukocytosis. People tend to think about sigmoid diverticulitis like a left-sided acute appendicitis, And it represents the same way that all of us have associated nausea and chills. Charles: Certainly.

The standard of care, or what I call the gold standard diagnostic test, is the contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. And this typically will show you the presence of diverticulosis or indeed diverticulitis. You will see stranding and thickening of the bowel wall. You may indeed see pockets of air in the area of the diverticulitis. Charles: Certainly. So the most feared and dreaded complication is really a free perforation. So a patient has diverticulitis, it perforates, and then you have the free egress of bowel content that soils the entire peritoneal cavity. Those patients will typically present acutely. They may present in extraneous. So that's one complication, and that's really the commonest complication. Other complications include things like just having a pericolic abscess or even an intraabdominal abscess, and that is you have a perforation, it's limited, it's walled up in the left lower quadrant, or you can have a pelvic abscess.

These patients will typically present with signs and symptoms of changing bowel habits, of obstructive symptoms, thinning of the stool, and it's very difficult to differentiate stricture from diverticulitis from the stricture of colon cancer. And this patient ultimately will need a bowel resection. Well, colonoscopy first to biopsies and then certainly bowel resection.

Conjunctivitis Preferred Practice Pattern — ocular surface squamous neoplasia (neoplastic) is characterized by conjunctival hyperemia with papillomatous or sessile nodules that may be leukoplakic or gelatinous, and lesions at the palpebral area or limbal location with a sentinel vessel. Associated or predisposing factors include human papillomavirus (HPV), significant ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, long-standing chronic inflammation, HIV, smoking, and xeroderma pigmentosum. The natural history notes inflammation may be chronic and mistreated as an unresponsive blepharoconjunctivitis.

### A sore throat – potentially life-threatening? [^114Lz7en]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

A sore throat, which is most commonly viewed as a minor ailment, can be a manifestation of a life-threatening disorder known as Lemierre's syndrome caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum. We report a new case of Lemierre's syndrome that occurred in an otherwise healthy 18-year-old woman, who initially presented with fever and sore throat. The diagnosis was not made until a week later when blood cultures became available. This syndrome should be suspected until proven otherwise in any patient with signs of pharyngitis, a painful swollen neck, and pulmonary symptoms. By presenting this curable, but potentially life-threatening case of Lemierre's syndrome, we hope to increase the awareness of the early clinical manifestations of Lemierre's syndrome and to emphasize the importance of careful physical examination with special attention to the neck. Clinicians should be aware that exclusion of streptococcal infection in a patient with severe tonsillar infection does not exclude a bacterial cause.

### Practical multidisciplinary framework for the assessment and management of patients with unexplained chronic aerodigestive symptoms [^1125FrYe]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Taxonomy and terminology of UCTS and related diagnoses

UCTS involves diverse symptom presentations, in the absence of structural causes, and encompasses divergent aetiological theories and specialty approaches. This clinical dilemma is the subject of highly divided terminology and taxonomy, involving specialty and regional divides and presents a challenge in developing consistent clinical guidelines. Divisions reflect varying interpretations of symptom mechanisms, origins and significance, as detailed above.

In table 4, diagnoses and other labels relevant to UCTS in the literature are presented and categorically divided according to inflammatory and functional concepts. Terms with a shared clinical or pathophysiological focus are further grouped. Current understanding of clinical features, symptom mechanisms, disease associations and other identified biopsychosocial factors for each were synthesised from the literature and are summarised in the table. Similarly, biopsychosocial associations associated with each UCTS reported in the literature are summarised in table 5.

Table 4
Clinical features reported in association with unexplained chronic throat symptoms

Table 5
Symptom associations in unexplained chronic throat symptoms

On review of the literature, three broad themes emerged in terms of diagnostic taxonomy and nomenclature:

Symptom-centric terms

Various diagnoses in the UCTS landscape identify a predominant symptom profile following the exclusion of structural pathologies (eg, idiopathic cough, functional dysphonia). This extends the symptom-directed approach that guides the assessment of organic and structural disease concepts in patients with undifferentiated throat symptoms.

Mechanism-centric terms

Diagnoses may identify a central mechanism for UCTS and likewise imply the absence of identifiable organic disease. They may relate to single symptoms (eg, CHS, muscle tension dysphonia) or encompass multiple symptom manifestations (eg, Laryngeal dysfunction).

Disease-centric terms

UCTS may be empirically attributed to consequences of underlying disease states, such as reflux or allergy (LPR, AL). These diagnoses are distinguished from those in table 2 by the inherent challenge in both identifying the proposed disease and establishing the symptom–disease correlation.

### Atypical mucocutaneous manifestations of MPOX: a systematic review [^117Sxmr3]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

4.2 area

Ear, nose, and throat manifestations have been present in some patients with MPOX. They have generally been milder than in pre‐2022 endemic cases. Some of these include cough, oral ulcers, odynophagia, otalgia, tonsillitis, and tonsillar and laryngeal ulcers. These nonspecific manifestations require a high index of suspicion, and the presence of typical cutaneous findings may be the key to diagnosis,(Figure 3a).

(a) Pseudopustule at the root of the helix. (b) Pseudopustules on the eyelid and glabella in a patient with HIV and eyelash hypertrichosis. In these cases, typical skin lesions may be the clue to the diagnosis of ophthalmological or otorhinolaryngological presentations.

The pinna is a rare site for this type of infection. Some cases have been described with typical pseudopustules associated with perichondritis and marked erythema and edema in the earlobe. This complication could be considered similar to facial or genital edema, as the lobule is also an area of very loose subcutaneous cellular tissue. Some of these patients had previous eczema or received a piercing as a possible route of contagion.

Nasal lesions have been particularly complicated. In patients with lesions in the nose, additional bacterial infections, severe necrosis, and edema surrounding the lesions have been documented. An additional challenge lies in the fact that this region has great aesthetic relevance, and the sequelae can considerably affect quality of life. The use of antivirals, either topical or systemic, could mitigate symptoms and reduce possible sequelae.

4.3 Ocular lesions

Ophthalmological manifestations are rare and include pseudopustules on the periocular skin, blepharitis, conjunctivitis, scleritis, corneal ulcers and keratitis, uveitis, and even corneal scarring and blindness. Cases have been reported with significant swelling in this location comparable to edema in the genital areaand even ocular necrosis. The presence of pseudopustules on the eyelids may be a diagnostic clue as some cases do not display lesions on the rest of the integument(Figure 3b). Considering the possible sequelae of blindness in cases of corneal involvement, patients with suspected ocular affectation should be evaluated by an ophthalmology specialist.

### Uvular ulceration following transoesophageal echocardiography [^1111AeEi]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

This report describes two episodes of significant uvular and oropharyngeal ulceration occurring during routine transoesophageal echocardiographic examination of the heart while intubated under general anaesthesia. Both patients were young and healthy and underwent anaesthesia without compromise, but experienced significant morbidity as a result of the ulceration. Uvular and oropharyngeal ulceration has been described following endoscopy and intubation, but there are few reports of ulceration following transoesophageal echocardiography. Operator skill is often a factor. Physical trauma and local ischaemia may play a role in aetiology. Patients experiencing sore throat following the procedure should be examined and observed in case of potentially fatal complications of airway compromise or uvular necrosis and infection. Particular care is required in patients undergoing day case procedures, as early discharge may lead to complications while the patient is at home.

Photosensitivity disorders in children encompass a diverse group of diseases. Compared to adult patients, underlying systemic disorders, including genetic or metabolic defects, are common causes in pediatric photosensitivity disorders. Photosensitivity in a child should be suspected if the child develops a sunburn reaction in sun-exposed sites after limited sun exposure. Diagnosis of a photodermatosis is made based on careful history taking and a physical examination. Early recognition and prompt diagnosis are essential to minimize long-term complications associated with inadequate photoprotection. In part I of this continuing medical education article, immunologically mediated photodermatoses, photodermatoses caused by exogenous photosensitizers, and the cutaneous porphyrias will be covered.

### Morphea and eosinophilic fasciitis: an update [^113nZaqw]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment

Care providers should take disease subtype, degree of activity, depth of involvement, and quality-of-life impairments into account when initiating treatment. In most patients with circumscribed superficial subtypes, treatment with topical therapies suffices. In widespread superficial disease, phototherapy or systemic treatment with methotrexate (MTX) should be initiated. For deep involvement, MTX is considered first-line treatment. The addition of SCS should be considered in case of severe disease, rapid progression, or (looming) contractures. Figure 9 shows an algorithm which guides care providers in treatment decisions for the different subtypes, including EF.

Fig. 9
Flow chart for the management of morphea and eosinophilic fasciitis. * Topical Corticosteroids (TCS): moderately potent TCS once daily for 3 months. Highly potent TCS once daily for 1 month. ** Topical calcipotriol 0.005% ointment: once or twice daily, with or without occlusion. Possibly in combination with TCS. ** Topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment: once or twice daily, with or without occlusion. Possibly in combination with TCS. † Phototherapy: preferably UVA1; suggested dose: 60 J/cm² to a cumulative dose of 1460 J/cm². If UVA1 is unavailable or impractical, alternative modalities are broadband UVA, PUVA or UVB. Methotrexate (MTX): adult starting dose 15 mg/week, max dose 25 mg/week; pediatric starting dose 15 mg/m², max dose 25 mg. Folic acid supplementation: 0.4–1 mg/day or 5–10 mg/week. Systemic corticosteroids (SCS): adult starting dose 0.5–1 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg) during a max of 3 months followed by tapering; pediatric dose: 1–2 mg/kg/day, max dose 60mg/day, followed by tapering. Intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP): adult dose 1000 mg/day for 3 days/month for 3–6 months, possibly followed by oral SCS.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of pouchitis and inflammatory pouch disorders [^115ydAi3]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA guideline — pragmatic definitions of inflammatory pouch disorders define intermittent pouchitis as isolated and infrequent episodes of typical pouchitis symptoms that resolve with therapy or spontaneously, followed by extended periods of normal pouch function (typically months to years). Chronic antibiotic-dependent pouchitis involves recurrent episodes that respond to antibiotics but relapse shortly after stopping antibiotics (typically within days to weeks) and often require recurrent or continuous antibiotic therapy; this is a continuum in which some patients may require 3–4 courses of antibiotics per year and others require almost continuous antibiotics. Chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis is relapsing–remitting or continuous symptoms of pouchitis with inadequate response to antibiotic therapy, often needing escalation to other therapies. Crohn's-like disease of the pouch is defined by diagnostic criteria including a perianal or other fistula that developed at least 12 months after the final stage of IPAA surgery, stricture of the pouch body or prepouch ileum, and the presence of prepouch ileitis, and the panel recognized that pouchitis may often coexist in these patients.

### Cogan and behcet syndromes [^113ST42V]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Cogan and Behcet syndromes are considered large vessel vasculitides. Both are rare diseases, with varied clinical manifestations affecting multiple organ systems. Although both have hallmark symptoms (ocular and vestibuloauditory inflammation in Cogan syndrome and aphthous ulcers in Behcet syndrome), neither has confirmatory diagnostic testing. Delayed diagnosis can result in poor outcomes. In both syndromes, large vessel arterial inflammation may result in severe morbidity and mortality. Treatment strategies in both syndromes vary based on organ system involvement and severity of manifestations. In this article, the epidemiology, proposed pathogenesis, manifestations, and the most current treatment paradigms for these syndromes are reviewed.

### A photodistributed eruption in an immunosuppressed patient [^112Cg6RZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Photolocalized varicella
B. Phototoxic drug reaction
C. Porphyria cutanea tarda
D. Polymorphous light eruption (PMLE)
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus

Answers:
A. Photolocalized varicella – Correct. Varicella is a common viral infection with a characteristic exanthem. Although viral rashes aggravated by sun exposure, trauma, and inflammation have been described, photolocalized varicella is rare, and the typical distribution may not be seen. As with our patient, a mild viral prodrome or constitutional symptoms are often reported. This case highlights the importance of including varicella in the differential diagnosis of a photolocalized eruption, especially in a patient with a known history of exposure and immunosuppression.
B. Phototoxic drug reaction – Incorrect. Phototoxic drug reactions present as more similar to a sunburn than to a pruritic eruption. Commonly reported etiologic drugs include vemurafenib, voriconazole, doxycycline, hydrochlorothiazide, amiodarone, and chlorpromazine. This patient was taking only ustekinumab and prednisone.
C. Porphyria cutanea tarda – Incorrect. Porphyria cutanea tarda is a disorder of porphyrin accumulation and is characterized by painful vesicles that develop on sun-exposed areas of the skin, most commonly the hands and face. Most cases are due to acquired or inherited uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase deficiency.
D. PMLE – Incorrect. PMLE is an idiopathic photodermatosis that can present with a wide range of morphologies.PMLE can affect any skin type but is more commonly reported in lighter skin types. Systemic symptoms are rare in PMLE.
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a subtype of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that usually presents symmetrically as an annular or papulosquamous eruption distributed on the sun-exposed sites of the skin.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117TWuXQ]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Guideline panel and patient involvement

According to the BMJ Rapid Recommendations process, a guideline panel provided critical oversight to the review and identified populations, subgroups, and outcomes of interest. The panel included clinicians, methodologists, and patients with experience of sore throat. Patients received personal training and support to optimise contributions throughout the guideline development process. The patients on the panel led the interpretation of the results based on what they expected the typical patient values and preferences to be, as well as the variation between patients. Five patient representatives were full members of the guideline panel and contributed to the selection and prioritisation of outcomes, values and preferences assessments, and critical feedback to the protocol for the systematic review and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations manuscript.

Search strategy

We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for relevant published randomised controlled trials based on the strategy reported in the most recent Cochrane systematic review, modified under the guidance of a research librarian (appendix 1). We limited the search from 1 January 2010, which included a two month overlap with the previous Cochrane review search, to 1 May 2017. There were no language restrictions. We reviewed reference lists from eligible new trials and related reviews for additional eligible trials and searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing or unpublished trials and for additional data from published trials.

### Peritonsillar abscess: diagnosis and treatment [^112RRDst]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Peritonsillar abscess, the most common deep infection of the head and neck that occurs in adults, is typically formed by a combination of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The presenting symptoms include fever, throat pain, and trismus. Ultrasonography and computed tomographic scanning are useful in confirming a diagnosis. Needle aspiration remains the gold standard for diagnosis and treatment of peritonsillar abscess. After performing aspiration, appropriate antibiotic therapy (including penicillin, clindamycin, cephalosporins, or metronidazole) must be initiated. In advanced cases, incision and drainage or immediate tonsillectomy may be required.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### Local therapies for inflammatory eye disease in translation: past, present and future [^113eU8Fb]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory eye disease encompasses a wide range of clinical phenotypes, and uveitis can be classified anatomically into either anterior, intermediate and posterior uveitis or panuveitis; and as acute or chronic disease, depending on whether it lasts more or less than 3 months in duration. The Standardisation of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria now form the standard for reporting uveitis clinical data. The commonest type is acute anterior uveitis, in which 50% of people are HLA B27 positive, although they do not necessarily have an associated systemic disorder. Chronic anterior uveitis lasts longer than 3 months and may or may not be associated with systemic disease. The rest of the disorders tend to be chronic, and the more serious types with posterior segment involvement have an increased incidence of visual loss, and approximately half of these patients have an associated systemic disease.

Corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment of all types of uveitis. Anterior uveitis is treated to control symptoms of pain, photophobia and redness, and to reduce complications such as posterior synechiae, cataract and macular oedema. Posterior segment inflammation usually requires treatment as it generates sight-threatening sequelae such as retinitis, macular oedema, optic disc oedema, chorioretinitis and retinal vasculitis. Topical corticosteroids are inadequate for this as they do not penetrate beyond the lens, so oral corticosteroids and second-line immunosuppressive agents are used, particularly in patients with an associated systemic disease and in those with bilateral ocular inflammation requiring treatment. Nevertheless, systemic administration is associated with significant side-effects, so there has been increasing interest in the local delivery of drugs to the eye and periocular tissues in order to avoid these complications.

### Painful facial, oral, and genital ulcers [^1118kGyS]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old otherwise healthy male presented to the dermatology clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a 2-day history of multiple painful, non-pruritic ulcers in the genital and facial regions, fever, odynophagia, headache, and fatigue. Physical examination revealed pustules and vesicles with central umbilication at the same stage of development and targetoid crusted ulcers on the right inguinal area (Fig 1), base of the penis, right gluteal region, and left cheek along with bilateral painful inguinal adenopathy. The oropharynx showed erythematous patches and erosions with white exudate.

Question 1: Based on the clinical presentation, what is the most likely etiology of the patient's ulcers?
A. Treponema pallidum
B. Monkeypox virus
C. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)
D. Candida albicans
E. Non-infectious inflammation

Answers:
A. Treponema pallidum – Incorrect. Primary syphilis infection is classically characterized by a painless genital ulcer, often associated with non-tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. Serologies for syphilis were negative in this case.
B. Monkeypox virus – Correct. Upon further questioning, the patient reported frequent unprotected sexual intercourse with alternating male partners and recent contact with symptomatic partners. After 7 days, the patient developed additional lesions on the bilateral thighs, face, right anterior neck, and buttocks. Lesions evolved to erosions with overlying crusts, with spontaneous resolution of all lesions after 3 weeks. Monkeypox is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus. Beginning in May of 2022, a rapid increase in the number of monkeypox cases emerged. Historically, lesions began on the face and spread across the trunk and extremities. In the current outbreak, it has been observed that lesions begin primarily in the genital region in men who have sex with men.
C. HSV – Incorrect. Genital herpes presents as painful grouped vesicles or ulcers. Disseminated HSV could present as facial and genital ulcers in an immunocompromised patient. Serologies for HIV were negative.
D. Candida albicans – Incorrect. Cutaneous candidiasis presents as bright red erythema surrounded by satellite pustules and papules in moist areas. Deep fungal infections can cause genital ulcers but C. albicans is not the typical pathogen.
E. Non-infectious inflammation – Incorrect. Behcet syndrome is characterized by recurrent oral apthae associated with genital ulcers. The precise etiology is unknown, but an autoimmune etiology has been proposed. The classic triad includes uveitis as well.

Lemierre's syndrome is a rare yet potentially fatal cause of sore throat. Recently published literature suggests an increase in the incidence of this 'forgotten disease', highlighting Lemierre's syndrome as a clinically important differential diagnosis of sore throat. We present a case report of an 85-year-old man who developed a sore throat, which illustrates the re-emergence of Lemierre's syndrome. Reducing the morbidity and mortality from this disease requires a high index of clinical suspicion to ensure prompt diagnosis and initiation of appropriate multidisciplinary management.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^1167kzad]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

History and physical examination elements for dysphonia: The purpose of this statement is to help clinicians identify the underlying cause of dysphonia, and careful history and physical examination provide important clues to the underlying etiology and can help direct management. The larynx is described as a physiologically complex organ at the intersection of the upper respiratory tract and esophageal inlet, exposed to a variety of pathogens and noxious irritants and at risk for iatrogenic injury, so potential etiologies are very broad and include traumatic, infectious, inflammatory, neurologic, metabolic, neoplastic, congenital, and behavioral factors. The history should include duration, type of onset, potential inciting events, how the condition is affecting the patient, associated symptoms, modifying factors, current medications, habits, concurrent medical conditions, and prior surgery; careful evaluation allows the clinician to categorize dysphonia severity, develop a treatment plan, and prioritize patients who may need escalated care.

### Typical and atypical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome: time to retire the terms? [^111q2MR7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Studies indicate that symptoms labeled as "atypical" are more common in women evaluated for myocardial infarction (MI) and may contribute to the lower likelihood of a diagnosis and delayed treatment and result in poorer outcomes compared with men with MI. Atypical pain is frequently defined as epigastric or back pain or pain that is described as burning, stabbing, or characteristic of indigestion. Typical symptoms usually include chest, arm, or jaw pain described as dull, heavy, tight, or crushing. In a recent article published in the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Ferry and colleagues addressed presenting symptoms in men and women diagnosed with MI and reported that typical symptoms in women were more predictive of a diagnosis of MI than for men. A critical question is, are there really typical or atypical symptoms, and if so, who is the reference group? We propose that researchers and clinicians either discontinue using the terms typical and atypical or provide the reference group to which the terms apply (eg, men versus women). We believe it is past time to standardize the symptom assessment for MI so that proper and rapid diagnostic testing can be undertaken; however, we cannot standardize the symptom experience. When we do this, we are at risk of having study results, such as those of Ferry and colleagues, that vary from prior evidence and could lead to what the authors hope to avoid: disadvantaging women in receiving expeditious diagnostic testing and treatment for acute coronary syndrome.

In addition, important associations with internal diseases are discussed to assist clinicians in evaluating for a concurrent illness. Because treatment of these disorders may often require systemic therapy, the potential short-term and long-term effects of commonly used medications are discussed. Finally, treatment of recalcitrant diseases, mostly by use of therapies published in the form of small case series or reports, is also included to guide clinicians in dealing with the more challenging cases.

### Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis syndrome (PFAPA) or recurrent urinary tract infections: a case report [^114rVXYs]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Fever is the most frequent reason for medical consultation in children, and makes up 15–25% of all consultations in primary care and emergency departments. Recurrent fevers may be due to infectious or non-infectious causes. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is among the most common infections in children. Diagnosis of UTI in children can be challenging as it presents with variable and sometimes vague clinical signs and symptoms, and in some cases only fever may be the presenting sign.

In here we report a case of a 13 year-old girl who referred with an unusual presentation of fever and was misdiagnosed with recurrent UTI for the last 8 years.

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hidradenitis suppurativa is a severe and debilitating dermatologic disease. Clinical management is challenging and consists of both medical and surgical approaches, which must often be combined for best outcomes. Therapeutic approaches have evolved rapidly in the last decade and include the use of topical therapies, systemic antibiotics, hormonal therapies, and a wide range of immunomodulating medications. An evidence-based guideline is presented to support health care practitioners as they select optimal medical management strategies and is reviewed in this second part of the management guidelines. A therapeutic algorithm informed by the evidence available at the time of the review is provided.

### Practical multidisciplinary framework for the assessment and management of patients with unexplained chronic aerodigestive symptoms [^115qyRNk]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

UCTS: epidemiology and public health importance

Chronic throat symptoms listed in table 1 encompass persistent complaints (> 8 weeks) related to the throat, upper airway, voice or swallowing. Given the complex interactions between the aerodigestive structures and the symptom heterogeneity, multidisciplinary engagement is often necessitated. Differential diagnoses span various aerodigestive lesions and other structural pathologies (table 2). Typically, distinctive symptom insights within organic disease frameworks facilitate a targeted assessment strategy for the undifferentiated patient, which is influenced by presenting symptoms and pertinent patient factors such as medical history and smoking status. These relationships expedite the exclusion of malignant diseases, steering investigations towards the most relevant aetiologic considerations, which permits efficient care across diverse specialty realms.

Table 2
Structural and pathological causes of chronic throat symptoms

UCTS describe the scenario when no clear organic or structural pathology is identified despite thorough evaluations of the presenting complaints. The lack of standardised terminology for UCTS complicates accurate prevalence estimates. Table 3 summarises prevalence data reported for individual symptoms, alongside the proportion of cases labelled 'idiopathic' or 'functional' after investigation. These data suggest that no discernible structural pathology is evident in 31–93% of UCTS presentations, depending on the symptom and assessment method. Given the high prevalence of chronic throat symptoms in general populations, this supports estimates that UCTS may collectively account for 5–10% of total primary care visitsand precipitates significant numbers of referrals to otolaryngology, gastroenterology, respiratory and other specialty departments. However, inconsistent terminology for 'non-organic' throat symptoms and limited examinations may understate their true prevalence. While UCTS are generally considered benign, growing evidence of their impact on quality-of-lifeindicates a public health significance that may be under appreciated.

### Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor: clinical symptoms and course [^113jH3Q2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

A new type of hereditary angioedema was described recently. It was characterized by recurrent bouts of angioedema in various organs and normal C1 inhibitor and was observed mainly in women. Our aim was to conduct a detailed study of the clinical features of this condition.

Methods

A total of 138 patients with hereditary angioedema and normal C1 inhibitor who belonged to 43 unrelated families were examined through the use of standardized questionnaires.

Results

A majority of patients with hereditary angioedema and normal C1 inhibitor had skin swellings (92.8%), tongue swellings (53.6%), and abdominal pain attacks (50%). Laryngeal edema (25.4%) and uvular edema (21.7%) also were frequent, whereas edema episodes of other organs were rare (3.6%). Facial swellings and tongue involvement occurred considerably more frequently compared with hereditary angioedema caused by C1 inhibitor deficiency. The number of patients with recurrent edema of only 1 organ was higher than in classic hereditary angioedema. The number of patients with disease onset in adulthood was significantly higher in hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor compared with classic hereditary angioedema. Erythema marginatum was not observed. A subgroup of patients from families with coagulation factor XII mutations showed the same symptoms as the other patients.

Conclusions

Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor levels shows a characteristic pattern of clinical symptoms. The main clinical features include skin swellings, tongue swellings, and abdominal pain attacks. There are many differences in the clinical symptoms and course of disease between this type of hereditary angioedema and classic hereditary angioedema caused by a genetic C1 inhibitor deficiency.

### Behçet's disease in children, an overview [^113S6CeN]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Mucocutaneous lesions

Recurrent OU is not exceptional in the general paediatric population, but remains a major clue for the diagnosis of BD. ROU is the presenting symptom in 87 to 98% of cases and is present in almost all patients with BD (95%) (Table 4). BD-related OU do not differ from other OU. They are discrete, round or oval ulcers with a yellow-gray pseudomembranous base and a brightly erythematous halo (aphthae); they involve the lips, tongue, cheeks, and palate and disappear without scar. All variations are possible: single, multiple, herpetiform and necrotic, from minor to major. Lesions are painful and may interfere with eating, speaking, or swallowing. Minor lesions heal between 7 and 10 days but major lesions may evolve over weeks. When they are isolated, a large differential diagnosis is necessary to rule out numerous other causes of ROU, including autoinflammatory diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and immunodeficiency. OU may be the only manifestation of disease for an average of 6 to 7 years before the second major manifestation is apparent. GU is observed in 55 to 83% of children with BD, which is less than in the adult population (80 to 90%). In the PEDBD study they appeared at a mean (± SD) age of 11.23 ± 4.32 years. The lesions are usually larger and deeper than OA and have an irregular margin. They are located typically on the vulva and the scrotum; in children, skin aphthae over the perianal region has been observed in 7% of patients, and must be distinguished from anal aphthosis which is more related to IBD. In children, the combination of OU plus GU is not sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of BD. (Tables 1, 2 and 3). Other cutaneous symptoms are very frequent in BD; in the PEDBD cohort they appeared later than OU, at a mean age of 10.36 (± 4.30) years. Symptoms associated with PEDBD classification were necrotic folliculitis, and acneiform lesions more commonly in males, and erythema nodosum more commonly in females. These lesions appear often in combination and primarily involve the buttocks and the lower limbs. Other neutrophilic rashes may also be observed as well as lesions corresponding to superficial thrombosis (dermal nodules). The skin of patients with BD is irritable at puncture, minor trauma and shaving. The pathergy test, using a 24 gauge needle puncture, was formerly used to demonstrate skin hypersensitivity (pustula in 24 to 48 h). However the positivity of this test varies from 40 to 80% according to the studied population. The pathergy test is no longer mandatory to define BD in adults, and is not retained as a criterion for BD in children.

### Highlights of the updated Dutch evidence-and consensus-based guideline on psoriasis 2017 [^116zdY3h]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Topical therapy

Recommendations Topical corticosteroids are useful in the treatment of paediatric psoriasis, with class II–III potency recommended. Dependent on the disease severity, a combination with vitamin D3 analogues is recommended. Since the combination calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate contains a class III corticosteroid, it is recommended that this treatment be prescribed only for short‐term therapy (a maximum of 4 weeks) if possible.

For maintenance therapy vitamin D3 analogues (especially calcipotriol) are first choice, given the effect and favourable side‐effects. If necessary a class II corticosteroid can be added.

If, in recalcitrant psoriasis, a combination with class III steroid is necessary, intermittent use is strongly recommended.

Tacrolimus (0.03% or 0.1%) ointment is suggested to treat resistant psoriasis of the face and intertriginous folds. If treatment with (a combination of) topical corticosteroids or vitamin D3 analogues fails in paediatric psoriasis (and adherence is ensured), dithranol in a day care setting should be seriously considered before phototherapy or systemic therapy is started.

Phototherapy

Recommendations It is recommended that narrowband‐ultraviolet B phototherapy is only used to a limited extent in paediatric psoriasis. It should be used cautiously, particularly in young (age < 12 years) and in fair‐skinned children. It is the opinion of the guideline working group, that children should not be treated with home ultraviolet B. Given the proven carcinogenic effect, psoralen–ultraviolet A therapy is contraindicated in paediatric psoriasis.

Systemic therapy

Recommendations The effect of antibiotics in children with guttate psoriasis remains controversial. In the case of a suspect medical history of tonsillitis and positive throat culture, treatment with antibiotics can be considered.

Acitretin is suggested for paediatric psoriasis (including pustular or erythrodermic forms). Treatment in adolescent women is advised against because of the teratogenic potential of acitretin. Ciclosporin is recommended in exceptional situations and for short‐term treatment only, given the potential nephrotoxicity. Methotrexate is recommended in a dose range between 0.2 and 0.4 mg kg⁻¹ weekly. Folic acid 5–10 mg 24 h after ingestion of methotrexate is recommended. If fumarates are used for paediatric psoriasis, one should be aware of prolonged leucocytopenia/lymphocytopenia and follow the recommendations described in the section on fumarates in this guideline.

### Validation of the Spanish acute cystitis symptoms score (ACSS) in native Spanish-speaking women of Europe and Latin America [^112FkXb9]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 3a and 3b show the summary of scores of the patients and controls for each item of the domains "Typical", "Differential", and "QoL" of the ACSS questionnaire at baseline visit. The median punctuation in "Typical" score was 11.0 (9.0–13.0) [median (IQR)] in patients and 2.0 (0.0–6.5) in controls (p < 0.001). However, there was not a significant difference between patients and controls at baseline visit regarding the summary score of differential symptoms 1.0 (0.0–2.0) and 0.0 (0.0–1.5) (p = 0.381): The total score of ACSS for patients and controls was 16.0 (13.0–19.0) and 2.0 (0.0–6.5) (p < 0.001), respectively. The results for each symptom are reported in Table 4. When the results were stratified according to patients from Spain and Latin America, no differences were found in the typical, differential, and QoL symptoms. If the symptoms are analyzed individually, higher scores were found for frequency, hematuria in Spain, and incomplete bladder empty in Latin America (LATAM). Higher values in the impact of ITU–AC are reported in patients from LATAM (Table 5).

### Photosensitivity disorders in children: part II [^115DtDMY]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Photosensitivity disorders in children encompass a diverse group of diseases. Some inherited disorders manifest with photosensitivity early in life. Specific extracutaneous association may be the clue to diagnosis in this group of pediatric photodermatoses. Part II of this 2-part review covers hereditary photodermatoses caused by defects in nucleotide excision repair, double strand break repair, or localized or systemic biochemical abnormalities. Diagnosis and management of photoaggravated dermatoses are also discussed. Sun protection strategies are required in all patients with evidence of photosensitivity. Early recognition and prompt diagnosis is essential to minimize the long-term complications associated with inadequate photoprotection.

### Atypical ulcers [^116XJRqt]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Atypical ulcers of the skin challenge the dermatologist with respect to recognition, diagnosis, management, and treatment. The entire gamut of pathogenic categories including vascular, inflammatory, neoplastic, genetic, medication-related, and infectious processes may give rise to atypical ulcers. By definition, these ulcers are unusual, and accurate diagnosis may ultimately require the clinician to violate the dictum that "common things are common". Atypical ulcers may present with features that the clinician has not previously encountered, or may present with seemingly typical features that actually mislead due to phenotypic mimicry. Because skin ulcers are inherently tissue-destructive, and may reflect an underlying systemic disease process, there is heightened urgency to achieving an accurate diagnosis and initiating appropriate therapy.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^1117emon]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure, minimum erythema dose (MED), and vitamin D production — UVR exposure to the skin is measured as the minimum erythema dose (MED), and the amount of UVR exposure that is equivalent to 1 MED depends on skin pigmentation; an entire-body exposure to 1 MED is estimated to result in release of 10 000 to 20 000 IU of vitamin D into the circulation in 24 hours, while exposure of 40% of the body to one-fourth MED will result in generation of ∼1000 IU of vitamin D per day. UV-B (290–315 nm) has a shorter wavelength than UV-A (320–400 nm) and is prone to scatter with oblique rays earlier or later in the day; at solar noon, the time that enough UV-B photons reach the earth's surface to produce vitamin D in the skin is between 1000 and 1500 hours in the spring, summer, and the fall. In the southern United States at solar noon in the summer months, exposure time to achieve 1 MED is 4 to 10 minutes for pale skin and 60 to 80 minutes for dark skin.

Inhalation anthrax — clinical progression and imaging — Initial signs and symptoms are nonspecific and might include sore throat, mild fever, and muscle aches, which can be mistaken for upper respiratory infection. Approximately 2–3 days later, patients generally become progressively ill with severe respiratory symptoms and systemic deterioration, and chest radiograph often reveals the characteristic widened mediastinum.

### Ulceronecrotic rash in an immunocompetent individual [^111r96to]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

A 28-year-old woman presented with a 6-week history of a pustular rash that began on her ankles and spread upward. Two weeks prior to presentation, she began experiencing eye redness, swelling, and vision loss with enlarged lymph nodes and fatigue. Examination revealed ulcerated papules and plaques involving the face, shins, knees, and thighs (Fig 1). The palms and soles were spared. Postauricular and cervical lymphadenopathy was present, and there was bilateral periorbital edema with conjunctival injection (Fig 2). Punch biopsy demonstrated a lichenoid granulomatous dermatitis with plasma cells (Fig 3).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Pityriasis lichenoides
B. Malignant syphilis
C. Primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic T cell lymphoma
D. Ecthyma
E. Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME)
