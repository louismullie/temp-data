## Question

Low iron saturation and high ferritin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret low transferrin saturation with high ferritin and to outline a diagnostic and management plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what transferrin saturation and ferritin actually measure and how inflammation alters them. Then, I should verify the most likely pathophysiology for low TSAT with high ferritin. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and exclude iron overload syndromes. After that, I should confirm diagnostic criteria across key conditions such as CKD, heart failure, IBD, and preoperative states. Then, I will consider advanced markers and when to use them. Finally, I will outline management principles, including when to use IV iron, and close with a concise synthesis and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the basics: transferrin saturation reflects circulating iron availability and is calculated as serum iron divided by total iron-binding capacity, whereas ferritin reflects iron stores but is also an acute-phase reactant that rises with inflammation. Thus, discordance between low TSAT and high ferritin is common in inflammatory states and can mislead if interpreted in isolation [^1119Ki27] [^1133mjD8] [^116cC5xS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the pathophysiology. In inflammation, IL-6–driven hepcidin increases, which degrades ferroportin, traps iron in enterocytes and macrophages, lowers serum iron, and reduces TSAT, while ferritin rises as an acute-phase reactant, producing functional iron deficiency despite adequate or increased stores. This is the classic anemia of chronic disease/inflammation pattern and explains low TSAT with high ferritin [^116ir8de] [^117Pf2qx].

> I need to check the differential diagnosis carefully. The leading consideration is functional iron deficiency due to inflammation, but I must exclude absolute iron deficiency with inflammatory masking of ferritin, hereditary hemochromatosis or other iron overload syndromes, liver disease with hyperferritinemia, malignancy, and rare entities like ferroportin disease. Distinguishing these hinges on TSAT magnitude, ferritin level, liver enzymes, and clinical context, and I should double-check that TSAT is not high-normal or elevated, which would argue against pure functional deficiency [^116kXCsb] [^116cS6G1].

> Next, I should review condition-specific diagnostic thresholds to anchor the interpretation. In CKD, functional iron deficiency is supported by TSAT less than 20% with normal or elevated ferritin, and ferritin alone is unreliable. In heart failure, low TSAT identifies patients most likely to benefit from IV iron. In IBD, ferritin greater than 100 mcg/L with TSAT less than 20% supports anemia of chronic disease. In preoperative pathways, ferritin 30–100 mcg/L with TSAT less than 20% suggests iron-restricted erythropoiesis that may merit IV iron. And in general anemia, the AGA recommends a ferritin cutoff of 45 ng/mL rather than 15 ng/mL to improve sensitivity, acknowledging inflammation can elevate ferritin [^111CX2fR] [^111Ws2Lt] [^1162718v] [^114stzej] [^112knLuE].

> Wait, let me verify the role of advanced markers when standard tests are discordant or equivocal. Soluble transferrin receptor is less affected by inflammation and can help distinguish absolute from functional deficiency; reticulocyte hemoglobin content and percentage hypochromic red cells reflect iron-restricted erythropoiesis and predict response to IV iron; hepcidin, when available, is typically elevated in inflammation and low in absolute iron deficiency; and in complex hyperferritinemia, liver MRI for iron quantification can adjudicate iron overload versus inflammatory ferritin elevation, though access and cost vary [^116DvtSE] [^11536fLC] [^115fUwBF] [^114Zehy4].

> I will now examine management principles, but I need to ensure I tailor to the underlying condition. The cornerstone is to treat the cause of inflammation while repleting iron; oral iron is often ineffective in high-hepcidin states due to impaired absorption, so IV iron is preferred in functional iron deficiency, with multiple guidelines endorsing IV iron when TSAT is less than 20% even if ferritin is high, including in CKD, heart failure, IBD, and cancer-associated anemia; I should confirm that benefits include improved hemoglobin, reduced transfusion needs, and in heart failure, reduced hospitalizations when TSAT is low [^111vsMJh] [^114Kcnym] [^111Ws2Lt] [^116F4kbE] [^1128cbjK].

> But wait, what if ferritin is extremely high, for example above 500–800 ng/mL? Does IV iron still make sense? I should double-check the cautions: in CKD, KDIGO and KDOQI advise that a single course of IV iron can be considered with low TSAT even when ferritin exceeds 500 ng/mL, balancing risks and benefits, and in heart failure, emerging analyses suggest that low TSAT, not ferritin alone, identifies responders; nonetheless, I need to monitor closely for iron overload and infection risk, and consider MRI-based liver iron quantification if hyperferritinemia persists without clear inflammatory drivers [^114Kcnym] [^111Ws2Lt] [^114Zehy4].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Low TSAT with high ferritin in an inflamed patient most often reflects functional iron deficiency due to hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration; absolute iron deficiency may coexist, especially with ongoing blood loss, so I should integrate symptoms, CBC indices, CRP, and, when needed, sTfR or marrow response to a therapeutic iron trial to confirm; importantly, a hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L within about 2 weeks of iron therapy strongly supports true iron deficiency even if baseline studies were equivocal [^115bHVQo] [^1149wkcb].

> Next, I should review immediate next steps in practice. I need to check for sources of inflammation and blood loss, obtain CRP and a full iron panel including TSAT, ferritin, serum iron, TIBC, and transferrin, assess liver enzymes and consider HFE testing if hyperferritinemia with elevated TSAT suggests hemochromatosis, and in complex cases add sTfR or reticulocyte hemoglobin. If hyperferritinemia remains unexplained or severe, liver MRI for iron quantification can help differentiate overload from inflammatory ferritin elevation [^112knLuE] [^112dgQXJ] [^114Zehy4].

> Finally, I should confirm a concise clinical bottom line. Low TSAT with high ferritin typically signals functional iron deficiency from inflammation. Confirm with clinical context and, when needed, sTfR or reticulocyte indices. Prioritize IV iron to bypass hepcidin-mediated blockade while treating the underlying inflammatory driver. And remain vigilant for coexisting absolute iron deficiency or iron overload syndromes that would alter management, adjusting therapy based on response and safety monitoring [^111vsMJh] [^116DvtSE] [^111Ws2Lt] [^112knLuE].

Low iron saturation with high ferritin most often reflects **functional iron deficiency** due to inflammation or chronic disease [^116ir8de], where hepcidin-driven iron sequestration [^116cS6G1] causes low serum iron and low transferrin saturation despite adequate or elevated stores (ferritin is an acute-phase reactant) [^116DvtSE]. This pattern is common in CKD [^112KhNGz], heart failure [^112KhNGz], IBD [^notfound], and chronic infections [^116ir8de]. Less common causes include **iron overload syndromes** (e.g. hemochromatosis) [^1119Ki27] and **liver disease** [^1148Nv4C], where ferritin is high but transferrin saturation is typically normal or high. Evaluate with CRP/ESR, liver enzymes, and consider sTfR or hepcidin if inflammation is suspected [^116DvtSE]; treat the underlying cause and use IV iron for functional deficiency [^111vsMJh] [^116F4kbE].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** can explain the coexistence of low iron saturation and high ferritin:

---

### Functional iron deficiency (FID)

- **Definition**: FID occurs when iron stores are adequate or elevated, but iron is unavailable for erythropoiesis due to inflammation-driven hepcidin upregulation [^116cS6G1].
- **Hepcidin role**: Hepcidin, a hepatic hormone, increases during inflammation, inhibiting iron export from macrophages and enterocytes, thereby reducing circulating iron and transferrin saturation [^117Pf2qx].
- **Clinical context**: FID is common in chronic inflammatory conditions such as CKD [^112KhNGz], heart failure [^112KhNGz], IBD [^11189XPC], and chronic infections [^116ir8de].

---

### Anemia of chronic disease (ACD)

ACD is a normocytic, normochromic anemia characterized by low serum iron, low transferrin saturation, and normal or elevated ferritin [^116ir8de]. It results from cytokine-driven hepcidin upregulation, which sequesters iron in macrophages and reduces iron availability for erythropoiesis [^117Pf2qx].

---

### Iron overload syndromes

In hereditary hemochromatosis, **HFE mutations** cause excessive iron absorption and accumulation, typically with high transferrin saturation and high ferritin [^111JTGYM]. However, in early or treated cases, transferrin saturation may be normal or mildly elevated, while **ferritin remains high**. Secondary iron overload from **repeated transfusions** or chronic liver disease can also raise ferritin, though transferrin saturation is usually normal or high [^113umYba].

---

### Liver disease

Liver disease can elevate ferritin through increased synthesis and release from damaged hepatocytes [^11434Rag]. Transferrin saturation may be low due to impaired transferrin synthesis or altered iron metabolism [^1133mjD8].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with low iron saturation and high ferritin

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|-|
| Functional iron deficiency | Hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration | - CKD [^111CX2fR] <br/> - Heart failure [^111Ws2Lt] <br/> - IBD [^1162718v] <br/> - Chronic infections [^113VYsQK] |
| Anemia of chronic disease | Inflammation-induced iron sequestration | - Chronic inflammatory diseases <br/> - Malignancies <br/> - Autoimmune disorders [^notfound] |
| Iron overload syndromes | Excessive iron absorption or transfusion-related iron accumulation | - Hereditary hemochromatosis [^111JTGYM] <br/> - Transfusional iron overload [^113umYba] |
| Liver disease | Increased ferritin synthesis and altered iron metabolism | - Chronic hepatitis <br/> - Cirrhosis <br/> - NAFLD [^1148Nv4C] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

Accurate diagnosis requires a **comprehensive evaluation**:

- **Confirm iron studies**: Measure serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) [^111wbP4h].
- **Inflammatory markers**: Assess C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) to identify inflammation [^114G1cVV].
- **Liver function tests**: Evaluate liver enzymes and consider liver imaging if liver disease is suspected [^114SLmej].
- **Genetic testing**: Consider HFE gene testing if hereditary hemochromatosis is suspected [^113CLG4W].
- **Advanced markers**: Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and hepcidin levels can help differentiate absolute from functional iron deficiency [^115fUwBF].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Functional iron deficiency**: Treat underlying inflammation and consider intravenous iron therapy to bypass hepcidin-mediated blockade [^111BGSMm] [^116F4kbE].
- **Iron overload syndromes**: Phlebotomy or iron chelation therapy may be indicated [^113CLG4W].
- **Liver disease**: Address underlying liver pathology and monitor iron parameters closely [^1148Nv4C].

---

Low iron saturation with high ferritin typically reflects **functional iron deficiency** from inflammation, but iron overload and liver disease must be excluded. A structured evaluation — iron studies, inflammatory markers, liver tests, and selective genetic or advanced testing — guides diagnosis and management, with therapy tailored to the underlying cause [^111CX2fR] [^116kXCsb] [^114SLmej] [^116PBzzy].

### An association between plasma ferritin concentrations measured 48 h after delivery and postpartum depression [^111Nx9wW]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional problem experienced by childbearing women, and postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common psychiatric disorder seen during the first year after delivery. The possible link between iron deficiency and PPD is not clear.

Objective

To evaluate whether iron status 48 h after delivery was associated with PPD. Our hypothesis was that iron deficiency would be associated with PPD.

Design

This was a prospective cohort study of depression-free women studied in the postpartum period.

Setting

Women who give birth at obstetric units in several general hospitals in Spain.

Participants

A subsample of 729 women was included in the present study after exclusion of women with high C-reactive protein (CRP) and other diseases known to interfere with iron metabolism.

Main Outcome Measures

We evaluated depressive symptoms at 48 h, 8 weeks and 32 weeks postpartum and used a diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnosis of major depression. A blood sample obtained 48 h after delivery was used to measure the following iron storage parameters: ferritin, transferrin (Tf), free iron and transferrin saturation (TfS) and the inflammatory marker CCRP.

Results

Overall, the women in the study had low iron concentrations (8.8 ± 6.9 μmol/L) and low TfS (12.6 ± 9.6%) but normal ferritin and Tf concentrations. A total of 65 women (9%) developed PPD during the 32 week postpartum period; these women also had a lower ferritin concentration (15.4 ± 12.7 μg/L vs. 21.6 ± 13.5 μg/L, P = 0.002). A strong association between ferritin and PPD was observed (odds ratio = 3.73, 95% CI: 1.84–7.56; P = 0.0001 for ferritin cutoff value of 7.26 μg/L). In our study, ferritin concentrations have a high specificity but low sensitivity in predicting PPD.

Conclusions

These findings support the role of iron in the etiology of PPD and the use of ferritin as a marker of iron deficiency in the postpartum period. We believe that this topic deserves further investigation.

### Disorders of iron metabolism. part II: iron deficiency and iron overload [^116cS6G1]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

MAIN DISORDERS OF IRON METABOLISM: Increased iron requirements, limited external supply, and increased blood loss may lead to iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anaemia. In chronic inflammation, the excess of hepcidin decreases iron absorption and prevents iron recycling, resulting in hypoferraemia and iron restricted erythropoiesis, despite normal iron stores (functional iron deficiency), and finally anaemia of chronic disease (ACD), which can evolve to ACD plus true ID (ACD+ID). In contrast, low hepcidin expression may lead to hereditary haemochromatosis (HH type I, mutations of the HFE gene) and type II (mutations of the hemojuvelin and hepcidin genes). Mutations of transferrin receptor 2 lead to HH type III, whereas those of the ferroportin gene lead to HH type IV. All these syndromes are characterised by iron overload. As transferrin becomes saturated in iron overload states, non-transferrin bound iron appears. Part of this iron is highly reactive (labile plasma iron), inducing free radical formation. Free radicals are responsible for the parenchymal cell injury associated with iron overload syndromes. ROLE OF LABORATORY TESTING IN DIAGNOSIS: In iron deficiency status, laboratory tests may provide evidence of iron depletion in the body or reflect iron deficient red cell production. Increased transferrin saturation and/or ferritin levels are the main cues for further investigation of iron overload. The appropriate combination of different laboratory tests with an integrated algorithm will help to establish a correct diagnosis of iron overload, iron deficiency and anaemia. REVIEW OF TREATMENT OPTIONS: Indications, advantages and side effects of the different options for treating iron overload (phlebotomy and iron chelators) and iron deficiency (oral or intravenous iron formulations) will be discussed.

### Iron deficiency in adults: a review [^111vsMJh]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Absolute iron deficiency, defined as low iron stores with or without anemia, affects approximately 2 billion people worldwide and 14% of adults in the US. Iron-deficiency anemia, defined as low hemoglobin due to low iron stores, affects approximately 1.2 billion people worldwide, including 10 million in the US.

Observations

Absolute iron deficiency progresses from low iron stores to iron-deficiency anemia. Individuals with nonanemic iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anemia may be asymptomatic or experience fatigue, irritability, depression, difficulty concentrating, restless legs syndrome (32%-40%), pica (40%-50%), dyspnea, lightheadedness, exercise intolerance, and worsening heart failure (HF). Symptom prevalences vary depending on age, comorbidities (eg, chronic kidney disease [CKD], HF), and severity and rate of development of iron deficiency. The most common causes of iron deficiency are bleeding (menstrual, gastrointestinal), impaired iron absorption (atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, bariatric surgical procedures), inadequate dietary iron intake, and pregnancy. In high-income countries, approximately 38% of nonpregnant, reproductive-age women have iron deficiency without anemia and about 13% have iron-deficiency anemia. During the third trimester of pregnancy, iron deficiency affects up to 84% of pregnant women, based on data from high-income countries. Additional risk factors include use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD [13%-90%]), and other chronic inflammatory conditions, such as CKD (24%-85%), HF (37%-61%), and cancer (18%-82%). Testing for iron deficiency is indicated for patients with anemia and/or symptoms of iron deficiency (fatigue, pica, or restless legs syndrome) and should be considered for those with risk factors such as heavy menstrual bleeding, pregnancy, or IBD. Iron deficiency is diagnosed by low serum ferritin (typically < 30 ng/mL) in individuals without inflammatory conditions or by transferrin saturation (iron/total iron binding capacity×100) less than 20%. Causes of iron deficiency should be identified and treated. Oral iron (ferrous sulfate 325 mg/d or on alternate days) is typically first-line therapy. Intravenous iron is indicated for patients with oral iron intolerance, poor absorption (celiac disease, post-bariatric surgical procedure), chronic inflammatory conditions (CKD, HF, IBD, cancer), ongoing blood loss, and during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia are common conditions that may cause symptoms such as fatigue, exercise intolerance, and difficulty concentrating. Ferritin and/or transferrin saturation are required for diagnosis and screening. Oral iron is first-line therapy for most patients. Intravenous iron is used for individuals who do not tolerate or have impaired absorption of oral iron, those with ongoing blood loss, certain chronic inflammatory conditions (IBD, CKD, HF, cancer), and during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

### Ferric gluconate treatment provides cost savings in patients with high ferritin and low transferrin saturation [^111JCZb6]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

A subgroup of hemodialysis patients experience high serum ferritin and low tansferrin saturation for reasons not clearly understood. Here we determined the economic impact of administering sodium ferric gluconate complex to patients with serum ferritin levels higher than 500 ng/ml and a transferrin saturation less than 25% based on the Dialysis Patients Response to IV Iron with Elevated Ferritin (DRIVE) study and its extension, DRIVE II. A cost effectiveness model was developed, consistent with the DRIVE studies, using decision analysis with a 12-week time horizon. The primary effectiveness measure was the mean hemoglobin increase in the intent to treat patient groups comparing epoetin with or without sodium ferric gluconate complex. Costs were computed using projected 2007 US Medicare reimbursements for the treatments and for serious adverse events, with the effectiveness factored by the increase in hemoglobin. The net savings for sodium ferric gluconate complex plus epoetin treatment was $1390 compared to epoetin alone for each g/dl hemoglobin increase over 12 weeks of study. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the impact of change in the variables (using medians or means and actual 2005 or projected 2007 Medicare reimbursements) and these affirmed the robustness of the model. Our study shows that treatment of patients with high ferritin and low transferrin saturation levels, as defined in DRIVE, with sodium ferric gluconate complex and epoetin resulted in significant savings compared to epoetin alone.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### Molecular pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease [^116ir8de]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Most patients suffering from chronic infections, chronic inflammatory diseases, and some malignancies develop a mild to moderate anemia designated anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation. Patients with this anemia have low serum iron, low to normal transferrin, and high to normal serum ferritin concentration. The anemia is caused by increased inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6, inducing increased production of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin by hepatocytes. Hepcidin blocks the release of iron from macrophages, hepatocytes, and enterocytes, causing the characteristic hypoferremia associated with this anemia and iron-deprivation of the developing erythrocytes.

### Assessing iron status: beyond serum ferritin and transferrin saturation [^116DvtSE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of multiple comorbidities among anemic patients with chronic kidney disease has made the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation more challenging in diagnosing iron deficiency. Because serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and because the inflammatory state may inhibit the mobilization of iron from reticuloendothelial stores, the scenario of patients with serum ferritin > 800 ng/ml, suggesting iron overload, and transferrin saturation < 20%, suggesting iron deficiency, has become more common. This article revisits the basis for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommendations regarding the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in guiding iron therapy, then explores some of the newer alternative markers for iron status that may be useful when serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are insufficient. These newer tests include reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, and soluble transferrin receptor, all of which have shown some promise in limited studies. Finally, the role of hepcidin, a hepatic polypeptide, in the pathophysiology of iron mobilization is reviewed briefly.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^112Vtput]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### Disrupted iron regulation in the brain and periphery in cocaine addiction [^111XYCV5]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Iron dysregulation in the periphery in cocaine addiction

We found evidence of dysregulation of peripheral iron metabolism in our CUD sample with significantly reduced levels of iron and transferrin saturation (Table 1). Given that transferrin is the major iron transporter protein, one would anticipate increased rather than decreased transferrin saturation in mild iron deficiency. However, during acute inflammation (as reflected by increased CRP levels, and abnormal eosinophil, lymphocyte and neutrophil counts), ferritin levels may increase disproportionately due to hepatic ferritin production, while iron release remains proportionate to the cellular ferritin content, resulting in low transferrin saturation as seen in the present study. The rather modest increase in ferritin during inflammation in CUD patients further supports the notion of peripheral iron dysregulation.

As iron crosses the blood–brain barrier bound to transferrin, the correlation between peripheral transferrin saturation and low iron levels in the red nucleus in CUD patients also concurs with the notion of peripheral iron deficiency (Figure 2c). In conditions of iron overload, the exact opposite pattern has been reported, namely excessive iron accumulation in the red nucleus and increased transferrin saturation in the periphery.

A possible mediating role of peripheral inflammation in central iron accumulation?

Given that we see elevated serum CRP and ferritin levels in the CUD, it may be that inflammation is a mediator of the increased iron brain iron concentration. Although we found no significant correlations between CRP levels and QSM, this does not rule out this possibility, as QSM cannot separately detect the ferritin-isoform, which is associated with inflammation. Ferritin has two dominant isoforms, light polypeptide (-ferritin) and heavy polypeptide (H-ferritin). H-ferritin has a critical regulatory role in iron metabolism, whereas the physically more stable-ferritin is more involved in iron storage of iron.H-ferritin is involved myelination and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)and predominates in the young adult brain. However with aging,-ferritin levels in the brain increase with the accumulation of myelin debris and the breakdown of neuromelalin, and-ferritin is thought to play a critical role in neurodegeneration. To examine the association between iron accumulation in the brain and inflammation, it is necessary to specifically measureferritin, which is not possible at present with QSM, and this remains an important area of future research.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^1149wkcb]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Definitions

3. We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

4. We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

5. We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia

The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO defined lower limits.

There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines in the UK for suspected lower GI cancer suggest that IDA with an Hb concentration < 110 g/L in men or < 100 g/L in non-menstruating women warrants fast-track referral. These cut-off values will however miss some cases of colorectal cancer, especially in men. It is therefore advised that investigation should be considered at any level of anaemia in the presence of iron deficiency, though the case is stronger in those with more severe degrees of anaemia, as they are more likely to have serious underlying GI pathology.

### What do we know about micronutrients in critically ill patients? A narrative review [^115fUwBF]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Plasma concentrations in critically ill patients

Critical illness alters iron metabolism, and its specific requirements during ICU stay are not well defined.

Ferroptosis

Acute disease can disrupt the redox systems, causing intracellular iron overload and lipid peroxide accumulation in ferroptosis, an iron‐dependent, nonapoptotic cell death. Ferroptosis has been linked to sepsis, viral infections, and ALI, and may contribute to multiorgan dysfunction in practically every ICU patient.

Anemia

Anemia may affect up to 90% of ICU patients, requiring blood transfusion in 15%–35%. The two leading causes of iron‐related anemia are
Iron deficiency anemia: absolute iron deficiency owing to poor intake/adsorption or increased loss owing to phlebotomiesand hemorrhages, affecting 20%–40% of ICU patients.
Anemia of inflammation: Inflammation causes iron storage in the macrophages to reduce redox stress and hide iron from infectious pathogens, leading to iron‐deficient erythropoiesis independently from erythropoietin levels.

The most used biomarkers to determine iron status are iron plasma levels, ferritin, and transferrin, which enable the calculation of transferrin saturation. These are highly affected by inflammation and poorly differentiate between anemia because of inflammation or iron deficiency in acute phases of disease. The newer biomarkers hepcidin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) are expensive but increasingly available; they are less affected by inflammation, making these biomarkers promising in critically ill patients. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed by microcytic hypochromic anemia, increased sTfR, and reduced ferritin and hepcidin levels. Anemia of inflammation is diagnosed by normocytic normochromic anemia, normal sTfR, and increased ferritin and hepcidin levels. Anemia of inflammation in patients with non–iron deficiency anemia develops within 8 days of ICU admission.

Low plasma iron levels and iron deficiency are associated with worsening of chronic cardiac dysfunction. Decreased hepcidin levels are associated with ICU mortality. At ICU discharge, hemoglobin (Hb) < 100 g/L affects up to 53.3% of patients and persists in 46% at hospital discharge and up to 12 months later. Post‐ICU anemia correlates with increased ICU readmission rates, prolonged hospital length of stay, increased mortality, and lower quality of life,(see Table S20).

### The diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1148Nv4C]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Initial evaluation of suspected NAFLD — diagnostic requirements and laboratory considerations specify that the diagnosis of NAFLD requires that there is HS by imaging or histology, no significant alcohol consumption, no competing etiologies for HS, and no coexisting causes of CLD; if serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are elevated, genetic hemochromatosis should be excluded, and although the data are somewhat conflicting, serum ferritin > 1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN) was associated with more advanced fibrosis in a retrospective cohort of 628 adults; mutations in the HFE gene occur with variable frequency and the clinical significance is unclear; liver biopsy should be considered in the setting of high ferritin and a high iron saturation; low‑titer autoantibodies are common and often prompt biopsy to exclude autoimmune disease, and in a study of 864 NAFLD subjects, significant autoantibody elevations (antinuclear antibodies > 1:160 or antismooth muscle antibodies > 1:40) were present in 21% and were not associated with more advanced disease or atypical histological features.

### Hereditary hemochromatosis: rapid evidence review [^1169ycLm]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that disrupts iron homeostasis, resulting in systemic iron overload. It is the most common inherited disorder among people of northern European ancestry. Despite the high prevalence of the gene mutation, there is a low and variable clinical penetrance. The deposition of excess iron into parenchymal cells leads to cellular dysfunction and the clinical manifestations of the disease. The liver, pancreas, joints, heart, skin, and pituitary gland are the most commonly involved organs. Hereditary hemochromatosis is usually diagnosed in the 40s or 50s. Women are often diagnosed later than men, likely because of menstrual blood loss. There is no typical presentation or pathognomonic signs and symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis. Because of increased awareness and earlier diagnosis, the end-organ damage secondary to iron overload is not often seen in clinical practice. A common initial presentation is an asymptomatic patient with mildly elevated liver enzymes who is subsequently found to have elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. Ferritin levels greater than 300 ng per mL for men and 200 ng per mL for women and transferrin saturations greater than 45% are highly suggestive of hereditary hemochromatosis. Phlebotomy is the mainstay of treatment and can help improve heart function, reduce abnormal skin pigmentation, and lessen the risk of liver complications. Liver transplantation may be considered in select patients. Individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal and breast cancers. Genetic testing for the hereditary hemochromatosis genes should be offered after 18 years of age to first-degree relatives of patients with the condition.

### Iron status in patients with chronic heart failure [^111nAg2o]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

The changes in iron status occurring during the course of heart failure (HF) and the underlying pathomechanisms are largely unknown. Hepcidin, the major regulatory protein for iron metabolism, may play a causative role. We investigated iron status in a broad spectrum of patients with systolic HF in order to determine the changes in iron status in parallel with disease progression, and to associate iron status with long-term prognosis.

Methods and Results

Serum concentrations of ferritin, transferrin saturation (Tsat), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and hepcidin were assessed as the biomarkers of iron status in 321 patients with chronic systolic HF [age: 61 ± 11 years, men: 84%, left ventricular ejection fraction: 31 ± 9%, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class: 72/144/87/18] at a tertiary cardiology centre and 66 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. Compared with healthy subjects, asymptomatic HF patients had similar haematological status, but increased iron stores (evidenced by higher serum ferritin without distinct inflammation, P < 0.01) with markedly elevated serum hepcidin (P < 0.001). With increasing HF severity, patients in advanced NYHA classes had iron deficiency (ID) (reduced serum ferritin, low Tsat, high sTfR), iron-restricted erythropoiesis (reduced haemoglobin, high red cell distribution width), and inflammation (high serum high-sensitivity-C-reactive protein and interleukin 6), which was accompanied by decreased circulating hepcidin (all P < 0.001). In multivariable Cox models, low hepcidin was independently associated with increased 3-year mortality among HF patients (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Increased level of circulating hepcidin characterizes an early stage of HF, and is not accompanied by either anaemia or inflammation. The progression of HF is associated with the decline in circulating hepcidin and the development of ID. Low hepcidin independently relates to unfavourable outcome.

### Transferrin saturation and serum ferritin are main predictors of liver iron content in subjects with hyperferritinemia [^114Zehy4]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Hyperferritinemia is widespread and is caused by or associated with a variety of diseases requiring complex diagnostic workup. Magnetic resonance imaging-based liver iron quantification (LIC MRI) can differentiate subjects with iron overload requiring treatment but is still limited to specialized centers and costly. We aimed to determine whether parameters belonging to the diagnostic setting of hyperferritinemia could lead to a more selective use of LIC MRI.

Methods

We enrolled a cohort of 570 subjects with hyperferritinemia from a tertiary hospital center. They underwent full clinical and laboratory evaluation, and LIC MRI. We applied a partitioning tree to explore which features were relevant in classifying LIC MRI, severity from grade 1 to 3.

Results

A total of 66.1% had LIC MRI ≤ 3 mg/g (grade 1), while 11.2% had LIC MRI above 7 mg/g (grade 3). The partitioning tree model showed a global accuracy of 78% (95% confidence interval, 74%-81%) in predicting the severity of LIC MRI in the entire series. Sensitivity and specificity were high to distinguish patients with grade 1 from those with grade 3 but not from patients with grade 2. Focusing on the LIC MRI threshold of 7 mg/g, we found that transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≥ 60% and TSAT < 60% with serum ferritin ≥ 963 μg/L correctly classified 61 (95.3%) subjects with grade 3 LIC MRI to class 3. Based on these cutoffs, 193 subjects with LIC MRI grade 1 and 2 were also selected for LIC MRI assessment, while 316 patients (55.4%) would be addressed to follow-up.

Conclusions

TSAT and serum ferritin allow us to identify more than 95% of patients with a LIC MRI grade 3 and reduce MRI requirements by more than 50%.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113CLG4W]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Iron-overload cardiomyopathy — diagnosis and initial management begin with serological testing, where serum transferrin saturation (serum iron/total iron binding capacity of > 45%) and elevated serum ferritin > 200 µg/L in men or > 150 µg/L in women supports the diagnosis; if HH is suspected, especially with a known family history, testing for the HH genotype should be performed. Diagnosis of cardiac iron overload is possible with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in which a decreased T2 signal correlates with myocardial iron infiltration and depressed left ventricular function. The established treatment for HH is phlebotomy, and in secondary iron overload, there is a role for chelation therapy.

Elevated ferritin and HFE mutations — mildly elevated serum ferritin is common in patients with NAFLD and it does not necessarily indicate increased iron stores; persistently high serum ferritin and increased iron saturation, especially in the context of homozygote or heterozygote C282Y HFE mutations may warrant a liver biopsy (Strength – 1, Evidence - B).

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111CX2fR]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider using a transferrin saturation < 20% and a normal or elevated ferritin level to define functional iron deficiency in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD or maintained on peritoneal dialysis and in those receiving hemodialysis. Recognize that normal or high serum ferritin values do not exclude iron deficiency, as it could be due to other causes such as infection or inflammation.

### Vasculo-toxic and pro-inflammatory action of unbound haemoglobin, haem and iron in transfusion-dependent patients with haemolytic anaemias [^113umYba]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

A first result was that circulating Hb/haem levels increased in all three haemolytic diseases independently of the underlying haemolytic mechanism. This implies that irrespective whether haemolysis occurs extra‐ (within tissues) or intra‐vascularly, Hb and haem reach the circulation, saturating plasma scavengers and giving rise to 'free' NHBHb and NHBH (Fig 8D). Most patients with SPH had lower circulating Hb/haem levels, suggesting a reduced haemolysis rate compared to patients with β‐thal and SCD (Fig 1).

We further show that systemic iron levels, Tf saturation and NTBI are increased according to transfusion burden, being more elevated in patients with β‐thal than in patients with SCD and SPH (Fig 2). The majority of previous studies showed a reduction of hepcidin in β‐thal. 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 In the present study, we observed increased hepcidin levels, suggesting that transfusional iron overload (Fig 3) dominates over hepcidin regulatory signals induced by anaemia and ineffective erythropoiesis (EPO, erythroferrone) in these β‐thal cohorts. The discrepancy is likely explained by the severe transfusional iron overload indicated by very high serum ferritin levels (average 3763 ng/ml) in the present β‐thal cohort compared to most β‐thal cohorts analysed previously where ferritin levels were lower (< 1000 ng/ml). Similarly to our present study, Rashidy et al. 79 observed high hepcidin in patients with β‐thal associated with elevated ferritin levels (average 2451 ng/ml). Indeed, transfusions acutely induce hepcidin expression in patients with β‐thal major by triggering a temporary suppression of erythropoiesis and by causing iron accumulation. Persistent hepcidin elevation likely reflects iron overload due to inadequate chelation and poor compliance in our present cohort. Despite absolute high hepcidin levels, these are inadequately low when compared to the iron burden, as suggested by the low hepcidin–ferritin ratio in patients with β‐thal compared to healthy subjects (Fig 3D). Elevated erythropoietic activity and iron demand likely account for inappropriately low hepcidin induction. Overall, these data indicate that in transfused patients with β‐thal hepcidin levels result from the combined effect of ineffective erythropoiesis and transfusional iron overload. In SCD, hepcidin modulation is controversial: previous studies showed either increased or reduced hepcidin levels. Kroot et al. 70 showed that in four of nine patients with HbSS SCD hepcidin levels were decreased compared to control subjects, which was attributed to increased erythropoietic activity. In agreement with this study Karafin et al. 71 has proven that while erythropoietic drive, iron status, and inflammation all contribute to the control of hepcidin levels, the strongest contributor is the erythropoietic drive. Therefore, low hepcidin values were found in patients with high reticulocyte percentage and EPO. Consistently, hepcidin levels were reduced and EPO was increased in our present SCD cohorts, suggesting that enhanced erythropoietic activity overrides iron burden and inflammation in the regulation of hepcidin and has a key role in triggering iron overload in SCD (Fig 3). The observation of comparable NTBI levels in the two SCD cohorts suggests that NTBI may not only result from iron overload due to simple transfusions, but are likely explained by reduced hepcidin levels in patients with SCD receiving exchange transfusions.

### Testing practices, interpretation, and diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US primary care physicians [^115HMvHZ]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Interpretation of Laboratory Studies

To assess PCPs' choices for additional laboratory tests to be performed for evaluation of IDA, respondents were presented with a hypothetical scenario of a 65-year-old man reporting generalized fatigue who had a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0) and mean corpuscular volume of 72.3 fL (to convert to μm³, divide by 1.0). Measurement of ferritin level, the most specific marker of iron deficiency, was the most common laboratory test recommended by respondents (302 of 325 [92.9%]), followed by total iron-binding capacity and transferrin saturation (278 of 325 [85.5%]).

To assess PCPs' interpretation of iron laboratory studies, respondents were presented with a series of laboratory values and asked to determine whether the anemia resulted from iron deficiency or an alternate cause. For scenarios in which ferritin level and transferrin saturation were concordantly low or normal, respondents correctly identified the cause with more than 93% accuracy: 321 of 325 respondents (98.8%) correctly attributed anemia to iron deficiency in the presence of a low transferrin saturation (6%) and a low ferritin level (11 ng/mL), and 303 of 325 (93.2%) correctly attributed anemia to an alternate cause in the presence of a normal transferrin saturation (30%) and a normal ferritin level (150 ng/mL) (Figure 2). However, in scenarios of discordant ferritin and transferrin saturation values, diagnostic accuracy decreased. For example, in a scenario with a normal transferrin saturation (25%) but low ferritin level (6 ng/mL), 44 of 325 respondents (13.5%) misidentified the cause as something other than iron deficiency even though the likelihood ratio for iron deficiency with a ferritin level less than 15 ng/mL is 51.9. In a scenario with a low transferrin saturation (2%) but borderline low ferritin level (40 ng/mL), 86 of 325 respondents (26.5%) did not consider IDA as the cause even though the likelihood ratio for iron deficiency with a transferrin saturation less than 5% is 10.5. In that scenario, 239 of 325 respondents (73.5%) correctly identified the scenario as IDA. There were no statistically significant differences in correct interpretation of these scenarios by academic affiliation status, gender, stage in clinical practice, or practice of ordering ferritin level measurement for anemia evaluation.

### Testing practices, interpretation, and diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US primary care physicians [^1135e9FE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this nationally representative survey study of internal medicine PCPs, we found substantial variation in the management of anemia. Specifically, we found self-reported evidence of both overuse of screening CBCs (76.9% of respondents) and underuse of bidirectional endoscopy in patients with IDA. Certain knowledge gaps also existed in the interpretation of discordant laboratory test results, which may contribute to diagnostic errors. Specifically, 26.5% of respondents misdiagnosed a scenario of IDA as anemia with an alternate cause despite a low transferrin saturation (2%) and a borderline low ferritin level (40 ng/mL). Several subtle but important nuances in interpretation of these studies may contribute to errors, including the high specificity of a low ferritin level (98% specific for iron deficiency with a ferritin level ≤ 12 ng/mL), the potential for the ferritin level to be normal or elevated in inflammatory states when a patient is iron deficient, and the importance of measuring serum iron level in a fasting state to avoid potential confounders of dietary or supplemental iron. Given the relatively high baseline prevalence of anemia of 5.6% in the US, incorrect interpretation of these laboratory results may lead to a substantial number of missed or delayed diagnoses of IDA and, by extension, potential delays in diagnosis of GI tract malignant neoplasm.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^112XZNNU]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

We also assessed requests for additional iron studies accompanying ferritin testing (within ± 1 week), considering iron studies often mentioned in international and local clinical guidelines for iron deficiency,: serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation, and soluble transferrin receptor. To further examine concomitant testing, we considered all patients of the study cohort who received ferritin testing during the study period and considered the presence of hemoglobin and CRP accompanying the first ferritin test recorded during the study period as 2 distinct binary outcomes. We fitted mixed-effects logistic regression models using the R package lme4to assess the associations of each outcome with the same determinants and random effects as for ferritin. Associations are expressed as adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with corresponding 95% CIs.

### Iron deficiency anaemia [^115LH3LE]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Anaemia affects roughly a third of the world's population; half the cases are due to iron deficiency. It is a major and global public health problem that affects maternal and child mortality, physical performance, and referral to health-care professionals. Children aged 0–5 years, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women are particularly at risk. Several chronic diseases are frequently associated with iron deficiency anaemia — notably chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. Measurement of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum soluble transferrin receptors, and the serum soluble transferrin receptors-ferritin index are more accurate than classic red cell indices in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia. In addition to the search for and treatment of the cause of iron deficiency, treatment strategies encompass prevention, including food fortification and iron supplementation. Oral iron is usually recommended as first-line therapy, but the most recent intravenous iron formulations, which have been available for nearly a decade, seem to replenish iron stores safely and effectively. Hepcidin has a key role in iron homoeostasis and could be a future diagnostic and therapeutic target. In this Seminar, we discuss the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and acute management of iron deficiency anaemia, and outstanding research questions for treatment.

### Loss of erythroblasts in acute myeloid leukemia causes iron redistribution with clinical implications [^116ANAfZ]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with poor prognosis and limited treatment strategies. Determining the role of cell-extrinsic regulators of leukemic cells is vital to gain clinical insights into the biology of AML. Iron is a key extrinsic regulator of cancer, but its systemic regulation remains poorly explored in AML. To address this question, we studied iron metabolism in patients with AML at diagnosis and explored the mechanisms involved using the syngeneic MLL-AF9-induced AML mouse model. We found that AML is a disorder with a unique iron profile, not associated with inflammation or transfusion, characterized by high ferritin, low transferrin, high transferrin saturation (TSAT), and high hepcidin. The increased TSAT in particular, contrasts with observations in other cancer types and in anemia of inflammation. Using the MLL-AF9 mouse model of AML, we demonstrated that the AML-induced loss of erythroblasts is responsible for iron redistribution and increased TSAT. We also show that AML progression is delayed in mouse models of systemic iron overload and that elevated TSAT at diagnosis is independently associated with increased overall survival in AML. We suggest that TSAT may be a relevant prognostic marker in AML.

KDOQI commentary — IV iron at high ferritin. KDIGO notes that IV iron "should not routinely be administered" when ferritin is consistently > 500 ng/ml, yet cites allowance in selected patients for "a single course of up to 1,000 mg" even with ferritin ≥ 500 ng/ml after considering risks. The commentary highlights data that intravenous iron given to patients with ferritin > 500 ng/mL reduced ESA doses and costs, and states a therapeutic trial of IV iron (or oral iron in CKD ND) "should be considered when TSAT is low (≤ 30%), even if ferritin concentration is above 500 ng/mL". It also states "there are currently no data available that suggest long-term IV iron administration in moderate doses causes worse outcomes", and that "Hb response to iron therapy, TSAT, and ferritin should be monitored closely and further iron therapy titrated accordingly".

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Erythropoietin (Procrit) [^116Zov3Q]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosing Information

Evaluation of Iron Stores and Nutritional Factors

Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

Monitoring of Response to Therapy

Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g., vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc.) before initiating PROCRIT. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

Selection of Formulation

In pregnant women, lactating women, neonates, and infants use only single-dose vials (the benzyl alcohol-free formulation) [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2, and 8.4)].

2.2 Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease

In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of PROCRIT sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks of death and other serious cardiovascular adverse reactions [see Boxed Warning and Clinical Studies (14)].

### Should serum transferrin saturation Be included as a therapeutic target in addition to serum ferritin in treating HFE-hemochromatosis? [^113Gvcb6]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In HFE-hemochromatosis, transferrin saturation (TSAT) indirectly reflects plasma non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), which drives iron overload and tissue damage. TSAT above ~75% suggests harmful NTBI levels. Despite its clinical relevance, NTBI remains understudied due to the limitations of current assays. High TSAT levels persist during maintenance therapy, yet some guidelines omit TSAT monitoring, though it correlates with symptoms like fatigue and joint pain. Monitoring TSAT may improve outcomes. Randomized trials comparing ferritin-only versus ferritin-plus-TSAT-guided treatment are needed. Consideration should be given to approaches that minimize plasma NTBI in managing and monitoring patients with hemochromatosis. Until reliable NTBI testing has been established, TSAT should be included in the management of HFE-hemochromatosis.

### Iron parameters determine the prognosis of critically ill patients [^113Kvmyd]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Because iron is both an essential and toxic micronutrient influencing the development of microbial infections, we evaluated the usefulness of iron parameters as outcome predictors in ICU patients.

Design

Prospective clinical single-center non-interventional study.

Setting

General internal medicine ICU; German University hospital.

Patients

One hundred and twelve septic and 43 nonseptic ICU patients, 156 healthy blood donors.

Measurements and Main Results

Serum iron parameters at admission were correlated with short and long term mortality in ICU subjects. Both hepcidin and ferritin concentrations were significantly elevated in ICU patients compared with blood donors and were the highest in septic patients. On the contrary, serum iron and transferrin levels were decreased in ICU subjects with lowest values among septic patients. Hepcidin values correlated with ferritin levels, and serum iron correlated strongly with transferrin saturation. A moderate correlation of hepcidin, ferritin, and transferrin with inflammatory parameters was noted. Both short- and long-term survivors displayed higher ferritin/transferrin levels and lower transferrin saturation. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, low iron levels (cutoff 10.5 μmol/mL), low transferrin saturation (cutoff 55%), and high serum transferrin concentrations (cutoff 1.6g/L) were associated with short- and long-term survival. In the subgroup of septic ICU subjects, low iron levels and transferrin saturation went along with a nonlethal outcome.

Conclusions

Our findings demonstrate that parameters of iron metabolism, particularly transferrin saturation, that reflect serum iron availability, are strong outcome predictors in ICU patients. These data suggest that a failure of iron homeostasis with increased iron availability in serum occurs in lethally ill ICU patients and should trigger prospective clinical trials evaluating the usefulness of iron-chelating therapy in critical illness and sepsis.

### Avoid using hemoglobin to evaluate patients for iron… [^11238wtk]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron depletion is a progressive process with anemia as the final phase. Thus, screening for iron deficiency using hemoglobin will only identify the most severe cases. Moreover, hemoglobin is not specific for iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide. Prevalence of iron deficiency in U. S. women ages 12 to 49 years rose from 11% in 2003 to 14. 8% in
2010. Pregnant women and young children are also high-risk groups and must be evaluated. Iron deficiency in U. S. toddlers, without anemia, is estimated at 6. 6% to
15. 2%. Serum ferritin is a measure of iron stores and is the most sensitive biomarker to test for early stages of iron deficiency as well as iron deficiency anemia. Sensitivity of ferritin test is 89% for diagnosis of iron depletion compared with hemoglobin, which is only 26%.

Moreover, a ferritin cut off of ≤ 30 ng/mL provides 92% sensitivity and 98% specificity for iron deficiency anemia and is the best screening test for this disorder. Evaluating patients for iron deficiency with ferritin will identify early stage iron deficiency and will potentially result in iron therapy, preventing iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia has been long associated with psychomotor and cognitive abnormalities but even iron deficiency without anemia has been related to negative neurodevelopmental outcomes in children. Ferritin is an acute phase reactant, and occasionally in inflammatory conditions, ferritin levels may be normal or elevated even in the presence of iron deficiency.

Additional laboratory tests accompanying clinical correlation are also helpful to determine iron deficiency.

### Differences in clinical profile and outcomes of low iron storage vs defective iron utilization in patients with heart failure… [^115HH1uN]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

The orange area represents the diagnostic criteria used for LIS, and the blue area represents the diagnostic criteria used for DIU. Results Among the 42 patients in the DEFINE-HF study, 10 were women, and the mean age was 68. 0 years. Low iron storage was defined as a bone marrow–validated combination of transferrin saturation less than 20% and a serum ferritin concentration of 128 ng/mL or less; DIU was defined as transferrin saturation less than 20% and a serum ferritin concentration greater than 128 ng/mL. These results were confirmed by continuous hazard regression analysis, which showed low TSAT to be associated with unfavorable prognosis.

In patients with ID, a low ferritin level was associated with worse prognosis, while this was not the case in patients without ID. Low iron storage and DIU in patients with HF are generally treated similarly. However, in the present study, we demonstrated important differences. Using bone marrow–validated data, LIS could be distinguished from DIU when serum ferritin concentrations were less than 128 ng/mL. Low iron storage was independently associated with a higher prevalence of anemia and poorer quality of life, while DIU was associated with a higher incidence of inflammation. Low iron storage, but not DIU, was independently associated with higher mortality risk. In 2018, we proposed a definition of ID in patients with HF based on bone marrow iron staining, 3 which is considered the criterion standard.

Transferrin saturation less than 20% was shown to be optimal for the diagnosis of ID and selected patients with the worst prognosis and patients that responded best to intravenous ferric carboxymaltose in terms of improved prognosis in a post hoc analysis. 3 In the current study, we applied this definition to a large population of patients with worsening HF. Iron deficiency was shown to be prevalent, associated with more signs and symptoms, and independently associated with worse prognosis.

### The diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112L6njK]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) evaluation — guidance statements include: When evaluating a patient with suspected NAFLD, it is essential to exclude competing etiologies for steatosis and coexisting common CLD; in patients with suspected NAFLD, persistently high serum ferritin and increased iron saturation, especially with homozygote or heterozygote C282Y HFE mutation, a liver biopsy should be considered; high serum titers of autoantibodies with other features suggestive of autoimmune liver disease (> 5 ULN aminotransferases, high globulins, or high total protein to albumin ratio) should prompt a work-up for autoimmune liver disease; and initial evaluation should carefully consider comorbidities such as obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and sleep apnea.

### In search of potential predictors of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) hyporesponsiveness: a population-based study [^113J6T9n]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Anaemia is a common complication in both cancer and CKD patients and it could contribute to a poor prognosis. ESA therapy represents the main treatment to increase Hb levels in such groups of patients, leading to improvement of quality of life and reducing the risk of cardio- and cerebrovascular complications, as well as the requirement of blood transfusions. However, ESA therapy must be carefully handled due to the increased risk of stroke in older patients having Hb levels above the target range. Indeed, due to the occurrence of ESA resistance, the need for higher doses of ESA may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and, ultimately, death. Moreover, Minutolo et al. demonstrated that ESA hyporesponsiveness increased the risk of end stage renal disease by 2.5-fold in CKD patients.

Our data confirmed that the inflammatory condition and the iron intake affect ESA response. Inflammatory cytokines may affect the development of anemia through suppression of bone marrow erythropoiesis, suppression of erythropoietin production, or interfering with the iron status. Several published studies demonstrated that high levels of CRP in hemodialysis patients were associated with ESA hyporesponsiveness, leading to an increased risk of death. Although the prevalence of ESA hyporesponsiveness in hemodialysis patients is similar to that found in non-dialysis patients, limited studies on the predictors of ESA hyporesponsiveness have been conducted in the latter population.

Regarding the iron intake, our results highlighted that the use of iron preparations was a predictive factor of ESA response, whilst serum iron and ferritin were not independently associated to responsiveness to ESA treatment. Although previous studies on hemodialysis patients demonstrated that an altered iron status (in terms of low transferrin saturation levels and/or low ferritin levels), is a common factor inducing ESA hyporesponsiveness, there is no general consensus regarding the role of iron status as a predictor of ESA response. A recent study examined the relationship between iron markers, such as transferrin saturation and ferritin levels, and ESA responsiveness. Finding from the study highlighted that transferrin saturation, but not ferritin, was statistically associated to ESA hyporesponsiveness. On the hand, in our study, transferrin saturation covariate was excluded from the analysis, due to the high proportion of missing values (> 50%).

### Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp) [^112Mjn9Q]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 		 	Important Dosing Information

Evaluation of Iron Stores and Nutritional Factors

Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

Monitoring of Response to Therapy

Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g., vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc.) before initiating Aranesp. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

### Abnormal ferritin levels predict development of poor outcomes in cirrhotic outpatients: a cohort study [^115Axrko]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

However, uncovering all the underlying processes will require a complex perspective for future studies since ferritin is a multifunctional molecule that has the potential to even play a direct role in the development of various adverse events. As it has been reported, the two subunits serve different purposes: H-ferritin bears ferroxidase activity while acidic residues on L-ferritin facilitate the ferroxidase turnover and are essential for the nucleation of ferric (Fe³⁺) iron into the core of ferritin. Importantly, H-ferritin's cytosolic iron sequester activity has been shown to prevent iron-driven oxidative inhibition of glucose-6-phosphatase to sustain glucose production via liver gluconeogenesis, which ultimately increases the host's tolerance to sepsis. Another study showed that high level of L-ferritin inhibits LPS-mediated production of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1 in macrophages. In contrast, a study investigating hematopoiesis in mice after the injection of human H-ferritin observed a myelosuppressive effect of the protein that depended on its ferroxidase activity and involved the induction of interleukin-10. Consistently, L-ferritin, lacking ferroxidase activity, did not display such an effect. Since routine laboratory methods are designed to measure L-ferritin, we do not have information about the ratio of H-ferritin or iron saturation of serum ferritin, which could expand our understanding of the underlying processes. Additionally, transferrin level and saturation as well as liable iron level could have further supported our hypothesis about how low ferritin level is connected to decompensation. The lack of these data is a limitation of the present study and must be assessed by further investigations; however, the association of low ferritin level and low iron storage is evident even without the aforementioned laboratory results. Depleted iron stores may be treated using different iron salt supplementations. Recently, intravenous iron sucrose treatment has been reported to improve anemia specifically in patients with cirrhosis and gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^11189XPC]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in chronic conditions

Until very recently, iron deficiency (ID) was considered only in the context of iron‐deficiency anemia. It is only in the last 10–15 years that ID has been considered as an autonomous pathological entity in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs. Therefore, early ID detection and treatment became important goals, as iron is essential for the functioning of all organs. The fact that the biological definition of ID is debated and inconsistently defined by authors in different studies has probably contributed to preventing the recognition of ID as an independent condition. An international multidisciplinary group of experts recently proposed a more comprehensive definition of ID: "Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia". This definition is important because it indicates that ID may have specific symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment, even in the absence of anemia. Furthermore, as detailed in the next section, ID is associated with poor prognosis in many diseases, thus highlighting the importance of its diagnosis.

Depending on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, two types of ID can be distinguished, with identical clinical symptoms: absolute ID, which is the consequence of a quantitative decrease in iron stores, and functional ID, which is due to the sequestration of iron in otherwise quantitatively normal or abundant stores. These two types of ID are not mutually exclusive and are often associated. Understanding their underlying mechanisms is essential for the development of rational diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.

In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects stored iron, and transferrin saturation (TSAT), which is indicative of transported iron. TSAT is always present; thus, the decrease of TSAT is an essential diagnostic criterion of absolute or functional ID. Since the reliability of serum ferritin measurement may be compromised in patients with chronic diseases or any inflammatory condition, there is a large consensus in guidelines to determine both serum ferritin and TSAT in the first line. There is still no consensus on the thresholds, but recent recommendations of international guidelines have shown agreement for defining ID by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or TSAT < 20%.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

### Circulating heart failure biomarkers beyond natriuretic peptides: review from the biomarker study group of the heart failure association (HFA), European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^113KJ8Lk]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Metabolic markers

In this review, we address several biomarkers that might be implemented in clinical algorithms in the foreseen future. However, several biomarker niches like iron deficiency, thyroid (dys)function and thiamin deficiency have not been addressed.

Briefly, iron deficiency, a common nutritional disorder accounts for approximately one‐half of anaemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency and anaemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores (ferritin < 100 ng/mL or ferritin 100–300 ng/mL and transferrin saturation < 20%) and a haemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal (based per gender). In patients with HF, iron deficiency (∼50%) and anaemia (∼35%) are highly prevalent. Iron deficiency is associated with poor outcome in HF patients. Another review in this Journal describes the practical guidance regarding screening, diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency in patients with HF based upon the ESC HF guidelines.

Physicians encounter thyroid dysfunction frequently. Hypothyroidism is a known risk factor for CAD, and on the other hand hyperthyroidism can cause atrial fibrillation (AF). Cardiac medication, including amiodarone, may precipitate a variety of thyroid disorders, and severe heart disease, such as left ventricular failure or acute MI. Elderly subjects with a high‐risk cardiovascular profile with either low or very high thyroid‐stimulating hormone along with normal free T4 appear at increased risk of incident HF. Furthermore, in HF patients subclinical hypothyroidism and isolated low T3 levels are associated with poor prognosis. A recent review summarizes our current knowledge on thyroid and cardiac interaction.

Thiamin deficiency has been reported to have a high incidence in HF patients. There is growing evidence that patients with HF have micronutrient deficiencies. Thiamin deficiency has been found to be more prevalent in HF patients than in the general population, with a prevalence reported to vary from 3% to 91% in different studies. Supplementation has been argued as a possible treatment strategy. A recently published prospective randomized trial investigated thiamin supplements (200 mg vs. placebo) in eligible ambulatory patients with HFrEF for 6 months. Left ventricular ejection fraction, quality of life, or exercise capacity did not improve, despite increases in thiamin concentrations. These findings did not support routine thiamin supplementation in the treatment of HFrEF.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients with IBD (diagnosis), ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to recognize that a combination of true iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease is likely in the case of serum ferritin levels between 30 and 100 mcg/L.

### Investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin [^116kXCsb]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Serum ferritin level is one of the most commonly requested investigations in both primary and secondary care. Whilst low serum ferritin levels invariably indicate reduced iron stores, raised serum ferritin levels can be due to multiple different aetiologies, including iron overload, inflammation, liver or renal disease, malignancy, and the recently described metabolic syndrome. A key test in the further investigation of an unexpected raised serum ferritin is the serum transferrin saturation. This guideline reviews the investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin level. The investigation and management of genetic haemochromatosis is not dealt with however and is the subject of a separate guideline.

### Critical re-evaluation of the identification of iron deficiency States and effective iron repletion strategies in patients with chronic heart failure [^111Ws2Lt]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

According to current guidelines, iron deficiency is defined by a serum ferritin level < 100ng/ml or a transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20% if the serum ferritin level is 100–299μg/L. These criteria were developed to encourage the use of intravenous iron as an adjunct to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the treatment of renal anaemia. However, in patients with heart failure, these criteria are not supported by any pathophysiological or clinical evidence that they identify an absolute or functional iron deficiency state. A low baseline TSAT-but not serum ferritin level-appears to be a reliable indicator of the effect of intravenous iron to reduce major heart failure events. In randomized controlled trials, intravenous iron decreased the risk of cardiovascular death or total heart failure hospitalization in patients with a TSAT < 20% (risk ratio 0.67 [0.49–0.92]) but not in patients with a TSAT ≥ 20% (risk ratio 0.99 [0.74–1.30]), with the magnitude of the risk reduction being proportional to the severity of hypoferraemia. Patients who were enrolled in clinical trials solely because they had a serum ferritin level < 100μg/L showed no significant benefit on heart failure outcomes, and it is noteworthy that serum ferritin levels of 20–300μg/L lie entirely within the range of normal values for healthy adults. Current guidelines reflect the eligibility criteria of clinical trials, which inadvertently adopted unvalidated criteria to define iron deficiency. Reliance on these guidelines would lead to the treatment of many patients who are not iron deficient (serum ferritin level < 100μg/L but normal TSAT) and ignores the possibility of iron deficiency in patients with a low TSAT but with serum ferritin level of > 300μg/L. Importantly, analyses of benefit based on trial eligibility-driven guidelines substantially underestimate the magnitude of heart-failure-event risk reduction with intravenous iron in patients who are truly iron deficient. Based on all available data, we recommend a new mechanism-based and trial-tested approach that reflects the totality of evidence more faithfully than the historical process adopted by clinical investigators and by the guidelines. Until additional evidence is forthcoming, an iron deficiency state in patients with heart failure should be defined by a TSAT < 20% (as long as the serum ferritin level is < 400μg/L), and furthermore, the use of a serum ferritin level < 100μg/L alone as a diagnostic criterion should be discarded.

### Extreme hyperferritinaemia; clinical causes [^112N6wmB]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

There are many causes of raised serum ferritin concentrations including iron overload, inflammation and liver disease to name but a few examples. Cases of extreme hyperferritinaemia (serum ferritin concentration equal to or greater than 10 000 ug/l) are being reported in laboratories but the causes of this are unclear. We conducted an audit study to explore this further. Extreme hyperferritinaemia was rare with only 0.08% of ferritin requests displaying this. The main causes of extreme hyperferritinaemia included multiple blood transfusions, malignant disease, hepatic disease and suspected Still's disease.

### Early detection of type 1 haemochromatosis: a case of normal ferritin levels with elevated transferrin saturation [^115oKwcQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Haemochromatosis is marked by excessive iron accumulation leading to damage to various organs. Although haemochromatosis dates to 1865, diagnosing the condition remains challenging due to its non-specific symptoms and due to its quiescent course, it often leads to significant delay in recognition. A woman in her 50s who presented with arthralgia was found to have raised transferrin saturation with normal ferritin. She underwent human homeostatic iron regulator protein (HFE) genetic screening test which showed H63D type 1 haemochromatosis. This report aims to draw attention to the pitfalls in diagnosing haemochromatosis as normal ferritin does not exclude hereditary haemochromatosis.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^111wbP4h]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm³ (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^1119Ki27]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — definitions for key terms: Hepcidin is defined as a hormone synthesized and secreted by the liver in response to circulating iron levels, which inhibits iron absorption from the intestinal mucosal cells by degradation of ferroportin-1. Ferroportin-1 is a transmembrane protein found predominantly in the intestinal epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and macrophages, which facilitates iron export from the cells. Transferrin is a glycoprotein synthesized by the liver which exists in 3 forms (apo, monomeric, and dimeric); it carries iron in the circulation. Unsaturated iron-binding capacity is the portion of iron-binding sites on transferrin that are not occupied by iron, and a low unsaturated iron-binding capacity raises the suspicion for hemochromatosis. Total iron-binding capacity is the sum of the serum iron and unsaturated iron-binding capacity. Transferrin saturation is the percentage of iron bound to transferrin and is calculated by dividing serum iron by total iron-binding capacity. Ferritin is an intracellular protein that stores and releases intracellular iron.

In patients with inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, other laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein, transferrin saturation, or soluble transferrin receptor may be needed in conjunction with ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency anemia.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^111Q2E5c]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Iron deficiency is frequent in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g. chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cancers, and bowel inflammatory diseases). Indeed, high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines increase hepcidin concentrations that lead to the sequestration of iron in cells of the reticuloendothelial system (functional iron deficiency). Iron parameters are often assessed only in the context of anemia, but iron deficiency, even without anemia, is present in about half of patients with inflammatory conditions. Iron deficiency worsens underlying chronic diseases and is an independent factor of morbidity and mortality. In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects iron storage, and transferrin saturation, which reflects the transport of iron. Serum ferritin is increased in an inflammatory context, and there is still no consensus on the threshold to be used in chronic inflammatory conditions. Nevertheless, recent recommendations of international guidelines agreed to define iron deficiency by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or transferrin saturation < 20%. Iron parameters remain, however, insufficiently assessed in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Indeed, clinical symptoms of iron deficiency, such as fatigue, are not specific and often confused with those of the primary disease. Iron repletion, preferably by the intravenous route to bypass tissue sequestration, improves clinical signs and quality of life. Because of the negative impact of iron deficiency on chronic inflammatory diseases and the efficacy of intravenous iron repletion, screening of iron parameters should be part of the routine examination of all patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

### Predictors of the response to treatment in anemic hemodialysis patients with high serum ferritin and low transferrin saturation [^113WdYn3]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Treating hemodialysis patients to combat anemia corrects hemoglobin but exacerbates iron deficiency by utilizing iron stores. Patients needing iron should receive this by intravenous (i.v.) means. The Dialysis patients' Response to IV iron with Elevated ferritin (DRIVE) trial investigated the role of i.v. iron in anemic patients with high ferritin, low transferrin saturation, and adequate epoetin doses. We examined whether baseline iron and inflammation markers predict the response of hemoglobin to treatment. Patients (134) were randomized to no added iron or to i.v. ferric gluconate for eight consecutive hemodialysis sessions spanning 6 weeks with epoetin increased by 25% in both groups. The patients started with hemoglobin less than or equal to 11 g/dl, ferritin between 500 and 1200 ng/ml, and transferrin saturation of less than 25%. Significantly, patients with a reticulocyte hemoglobin content greater than or equal to 31.2 pg were over five times more likely to achieve a clinically significant increase in hemoglobin of greater than 2 g/dl. Lower reticulocyte hemoglobin contents did not preclude a response to i.v. iron. Significantly higher transferrin saturation or lower C-reactive protein but not ferritin or soluble transferrin receptor levels predicted a greater response; however their influence was not clinically significant in either group. We conclude that none of the studied markers is a good predictor of response to anemia treatment in this patient sub-population.

### Pathophysiological consequences and benefits ofmutations: 20 years of research [^111UumWC]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of HH

Elevated liver enzymes and/or iron parameters indicative of iron overload (serum ferritin and transferrin saturation levels) usually precede a symptomatic manifestation of hemochromatosis. Individuals with elevated body iron levels despite fully functional erythropoiesis are thus commonly diagnosed with hemochromatosis, regardless of whether or not they show disease symptoms. Genetic and biochemical screening of the general population for HFE mutations has been discussed but is currently not recommended because of its high costs and the low penetrance of the disease.

Depending on the degree of iron accumulation, cytotoxic hydroxyl and lipid radicals will be produced causing various organ pathologies, including those of the liver, heart, and pancreas, and ultimately lead to organ failure in affected individuals who remain untreated. The symptoms of hemochromatosis range from chronic fatigue, hyperpigmentation, joint and bone symptoms to diabetes, and liver diseases, such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma(Table 1 and Figure 2). The correlation between increased ferritin levels and transferrin saturation with organ damage is poor, highlighting the need for better markers for iron-induced organ damage. Despite this, symptoms develop especially in men with homozygous p. Cys282Tyr mutations and serum ferritin concentrations greater than 1000 μg/L. Liver biopsies may thus be performed to test for liver damage in HH when serum ferritin levels exceed 1000 μg/L, while diverse arthropathies may also be observed in C282Y mutation carriers without severe iron overload. Patients diagnosed with clinical HH face a higher risk of developing liver cancer (when cirrhosis is present at diagnosis) compared to controls. Although highly debated, several studies have suggested a direct association of HFE mutations with the progression of various cancers including colon, breast, prostate, and epithelial ovarian cancer. – Patients with iron overload are also more susceptible to some infections, such as those caused by Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio vulnificus, or HIV. Consistently, studies in mice with iron overload resulting from a hepcidin deficiency showed decreased survival of animals infected by Vibrio vulnificus or the malaria-causing Plasmodium berghei. In addition, Hfe-deficiency in mice prevents a proper response to infection in that recruitment of pulmonary neutrophils upon an inflammatory stimulus is reduced.

### Is intervertebral disc degeneration associated with reduction in serum ferritin? [^114NCy7p]. European Spine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Ferritin autophagy is characterized by intracellular ferroptosis and selective ferritin degradation. However, the role of ferritin in the development of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) has not been elucidated. The study aimed to investigate the role of serum iron metabolism markers, especially serum ferritin (SF), in IDD.

Methods

217 patients who came to the spine surgery department of our hospital for low back pain were recruited, and blood samples were collected for routine examination after admission. The cumulative grade was also calculated by summing up the Pfirrmann grade of all lumbar discs.

Results

Correlation analysis showed that cumulative grade was correlated with SF (r = - 0.185, p = 0.006), not with serum iron (SI), transferrin saturation (TS), unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) (all p > 0.05). In addition, SF levels in the low severity IDD were significantly higher than high severity IDD in cumulative grade (p = 0.003) and single disc grade. No statistically significant difference was found in the other four indicators. A statistically significant difference was observed between the high (cumulative grade > 17) and low score (cumulative grade ≤ 17) groups in terms of age. According to the ROC curve, the cut-off value of SF levels was 170.5. Patients with SF < 170.5 ng/mL had severe disc degeneration. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.635 and 0.602, respectively.

Conclusion

This study preliminarily showed that SF was negatively correlated with the degree of IDD and can be used to predict IDD severity.

### Transferrin as a predictor of survival in cirrhosis [^116ivaLX]. Liver Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

The Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease (MELD) has evolved as a reference staging system for cirrhosis and is used for prognosis, evaluation for liver transplantation, and donor liver allocation. 1, 2, 3 Incorporating sodium, age, or albumin into modified MELD scores improves accuracy in predicting survival in patients with cirrhosis. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 In search for additional prognostic parameters, high ferritin at the time of listing for liver transplantation was identified as an independent predictor of wait‐list mortality, 9 but the prognostic utility of ferritin could not be reproduced in a larger cohort. 10 When transferrin saturation was taken into consideration, ferritin could predict mortality on the waiting list and after orthotopic liver transplantation. 11

Iron overload was therefore proposed as a risk factor for mortality in patients with liver disease. Accordingly, transferrin and transferrin saturation have also been identified as predictors of survival in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and acute‐on‐chronic liver failure (ACLF). 12, 13 Transferrin is lower in patients with cirrhosis and impaired synthetic function. 14 High ferritin and low transferrin can indicate inflammation, 15, 16 which is also a risk factor for disease progression and mortality in cirrhosis. In addition, alcohol and metabolic factors can directly affect iron metabolism. 17, 18, 19 Hence, it remains unclear if altered iron metabolism is cause or consequence of advanced liver disease in different etiologies.

The effect of inflammation and hepatic function on serum iron parameters was assessed by correlating serum ferritin, transferrin, and transferrin saturation with C‐reactive protein (CRP) and albumin. The prognostic utility of all these parameters was determined by survival analysis in a large cohort of unselected patients with cirrhosis.

### Iron deficiency: new insights into diagnosis and treatment [^112sB6Gi]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common conditions worldwide affecting especially children and young women. In developing countries, iron deficiency is caused by poor iron intake and/or parasitic infection, whereas vegetarian dietary choices, poor iron absorption, and chronic blood loss are common causes in high-income countries. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents can result in functional iron deficiency for erythropoiesis even when stores are iron-replete. Diagnosis of iron deficiency is straightforward, except when it occurs in the context of inflammatory disorders. Oral iron salts correct absolute iron deficiency in most patients, because low hepcidin levels facilitate iron absorption. Unfortunately frequent side effects limit oral iron efficacy. Intravenous iron is increasingly utilized, because currently available preparations allow rapid normalization of total body iron even with a single infusion and are effective also in functional iron deficiency and in iron deficiency associated with inflammatory disorders. The evidence is accumulating that these preparations are safe and effective. However, long-term safety issues of high doses of iron need to be further explored.

### Sex, lies, and iron deficiency: a call to change ferritin reference ranges [^115PFf6Y]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is a very common and treatable disorder. Of all the tests available to diagnose iron deficiency, the serum ferritin is the most able to discriminate iron deficiency from other disorders. However, the reference range for ferritin in many laboratories will lead to underdiagnosis of iron deficiency in women. Studies have shown that 30%-50% of healthy women will have no marrow iron stores, so basing ferritin cutoffs on the lowest 2.5% of sampled ferritins is not appropriate. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest the body physiologic ferritin "cutoff" is 50ng/mL. Work is needed to establish more realistic ferritin ranges to avoid underdiagnosing a readily treatable disorder.

Twin A has a low serum hepcidin of 7.7 ng/mL (normal range 4.4–47.3 ng/mL) despite elevated ferritin, and hepcidin to ferritin (H: F) ratio of 0.018 indicating classical hemochromatosis phenotype. Twin B has a serum hepcidin level of 12.3 ng/ mL and H: F ratio of 0.072, four-times higher than twin A. The level of hepcidin in twin B is inappropriately low considering the high serum transferrin saturation (> 50%). It is unclear why the patient has high transferrin saturation but no evidence of elevated iron stores (ferritin 170 ng/ mL). Iron utilization appears normal as hemoglobin (13.4 g/dL) is within the normal range. Twin B has higher mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), by ~10% consistently (Table 1B). This may indicate that she is utilizing iron for erythropoiesis at a higher rate than her sister, however their reticulocyte count is similar.

Twin B has a BUB1B mutation which is associated with MVA syndrome. Based on exome sequencing, she appears to be a carrier for this condition. We pursued additional testing, a sensitive genome-wide method to assess aneuploidy from blood DNA for which the whole genome sequence was generated. There was no evidence of any aneuploidy. There are no reports of any relationship between BUB1B mutation and iron metabolism. Twin B however has a few features of the MVA, such as IUGR, slow post-natal growth, shorter than average stature, and pachygyria with seizures. Currently, twin B weighs 15.6 kg at 8 years of age, less than the 1 percentile (compared to twin A who is 39 kg at 91 st percentile). It is likely that twin B's chronic malnutrition has contributed to having normal serum iron and ferritin levels despite having high transferrin saturation levels (> 50%). She may be absorbing iron at a higher rate than other nutrients because of her hemochromatosis mutations, which allows maintaining iron homeostasis and erythropoiesis at a normal level despite malnutrition. In contrast, the patient has been taking zinc supplements. Serum zinc lowest at 49 µg/dL at age 4 years, maintains in the range of 62.6–98.6 µg/dL with zinc supplements (normal range, 60–120 µg/dL).

Figure 1
The pathophysiology of iron deficiency in chronic inflammation. Increased cytokine levels in all conditions, and decreased renal clearance in CKD and CHF, result in enhanced hepcidin levels. High hepcidin levels bind, internalize and degrade ferroportin on the lateral membrane of duodenal enterocytes and spleen macrophages. Iron remains trapped in enterocytes, which are then shed in the gut. Iron is also sequestered into macrophages, which are responsible for destroying senescent red blood cells and recycling their iron. Serum ferritin levels are regulated by the iron content of macrophages and increase in inflammation (apoferritin as an acute‐phase protein). A decrease in circulating iron leads to lower amounts of iron bound to the iron carrier protein, transferrin, and subsequently to a decline in transferrin saturation and low iron supply to all organs. Furthermore, cytokines may also have negative effects on erythropoietin production in the kidney and erythroid cell maturation, while also increasing macrophage iron retention. Note that the increased iron losses that can occur in specific chronic inflammatory conditions are not illustrated here. Plus and minus signs represent increase/enhancement and decrease, respectively. EPO, erythropoietin; FPN, ferroportin; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TSAT, transferrin saturation

It is estimated that for the healthy individual, total body iron content is ∼3–4 g, of which 1–2 mg of exogenous iron is absorbed per day and 25 mg of iron is required daily for erythropoiesis, mostly obtained from iron recycling. 26 As a result of limited iron supply from macrophage‐led iron retention, patients with chronic inflammatory conditions have greater daily iron requirements to increase the levels of circulating iron compared with healthy individuals. 27, 28, 29 As a consequence of severely depleted iron availability, proper functioning of many organ systems is compromised in these patients. 27, 28, 29 For example, iron content and transferrin receptor levels were decreased in the myocardium of patients with iron deficiency anemia and advanced heart failure compared with healthy individuals, suggesting that iron depletion was associated with adverse outcomes in these patients. 30

### New concepts in the diagnosis and management approach to iron deficiency in candidates for metabolic surgery: should we change our practice? [^112bNqPw]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The near universal presence of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation among patients with severe obesity disrupts iron homeostasis and underlies the association between obesity and iron deficiency. Immune activation and inflammation result in a reduction in circulating iron and diminished iron bioavailability for erythropoiesis. Inflammation also alters blood levels of commonly measured markers of iron nutrition status, which makes the diagnosis of iron deficiency difficult and has led to new recommendations regarding laboratory markers for the diagnosis. Recent evidence using these newly recommended laboratory markers, which include levels of ferritin, C-reactive protein, and transferrin saturation, suggests that the actual prevalence of iron deficiency among candidates for metabolic surgery may be double or triple the prevalence identified by low levels of ferritin alone. Thus large numbers of surgical candidates have iron deficiency that has been heretofore largely unrecognized and inadequately treated. The assessment of iron status using the currently recommended markers in the presence of chronic inflammatory diseases and repletion of depleted stores for surgical candidates with deficiency during the preoperative period present an important opportunity for mitigating this condition in postoperative patients.

1.8 Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia (Table 1). However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish (Table 1). Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 86 yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut‐off values for these parameters. 4 Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation (according to inflammatory markers such as C‐reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured, should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L −1 or if patients are symptomatic 68, 87? Moreover, no standard CRP cut‐off values are provided; although a CRP level of 5 mg L −1 is the most common threshold, 64 this is not recognized in most guidelines 68

### Best but not perfect: indirect measure of low iron stores [^115WFgXM]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Although making the correct diagnosis of iron deficiency is critical for patient care, the use of indirect markers obtained through routine phlebotomy presents a challenge. Low serum iron, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, and MCV are characteristic of iron deficiency but can also result from inflammation. In addition, hemoglobin and MCV may be low due to genetic causes and, in the case of hemoglobin, to diurnal variation rather than iron deficiency. Transferrin concentrations tend to increase with iron deficiency and decrease with inflammation, whereas transferrin receptor levels rise with both iron deficiency and inflammation. Serum ferritin is an attractive marker because a very low level (< 10 μg/L) is diagnostic of iron deficiency as documented by absent stainable iron in a bone marrow aspirate. However, serum ferritin can be normal or even elevated when iron deficiency is documented by absent bone marrow stainable iron. A recent Cochrane review of 512 adults presenting for medical care at various institutions found that a serum ferritin < 30 μg/L had 98% specificity and 79% sensitivity for diagnosing iron deficiency as documented by absent bone marrow iron.

Lahtiharju et al make a remarkable contribution by evaluating the relationship of indirect measures of iron status to bone marrow iron stain in 6610 patients and providing evidence that ferritin is the most reliable single biomarker for predicting reduced iron stores. This finding is consistent with studies dated decades ago that established ferritin as a key standalone indicator of iron status. This study also underscores the limitations of ferritin, particularly its low sensitivity. Using a ferritin cutoff of 30 μg/L, the specificity rates were impressively high at 97% for females and 99% for males, but the sensitivity rates were only 54% and 35%, respectively. This indicates that while a ferritin of 30 μg/L or lower is highly specific for low or absent bone marrow iron, it is not sensitive enough to detect all cases of low iron stores, especially in patients with comorbid conditions that can increase ferritin levels. It is important to recognize that in this study, there were females with serum ferritin > 1750 μg/L and males with serum ferritin > 4967 μg/L who had low or absent bone marrow iron stores.

### Physiological need for calcium, iron, and folic acid for women of various subpopulations during pregnancy and beyond [^113ohco1]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has published a statement indicating that evidence is insufficient to warrant routine iron supplementation during pregnancy. Current published evidence on the benefits and risks of routine iron supplementation during pregnancy tends to focus more on infant outcomes and less on maternal health. With respect to maternal health, physiologic requirements for iron intake — and thus the benefits and risks of routine iron supplementation — are complicated by confounding factors, including ethnicity, diet, lifestyle, genetics, preexisting chronic diseases and conditions, and methods for assessing precise measures of iron status.

Iron status is commonly assessed as a measure of hemoglobin concentrations. However, interpretations of the outcomes of these measures are problematic. For example, iron deficiency as a measure of hemoglobin concentration is not always associated with anemic outcomes in all populations. On the other hand, measures of serum ferritin, a biomarker for iron stores, are more often preferred as a metric for low iron status. Interpretations of high ferritin concentrations also have proven to be problematic. Because ferritin acts as an acute phase reactant to infection and inflammation, it is difficult to discern whether high levels of serum ferritin are indicative of an iron overload status or inflammation. Furthermore, data from the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study of 20,080 nonpregnant and 1962 pregnant women suggest innate biological differences in serum ferritin levels (as well as transferrin saturation) across racial and ethnic groups and also suggest that these measures must be interpreted differently in persons of Asian or Pacific Island heritage than in Whites. Similarly, differences between the interpretation of maternal hematocrit levels in Black pregnant women and in White pregnant women have been reported.

### Diagnosis… [^115nVPKP]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

2 As such, iron deficiency should still be considered in all cases of anemia unless the mean corpuscular volume is greater than 95 μm³, because this cutoff has a sensitivity of 97. 6 percent. 6 Other causes of microcytosis include chronic inflammatory states, lead poisoning, thalassemia, and sideroblastic anemia.

1. The following diagnostic approach is recommended in patients with anemia and is outlined in Figure
2. 2, 6–11 A serum ferritin level should be obtained in patients with anemia and a mean corpuscular volume less than 95 μm³. Ferritin reflects iron stores and is the most accurate test to diagnose iron deficiency anemia. 7 Although levels below 15 ng per mL are consistent with a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia, using a cutoff of 30 ng per mL improves sensitivity from 25 to 92 percent, and specificity remains high at 98 percent.

8, 12 Ferritin is also an acute phase reactant and can be elevated in patients with chronic inflammation or infection. In patients with chronic inflammation, iron deficiency anemia is likely when the ferritin level is less than 50 ng per mL. 7 Ferritin values greater than or equal to 100 ng per mL generally exclude iron deficiency anemia. 9, 10. In patients with no inflammatory states and in whom the ferritin level is indeterminate, further tests can be performed to ascertain iron status. Values consistent with iron deficiency include a low serum iron level, low transferrin saturation, and a high total iron-binding capacity. 16 Risk factors include low birth weight, history of prematurity, exposure to lead, exclusive breastfeeding beyond four months of life, and weaning to whole milk and complementary foods without iron-fortified foods.

16 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends screening children from low-income or newly immigrated families at nine to 12 months of age, and consideration of screening for preterm and low-birth-weight infants before six months of age if they are not given iron-fortified formula. Excessive or irregular menstrual bleeding affects 9 to 14 percent of all women and can lead to varying degrees of iron deficiency anemia.

### High transferrin saturation predicts inferior clinical outcomes in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes [^113qT1fb]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In a large prospective study of MDS patients of all risk categories, TSAT > 80% and ferritin > 800 µg/L were clinically significant levels associated with inferior OS, PFS and LFS. The effects of transfusional IO were not restricted to lower risk patients, and a higher TSAT appears to be a better biomarker for IO toxicity than ferritin among higher risk patients. Compared to ferritin, TSAT may better reflect of the degree of oxidative stress present. Further study of the relationships between TSAT, reactive oxygen species, PFS, LFS and CDFS in MDS is warranted.

### Iron metabolism and iron disorders revisited in the hepcidin era [^111JTGYM]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis

The pathophysiology and diagnosis of hemochromatosis were profoundly influenced by the cloning of the HFE geneand the definition of the genetic heterogeneity of the disease (Table 1). Overall hemochromatosis is due to "insufficient hepcidin production" or exceptionally to "hepcidin resistance". Mutations in genes of the hepcidin-ferroportin axis disrupt iron homeostasis, leading to increased iron absorption, high transferrin saturation and increased toxicity from non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) species. The commonest form of hemochromatosis in Caucasians is due to homozygous HFE (C282Y) mutations. Genetic tests allow early diagnosis so that individuals with the affected genotypes show high biochemical penetrance (increased transferrin saturation ± increased serum ferritin) but low clinical expression. Loss-of-function mutations of HJV, TFR2 and HAMP (encoding hepcidin) lead to more severe diseases, collectively called "non- HFE hemochromatosis". In all the recessive forms hepcidin is inappropriately low in comparison with iron excess and the onset and severity of iron overload correlate with the hormone deficiency. The implementation of next-generation sequencing in familial and isolated cases of iron overloadhas enabled the identification of mutations in more than one gene and provided examples of digenic inheritance. Both genetic and acquired modifiers contribute to the penetrance of HFE -hemochromatosis, interfering with hepcidin expression: e.g. alcohol aggravates the iron burden, whereas blood donations attenuates it.

Ferroportin mutations are inherited in a dominant manner (Table 1). The different effects of these mutations account for the controversy in disease nomenclature. Loss-of-function mutations impair iron export, are associated with iron accumulation in Küpffer cells and require no or reduced phlebotomy therapy, representing the true "ferroportin disease". Gain-of-function mutations lead to hepcidin resistance and the release of too much iron, as occurs in hemochromatosis.

The clinical severity of hemochromatosis is related to NTBI, a toxic iron species bound to low molecular weight molecules, easily taken up by hepatocytes and pancreatic cells via ZIP14 transporterand by cardiomyocytes through other transporters. While iron uptake by transferrin receptor is tightly regulated, the uptake of NTBI is not and persists in iron overload. NTBI leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species and cell damage, causing liver fibrosis (which may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma), chronic heart failure, diabetes, hypopituitarism and other complications of iron loading.

We used observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

### Threshold ferritin and hepcidin concentrations indicating early iron deficiency in young women based on upregulation of iron absorption [^112XkeZX]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Iron deficiency is estimated to affect two billion people and is the leading cause of anemia worldwide. The serum or plasma ferritin concentration (referred to hereafter as ferritin) is the most widely used indicator to detect iron deficiency and a low ferritin indicates depleted iron stores. However, the threshold ferritin that defines iron deficiency remains unclearand diagnostic ferritin cutoffs from expert groups vary widely. WHO proposes that iron deficiency is present in adults when ferritin is < 15 µg/L 2. This threshold was derived from studies examining the highest ferritin among adults with iron-deficiency anemia who showed a therapeutic response to iron or who had absent bone marrow iron. Considering this definition, it is not unexpected that a ferritin < 15 µg/L is a specific but insensitive threshold for iron deficiency, which precedes iron-deficiency anemia. To increase the sensitivity of ferritin to detect iron deficiency, other experts recommend using higher cut-offs to avoid false-negative tests that would leave iron deficiency untreated. However, there is little evidence available to justify higher ferritin thresholds. Moreover, many studies that compared ferritin to absent bone marrow iron were done in hospitalized patients and were likely biased by inflammation, that increases ferritin independent of iron stores.

A largely unexplored reference method for defining iron deficiency is based on the fact that low iron stores trigger an increase in dietary iron absorption. In otherwise healthy individuals, low hepatic iron stores attenuate the bone morphogenetic protein–SMAD (BMP-SMAD) pathway, which reduces hepatic hepcidin synthesis, and low circulating hepcidin increases dietary iron absorption. Importantly, dietary iron absorption is already increased when a reduction in liver iron stores has not yet reduced serum iron or transferrin saturation. Iron absorption measured via erythrocyte iron incorporation of isotopic tracers has long been regarded as the most sensitive indirect measure of body iron stores.

A recent WHO review emphasized the need for additional research to establish a ferritin cutoff for iron deficiency. Using standardized methods, our laboratory has performed multiple stable iron isotope studies in healthy young women with varying iron status to measure iron absorption from meals extrinsically-labeled with ferrous sulfate. Pooling these data, our study aim was to define the ferritin concentration in young women at which the body senses iron depletion and begins to upregulate iron absorption from the diet; this approach could provide a functionally-defined threshold of incipient iron deficiency. At the same time, we hypothesized that this threshold ferritin value would correspond to the hepcidin threshold at which iron absorption begins to increase.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in CKD: a summary of the NICE guideline recommendations and their rationale [^11536fLC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The UK-based National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has updated its guidance on iron deficiency and anemia management in chronic kidney disease. This report outlines the recommendations regarding iron deficiency and their rationale. Serum ferritin alone or transferrin saturation alone are no longer recommended as diagnostic tests to assess iron deficiency. Red blood cell markers (percentage hypochromic red blood cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin content, or reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent) are better than ferritin level alone at predicting responsiveness to intravenous iron. When red blood cell markers are not available, a combination of transferrin saturation < 20% and ferritin level < 100ng/mL is an alternative. In comparisons of the cost-effectiveness of different iron status testing and treatment strategies, using percentage hypochromic red blood cells > 6% was the most cost-effective strategy for both hemodialysis and nonhemodialysis patients. A trial of oral iron replacement is recommended in people not receiving an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) and not on hemodialysis therapy. For children receiving ESAs, but not treated by hemodialysis, oral iron should be considered. In adults and children receiving ESAs and/or on hemodialysis therapy, intravenous iron should be offered. When giving intravenous iron, high-dose low-frequency administration is recommended. For all children and for adults receiving in-center hemodialysis, low-dose high-frequency administration may be more appropriate.

INTRODUCTION

In biological systems, iron exerts essential functions and can potentially result in cell toxicity, particularly in the context of increased intracellular iron content resulting in oxidative injury, which explains the complex regulation of iron metabolism in human physiology. On the other hand, a decrease in iron availability in the body results not only in iron deficiency (ID) anemia, but also in a disarrangement of the energy metabolism, particularly in muscle cells, given that iron is essential for the synthesis of major proteins in a wide range of intracellular pathways.

A precise diagnosis of ID can be achieved by the confirmation of reduced iron content in the bone marrow, although the clinical use of this evaluation is not practical. Although far from ideal, the most commonly used parameters to assess iron status in clinical practice are transferrin saturation (TSAT) and ferritin. Based on these biochemical parameters, there are two main ID subtypes: absolute ID, loosely defined as low TSAT and low ferritin levels, and functional ID, defined as high ferritin combined with low TSAT. While the former represents the most common subtype in the general population, the latter is commonly found in chronic inflammatory states, such as heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In fact, functional ID results in part from increased hepcidin levels, which reduce iron release from the reticuloendothelial system, thereby restricting iron availability for metabolic functions.

ID is a common finding in nondialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD), occurring in up to 50% of patients with anemia. Current CKD guidelines recommend that screening for ID should be done mainly in the context of anemia. Previous studies have shown that even in this restricted strategy of testing for iron parameters, patients are often left underevaluated and undertreated for ID.

The clinical effects of ID on muscle metabolism and function are well described in chronic conditions having a similar pathophysiological basis for ID, such as HF. In HF patients, ID, independent from anemia, has been associated with worse functional and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in observational studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have confirmed the benefits of ID treatment in HF, regardless of anemia status, with improvements ranging from patient-reported to clinical outcomes. In NDD-CKD patients, ID, both functional and absolute, has been associated with worse clinical outcomes in observational studies; RCTs, however, have primarily focused on the erythropoietic effects of iron replacement therapy.

### Abnormal ferritin levels predict development of poor outcomes in cirrhotic outpatients: a cohort study [^116rfLva]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, since low ferritin level was associated with higher incidence of decompensation, it might seem controversial that mortality was associated with higher ferritin levels in the compensated population. As discussed, elevated ferritin level indicates either iron overload, which is toxic to cells, or increased inflammation, caused by either bacterial translocation or a subclinical starting infection. These last two, in return, can lead to overt infections, while inflammation in general and iron-induced toxicity can trigger the progression of HCC and comorbidities ultimately leading to increased overall mortality. Indeed, as Fig. 6 shows, almost every patient with high ferritin level who developed decompensated clinical stage died, and some deceased even without having an AD episode. In contrast, as Fig. 3 demonstrates, no patient with low ferritin level who did not develop decompensated clinical stage died during follow up. Furthermore, approximately 40% of those with low ferritin levels who did decompensate, also survived. The explanation for this difference is not clear, but the decompensation of non-inflammatory mechanisms, indicated by lower ferritin levels, might represent a less severe/more manageable type of AD.

### A comprehensive vision for intravenous iron therapy [^1133mjD8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Commonly used iron indices, such as serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT), have limited utility in patients with chronic kidney disease. Both dialysis and nondialysis patients may have normal to high serum ferritin levels and little or no iron available for erythropoiesis. Inflammation can result in increased serum ferritin level and low TSAT and restrict the ability to mobilize iron stores. Management of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease requires recognizing that not only decreased erythropoietin production, but also decreased iron availability, can lead to anemia. The Dialysis Patients' Response to IV Iron with Elevated Ferritin (DRIVE) trial showed the efficacy of intravenous (IV) iron in anemic hemodialysis patients with serum ferritin levels of 500 to 1,200 ng/mL and TSAT of 25% or less receiving adequate erythropoiesis-stimulating agent doses. Withholding iron from these patients resulted in worsening iron-restricted erythropoiesis. To improve anemia management in patients receiving hemodialysis and being treated with ESAs, clinicians should consider the benefits of IV iron.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^115jn7J4]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 2.4 - treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy - upper limit for iron therapy

We recommend that serum ferritin should not exceed 800 microgram/L in patients treated with iron, and to achieve this iron management should be reviewed when the ferritin is > 500 microgram/L. (1B)

Rationale

- Iron overload is defined as increased total body iron content with the possible risk of organ dysfunction.

- There is no clinically available method that accurately determines total body iron content.

- An elevated serum ferritin does not always correlate with elevations in liver iron content.

- Magnetic resonance imaging provides a reliable assessment of tissue iron content in HD patients regularly treated with parenteral iron. However, the clinical relevance of increased liver iron remains unclear.

- Elevated serum ferritin together with elevated serum transferrin saturation remain the most clinically accurate parameter of iron overload in CKD patients.

- Discontinuation of adequate maintenance IV iron when an individual's ferritin is > 500 microgram/L produces a population mean that straddles the 500microgram/L ceiling. Ongoing iron therapy in patients with ferritin > 500 microgram/L results in a higher median ferritin outcome.

- Interpretation of iron status results and deciding on the need for further iron therapy should include a concomitant assessment of changes in Hb level and ESA dose over time. Examples:

- A dropping ferritin as well as decreasing Hb levels signifies blood loss e.g. on HD or bowel related anaemia: iron therapy is indicated; further investigation may be required depending on the clinical scenario.

- A decreasing ferritin level after initiation of ESA therapy, with a concomitant rise in Hb level indicates a response to ESA with a shift of iron from stores to bone marrow: further iron therapy is guided by target ferritin level.

- An increasing ferritin level after reduction of ESA dose to bring Hb level down to target range indicates ferritin level is rising as Hb synthesis is dropping: further iron therapy may be postponed.

### Mortality and risk of diabetes, liver disease, and heart disease in individuals with haemochromatosisC282Y homozygosity and normal concentrations of iron, transferrin saturation, or ferritin: prospective cohort study [^1137HcRB]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Fig 3
Relative risk of diabetes for C282Y homozygotes (C282Y/C282Y) compared with non-carriers for both C282Y and H63D (non-carrier/non-carrier) stratified according to levels of plasma iron, transferrin saturation, and ferritin at study enrolment, adjusted for age and sex. Diabetes was defined as any hospital contact with diabetes (inpatient admission, emergency department visit, or outpatient visit) at any time before or after study enrolment. Analysis excludes individuals (n = 11 C282Y homozygotes) with diagnosis of haemochromatosis at study enrolment to exclude that levels of iron, transferrin saturation, or ferritin in blood samples obtained at study enrolment were affected by previous therapeutic phlebotomy. Normal iron was defined as iron 9–34 µmol/L and high iron as > 34 µmol/L. Normal transferrin saturation was defined as 10–45% for women aged ≤ 50 years and 15–45% for women > 50 and men regardless of age. High transferrin saturation was defined as > 45% for both sexes. Normal ferritin was defined as ferritin 12–200 µg/L for women and 12–300 µg/L for men and high ferritin as > 200 µg/L for women and > 300 µg/L for men. As very few C282Y homozygotes had low levels of iron, transferrin saturation, or ferritin, individuals with low levels of iron, transferrin saturation, or ferritin were excluded from analysis stratified for specific parameter that was low. Owing to Danish regulations on data privacy, fewer than 3 individuals with diabetes in a column is reported as " < 3" but risk estimates were calculated using exact numbers. CI = confidence interval

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^1162718v]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients with IBD (diagnosis), ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to diagnose anemia of chronic disease in the presence of serum ferritin > 100 mcg/L and transferrin saturation < 20% in patients with biochemical or clinical evidence of inflammation.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^115aEBrk]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease — nonanemic iron deficiency (NAID) can be detected by routine screening and, in children, a ferritin level below 15 μg/L is considered diagnostic for iron deficiency, whereas in active disease levels of up to 100 μg/L can still be consistent with iron-deficient state; a low transferrin saturation (< 20%) coupled with a low ferritin will be observed with iron deficiency, while high ferritin and low TSAT will be observed in functional iron deficiency even without anemia, and early changes include a high RDW and low or borderline MCH.

### Biomarkers of iron metabolism facilitate clinical diagnosis ininfection [^113VYsQK]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron is a micronutrient that is important for host and MTB metabolism. Pathogenic mycobacteria compete with the host for iron, either by directly depleting intracellular iron from the host cytoplasm or by synthesising siderophores and macromolecules, including transferrin, ferritin or lactoferrin, which have high affinity to capture extracellular ferric ion. Anaemia, as a result of inflammation caused by MTB infection, is predominantly caused by an iron delivery problem, where erythrocyte iron is poorly used and dietary iron is enriched in intestinal enterocytes. This condition is in contrast to iron deficiency-mediated anaemia, which is mainly due to malnutrition. Although serum iron levels are low in both types of anaemia, other components involved in iron homeostasis are high in anaemia due to inflammation, including ferritin and hepcidin, a peptide involved in regulating iron metabolism.

Previous studies have found that serum iron and transferrin concentrations are lower and ferritin levels are higher in patients with TB compared with those without TB. These abnormalities in ferritin and transferrin concentration in affected patients typically normalise following treatment. Others have suggested that reduced transferrin levels are associated with the progression of TB at any time point, and higher ferritin and hepcidin levels are associated with a higher risk of early TB progression in household contacts of TB cases. In addition, iron biomarker status can be used as an indicator of treatment failure (low ferritin) and mortality (high ferritin). Finally, low transferrin and serum iron, and high ferritin concentrations in HIV-infected patients suggest increased risks of TB incidence and recurrence. However, no previous study has examined the possible combination of these iron homeostasis biomarkers for clinical TB diagnosis, particularly in differentiating TB from LTBI and PN.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116PBzzy]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — ferritin thresholds and adjunctive testing: Based on a systematic review of 55 studies, a ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL has a sensitivity for iron deficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82%–87%) with a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 91%–94%), whereas a ferritin value of < 15 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 55%–62%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 98%–99%). A ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL was believed to maximize sensitivity for the diagnosis of IDA with an acceptable number of false-positive diagnoses, and the tradeoff between higher sensitivity and lower specificity using a threshold of 45 ng/mL instead of 15 ng/mL was believed to provide an acceptable balance of benefits of fewer missed diagnoses compared with potential harms of additional diagnostic evaluations. In some patients, such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, ferritin levels may not accurately reflect body iron stores and other clinical tests, such as the serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, or C-reactive protein, may be useful adjunctive tests to assist in the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^111BGSMm]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cancers, and bowel inflammatory diseases). Indeed, high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines increase hepcidin concentrations that lead to the sequestration of iron in cells of the reticuloendothelial system (functional iron deficiency). Iron parameters are often assessed only in the context of anemia, but iron deficiency, even without anemia, is present in about half of patients with inflammatory conditions. Iron deficiency worsens underlying chronic diseases and is an independent factor of morbidity and mortality. In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects iron storage, and transferrin saturation, which reflects the transport of iron. Serum ferritin is increased in an inflammatory context, and there is still no consensus on the threshold to be used in chronic inflammatory conditions. Nevertheless, recent recommendations of international guidelines agreed to define iron deficiency by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or transferrin saturation < 20%. Iron parameters remain, however, insufficiently assessed in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Indeed, clinical symptoms of iron deficiency, such as fatigue, are not specific and often confused with those of the primary disease. Iron repletion, preferably by the intravenous route to bypass tissue sequestration, improves clinical signs and quality of life. Because of the negative impact of iron deficiency on chronic inflammatory diseases and the efficacy of intravenous iron repletion, screening of iron parameters should be part of the routine examination of all patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

### Iron deficiency anemia: diagnosis and management [^116BQgD7]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) still remains universally problematic worldwide. The primary focus of this review is to critique articles published over the past 18 months that describe strategies for the diagnosis and management of this prevalent condition.

Recent Findings

The medical community continues to lack consensus when identifying the optimal approach for the diagnosis and management of IDA. Current diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of current biomarkers such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations and others, and cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA is based on supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations has expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since the introduction of low versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Summary

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include the design of an algorithm that is inclusive of multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics, which will provide direction in managing IDA, and distinguish between IDA from the anemia of chronic disease.
