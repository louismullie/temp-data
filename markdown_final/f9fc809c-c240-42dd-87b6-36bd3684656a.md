## Question

Common causes of pneumothorax 3 weeks after mastectomy surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common causes of pneumothorax 3 weeks after mastectomy surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the quality of evidence and whether data exist precisely at a 3-week postoperative window. Then, I should consider delayed intraoperative injuries related to mastectomy and reconstruction. Next, I will examine adjuvant therapy contributions in that timeframe. After that, I should assess patient-specific predispositions like cystic lung diseases and catamenial etiologies. I will then evaluate mechanical stressors during recovery, stratify risk by reconstruction type, estimate incidence cautiously, outline diagnostic and management principles, and close with prevention and practical pearls anchored to guideline recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the evidence base and timing, because I need to ensure we are not over-extrapolating; direct studies of pneumothorax exactly 3 weeks post-mastectomy are sparse, so I will synthesize from breast surgery complication series, reconstructive literature, and pleural disease guidelines to create a timing-aware differential while acknowledging limitations in precise incidence at that interval.

> Now, delayed manifestation of an occult intraoperative pleural breach remains a leading consideration in this window; wait, let me verify mechanisms that plausibly present weeks later rather than immediately, such as a tiny pleural laceration that initially sealed but reopened with postoperative cough, drain removal, tissue expander inflation, or early activity, and iatrogenic sources like paravertebral blocks or local anesthetic needle injury that may not become clinically evident until later, all of which have been documented across breast augmentation and reconstruction contexts with low but real incidence [^113qfAQ9] [^116xGj6a].

> Hold on, I should verify adjuvant therapy contributions within 2–4 weeks after surgery; chemotherapy can precipitate pneumothorax by necrosis of subpleural metastases or fragile cystic lesions, and in susceptible conditions like LAM it may trigger recurrent events, whereas my initial thought that postoperative radiation within 3 weeks might be a common cause is likely incorrect because reported radiation-associated pneumothorax tends to occur months later, so in a 3-week window chemotherapy and targeted agents are more plausible than early radiotherapy effects [^notfound] [^112dKkFD] [^115ys6u8].

> I need to check patient-specific predispositions that disproportionately affect women undergoing breast surgery, because these can surface during postoperative stress; LAM and Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome can underlie primary or recurrent pneumothorax and warrant evaluation with history, examination, and chest CT, and catamenial pneumothorax tied to thoracic endometriosis may fit a 3–4 week pattern relative to menses, so I should confirm cycle timing and recurrence patterns to avoid missing these high-impact diagnoses with genetic and long-term surveillance implications [^115LTwiz] [^115cao7v] [^1166Cg24].

> Next, I will consider mechanical and physiologic stressors during recovery, because I need to ensure we account for common postoperative triggers; vigorous coughing from respiratory infections or bronchospasm, constipation-related straining from opioids, and early return to heavy exertion increase intrathoracic pressure and can unmask a small pleural defect or rupture a bleb, aligning with guideline emphasis on tailored post-pneumothorax activity counseling [^117SMQbu].

> Let me now examine how reconstruction type modulates risk, since this may shift pretest probabilities; tissue expander or implant-based reconstruction has documented but low rates of intraoperative pneumothorax, autologous flap procedures using internal mammary vessel dissection carry higher albeit still low risk of pleural violation, and capsulectomy carries a small but feared pneumothorax risk, so at 3 weeks a delayed presentation could still reflect a small perioperative injury becoming clinically evident with recovery activities or subsequent expander manipulations [^notfound] [^117MEX1G].

> I should double-check incidence statements to avoid overprecision; there are no robust data quantifying the share of cases presenting exactly at 3 weeks after mastectomy, so any estimate is inferential from overall low rates in breast surgery and higher odds with reconstructive maneuvers, while remembering that spontaneous pneumothorax recurrence data are not directly generalizable but help frame background risk and the importance of definitive management in selected patients [^113RPZY3] [^1153wEDM] [^114BL8zB].

> For clinical differentiation, I will now review expected presentation and diagnostic steps, because I need to confirm how to separate routine postoperative discomfort from pneumothorax; unilateral sharp pleuritic chest pain with new dyspnea should prompt immediate imaging, with chest radiograph as first-line, bedside ultrasound helpful via absent lung sliding or lung point, and CT reserved for equivocal films or to evaluate underlying cystic lung disease that changes management pathways [^116sR2ub] [^116JFB9i].

> Let me reconsider management next to ensure alignment with current guidance; for stable, minimally symptomatic patients, conservative observation can be appropriate, but for symptomatic or larger pneumothoraces, initial needle aspiration or tube drainage is recommended, and if an air leak persists beyond a few days or the clinical course is unfavorable, consider escalation to VATS-based interventions, with autologous blood pleurodesis or endobronchial options when surgery is not feasible [^114qggtF] [^1117xqLm] [^115btqFy] [^116sVi3J] [^1127cxWL].

> But wait, in the post-mastectomy setting I need to ensure procedural choices preserve oncologic and reconstructive plans; chest tube placement should avoid damaging expanders or flaps, surgical drains should be assessed to exclude inadvertent pleural communication, thoracic surgery input is helpful when pleural breach is suspected intraoperatively or postoperatively, and regional anesthesia strategies should be ultrasound-guided to minimize pleural puncture risk [^113RPZY3] [^116xGj6a].

> For risk reduction, I should confirm measures across the perioperative continuum; preoperative screening for cystic lung disease in suggestive histories, ultrasound-guided paravertebral or alternative fascial plane blocks to reduce pneumothorax risk, early postoperative counseling on cough control, bowel regimen, and graded activity, and individualized advice on flying or pressure exposures after resolution are prudent, particularly in patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé or LAM who merit tailored counseling regarding high-risk activities [^113wShYG] [^1149bh2j] [^114MXaQ2] [^113BZNuk].

> Stepping back, I initially favored adjuvant radiation as a frequent 3-week culprit, but hold on, I should verify timing and indeed most radiation-related pneumothoraces occur later, which makes a delayed occult intraoperative pleural injury or chemotherapy-related mechanism more likely in this specific window, especially when immediate reconstruction or expander manipulation is part of the course [^115ys6u8] [^116qiHw7] [^113RPZY3].

> In summary, the most common cause of pneumothorax at approximately 3 weeks after mastectomy is best framed as a delayed presentation of a small intraoperative pleural injury or alveolar–pleural fistula, particularly in patients with immediate reconstruction or internal mammary dissection, with adjuvant chemotherapy-related lung injury the next most plausible contributor in those who started systemic therapy early, and clinicians should keep a high index of suspicion for LAM, Birt-Hogg-Dubé, and catamenial etiologies in women because these diagnoses alter recurrence prevention and family counseling [^113RPZY3] [^1153wEDM] [^116qiHw7] [^111aSkk8].

> As next steps, I need to ensure timely imaging, check the reconstruction details and adjuvant therapy timeline, screen for cystic lung disease when appropriate, manage per guideline-directed algorithms balancing symptom burden and air leak, and coordinate with surgical oncology and plastic surgery to protect reconstructive integrity while preventing recurrence and enabling on-time cancer therapy [^116JFB9i] [^113QLUFj].

Pneumothorax three weeks after mastectomy is most often due to **iatrogenic injury**, typically related to paravertebral or intercostal nerve blocks [^116xGj6a] or pleural breach during axillary dissection or internal mammary vessel exposure [^1153wEDM]. Other causes include **spontaneous pneumothorax** [^114BL8zB] in the setting of underlying lung disease (COPD, blebs, metastases) [^116sR2ub], delayed air leak from unrecognized intraoperative pleural injury, or barotrauma related to positive-pressure ventilation [^111JYgbx]. Less common causes include infection-related necrosis [^116sR2ub], chemotherapy-induced lung injury [^116qiHw7], and foreign body migration [^115uFYpp]. Diagnosis relies on chest X-ray or CT [^116sR2ub], and management is guided by size and symptoms, ranging from observation [^114qggtF] to chest tube placement [^1117xqLm] or surgery [^1127cxWL].

---

## Iatrogenic causes

- **Iatrogenic injury** is the most common cause of pneumothorax after mastectomy, particularly during axillary dissection or internal mammary vessel exposure [^1153wEDM].

- **Paravertebral or intercostal nerve blocks**: Pleural puncture during these blocks [^116xGj6a] can cause delayed pneumothorax.

- **Pleural breach during axillary dissection**: Direct pleural injury during axillary node dissection can cause delayed air leak and pneumothorax.

- **Internal mammary vessel exposure**: Pleural injury during internal mammary vessel exposure in reconstruction can cause pneumothorax [^1153wEDM].

---

## Spontaneous pneumothorax

**Spontaneous pneumothorax** [^116sR2ub] can occur post-mastectomy, particularly in patients with underlying lung disease such as COPD, emphysema, or pulmonary metastases [^116qiHw7]. Rupture of pre-existing subpleural blebs or bullae is another mechanism [^114BL8zB].

---

## Delayed air leak from unrecognized intraoperative pleural injury

Unrecognized pleural injury during surgery can cause a **delayed air leak** and pneumothorax weeks later; small pleural defects may initially seal and later reopen, resulting in delayed pneumothorax [^111rXUfH].

---

## Barotrauma from positive-pressure ventilation

Positive-pressure ventilation during or after surgery can cause **barotrauma** [^117AeqZx]; high airway pressures may lead to alveolar rupture and pneumothorax [^111JYgbx].

---

## Infection-related necrosis or abscess formation

**Infection-related necrosis** or abscess may erode the pleura and cause pneumothorax [^116sR2ub].

---

## Chemotherapy-induced lung injury

Chemotherapy-related **lung injury** can lead to pneumothorax; agents such as bleomycin are implicated [^116qiHw7] [^1174KRA8].

---

## Foreign body migration

**Foreign body migration**, including movement of surgical materials, can precipitate pneumothorax [^115uFYpp].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Prompt diagnosis is essential, beginning with **clinical assessment** [^116sR2ub] for chest pain, dyspnea, and decreased breath sounds. Chest X-ray is first line, with CT more sensitive for small pneumothoraces [^116W8uNH].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on pneumothorax **size**, symptoms, and **underlying cause**.

- **Observation**: For small, asymptomatic pneumothoraces [^114qggtF].

- **Needle aspiration or chest tube** [^1117xqLm] [^112qvRGY]: For larger or symptomatic pneumothoraces.

- **Surgical intervention**: For persistent air leak or recurrent pneumothorax [^1127cxWL] [^112q8Sze].

---

Three weeks post-mastectomy, pneumothorax most commonly arises from iatrogenic injury but may also result from spontaneous pneumothorax, delayed air leak, barotrauma, infection, chemotherapy, or foreign body migration. **Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management** are essential for optimal outcomes [^116sVi3J].

Spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) remains a significant health problem due to the high recurrence rate during thoracic drainage and conservative treatments. Even when surgical management is performed, the recurrence rate is estimated to be approximately 10%–20%. Therefore, reinforcement of the visceral pleura around the staple line has been used in clinical practice. Nevertheless, the best procedure has not yet been established, and the results are by no means satisfactory at present. The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors for recurrence of pneumothorax after surgery.

### Pneumothorax as a complication of liposuction [^111JYgbx]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Spontaneous pneumothoraxes may occur during surgery since various disease processes can weaken lung tissue, leading to the formation of blebs and bullae. These are prone to rupture during surgery due to high ventilation pressure and spikes in pulmonary pressure during changes in oxygen tanks or intraoperative positions.

Although recognized as a possible complication of liposuction, the exact incidence of pneumothorax during this procedure has not been established. A previous study on cosmetic liposuction by Kaoutzanis et al. found pulmonary complications to be the second most common complication, with an incidence rate of 0.1%. However, it is unclear what percentage of these were pneumothoraxes, as the authors speculate the category likely includes dyspnea, pulmonary edema, and lung collections.

In a 2003 case series of 92 consecutive high-volume liposuction patients, Richards reported 3 cases of pneumothorax (3.3%). All were detected postoperatively in the recovery room with desaturation and symptoms of hypoxia, and all were treated with chest tubes. In a survey of tumescent liposuction procedures performed under local anesthesia from 39 centers, Hanke et al. reported 1 case of pneumothorax out of 702 procedures (0.14%).

The literature regarding pneumothorax complicating liposuction is otherwise limited to case reports. Preventative safety measures have been slow to develop, but a few possible risk factors have been proposed. Richards considered that thinner tumescent cannulas might create a higher risk.

In specific circumstances concerning pneumothorax, particularly for patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, the ERN GENTURIS 2024 guidelines recommend considering a clinical diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome in the absence of a detectable FLCN pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant. This consideration is warranted if one major criterion or two minor criteria are present.

- **Major criterion**: More than 5 fibrofolliculomas or trichodiscomas, with at least one histologically confirmed, of adult onset.

- **Minor criteria**:
	- **Lung**: Bilateral basally located pulmonary cysts with no other apparent cause.
	- **Kidney**: Onset at less than 50 years, multifocal or bilateral renal cancer, or renal cancer of mixed chromophobe and oncocytic histology.
	- **Family history**: A first-degree relative with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome.

### Pneumothorax as a complication of liposuction [^117AeqZx]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Pneumothorax is the accumulation of gas within the pleural space. It is a rare complication of several plastic surgical procedures, including breast augmentation and abdominoplasty. Pneumothoraxes may occur spontaneously or as a result of direct trauma to the lung or chest wall.

In a surgical setting, traumatic pneumothoraxes are caused by intraoperative laceration of the pleura, needle puncture with injection of local anesthetic, or barotrauma as air is forced into the pleural cavity due to increased pressure in the surgical pocket. Iatrogenic trauma may create a lung laceration that allows air to escape into the pleural space and not return, creating a "ball valve" effect. This is called a tension pneumothorax and leads to a potentially lethal progressive buildup of air and tension, which is magnified under positive-pressure ventilation. Tension pneumothorax can also follow spontaneous pneumothorax, although such cases are less common.

### Pneumothorax as a complication of breast augmentation [^113qfAQ9]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Pneumothorax is a recognized complication of breast augmentation, which, until now, was thought to be rare. The authors hypothesize that it is more common than generally appreciated.

- **Methods**: A fax survey was sent to 363 members of the California Society of Plastic Surgeons in 2001, questioning their experience with this complication.

- **Results**: The survey response rate was 50 percent, revealing that one in three members of the California Society of Plastic Surgeons had at least one patient who experienced a pneumothorax, and one in ten had experienced two or more complications of pneumothorax while performing breast augmentation. Sixty-two members reported a total of 83 separate pneumothoraces in their career. No local or hypodermic needle injections were used in 24 percent of these patients. Fifty-five percent of patients were hospitalized, with 71 percent of the cases paid for by insurance companies. Treatment consisted of observation and repeated chest radiograph in 33 percent, needle aspiration alone in 16 percent, and chest tube insertion in 47 percent.

- **Conclusions**: The cause is difficult to determine, but causes suspected by respondents included intraoperative laceration of the pleura (43 percent), needle puncture at the time of local injection (37 percent), ruptured pulmonary blebs during or after the procedure (16 percent), and high anesthetic ventilation pressures (3 percent). The authors believe the complication of pneumothorax is more common than generally appreciated and is not necessarily caused by negligence.

### Tension pneumothorax, is it a really life-threatening condition [^112kVbxP]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

In conclusion, although tension pneumothorax is not uncommon, clinically fatal tension pneumothorax is extremely rare. The risk of tension pneumothorax is associated with the size of the largest bullae and the presence of fibrotic adhesion. Although tension pneumothorax can present without hemodynamic instability, it requires immediate decompression because significant hemodynamic deterioration can occur as a late manifestation.

### Complications of aesthetic and reconstructive breast implant capsulectomy: An analysis of 7486 patients using nationwide outcomes data [^117MEX1G]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Pneumothorax may arguably represent the most feared complication of capsulectomy due to anatomical proximity to the pleura. Afshari et al. extrapolated a maximum incidence of 0.2% from CosmetAssure data without having access to pneumothorax as an explicit variable. In comparison, our TOPS data explicitly report pneumothorax rates of 0.06% for capsulectomy and 0% for capsulotomy. Subgroup analysis revealed pneumothorax rates of 0.05% and 0% in reconstructive and aesthetic patients, respectively. More frequent postoperative ER visits in the capsulectomy cohort (P = 0.0291) and more frequent postoperative readmissions among reconstructive patients (P < .0001) may support higher occurrences in these groups, given the urgent and often inpatient nature of pneumothorax management.

Our study is not without limitations. The self-reported nature of cases examined introduces room for selection bias and reporting errors. TOPS data also suffered from missing preoperative information in some cases, such as ASA classification, BMI, as well as smoking and diabetes status, all of which could impact demographic representation of study groups and interpretation of findings. Moreover, TOPS did not ensure rigorous reporting of irradiation history and pneumothorax, likely yielding underestimated incidence rates. Additionally, the TOPS database lacks data regarding the plane of initial implant insertion and subsequent capsular surgery, preventing further subgroup analysis in this context.

### Air drainage: An essential technique for preventing breast augmentation-related pneumothorax [^1119BVLz]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Pneumothorax is one of the most poorly understood and least frequently reported complications associated with breast augmentation, yet it presents as a dramatic and often extremely distressing event to both the patient and the surgeon. Additionally, this complication is associated with an estimated 10% occurrence of medicolegal consequences. A recent survey of 363 Californian plastic surgeons concerning the occurrence and outcome of breast augmentation-related pneumothorax suggested that the incidence of this complication could be more prevalent than previously reported. The author previously proposed barotrauma as the underlying mechanism responsible for the development of pneumothorax associated with breast augmentation. This study aimed to analyze the role of air drainage in preventing pneumothorax during the insertion of breast implants.

- **Methods**: A control group of five patients who experienced pneumothorax was compared with a group of six consecutive patients whose surgical pocket was drained of air during the insertion of the implant.

- **Results**: None of the study patients experienced pneumothorax.

- **Conclusions**: Air drainage from the surgical cavity during the insertion of the implant is extremely successful in preventing the development of breast augmentation-related pneumothorax. It is suggested that air drainage be introduced as a routine step in breast augmentation procedures, particularly in those that involve the insertion of large implants through small incisions.

### Erector spinae plane versus paravertebral nerve blocks for postoperative analgesia after breast surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^112HLFCB]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Paravertebral nerve blocks (PVBs) are frequently used to treat pain during and following breast surgery but have various undesirable risks such as pneumothorax. The erector spinae plane block (ESPB) also provides perioperative breast analgesia but is purported to be easier to administer with a favorable safety profile. However, it remains unknown if the new ESPB provides comparable analgesia to the decades-old PVB technique.

- **Methods**: Subjects undergoing unilateral or bilateral non-mastectomy breast surgery were randomized to a single-injection ESPB or PVB in a subject-blinded fashion (ropivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine; 20 mL unilateral or 16 mL/side for bilateral). We hypothesized that (1) analgesia would be non-inferior in the recovery room as measured on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) with ESPB, and (2) opioid consumption would be non-inferior in the operating and recovery rooms with ESPB.

- **Results**: Both pain scores and opioid consumption were higher in subjects with ESPBs (n = 50) than PVBs (n = 50; median NRS 3.0 vs. 0; 95% CI -3.0 to 0; p = 0.0011; and median morphine equivalents 2.0 vs. 1.5 mg; 95% CI -1.2 to -0.1; p = 0.0043). No block-related adverse events occurred in either group.

- **Conclusions**: PVBs provided superior analgesia and reduced opioid requirements following non-mastectomy breast surgery. To compare the relatively rare complications between the techniques will require a sample size 1–2 orders of magnitude greater than the investigation; however, without a dramatic improvement in safety profile for ESPBs, it appears that PVBs are superior to ESPBs.

### Management of pneumothorax: an update [^1141yb51]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to address pneumothorax as a global health problem. As of the time of writing, there remains significant variation in the management of pneumothorax. In recent years, there have been significant developments in the outpatient management of both primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP). This review will examine the latest evidence for the management of nontraumatic pneumothorax, both spontaneous and iatrogenic, including those associated with COVID-19 infection.

Recent findings suggest that outpatient management of both primary and SSP may be safe and feasible.

Outpatient management of both primary and SSP should be included in discussions with patients regarding treatment options.

### Pneumothorax in cystic fibrosis [^111oXHM8]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex genetic disease affecting many organs, although 85% of the mortality is due to lung disease. The natural history of lung disease in CF includes early and persistent infection, an exaggerated inflammatory response, structural airway changes (e.g. bronchiectasis), and progressive airway obstruction, ultimately leading to respiratory failure. As airway disease worsens, the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumothorax, increases and these complications can be serious. This review explores our understanding of the pathogenesis of pneumothorax in CF and its treatment.

- **Recent findings**: The CF Foundation Pulmonary Therapies Committee recently issued recommendations for treating hemoptysis and pneumothorax. Due to insufficient data for a systematic literature review leading to guidelines, these recommendations were developed through a formalized expert panel consensus process.

- **Summary**: We now have specific care recommendations for CF patients with pneumothorax.

### Pneumothorax as a complication of liposuction [^115sfiSy]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Pneumothorax is a rare complication of liposuction resulting from injury to the lung parenchyma. This study aimed to determine the incidence of pneumothorax complicating liposuction, describe an archetypal presentation, identify risk factors, and propose options for risk reduction.

In a retrospective chart review, liposuction procedures performed over a 16-year period by 8 surgeons in 1 practice were screened for pneumothorax. Cases featuring pneumothorax were analyzed to ascertain risk factors, presentation, and pathogenesis.

Among the 16,215 liposuction procedures performed during the study period, 7 pneumothoraxes were identified (0.0432%). Six (85.7%) were female, and three (42.9%) had previous liposuction. Six cases (85.7%) included liposuction of the axillary region. All cases featured depression of intra/postoperative oxygen saturations as the initial sign, and three (42.9%) were identified intraoperatively. All patients were transferred to a hospital for imaging. Five (71.4%) underwent chest tube placement, while two (28.6%) were treated with observation alone. Pneumothoraxes were left-sided in 4 cases (57.1%) and right-sided in 3 cases (42.9%). In early cases, 1.5-mm infiltration cannulas were used; in 2016, cannula size was changed to 3–4 mm for infiltration and 4–5 mm for liposuction.

Possible risk factors for pneumothorax include liposuction of the axilla, use of flexible infiltration cannulas, and scarring from previous liposuction. We recommend including pneumothorax as a potential complication during information sessions.

### Lymphangioleiomyomatosis: A new relative contraindication for breast conservation therapy [^115ys6u8]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Four months after the end of radiation treatment, the patient had a routine follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which revealed a spontaneous pneumothorax in the region of the prior radiation. She was asymptomatic but was admitted briefly for observation, and the pneumothorax resolved without intervention. On review of the patient's pretreatment CT scan as well as earlier scans, scattered thin-walled cysts compatible with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) were noted.

- **Serial computed tomography imaging of the thorax**:
	- A) Image at 1 month post-lumpectomy shows seroma in the lumpectomy bed and several small lung cysts, without evidence of pneumothorax.
	- B) Four months post-radiation, there is spontaneous pneumothorax in the region of the tangent radiation, and persistent lung cysts can be observed bilaterally.
	- C) Eight months post-radiation, there is repeat pneumothorax, partially loculated, and subcutaneous emphysema is also noted. Lung cysts persist bilaterally.

Approximately 1 month later, the patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was found to have a pneumothorax that did not improve with chest tube placement. She was admitted and underwent right-sided pleurodesis and apical pleurectomy, and intraoperatively was noted to have moderate-to-severe LAM. Three months later, the patient was readmitted for a pneumothorax and required two repeat pleurodeses. She was ultimately started on sirolimus for management of her lung disease and continues to follow up with the pulmonology department as well as our clinic.

### Predicting outcomes in primary spontaneous pneumothorax using air leak measurements [^112WZaoE]. Thorax (2019). Low credibility.

The initial treatment regime for primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is generic and non-personalized, often involving a long hospital stay while waiting for the air leak to cease. This prospective study of 81 patients with PSP, who required drain insertion, captured daily digital air leak measurements and assessed failure of medical management against prespecified criteria. Patients with a higher air leak on day 1 or 2 had a significantly longer hospital stay. If the air leak was ≥ 100 mL/min on day 1, the adjusted OR of treatment failure was 5.2 (95% CI 1.2 to 22.6, p = 0.03), demonstrating that early digital air leak measurements could potentially predict future medical treatment failure.

### Intraperitoneal migration of a hookwire following wide local excision of a breast lesion presenting as a spontaneous pneumothorax [^115uFYpp]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Hookwire migration is a rare complication of wide local excision surgery for breast neoplasia. We report the case of a 64-year-old woman who presented to the hospital with acute on chronic left upper quadrant and left scapular pain. She had undergone a hookwire-guided wide local excision of a right breast neoplasm 5 years previously. Her vital signs, clinical examination, and blood tests were unremarkable. A CT scan revealed a left-sided pneumothorax and a 20 cm metallic intraperitoneal foreign body transpiercing the diaphragm. A review of the patient's clinical record revealed that she experienced a vagal collapse during hookwire implantation. This article underlines the importance of clear communication between members of a multidisciplinary team involved in a staged surgical intervention and exemplifies that foreign bodies can migrate across large distances, sometimes against gravity, to cross multiple anatomical compartments and cause iatrogenic injuries multiple years after an index intervention.

### Demystifying the persistent pneumothorax: Role of imaging [^111rXUfH]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Post-surgical interventions:

Bronchopleural fistula (BPF) is a significant postoperative complication following lobectomy or pneumonectomy. The incidence is notably higher after pneumonectomy (2–20%) compared to lobectomy (0.5–3%). Surgical management is essential to limit airflow across the fistula, close the fistula, and evacuate the pleural space; it is equally important to protect the normal lung from the spillage of pleural fluid.

CT imaging (see Fig. 17) serves as a crucial noninvasive tool for identifying the location and size of this defect and is considered superior to bronchoscopy. On radiographs, the presence of a new or increased pneumothorax, a decrease in the air-fluid level, lack of progressive fluid accumulation, or a shift of the mediastinum away from the resected side following pneumonectomy suggests BPF. On CT, extraluminal air bubbles adjacent to a stump may be identified. Documenting complete resolution of pneumothorax after surgery is important. Regarding air travel, it is recommended to delay it by 1–3 weeks post-surgery or post-resolution of the pneumothorax.

- **Figure 17**: A 34-year-old male with a history of gunshot injury presents with persistent pneumothorax post-pneumonectomy. Axial (a, b) and coronal (c, d) post-pneumonectomy CT images reveal a dehiscent bronchial stump communicating with the pleural space (indicated by the thick arrow). Notice the discontinuity of the suture line (indicated by small arrows).

Penetrating injury context:

Thoracic penetrating injuries may result from ballistic trauma such as gunshot wounds or from nonballistic trauma including stab wounds or rib fractures (refer to Figs. 18 and 19). These can cause extensive damage which is not fully elaborated in the current text.

### Combining clinical, radiological and genetic approaches to pneumothorax management [^111aSkk8]. Thorax (2022). Low credibility.

Local demographics biased our cohort towards younger individuals, with few cases of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP). Overall, the 5-year recurrence rate was 38.6% ± 2.5%, which increased to 44.5% ± 3.4% by 10 years. For individuals 50 years or younger, the 5-year recurrence rate was 41.9% ± 2.8%, while it was only 20.7% ± 4.8% for those over 50 years, possibly due to higher mortality rates (39.3% ± 5.6% at 5 years for those over 50 years versus 1.0% ± 0.6% for those 50 years or younger). The comparatively high overall recurrence rate seen in our series may, therefore, reflect the predominance of younger patients.

The sex ratio was 3:1 male to female, with no mortality difference between sexes. However, the 10-year recurrence rate was significantly higher for females (63.1% ± 9.4% vs. 41.3% ± 3.5%, p = 0.041). This difference persisted when patients over 50 years were excluded (p = 0.017).

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) was diagnosed in two women (1.8% of 113 female cases), while thoracic endometriosis (catamenial pneumothorax) was diagnosed in 9 women (7.9% of female cases). Both patients with LAM experienced recurrences, as did 7 (77.8%) of the women with catamenial pneumothorax. These conditions may, therefore, contribute to the increased risk of recurrence observed in women.

### Pneumothorax as a complication of liposuction [^113qMn7L]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Pneumothorax is a rare complication of liposuction resulting from injury to the lung parenchyma.

- **Objectives**: This study aimed to determine the incidence of pneumothorax complicating liposuction, describe an archetypal presentation, identify risk factors, and propose options for risk reduction.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective chart review, liposuction procedures performed over a 16-year period by eight surgeons in one practice were screened for pneumothorax. Cases featuring pneumothorax were analyzed to ascertain risk factors, presentation, and pathogenesis.

- **Results**: Among the 16,215 liposuction procedures performed during the study period, seven pneumothoraxes were identified (0.0432%). Six (85.7%) were female. Three (42.9%) had previous liposuction. Six cases (85.7%) included liposuction of the axillary region. All cases featured depression of intra/postoperative oxygen saturations as the initial sign. Three (42.9%) were identified intraoperatively. All patients were transferred to a hospital for imaging. Five (71.4%) underwent chest tube placement, while two (28.6%) were treated with observation alone. Pneumothoraxes were left-sided in four cases (57.1%) and right-sided in three cases (42.9%). In early cases, 1.5-mm infiltration cannulas were used; in 2016, cannula size was changed to 3–4 mm for infiltration and 4–5 mm for liposuction.

- **Conclusions**: Possible risk factors for pneumothorax include liposuction of the axilla, use of flexible infiltration cannulas, and scarring from previous liposuction. We recommend including pneumothorax as a potential complication during informed consent discussions.

### Patient perspectives on management of pneumothorax in lymphangioleiomyomatosis [^114BUcHM]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

The American College of Chest Physicians Delphi Consensus Statement on the management of spontaneous pneumothorax recommended pleurodesis after the first secondary spontaneous pneumothorax to prevent recurrence, and evaluation of patients' perspectives regarding pneumothorax treatment was identified as a future research priority. Patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) are an ideal population for performing these studies since pneumothorax occurs and recurs more commonly in LAM than in any other chronic pulmonary disorder.

- **Study design and participants**: A 23-item questionnaire evaluating opinions of pneumothorax treatment was distributed to 615 patients in the LAM Foundation patient database, with a response rate of 52%.

- **Results**: Of the respondents, 69% (216 of 314 patients) reported a history of radiographically documented pneumothorax, and 181 patients (84%) reported at least one pleurodesis procedure. Neither a history of pneumothorax nor surgical management of pneumothorax affected reported oxygen use or perception of overall lung function; however, 41% thought that their pneumothorax had contributed to a decline in lung function. Few patients (12%) worried frequently about a pneumothorax developing, but one-third made lifestyle modifications due to fear of pneumothorax. Extensive pain associated with chest tube placement and inadequate pain management throughout treatment were frequent concerns. Only 25% of respondents thought that pleurodesis was appropriate for a first pneumothorax, while 60% favored pleurodesis for a second pneumothorax.

### Incidence of pneumothorax during tissue expander-implant reconstruction and algorithm for intraoperative management [^113RPZY3]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Iatrogenic pneumothorax is a serious intraoperative complication of immediate breast reconstruction with tissue expanders. However, there is a paucity of literature regarding the incidence or management of intraoperative pneumothorax in the breast reconstruction patient population.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective chart review on prospectively collected data from all patients undergoing immediate breast reconstruction with tissue expanders from 1992 to 2012 to determine institutional incidence. We also searched the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from 1998 to 2008 to determine national incidence.

- **Results**: A total of 9,653 tissue expanders were placed in 6,955 patients at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 1992 and 2012. There were 3 cases of pneumothorax during immediate breast reconstruction with tissue expanders. The incidence of pneumothorax is 0.03% per expander and 0.04% per patient. From the national database, there were 153 cases of pneumothorax during immediate breast reconstruction with tissue expanders in 27,612 patients. The overall national incidence of pneumothorax is 0.55% per patient.

- **Conclusions**: Our algorithm for management includes a thoracic surgery consultation intraoperatively. A chest tube should be placed at a site distal to the pleurotomy. The site of injury should be repaired primarily or patched as necessary. If the patient remains stable, it is safe to proceed with the placement of the tissue expander.

### Videothoracoscopic surgical approach for spontaneous pneumothorax: Review of the pertinent literature [^114BL8zB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with spontaneous pneumothorax, usually caused by a rupture of a subpleural bleb or bulla in the underlying lung, most commonly present with ipsilateral sudden chest pain and dyspnea. Spontaneous pneumothoraces are classified as primary or secondary. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in otherwise healthy patients, most commonly in tall, young, lean males, particularly those who smoke. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs as a complication of an underlying lung disease, most often chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

In either case, the goals of pneumothorax treatment are to eliminate intrapleural air collection and to prevent recurrence. In the first episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax, observation, simple aspiration, or chest tube drainage in proportion to clinical stability or the degree of pneumothorax are recommended as first-line therapies. The recurrence rate after these therapies has been reported to range from 16% to 52%, with a mean of 30%.

Treatment to prevent pneumothorax is essential under clinical conditions such as spontaneous pneumothorax with potential respiratory insufficiency, recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, or persistent pneumothorax. Under these conditions, a surgical option is considered for pneumothorax.

### Efficacy of bi-level erector spinae plane block versus bi-level thoracic paravertebral block for postoperative analgesia in modified radical mastectomy: a prospective randomized comparative study [^113wShYG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

However, the risk of pneumothorax, the long time to perform the block, and the high level of skills needed make some inexperienced anesthesiologists avoid the TPV block and instead use other techniques, such as the ESP block. This is a novel nerve-blocking technique first proposed by Forero et al. in 2016. It is generally implemented through the deposition of drugs into the fascial plane beneath the erector spinae muscle at the tip of the transverse process of the vertebra, thereby reducing the risk of pneumothorax and significant neurovascular damage.

The ESP block allows for anesthetic coverage similar to that of the TPV block. It is considered a peri-paravertebral regional anesthesia technique that is supposed to block the dorsal and ventral rami of the thoracic and abdominal spinal nerves, thereby blocking the anterior, posterior, and lateral thoracic and abdominal walls. The mechanism of action of the ESP block is probably related to the spread of the local anesthetic into the paravertebral space. This hypothesis is reinforced by the recent discovery identifying two slits at the medial and lateral ends of the superior costo-transverse ligament (SCTL) that can act as channels to the thoracic paravertebral space.

The TPV block is certainly one of the most effective techniques in pain control after radical mastectomy. In the work of Jacobs et al, it is considered the gold standard for major breast surgery. Several previous studies have documented that ultrasound-guided paravertebral block is an advanced regional anesthetic technique requiring a longer learning curve to master.

### Case report: COVID-19-related pneumothorax-case series highlighting a significant complication [^112ALKVR]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Pneumothorax is air entrapment in the pleural space. It occurs spontaneously or following trauma. Spontaneous pneumothorax is divided into primary and secondary pneumothorax. Primary pneumothorax occurs in the absence of underlying parenchymal lung diseases, whereas secondary pneumothorax affects diseased lungs. Pneumothorax is considered a medical emergency; hence, prompt identification and management are imperative for a favorable outcome.

Our patients developed pneumothoraces at different stages of the disease course. The first, second, and third patients developed pneumothorax on days 2, 7, and 15, respectively. Chen et al. reported pneumothorax as the first presentation in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. Subsequent case reports described COVID-19-associated pneumothorax with or without subcutaneous emphysema on the first day of diagnosis. Our case series supports the probability that pneumothorax happens in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia resulting from advanced alveolar damage, and the bronchiolar distortion and narrowing caused by SARS-CoV-2 leading to pulmonary bullae formation. Moreover, the severe cough associated with viral infections increases the intrapulmonary pressure, which may precipitate bullae rupture and pneumothorax formation.

### Simple aspiration versus intercostal tube drainage for primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults [^112BqQKk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

For management of pneumothorax that occurs without underlying lung disease, also referred to as primary spontaneous pneumothorax, simple aspiration is technically easier to perform than intercostal tube drainage. In this systematic review, we seek to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of simple aspiration versus intercostal tube drainage for management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. This review was first published in 2007 and was updated in 2017.

- **Objectives**: To compare the clinical efficacy and safety of simple aspiration versus intercostal tube drainage for the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (1966 to January 2017); and Embase (1980 to January 2017). We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry for ongoing trials (January 2017). We checked the reference lists of included trials and contacted trial authors. We imposed no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults 18 years of age and older with primary spontaneous pneumothorax that compared simple aspiration versus intercostal tube drainage.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. We combined studies using the random-effects model.

- **Main results**: Of 2332 publications obtained through the search strategy, seven studies met the inclusion criteria; one study

### Ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral blockade: A retrospective study of the incidence of complications [^116xGj6a]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

The benefits of thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) have been demonstrated for patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer. However, pleural puncture resulting in pneumothorax is a serious complication associated with traditional approaches using guidance from anatomic landmarks and nerve stimulation and may contribute to the low utilization of this block. An ultrasound-guided technique has the potential to reduce complications by providing direct visualization of the paravertebral space during needle manipulation. We evaluated the complications using a single-injection, transverse, in-plane ultrasound-guided technique for paravertebral blockade in patients undergoing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction for breast cancer treatment or prophylaxis.

- **Methods**: Data from all patients who underwent TPVB between January 1, 2010, and December 3, 2013, at Massachusetts General Hospital was prospectively recorded in a computerized database. All blocks were placed for postoperative analgesia after unilateral or bilateral mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for any patient who developed complications including accidental pleural puncture, symptomatic pneumothorax, hypotension, or bradycardia, as well as signs and symptoms of toxicity or effects of local anesthetic outside of the paravertebral space.

- **Results**: Eight hundred fifty-six patients underwent a total of 1427 thoracic paravertebral injections (285 unilateral and 571 bilateral TPVB). There were 6 complications (0.70%; 99.2% confidence interval, 0.17%-1

### Bilateral pneumothoraces: A rarely described complication following augmentation mammaplasty [^114LeAPR]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Pneumothorax as a complication of augmentation mammaplasty has rarely been reported in the literature. In this article, we describe a case of bilateral iatrogenic pneumothoraces following aesthetic breast augmentation surgery in a thin patient who was a heavy smoker. Symptoms appeared progressively on the second postoperative day. Clinical examination showed abnormal pulmonary ventilation of both thoracic bases. Bilateral pneumothoraces were demonstrated by radiography and confirmed by computed tomography. The patient improved after surgical placement of two chest tubes, which were removed after six days. The authors suggest that a patient be informed of the risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax before undergoing aesthetic augmentation mammaplasty and recommend extreme caution when injecting local anesthetic, particularly in the submuscular pocket of a very thin patient.

Maintain FIO2 at concentrations approximating that of room air (25%) during surgery and the postoperative period. Monitor fluid replacement carefully, focusing more on colloid administration rather than crystalloid.

Sudden onset of acute chest pain syndrome suggestive of pleuropericarditis has been reported during Bleomycin for Injection infusions. Although each patient must be individually evaluated, further courses of Bleomycin for Injection do not appear to be contraindicated.

Pulmonary adverse events which may be related to the intrapleural administration of Bleomycin have been reported.

- **Idiosyncratic reactions**: In approximately 1% of the lymphoma patients treated with Bleomycin for Injection, an idiosyncratic reaction, similar to anaphylaxis clinically, has been reported. The reaction may be immediate or delayed for several hours and usually occurs after the first or second dose (see WARNINGS). It consists of hypotension, mental confusion, fever, chills, and wheezing. Treatment is symptomatic, including volume expansion, pressor agents, antihistamines, and corticosteroids.

- **Integument and mucous membranes**: These adverse reactions have been reported in approximately 50% of treated patients. They consist of erythema, rash, striae, vesiculation, hyperpigmentation, and tenderness of the skin. Hyperkeratosis, nail changes, alopecia, pruritus, and stomatitis have also been reported. It was necessary to discontinue bleomycin therapy in 2% of treated patients because of these toxicities.

### Case report: COVID-19-associated bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax-a literature review [^111e977D]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Coronaviridae is a family of RNA viruses that has captured the attention of epidemiologists, microbiologists, clinicians, and policymakers worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 has caused a massive impact on the global economy and everyday life and an unprecedented burden on the healthcare system. This infection has a broad spectrum of presentations that can range from asymptomatic disease to fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although most cases are mild, up to 5% of cases can develop severe illness, leading to multi-organ damage.

Spontaneous pneumothorax is a rare complication of COVID-19. Most reported cases of pneumothorax associated with COVID-19 lack traditional risk factors or underlying predisposing lung disease. At the time of writing, one case of COVID-19-associated spontaneous bilateral pneumothorax in COVID-19 has been described to the best of our knowledge.

### Litigation for pneumothorax as a complication of fine-needle aspiration of the breast [^112edeqC]. The British Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Pneumothorax is a rare but recognized complication of diagnostic needle aspiration of the breast. Two recent court cases alleging negligence have reached opposing opinions on very similar findings.

- **Methods**: A Medline literature search was carried out.

- **Results**: The reported incidence of pneumothorax after diagnostic aspiration of the breast in seven series varied between three in 100 and one in 10,000, but the weight of evidence tended towards the latter rate. Two studies reported that the complication is more common in the hands of trainees. It is not always possible to maintain the aspirating needle parallel or tangential to the chest wall. Pleural puncture may be more common than is apparent and is most common in the tail of the breast in a thin woman.

- **Conclusion**: It is important that breast clinicians are aware of the risk of pneumothorax but, provided proper care has been taken, this complication is not the result of a negligent act.

### Demystifying the persistent pneumothorax: Role of imaging [^116qiHw7]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Rarely, spontaneous pneumothorax can be the initial manifestation of an underlying lung cancer. In such cases, a pneumothorax can arise secondary to the rupture of necrotic neoplastic tissue into the pleural cavity (Fig. 15, a-d), rupture of a subpleural bleb, or formation of interstitial air due to partial bronchial obstruction by the tumor, and can be a complication of radiation therapy (Fig. 16, a–c) or chemotherapy.

- **Figure 15**: A 56-year-old male presented to the ED with right-sided chest pain. The frontal chest radiograph (a) demonstrated a large right hydropneumothorax, which did not completely resolve after chest tube placement (b). Coronal (c) and axial (d) CT images demonstrated a cavitating cancer within the right upper lung with an associated alveolopleural fistula (arrow). In addition, right paratracheal lymphadenopathy is seen. Extensive alveolar opacities in the re-expanded lung are consistent with pneumonia and re-expansion edema.

- **Figure 16**: A 60-year-old male with left upper lung carcinoma post-radiation therapy. The frontal chest radiograph (a) demonstrates a left apical pneumothorax (circle). Axial (b) and coronal (c) CT images demonstrate discontinuity of visceral pleura (arrow) with an associated alveolopleural fistula.

Lung metastases from sarcoma can result in pneumothorax, which, though rare, carries high mortality. Metastases from mesenchymal sarcomas can also present with cystic lung disease, which can be complicated by pneumothorax. Necrosis of a peripheral metastasis post-chemotherapy (particularly doxorubicin) or radiation can also occur.

### Pneumothorax as a complication of liposuction [^1179nBgF]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Pneumothorax is a potential complication that can arise from liposuction procedures. While it is considered rare, the risk should not be underestimated. During liposuction, there is an inadvertent possibility of puncturing the pleural cavity, leading to the accumulation of air in the pleural space. This can result in respiratory distress and requires immediate medical attention to prevent further complications.

- **Clinical presentation**: Patients may complain of sudden chest pain and difficulty in breathing. It is crucial for practitioners to recognize these symptoms promptly and differentiate them from other post-procedural discomforts.

- **Management and intervention**: Immediate measures typically involve the insertion of a chest tube to evacuate the air and allow the lung to re-expand. Prevention involves meticulous surgical technique and thorough knowledge of the patient's anatomy.

- **Incidence**: Although the exact incidence is not well-documented, awareness is essential for plastic surgeons who perform liposuction. Proper pre-operative assessment and post-operative monitoring are vital to ensure patient safety.

This study highlights the importance of recognizing and managing pneumothorax as a complication of liposuction to improve patient outcomes and ensure adequate surgical care.

### Pneumothorax as a complication of liposuction [^115oJGiG]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2020). Low credibility.

A total of 7 cases of pneumothorax were identified out of 16,215 liposuction cases, resulting in an incidence rate of 0.0432%. Among these cases, the patients' ages ranged from 35 to 56 years, with a mean age of 46 years. Six out of the 7 cases (85.7%) involved female patients. Moreover, three patients had a history of previous liposuction (42.9%). Liposuction of the axillary region was involved in six cases (85.7%), while the seventh case involved liposuction of the abdomen and waistline only. Positive-pressure ventilation at induction was used in six cases (85.7%). The BMI of these patients ranged from 22.7 to 29.1 kg/m², with a mean BMI of 26.4 kg/m². Four out of the 7 patients (51.7%) had BMIs in the overweight range (25–29.9 kg/m²), while the others were within the normal range (18–24.9 kg/m²).

Three cases presented intraoperatively with sudden oxygen desaturation (42.9%), with the lowest saturation recorded at 85%. An additional three patients first presented in the postoperative care unit with tachypnea, with the highest recorded respiratory rate being 44 breaths per minute. The seventh patient remained asymptomatic, being discharged with an oxygen saturation of 99% and a respiratory rate of 10–12 breaths per minute, before developing shortness of breath 16 hours postoperatively, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (14.3%).

Unilateral decreased breath sounds were noted on physical exams in six of the 7 cases (85.7%). However, there were no findings of tracheal deviation or tension pneumothorax. The left side was affected in 4 cases (57.1%).

### Risk of pneumothorax with internal mammary vessel utilization in autologous breast reconstruction [^1153wEDM]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Complications associated with autologous breast reconstruction are well reported in the literature. Regardless of the type of free flap harvested, the anastomosis is most commonly performed to the recipient internal mammary vessels. Although pneumothorax is a known possible complication of breast surgery, the incidence of pneumothorax in breast reconstruction involving the use of the internal mammary vessels is rarely discussed. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence of pneumothorax in deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap breast reconstruction.

- **Methods**: A single-institution review was performed examining the incidence of pneumothorax in cases of DIEP flap breast reconstruction with anastomosis to the internal mammary vessels over a 4-year period. Intraoperative irrigation was used to visually assess for evidence of pneumothorax during recipient vessel dissection and anastomosis. Anteroposterior chest radiographs were obtained on the first postoperative day to assess for pneumothorax. Additional variables analyzed included the type of retractor used during recipient vessel dissection and history of radiation.

- **Results**: A total of 180 patients underwent autologous DIEP breast reconstruction at our institution. The overall incidence of pneumothorax was 1.4 per 100 recipient vessel dissections and 2.2 per 100 patients undergoing breast reconstruction. There were a total of 4 cases of pneumothorax. Three were attributed to unknown causes, and 1 was due to direct injury to the parietal pleura via electrocautery.

- **Conclusion**: The use of the internal mammary vessels in autologous breast reconstruction presents a low incidence of pneumothorax. However, awareness of this potential complication is important for effective surgical planning and patient counseling.

### Reexpansion pulmonary edema following a posttraumatic pneumothorax: a case report and review of the literature [^115j5Gbx]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Cases of posttraumatic or spontaneous pneumothorax are usually treated by the insertion of a chest tube. A rare, potentially life-threatening complication of pneumothorax drainage is pulmonary reexpansion edema, which usually occurs after non-traumatic pneumothoraces. Early recognition and prompt symptom-oriented therapy of pulmonary reexpansion edema are necessary for a good outcome. Here we present a case of the development of a reexpansion pulmonary edema following a traumatic pneumothorax.

### Pneumothorax as a complication of liposuction [^116VMrfT]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Six of the seven (85.7%) pneumothorax cases occurred in procedures involving positive-pressure ventilation, which is a known risk factor for spontaneous pneumothorax. Although additional pressure was only applied at induction, it may nevertheless pose some additional risk. A paper from the orthopedic literature suggests that certain operative positions are related to increased risks of pneumothorax. We hypothesize that the positional changes involved in multiple-area liposuction may compound the risks associated with positive-pressure ventilation. For example, if the patient is on their side while receiving positive-pressure ventilation, the endotracheal tube may slide deeper toward a right bronchial mainstem position, increasing pressure in the right lung. However, the data are insufficient to draw conclusions, and further investigation is recommended.

Three cases (42.9%) were identified intraoperatively by sudden oxygen desaturation. Unfortunately, no records were made of the areas being liposuctioned at the time of desaturation. This information would be useful for further studies, and the authors recommend implementing measures to facilitate the collection of this valuable data in the future. Three cases (42.9%) were identified in the recovery room by high respiratory rate (up to 44 breaths per minute). Unilateral decreased breath sounds were detected in six of seven cases (85.7%). None of the cases featured tracheal deviation.

Shortness of breath presented in four out of seven cases (57.1%). One case remained asymptomatic until 16 hours after the operation.
