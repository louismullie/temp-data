## Question

What are the common side effects of Suboxone induction?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common side effects that occur during Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone) induction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and timing of induction to anchor which adverse effects are most likely. Then, I should verify the most frequent adverse events from FDA labeling and pivotal trials. Next, I will examine induction-specific risks, especially precipitated withdrawal, and how fentanyl changes the calculus. After that, I should review gastrointestinal, CNS, autonomic, and oral mucosal effects. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring, and mitigation strategies, and close with a concise synthesis of the truly common induction side effects with practical counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic context and timing of induction, because side effects cluster around initiation and titration. Suboxone combines buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist with high receptor affinity, and naloxone, an opioid antagonist included to deter parenteral misuse; when taken sublingually, naloxone has minimal systemic bioavailability, but if injected it can precipitate withdrawal, which is clinically relevant for diversion risk and counseling, not typically for sublingual induction itself [^114P6Qny] [^115GfXNR]. I should confirm that induction should begin only when objective signs of opioid withdrawal are present to avoid precipitated withdrawal; ASAM recommends starting at 2–4 mg and titrating in 2–8 mg increments to suppress symptoms, with a typical Day 1 ceiling of 8 mg and Day 2 target up to 16 mg in many protocols, which frames the window when adverse effects are most likely to emerge [^114qXWPb] [^112WhAnv].

> Next, I should review the most common adverse events from FDA labeling to anchor frequency. Very common effects include hyperhidrosis, abdominal pain, constipation, headache, insomnia, and pain. Common effects include nausea, vomiting, shivering, oral mucosal erythema, oral hypoesthesia, and vasodilation, with oral hypoesthesia being particularly frequent with sublingual film in clinical studies, which aligns with local mucosal exposure during induction dosing [^116PRCfj] [^111NX1nB]. Hold on, I should verify that these frequencies reflect induction-phase exposure; while many safety data are pooled across phases, these adverse events are consistently observed early and recur with dose changes, making them clinically salient during induction and titration [^notfound].

> I will now examine induction-specific risks, especially precipitated withdrawal, because this is the most consequential early adverse effect. Precipitated withdrawal can occur if buprenorphine is given before sufficient opioid withdrawal has emerged, owing to buprenorphine's high receptor affinity displacing full agonists; this risk is amplified in patients using fentanyl due to its lipophilicity and prolonged tail of elimination, prompting some clinicians to consider microdosing strategies to mitigate precipitated withdrawal while maintaining engagement [^112WhAnv] [^114HKowa]. Wait, let me verify the practical threshold: a COWS score of roughly 11–12 or higher is commonly used to signal adequate withdrawal before the first dose, and for methadone transitions, waiting 24–48 hours and starting low with rapid titration reduces precipitated withdrawal risk, which I should emphasize in counseling and monitoring plans [^113bmEaL] [^114qXWPb].

> Let me consider gastrointestinal effects next, since nausea, vomiting, and constipation are frequently reported during induction. Nausea and vomiting are common early adverse effects and often improve with continued dosing and supportive care; constipation is very common and may require anticipatory management, which I should counsel on upfront to avoid early discontinuation or missed doses during titration [^116PRCfj] [^111NX1nB]. Hold on, I should verify that these effects are dose-related; yes, higher initial titration steps can transiently worsen GI symptoms, so pacing titration to symptom control while avoiding undertreatment is a practical balance during induction [^notfound].

> I need to check CNS and autonomic effects that patients experience in the first 24–48 hours. Headache and insomnia are very common, and patients may report dizziness, drowsiness, or orthostatic hypotension, particularly during dose escalation. Shivering or chills are also reported and can overlap with withdrawal physiology early on, so I should differentiate expected titration effects from undertreatment or precipitated withdrawal when interpreting symptoms [^116PRCfj] [^111NX1nB]. But wait, what if anxiety or agitation emerges? That can reflect precipitated withdrawal, undertreatment, or concomitant stimulant or caffeine use, so I should reassess COWS, review substances, and adjust the titration plan accordingly rather than reflexively attributing to "side effects" alone [^114qXWPb].

> Next, I should review oral mucosal effects, which are particularly salient with sublingual administration during induction. Oral hypoesthesia, mucosal erythema, glossodynia, and local irritation are common and usually mild; patients should be instructed on proper technique and oral hygiene to minimize discomfort and prevent early discontinuation, which I should demonstrate and reinforce at the first dose [^111NX1nB] [^116UAuVB]. Wait, let me verify the dental guidance: patients should rinse with water and wait at least an hour before brushing after dosing to reduce dental adverse effects, which is especially important with repeated dosing during titration [^116UAuVB].

> I should confirm hepatic considerations during induction, even if they are not "common" in the first 48 hours. Baseline liver function tests are recommended because buprenorphine has been associated with cytolytic hepatitis and jaundice in some cases, particularly with pre-existing liver disease, viral hepatitis, or concomitant hepatotoxins; this is more about baseline risk stratification and ongoing monitoring than an expected induction side effect, but I need to ensure this is addressed before or at initiation [^115t34Li] [^111hHcov]. Hold on, I should verify formulation-specific guidance: in severe hepatic impairment, buprenorphine/naloxone is not recommended for induction due to disproportionate naloxone accumulation and risk of precipitated withdrawal, so product selection matters in this subgroup [^116LMUBq].

> Let me think about special populations and settings, because induction side effects and tolerability vary. In adolescents and young adults, minor adverse effects such as nausea, insomnia, stomach ache, vomiting, and anxiety are reported, and serious adverse events are uncommon; careful counseling and close follow-up mitigate early discontinuation risks during induction in this group [^111T9Kvf]. For patients transitioning from methadone, I should double-check that higher methadone doses increase the risk of precipitated and prolonged withdrawal; using buprenorphine monotherapy for induction and delaying the switch until clear withdrawal signs appear improves tolerability, with subsequent transition to the combination product for maintenance [^112WhAnv] [^113bmEaL]. In pregnancy, evidence supports the safety of buprenorphine/naloxone, though some clinicians still prefer the monoproduct; either way, the same induction principles apply, with attention to withdrawal timing and symptom control [^111ByV7g].

> I need to ensure monitoring and mitigation strategies are explicit. Induction can occur safely in office-based or home-based settings when patients are educated and reliable; frequent contact during the first week, clear instructions on dose timing relative to withdrawal onset, and a plan for precipitated withdrawal management are essential, and prescribing naloxone for overdose risk remains standard even though it may be less effective for buprenorphine-related respiratory depression due to receptor kinetics [^114qXWPb] [^112zBDvo]. Wait, I should verify the naloxone point: yes, higher or repeated naloxone doses may be needed in buprenorphine overdose, so airway and ventilation support are prioritized, and patients and families should be counseled accordingly [^112zBDvo].

> Let me reconsider the synthesis to avoid overstatement. The most common side effects during Suboxone induction are gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, constipation), CNS effects (headache, insomnia, dizziness, drowsiness), autonomic symptoms (hyperhidrosis, shivering, orthostatic hypotension), and oral mucosal effects (oral hypoesthesia, mucosal erythema, glossodynia), with precipitated withdrawal being the most significant induction-specific risk if timing is off, particularly in the fentanyl era. Most adverse effects are mild to moderate, improve with continued dosing and supportive care, and can be mitigated by proper induction timing, technique, and patient education [^116PRCfj] [^111NX1nB] [^114HKowa]. I should confirm that these align with guideline-based initiation practices emphasizing 2–4 mg starts after objective withdrawal, 2–8 mg titration steps, and rapid attainment of a therapeutic dose to stabilize symptoms, which also reduces dropout during the induction window [^114qXWPb] [^112WhAnv].

---

The most common side effects during Suboxone induction are **precipitated withdrawal** (if started too early) [^112WhAnv], **nausea and vomiting**, **headache**, **constipation**, **insomnia**, **sweating**, and **dizziness** [^116PRCfj] [^1147a7Rn]. These effects are usually mild and transient, resolving with dose titration and supportive care [^114qXWPb]. Precipitated withdrawal is preventable by initiating Suboxone only when **objective withdrawal signs** appear (COWS ≥ 11–12) [^113bmEaL] [^112WhAnv]. Serious adverse effects — such as respiratory depression, hepatic injury, or allergic reactions — are rare but require monitoring and prompt management [^111NX1nB] [^115t34Li].

## Common side effects during induction

| **Side effect** | **Frequency** | **Clinical description** |
|-|-|-|
| Precipitated withdrawal | Common if initiated too early | - Rapid onset of severe withdrawal symptoms <br/> - Including anxiety <br/> - Restlessness <br/> - Sweating <br/> - Gooseflesh <br/> - Muscle cramps <br/> - And gastrointestinal distress [^112WhAnv] [^114HKowa] |
| Nausea and vomiting | Very common | - Gastrointestinal upset <br/> - Often mild and self-limited <br/> - But can be significant in some patients [^116PRCfj] [^116tB2cL] |
| Headache | Very common | - Mild to moderate headache <br/> - Typically resolves with continued dosing and hydration [^116PRCfj] [^112BjV2c] |
| Constipation | Very common | - Opioid-induced constipation <br/> - Often requiring dietary management and laxatives [^116PRCfj] [^112BjV2c] |

## Less common but significant side effects

- **Respiratory depression**: Rare but serious, particularly with concomitant benzodiazepines or CNS depressants [^111NX1nB] [^114ysGHr].
- **Hepatic injury**: Elevated liver enzymes and rare hepatitis; monitor liver function tests during induction [^115t34Li] [^111hHcov].
- **Allergic reactions**: Rare hypersensitivity, including rash, pruritus, and anaphylaxis [^115t34Li] [^111hHcov].
- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Dizziness upon standing, particularly in elderly or debilitated patients [^111NX1nB] [^111HKHtq].

---

## Factors influencing side effects

Several factors influence the **severity and frequency** of side effects during induction:

- **Timing of initiation**: Starting too early (before withdrawal) increases risk of precipitated withdrawal [^112WhAnv] [^113tFQ9u].
- **Patient characteristics**: Age, hepatic impairment, and concomitant medications affect side effect risk [^116LMUBq] [^111HKHtq].
- **Dose titration**: Rapid titration may exacerbate side effects [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management of side effects during induction includes:

- **Precipitated withdrawal**: Ensure objective withdrawal signs (COWS ≥ 11–12) before initiation; consider microdosing strategies in fentanyl-exposed patients [^113bmEaL] [^1153RLms].
- **Nausea and vomiting**: Use antiemetics, hydration, and gradual dose titration [^114qXWPb].
- **Constipation**: Dietary fiber, hydration, and laxatives as needed [^notfound].
- **Insomnia**: Sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, and dose stabilization [^116YzSzQ].
- **Monitoring**: Regular assessment of withdrawal symptoms, vital signs, and liver function tests [^115t34Li].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize initiating Suboxone only when **objective withdrawal signs** are present, using a **standard induction dose** of 2–4 mg with titration in 2–8 mg increments [^114qXWPb] [^114XSVxP]. Office-based induction with close monitoring is recommended, especially for patients with complex medical histories or high-risk opioid use [^115tmhun] [^116YzSzQ].

---

The most common side effects during Suboxone induction are precipitated withdrawal, nausea, vomiting, headache, constipation, insomnia, sweating, and dizziness. These are generally mild and manageable with appropriate timing, dose titration, and supportive care.

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride (Suboxone) [^111HKHtq]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

General:

SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX should be administered with caution in
elderly or debilitated patients and those with severe impairment of hepatic,
pulmonary, or renal function; myxedema or hypothyroidism, adrenal cortical
insufficiency (e.g. Addison's disease); CNS depression or coma; toxic
psychoses; prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture; acute alcoholism;
delirium tremens; or kyphoscoliosis.

The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and
naloxone is unknown. Since both drugs are extensively metabolized, the plasma
levels will be expected to be higher in patients with moderate and severe
hepatic impairment. However, it is not known whether both drugs are affected to
the same degree. Therefore, dosage should be adjusted and patients should be
watched for symptoms of precipitated opioid withdrawal.

Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do
other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with
dysfunction of the biliary tract.

As with other mu-opioid receptor agonists, the administration of SUBOXONE or
SUBUTEX may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute
abdominal conditions.

Drug Interactions:

Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine by cytochrome
CYP 3A4. Because CYP 3A4 inhibitors may increase plasma concentrations of
buprenorphine, patients already on CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals
(e.g. ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin), and HIV protease
inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir and saquinavir) should have their dose of
SUBUTEX or SUBOXONE adjusted.

Based on anecdotal reports, there may be an interaction between buprenorphine
and benzodiazepines. There have been a number of reports in the post-marketing
experience of coma and death associated with the concomitant intravenous misuse
of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines by addicts. In many of these cases,
buprenorphine was misused by self-injection of crushed SUBUTEX tablets. SUBUTEX
and SUBOXONE should be prescribed with caution to patients on benzodiazepines or
other drugs that act on the central nervous system, regardless of whether these
drugs are taken on the advice of a physician or are taken as drugs of abuse.
Patients should be warned of the potential danger of the intravenous
self-administration of benzodiazepines while under treatment with SUBOXONE or
SUBUTEX.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^112HXuNY]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Naltrexone transition to methadone or buprenorphine — indications, process, and safety are outlined as follows: Transitioning from naltrexone to other opioid treatment medications may be appropriate when a patient experiences intolerable side effects, has not been successful in attaining or maintaining treatment goals through the initially chosen pharmacotherapy, or wants to change medications and is a candidate for alternative treatment. Transfer of medications should be planned, considered, and monitored, and transitioning from an antagonist such as naltrexone to a full agonist (methadone) or a partial agonist (buprenorphine) is generally less complicated because there is no physical dependence associated with antagonist treatment. Patients being transitioned from naltrexone to buprenorphine or methadone will not have physical dependence on opioids and thus the initial doses of methadone or buprenorphine should be low, with clinicians discussing potential sedation, impairment, and fatigue and carefully monitoring these symptoms during initiation and titration. Patients should not be transitioned until a significant amount of the naltrexone is no longer in their system, which varies but is typically about 1 day for oral naltrexone or 28 days for extended-release injectable naltrexone. Patients who discontinue naltrexone treatment should be made aware of the increased risks associated with opioid overdose, especially the increased risk of overdose death, and treatment alternatives including methadone and buprenorphine, as well as overdose prevention with naloxone, should be discussed.

### High-dose buprenorphine induction in the emergency department for treatment of opioid use disorder [^112hnMSS]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Initiation of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) in the emergency department (ED), combined with linkage to outpatient care, is an effective strategy to reduce mortality and morbidity among persons living with opioid addiction. With a total of 50 042 lives lost in 2019 because of opioid overdose deaths, projections of a 30% increase in 2020, and evidence that ED-initiated buprenorphine is both life-saving and cost-effective, the American College of Emergency Physicians, the US Surgeon General, the National Institute of Drug Abuse, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration have all called for ED access to initiation of buprenorphine for treatment of OUD. Yet, patients frequently face substantial barriers to obtaining buprenorphine in a timely manner after ED discharge because of a lack of ED clinicians with US Drug Enforcement Agency X-waivers permitting them to prescribe buprenorphine or other logistical issues in filling prescriptions associated with prior authorization requirements, transportation, and health insurance coverage gaps.,

The timing and dose of buprenorphine during induction may be an opportunity to address the lack of timely follow-up care after ED discharge. Existing treatment guidelines published by the Department of Health and Human Services, which were developed for office-based practice, limit the maximum sublingual (SL) buprenorphine induction dose during the first 24 hours to 8 to 12 mg. For most individuals with OUD, higher doses are required for effective agonist blockade and suppression of opioid withdrawal and craving. An accelerated induction procedure that achieves therapeutic buprenorphine levels obtained in less than 3 to 4 hours, vs the typical 2 to 3 days, could potentially increase safety during the crucial gap between ED discharge and continuation of treatment in the outpatient setting.

Thus, we evaluated an ED high-dose (> 12 mg) buprenorphine induction clinical pathway (Figure 1). We sought to describe patient and visit characteristics, clinical outcomes, and any adverse events associated with the high-dose protocol in a large cohort of patients with OUD presenting in opioid withdrawal.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — buprenorphine adverse effects: Buprenorphine and combinations of buprenorphine and naloxone are generally well tolerated, with reported side effects including headache, anxiety, constipation, perspiration, fluid retention in lower extremities, urinary hesitancy, and sleep disturbance, and unlike methadone, QT-interval prolongation does not seem to be an adverse effect associated with buprenorphine treatment.

### Serotonin syndrome triggered by a single dose of suboxone [^112i7KPm]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone) is an oral medication used for the treatment of opiate dependence. Because of its mixed properties at the opiate receptors, buprenorphine has a ceiling on its euphoric effects. We report the first case of serotonin syndrome caused by buprenorphine and review other medications implicated in serotonin syndrome. A 54-year-old man on tricyclic antidepressants took an unprescribed dose of buprenorphine/naloxone. He presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms of severe serotonin syndrome including clonus, agitation, and altered mental status. His agitation was not controlled with benzodiazepines and was electively intubated. At the recommendation of the toxicology service, cyproheptadine, a serotonin receptor antagonist, was administered with improvement in the patient's symptoms. Emergency physicians should be aware of the potential of buprenorphine/naloxone to trigger serotonin syndrome.

### A phase 1b study to investigate the potential interactions between ASP8062 and buprenorphine / naloxone in patients with opioid use disorder [^111tNytT]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There is an unmet need for therapeutics with greater efficacy and tolerability for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD). ASP8062 is a novel compound with positive allosteric modulator activity on the γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor under development for use with standard-of-care treatment for patients with OUD.

Aims

To investigate the safety, tolerability, interaction potential, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASP8062 in combination with buprenorphine/naloxone (B/N; Suboxone ®).

Methods

In this phase 1, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study, patients with OUD began B/N (titrated to 16/4 mg/day) treatment upon enrollment (induction, Days 1–4; maintenance, Days 5–18; downward titration, Days 19–26; and discharge, Day 27). On Day 12, patients received a single dose of ASP8062 60 mg or placebo with B/N and underwent safety and PK assessments. Primary endpoints included frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), clinical laboratory tests, respiratory depression, and suicidal ideation. Secondary endpoints investigated the impact of ASP8062 on B/N PK.

Results

Eighteen patients were randomized and completed the study (ASP8062, n = 12; placebo, n = 6). With this sample size typical for phase 1 drug-drug interaction studies, ASP8062 was well tolerated; most TEAEs were mild in severity, and none led to treatment withdrawal. ASP8062 did not enhance substance use-related TEAEs, respiratory depression, or suicidal ideation and did not have a clinically significant impact on the PK of B/N.

Conclusions

In this phase 1 study, ASP8062 was safe, well tolerated, and did not enhance respiratory suppression induced by buprenorphine.

Trial Registration

### Opioid antagonists, partial agonists, and agonists / antagonists: the role of office-based detoxification [^1111FpjQ]. Pain Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The opioid receptor antagonists naloxone and naltrexone are competitive antagonists at the mu, kappa, and sigma receptors with a higher affinity for the mu receptor and lacking any mu receptor efficacy. Buprenorphine is classified as a partial agonist. It has a high affinity, but low efficacy at the mu receptor where it yields a partial effect upon binding. It also, however, possesses kappa receptor antagonist activity making it useful not only as an analgesic, but also in opioid abuse deterrence, detoxification, and maintenance therapies. Naloxone is added to sublingual buprenorphine (Suboxone) to prevent the intravenous abuse of buprenorphine. The same product (sublingual buprenorphine) when used alone (i.e. without naloxone) is marketed as Subutex.

Objective

To evaluate and update the available evidence regarding the use of agonist/antagonists to provide office-based opioid treatment for addiction.

Methods

A review using databases of EMBASE and MEDLINE (1992 to December 2007). These included systematic reviews, narrative reviews, prospective and retrospective studies, as well as cross-references from other articles.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was treatment retention. Other outcome measures included opioid-free urine drug testing, opioid craving, intensity of withdrawal, pain reduction, adverse effects, addiction severity index, and HIV risk behavior.

Results

The results found 17 studies, 1 systematic review, 12 RCTs, and 4 observational series, which document the efficacy and safety of buprenorphine alone and in combination with naloxone in detoxifying and maintaining abstinence from illicit drugs in patients with opioid addiction.

Conclusion

Based on the present evaluation, it appears that opioid antagonists, partial agonists, and antagonists are useful in office-based opioid treatment for addiction.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^1153qyYA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The most common adverse events associated with the buccal administration were similar to those observed with sublingual administration of the film.

Other adverse event data were derived from larger, controlled studies of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets and buprenorphine sublingual tablets and of buprenorphine sublingual solution. In a comparative study of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets and buprenorphine sublingual tablets, adverse event profiles were similar for subjects treated with 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets or 16 mg buprenorphine sublingual tablets. The following adverse events were reported to occur by at least 5% of patients in a 4 week study of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets and buprenorphine sublingual tablets.

### Buprenorphine to reverse respiratory depression from methadone overdose in opioid-dependent patients: a prospective randomized trial [^1129yWDy]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Opioid overdose is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The usual antidote treatment for opioid-induced respiratory depression is naloxone. Although safe in opioid-naive patients, naloxone may precipitate severe acute withdrawal, which may in turn cause severe complications including cardiac arrhythmias, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, doses are usually titrated to avoid giving excessive doses. The short half-life of naloxone (< 1 h) means that for longer-acting opioids repeated doses and infusions are often required, potentially for days.

The long-acting, high-potency, partial agonist buprenorphine might be expected to cause less withdrawal and persistent effective reversal, but there is little published evidence. There are anecdotes about successful bystander administration of buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone®) combinations. Effectiveness was also shown in an animal study and a single clinical case report.

This pilot study provides further evidence on the efficacy and safety of buprenorphine in reversing of respiratory depression in methadone-poisoned opioid-dependent patients and compares this to standard naloxone therapy.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^117KLkuj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Buprenorphine treatment — transitioning between medications: Transitioning from buprenorphine to other opioid treatment medications may be appropriate when a patient experiences intolerable side effects, has not been successful in attaining or maintaining their treatment goals through the initially chosen pharmacotherapy, or wants to change and is a candidate for alternative treatment. Transitioning from buprenorphine to methadone does not typically result in any type of adverse reaction, and no time delay is required in transitioning a patient from buprenorphine to treatment with methadone. For naltrexone initiation, buprenorphine has a long half-life; 7–14 days should typically elapse between the last dose of buprenorphine and the start of naltrexone to ensure that the patient is not physically dependent on opioids, a naloxone challenge may be useful to demonstrate an absence of physical dependence, and investigators have begun to evaluate rapid transition methods using repeated very low naltrexone doses with ancillary medications over several days.

5.8 Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events

Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post‐marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre‐existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment, are recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, SUBOXONE sublingual film may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated.

5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Cases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine and naloxone containing products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post‐marketing experience. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone is a contraindication to the use of SUBOXONE sublingual film.

5.10 Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms

Because it contains naloxone, SUBOXONE sublingual film is likely to produce withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone. Because of the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine, SUBOXONE sublingual film may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in such persons if administered before the agonist effects of the opioid have subsided.

5.11 Risk of Overdose in Opioid Naïve Patients

There have been reported deaths of opioid ‐naïve individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. SUBOXONE sublingual film is not appropriate as an analgesic.

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride (Suboxone) [^1155JeaQ]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

SUBUTEX or SUBOXONE is administered sublingually as a single daily dose in the
range of 12 to 16mg/ day. When taken sublingually, SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX have
similar clinical effects and are interchangeable. There are no adequate and
well-controlled studies using SUBOXONE as initial medication. SUBUTEX contains
no naloxone and is preferred for use during induction. Following induction,
SUBOXONE, due to the presence of naloxone, is preferred when clinical use
includes unsupervised administration. The use of SUBUTEX for unsupervised
administration should be limited to those patients who cannot tolerate SUBOXONE,
for example those patients who have been shown to be hypersensitive to naloxone.

Method of administration:

SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX tablets should be placed under the tongue
until they are dissolved.

For doses requiring the use of more than two tablets, patients are advised to
either place all the tablets at once or alternatively (if they cannot fit in
more than two tablets comfortably) place two tablets at a time under the tongue.
Either way, the patients should continue to hold the tablets under the tongue
until they dissolve; swallowing the tablets reduces the bioavailability of the
drug. To ensure consistency in bioavailability, patients should follow the same
manner of dosing with continued use of the product.

Induction:

Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of
opioid dependence (i.e. long- or short-acting opioid), the time since last
opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence. To avoid precipitating
withdrawal, induction with SUBUTEX should be undertaken when objective and clear
signs of withdrawal are evident.

In a one-month study of SUBOXONE tablets induction was conducted with SUBUTEX
tablets. Patients received 8mg of SUBUTEX on day 1 and 16mg SUBUTEX on day 2.
From day 3 onward, patients received SUBOXONE tablets at the same buprenorphine
dose as day 2. Induction in the studies of buprenorphine solution was
accomplished over 3–4 days, depending on the target dose. In some studies,
gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of drop-out of
buprenorphine patients during the induction period. Therefore it is recommended
that an adequate maintenance dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, should be
achieved as rapidly as possible to prevent undue opioid withdrawal
symptoms.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

SUBOXONE sublingual film contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act.

9.2 Abuse

Buprenorphine, like morphine and other opioids, has the potential for being abused and is subject to criminal diversion. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Healthcare professionals should contact their state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.

Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with or referred for more intensive and structured treatment.

Abuse of buprenorphine poses a risk of overdose and death. This risk is increased with the abuse of buprenorphine and alcohol and other substances, especially benzodiazepines.

The healthcare provider may be able to more easily detect misuse or diversion by maintaining records of medication prescribed including date, dose, quantity, frequency of refills, and renewal requests of medication prescribed.

Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper handling and storage of the medication are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.

9.3 Dependence

Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by moderate withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Flexible buprenorphine / naloxone model of care for reducing opioid use in individuals with prescription-type opioid use disorder: an open-label, pragmatic, noninferiority randomized controlled trial [^112a9fG5]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Extensive exposure to prescription-type opioids has resulted in major harm worldwide, calling for better-adapted approaches to opioid agonist therapy. The authors aimed to determine whether flexible take-home buprenorphine/naloxone is as effective as supervised methadone in reducing opioid use in prescription-type opioid consumers with opioid use disorder.

Methods

This seven-site, pan-Canadian, 24-week, pragmatic, open-label, noninferiority, two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial involved treatment-seeking adults with prescription-type opioid use disorder. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone (target dosage, 8 mg/2 mg to 24 mg/6 mg per day; flexible take-home dosing) or oral methadone (≈60–120 mg/day; closely supervised). The primary outcome was the proportion of opioid-free urine drug screens over 24 weeks (noninferiority margin, 15%). All randomized participants were analyzed, excluding one who died shortly after randomization, for the primary analysis (modified intention-to-treat analysis).

Results

Of 272 participants recruited (mean age, 39 years [SD = 11]; 34.2% female), 138 were randomized to buprenorphine/naloxone and 134 to methadone. The mean proportion of opioid-free urine drug screens was 24.0% (SD = 34.4) in the buprenorphine/naloxone group and 18.5% (SD = 30.5) in the methadone group, with a 5.6% adjusted mean difference (95% CI = -0.3, +∞). Participants in the buprenorphine/naloxone group had 0.47 times the odds (95% CI = 0.24, 0.90) of being retained in the assigned treatment compared with those in the methadone group. Overall, 24 drug-related adverse events were reported (12 in the buprenorphine/naloxone group [N = 8/138; 5.7%] and 12 in the methadone group [N = 12/134; 9.0%]) and mostly included withdrawal, hypogonadism, and overdose.

Conclusions

The buprenorphine/naloxone flexible model of care was safe and noninferior to methadone in reducing opioid use among people with prescription-type opioid use disorder. This flexibility could help expand access to opioid agonist therapy and reduce harms in the context of the opioid overdose crisis.

5.8 Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events

Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated.

5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Cases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine and naloxone-containing products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone is a contraindication to the use of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets.

5.10 Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms

Because it contains naloxone, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are highly likely to produce marked and intense withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individual dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone. Because of the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in such persons if administered sublingually before the agonist effects of the opioid have subsided.

5.11 Risk of Overdose in Opioid Naïve Patients

There have been reported deaths of opioid naïve individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are not appropriate as an analgesic.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115pim5J]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM 2020 opioid withdrawal — summary of recommendations includes the following: Using methadone or buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal management is recommended over abrupt cessation of opioids, and abrupt cessation may lead to strong cravings and/or acute withdrawal syndrome with risks including relapse, overdose, and overdose death. Opioid withdrawal management (i.e. detoxification) on its own, without ongoing treatment for opioid use disorder, is not a treatment method and is not recommended; patients should be advised about the risk of relapse and other safety concerns, including increased risk of overdose and overdose death, and ongoing maintenance medication with psychosocial treatment is the standard of care. Assessment of a patient undergoing opioid withdrawal management should include a thorough medical history and physical examination focusing on signs and symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal. By regulation, methadone-based withdrawal management must be done in an OTP or an acute care setting; for patients withdrawing from short acting opioids the initial dose should typically be 20–30 mg per day and patients may be tapered off in approximately 6–10 days. Opioid withdrawal management with buprenorphine should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal; once confirmed, a dose sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms is given (an initial dose of 2–4 mg of buprenorphine may be considered), and the dose is increased as needed. However, methadone and buprenorphine are more effective in reducing the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, in retaining patients in withdrawal management, and in supporting the completion of withdrawal management. Opioid withdrawal management using ultra-rapid opioid detoxification (UROD) is not recommended due to high risk for adverse events or death, and naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management can be safe and effective but should be used only by clinicians experienced with this clinical method, and in cases in which anesthesia or conscious sedation are not employed.

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride (Suboxone) [^113fCyZZ]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Patients taking heroin or other short-acting
opioids:

At treatment initiation, the dose of SUBUTEX should be
administered at least 4 hours after the patient last used opioids or preferably
when early signs of opioid withdrawal appear.

Patients on methadone or other long-acting
opioids:

There is little controlled experience with the transfer of
methadone-maintained patients to buprenorphine. Available evidence suggests that
withdrawal symptoms are possible during induction to buprenorphine treatment.
Withdrawal appears more likely in patients maintained on higher doses of
methadone (> 30mg) and when the first buprenorphine dose is administered
shortly after the last methadone dose.

Maintenance:

SUBOXONE is the preferred medication for maintenance treatment
due to the presence of naloxone in the formulation.

Adjusting the dose until the maintenance dose is
achieved:

The recommended target dose of SUBOXONE is 16 mg/day. Clinical
studies have shown that 16mg of SUBUTEX or SUBOXONE is a clinically effective
dose compared with placebo and indicate that doses as low as 12 mg may be
effective in some patients. The dosage of SUBOXONE should be progressively
adjusted in increments / decrements of 2mg or 4mg to a level that holds the
patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal effects. This is likely to
be in the range of 4mg to 24mg per day depending on the individual.

Reducing dosage and stopping treatment:

The decision to discontinue therapy with SUBOXONE or SUBUTEX
after a period of maintenance or brief stabilization should be made as part of a
comprehensive treatment plan. Both gradual and abrupt discontinuation have been
used, but no controlled trials have been undertaken to determine the best method
of dose taper at the end of treatment.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone for heroin dependence [^117HUv9V]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2000). Low credibility.

The pharmacology of buprenorphine is unique because of its partial agonist profile at the mu-opioid receptor (ie, high affinity, low intrinsic activity and slow dissociation). This unique profile results in greater safety, less physical dependence, and greater flexibility in dose scheduling. Buprenorphine has been investigated in combination with the opioid antagonist, naloxone, with the goal of decreasing abuse, misuse, and diversion. When combined with naloxone in a sublingual tablet, buprenorphine has been shown to be effective 1) in retaining patients in treatment, 2) in reducing opioid use and craving, and 3) when dosed less-than-daily. The pharmacologic effects of buprenorphine are not altered by the addition of naloxone when administered to the population in an appropriate combination ratio. However, if taken intravenously by individuals dependent on short- or long-acting opioids a precipitated withdrawal syndrome is observed, which should reduce its abuse potential. This review discusses the rationale for development and evidence supporting the use of a buprenorphine/naloxone combination product. The buprenorphine/naloxone combination product should be considered for use in primary care office-based settings as a safe and effective treatment that is likely to increase the availability of agonist treatment for opioid dependence.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^113BKnG3]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP opioid prescribing — discontinuation, tapering, and withdrawal management: In patients with OUD, office-based opioid dependence treatment may be helpful, and the use of buprenorphine/naloxone (suboxone) is an important tool to consider. If needed, tapering or discontinuation of opioid therapy should occur, with tapering that may be slowly articulated with a decrease of 10% of the original dose per week, though some patients can be tapered or weaned more rapidly without any major adverse effects over a 6-to-8-week period. The symptoms of abstinence syndrome can be managed with clonidine 0.1 to 0.2 mg orally every 6 hours or clonidine transdermal patch 0.1 mg 24 hours weekly during the taper, and patients should be monitored for significant hypotension and anticholinergic side effects. Symptoms of mild opioid withdrawal occasionally persist for 6 months after opioids have been discontinued; physicians should be cautious and preferably not treat withdrawal symptoms with opioids or benzodiazepines once the weaning process or discontinuation of opioids is started. Supportive care and referrals are described: the patient may be referred for counseling or other psychological support during the tapering period if there are significant cognitive-emotional and/ or behavioral issues; if such issues arise, the physician should refer the patient to a chemical dependency center; and physicians not trained in pain medicine may refer their patients in need of opioid tapering to pain management specialists or if complex to addictionologists. In some patients it may be necessary to slow the tapering and weaning timeline from weekly to monthly dose adjustments, and careful and meticulous downward tapering along with close monitoring is warranted when weaning patients off high doses of opioids.

2.6 Clinical Supervision

Treatment should be initiated with supervised administration, progressing to unsupervised administration as the patient's clinical stability permits. SUBOXONE sublingual film is subject to diversion and abuse. When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patient's level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take‐home medication.

Ideally patients should be seen at reasonable intervals (e.g., at least weekly during the first month of treatment) based upon the individual circumstances of the patient. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow‐up visits. Periodic assessment is necessary to determine compliance with the dosing regimen, effectiveness of the treatment plan, and overall patient progress.

Once a stable dosage has been achieved and patient assessment (e.g., urine drug screening) does not indicate illicit drug use, less frequent follow‐up visits may be appropriate. A once‐monthly visit schedule may be reasonable for patients on a stable dosage of medication who are making progress toward their treatment objectives. Continuation or modification of pharmacotherapy should be based on the healthcare provider's evaluation of treatment outcomes and objectives such as:

Absence of medication toxicity.
Absence of medical or behavioral adverse effects.
Responsible handling of medications by the patient.
Patient's compliance with all elements of the treatment plan (including recovery‐oriented activities, psychotherapy, and/or other psychosocial modalities).
Abstinence from illicit drug use (including problematic alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use).

If treatment goals are not being achieved, the healthcare provider should re‐evaluate the appropriateness of continuing the current treatment.

2.7 Unstable Patients

Healthcare providers will need to decide when they cannot appropriately provide further management for particular patients. For example, some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs, or unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the healthcare provider does not feel that he/she has the expertise to manage the patient. In such cases, the healthcare provider may want to assess whether to refer the patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment. Decisions should be based on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of treatment.

Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with, or referred to, more intensive and structured treatment.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115niESQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — Buprenorphine indications, initiation, and dosing: Buprenorphine is a recommended treatment for patients with opioid use disorder who are able to give informed consent and have no specific contraindication, and for patients who are currently opioid dependent buprenorphine should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal. Once objective signs of withdrawal are observed, initiation should start with a dose of 2–4 mg and dosages may be increased in increments of 2–8 mg, with the initiation setting determined by clinical judgement because both office-based and home-based initiation are considered safe and effective when starting buprenorphine treatment. Following initiation, the buprenorphine dose should be titrated to alleviate symptoms to enable patients to discontinue illicit opioid use, evidence suggests that 16 mg per day or more may be more effective than lower doses, and there is limited evidence regarding the relative efficacy of doses higher than 24 mg per day with the use of higher doses potentially increasing the risk of diversion. The FDA recently approved several new buprenorphine formulations for treatment of opioid use disorder and, as effectiveness data are currently limited, clinicians should use these products as indicated and be mindful of emerging evidence as it becomes available. Patients' psychosocial needs should be assessed and patients should be offered or referred to psychosocial treatment based on their individual needs in conjunction with buprenorphine, but a patient's decision to decline psychosocial treatment or the absence of available psychosocial treatment should not preclude or delay buprenorphine treatment with appropriate medication management.

Transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine — dosing, timing, and withdrawal thresholds specify that lower methadone doses transition more comfortably, initiation should occur in withdrawal, and specific buprenorphine doses are outlined. "Patients on low doses of methadone (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerate the transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort; whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may find that transitioning causes significant discomfort". "To minimize the risk of precipitated withdrawal, it is recommended that clinicians use careful initial dosing followed by rapid titration up to an appropriate maintenance dose". "Patients should be experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before the transition. This would typically occur up to 24–48 hours after the last dose of methadone", and "A COWS score of 11–12 or more is generally sufficient for significant withdrawal to allow a safe and comfortable initiation onto buprenorphine".

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film is supported by clinical trials using buprenorphine sublingual tablets and buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets, and other trials using buprenorphine sublingual solutions, as well as an open-label study in 194 patients treated with buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film administered sublingually and 188 patients treated with the film administered buccally. In total, safety data from clinical studies are available from over 3,000 opioid-dependent subjects exposed to buprenorphine at doses in the range used in the treatment of opioid dependence. Few differences in the adverse event profile were noted with regard to sublingually and buccally administered buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets, buprenorphine sublingual tablets and a buprenorphine ethanolic sublingual solution.

The most common adverse event (> 1%) associated with the sublingual administration of the buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film was oral hypoesthesia. Other adverse events were constipation, glossodynia, oral mucosal erythema, vomiting, intoxication, disturbance in attention, palpitations, insomnia, withdrawal syndrome, hyperhidrosis, and blurred vision.

### Buprenorphine: a primer for emergency physicians [^114BU6yA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The recent approval of office-based treatment for opioid addiction and US Food and Drug Administration approval of buprenorphine will expand treatment options for opioid addiction. Buprenorphine is classified as a partial micro opioid agonist and a weak kappa antagonist. It has a high affinity for the micro receptor, with slow dissociation resulting in a long duration of action and an analgesic potency 25 to 40 times more potent than morphine. At higher doses, its agonist effects plateau and it begins to behave more like an antagonist, limiting the maximal analgesic effect and respiratory depression. This "ceiling effect" confers a high safety profile clinically, a low level of physical dependence, and only mild withdrawal symptoms on cessation after prolonged administration. Suboxone contains a mixture of buprenorphine and naloxone. The naloxone is poorly absorbed sublingually and is designed to discourage intravenous use. Subutex, buprenorphine only, will also be available primarily as an initial test dose. Clinicians will be using this drug for detoxification or for maintenance of opioid addiction. Patients with recent illicit opioid use may develop a mild precipitated withdrawal syndrome with the induction of buprenorphine. Acute buprenorphine intoxication may present with some diffuse mild mental status changes, mild to minimal respiratory depression, small but not pinpoint pupils, and relatively normal vital signs. Naloxone may improve respiratory depression but will have limited effect on other symptoms. Patients with significant symptoms related to buprenorphine should be admitted to the hospital for observation because symptoms will persist for 12 to 24 hours.

### Opioid dependence treatment, including buprenorphine / naloxone [^114P6Qny]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review opioid dependence (OD) and its treatment. Pharmacologic treatments, including the use of buprenorphine/naloxone, are presented. Pharmaceutical care functions for outpatient OD treatment are discussed.

Data Sources

Primary and review articles were identified by MEDLINE and HEALTHSTAR searches (from 1966 to November 2000) and through secondary sources. Tertiary sources were also reviewed regarding general concepts of OD and its treatment.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

Relevant articles were reviewed after identification from published abstracts. Articles were selected based on the objectives for this article. Studies of the treatment of OD with buprenorphine were selected based on the topic (pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, adverse reactions) and study design (randomized, controlled clinical trials in patients with OD with active/placebo comparisons and/or comparisons of active OD treatments). Articles regarding pharmacists' activities in the treatment and prevention of OD were reviewed for the pharmaceutical care section.

Data Synthesis

OD is considered a medical disorder with costly adverse health outcomes. Although methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is cost-effective for OD, only about 12% of individuals with OD receive this treatment. Psychological and pharmacologic modalities are used to treat OD, but patients often relapse. Drug therapy includes alpha 2-agonists for withdrawal symptoms, detoxification regimens with or without opioids, opioid antagonists, and opioid replacement including methadone, levomethadyl acetate, and buprenorphine. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999 allows for office-based opioid replacement therapies. Sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone can be used in this milieu. Buprenorphine with naloxone is currently under new drug application review with the Food and Drug Administration. Clinical research shows buprenorphine to be equal in effectiveness to methadone, but safer in overdose due to its ceiling effect on respiratory depression. It has lower abuse potential and fewer withdrawal symptoms when discontinued. Naloxone is included to decrease diversion and injection of the tablets. Pharmacists in outpatient settings who are familiar with OD have opportunities to provide pharmaceutical care to patients receiving this treatment. Pharmaceutical care functions for OD include ensuring appropriate drug administration, monitoring adverse effects, alleviating withdrawal symptoms, treating intercurrent illnesses, minimizing diversion, and preventing relapse.

Conclusions

OD is a critical unmet health problem in the US. Buprenorphine combined with naloxone represents an innovative treatment for OD in outpatient settings. This new treatment has advantages over MMT.

Buprenorphine safety and drug interactions in adolescents with OUD include that more minor side effects of buprenorphine and buprenorphine–naloxone include headache, back pain, insomnia, chills, sweating, nausea, vomiting, and constipation, while buprenorphine can convey risk of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Rare but serious adverse effects have included life-threatening respiratory and central nervous system depression (particularly with benzodiazepine use or compromised respiratory function), central sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoxemia, adrenal insufficiency, risk of hepatitis, hypersensitivity reactions, adverse dental events, QTc prolongation, orthostatic hypotension, elevation of cerebrospinal fluid and intrathecal pressure, and obscuring the diagnosis of acute abdominal conditions. Long-term agonist-based therapy is described as controversial, and given co-occurring psychiatric treatment, clinicians should consider interactions: buprenorphine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are 3A4 inhibitors that may increase buprenorphine levels.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114HB3R8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Opioid use disorder pharmacotherapy — extended-release naltrexone comparative effectiveness and mortality signals — Evidence supports the efficacy of extended-release injectable naltrexone for relapse prevention compared to placebo control. A recent study comparing extended-release naltrexone to sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone found it was more difficult to initiate treatment with extended-release naltrexone resulting in a higher rate of early relapse among those randomized to extended-release naltrexone compared with those randomized to buprenorphine/naloxone, but for those who successfully initiated treatment, extended-release naltrexone and buprenorphine/naloxone were similarly effective and fatal overdose, non-fatal overdose, and other serious adverse events did not differ between treatment groups. A 12-week open-label randomized controlled trial found extended-release naltrexone was similar to buprenorphine/naloxone in maintaining short-term abstinence from illicit opioids following successful initiation. Further study is needed on the relative effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone in reducing mortality compared with methadone or buprenorphine, and a recent retrospective cohort study including data from more than 17,000 adults without cancer who survived an opioid overdose found decreased all-cause mortality and opioid-related mortality among patients treated with buprenorphine but could not draw any conclusions about the effect of naltrexone on mortality due to uncertainty in the estimates.

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride (Suboxone) [^115GfXNR]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Physiologic Effects:

Buprenorphine in intravenous (2mg, 4mg, 8mg, 12mg and 16 mg) and
sublingual (12mg) doses has been administered to non-dependent subjects to
examine cardiovascular, respiratory and subjective effects at doses comparable
to those used for treatment of opioid dependence. Compared with placebo, there
were no statistically significant differences among any of the treatment
conditions for blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, O2saturation or skin temperature across time. Systolic BP was
higher in the 8 mg group than placebo (3 hour AUC values). Minimum and maximum
effects were similar across all treatments. Subjects remained responsive to low
voice and responded to computer prompts. Some subjects showed irritability, but
no other changes were observed.

The respiratory effects of sublingual buprenorphine were compared with the
effects of methadone in a double-blind, parallel group, dose ranging comparison
of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg)
and oral methadone (15, 30, 45, or 60 mg) in non-dependent, opioid-experienced
volunteers. In this study, hypoventilation not requiring medical intervention
was reported more frequently after buprenorphine doses of 4 mg and higher than
after methadone. Both drugs decreased O2saturation to
the same degree.

Effect of Naloxone:

Physiologic and subjective effects following acute sublingual administration of
SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX tablets were similar at equivalent dose levels of
buprenorphine. Naloxone, in the SUBOXONE formulation, had no clinically
significant effect when administered by the sublingual route, although blood
levels of the drug were measurable. SUBOXONE, when administered sublingually
even to an opioid-dependent population, was recognized as an opioid agonist,
whereas when administered intramuscularly, combinations of buprenorphine with
naloxone produced opioid antagonist actions similar to naloxone. In
methadone-maintained patients and heroin-dependent subjects, intravenous
administration of buprenorphine/naloxone combinations precipitated opioid
withdrawal and was perceived as unpleasant and dysphoric. In morphine-stabilized
subjects, intravenously administered combinations of buprenorphine with naloxone
produced opioid antagonist and withdrawal effects that were ratio-dependent; the
most intense withdrawal effects were produced by 2:1 and 4:1 ratios, less
intense by an 8:1 ratio. SUBOXONE tablets contain buprenorphine with naloxone at
a ratio of 4:1.

### Discontinuing methadone and buprenorphine: a review and clinical challenges [^114pzZkA]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

This paper offers a review and recommendations for clinicians working with patients interested in discontinuing opioid agonist treatment. As buprenorphine/naloxone has gained widespread acceptance for opioid addiction, many treatment providers and patients have a range of hopes and expectations about its optimal use. A surprising number assume buprenorphine/naloxone is primarily useful as a medication to transition off illicit opioid use, and success is partially defined by discontinuing the medication. Despite accumulating evidence that a majority of patients will need to remain on medication to preserve their gains, clinicians often have to address a patient's fervent desire to taper. Using the concept of "recovery capital", our review addresses (1) the appropriate duration of opioid agonist treatment, (2) risks associated with discontinuing, (3) a checklist that guides the patient through self-assessment of the wisdom of discontinuing opioid agonist treatment, and (4) shared decision making about how to proceed.

### Reddit discussions about buprenorphine associated precipitated withdrawal in the era of fentanyl [^114HKowa]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 Background

Buprenorphine (Suboxone ®, a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone) is an effective, evidence-based treatment for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). Buprenorphine has unique pharmacologic properties: it is a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and has very high affinity for the mu-opioid receptor. Therefore, to avoid buprenorphine from displacing lower affinity, full agonist opioids (e.g. heroin) from the opioid receptor and causing withdrawal, patients seeking buprenorphine treatment must wait until they start experiencing withdrawal before initiating standard dosing regimens. If buprenorphine is initiated prior to withdrawal onset, it can displace residual opioids, causing an uncomfortable and sometimes severe acute withdrawal syndrome known as precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW). POW has been defined as an increase in the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), which measures the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, of 6 or more while initiating buprenorphine. Fear of POW poses a barrier to both clinicians and patients to buprenorphine initiation.

Multiple recently published reports suggest that POW can occur even after waiting the recommended amount of time in patients with a history of heavy fentanyl use. It has been proposed that this phenomenon may occur due to the high lipophilicity of fentanyl, resulting in a long tail of elimination after chronic use. One study showed that in patients with OUD and chronic fentanyl use, urinary metabolites of fentanyl could be detected 2–3 weeks after last use when hospitalized in a treatment program. Additional risk of severe POW could be related to the dose or length of use of full opioid agonist used prior to buprenorphine induction, time interval to receiving buprenorphine, and other comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions that alter metabolism of opioids or symptoms of POW. One potential alternative approach to avoid POW is microdosing, which involves overlapping induction of buprenorphine in very small escalating doses while still using full agonist opioids. The "Bernese Method" is one such method, although several different regimens have been described in the medical literature. While the literature on this subject is growing, many people with OUD have discovered these methods through their own lived experiences.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111EE7TM]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

In April 2021, to expand access to buprenorphine, the Practice Guidelines for the Administration of Buprenorphine for Treating Opioid Use Disorder exempted eligible physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives from previous Controlled Substances Act certification requirements related to training, counseling and other ancillary services (i.e. psychosocial services). To prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder for up to 30 patients in an office-based setting, clinicians can forgo or choose to undertake training but must still receive a waiver from SAMHSA. Information about qualifications and the process to obtain a waiver are available from SAMHSA.

Additional recommendations have been published on initiation, use, and monitoring of buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder is usually combined with naloxone in a sublingual or buccal film or tablet (e.g. Suboxone), to reduce the potential for misuse of buprenorphine when injected. Naloxone is poorly absorbed orally; however, if buprenorphine/naloxone is manipulated and injected, naloxone can trigger opioid withdrawal. In 2018, long-acting injectable formulations of buprenorphine became available. As a partial agonist, buprenorphine should generally not be initiated until there are objective signs of withdrawal, to avoid precipitating withdrawal. As an alternative for patients not yet in opioid withdrawal, certain studies have described a low-dose initiation approach (sometimes referred to as microdosing) to avoid precipitating withdrawal when initiating buprenorphine, although evidence regarding this approach is limited. Low-dose buprenorphine initiation is a potential option for patients with opioid use disorder who are taking opioid medications for pain. With this dosing strategy, full agonist opioids can be continued while buprenorphine is initiated, and the patient does not need to experience opioid withdrawal symptoms. For standard (not low-dose) buprenorphine initiation, after objective signs of withdrawal are observed, buprenorphine should be initiated and titrated upward under supervision at approximately 2-hour intervals as needed to control withdrawal symptoms. Protocols for initiating buprenorphine by patients at home after an initial encounter with a clinician to establish the diagnosis of opioid use disorder and discuss medication options are in use by more experienced clinicians.

### Comparisons of analgesic potency and side effects of buprenorphine and buprenorphine with ultra-low-dose naloxone [^112imYwP]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Opioids are the most effective pain medication available, yet concerns about their safety may limit their administration to those in need. In efforts to identify analgesics with lower potential for abuse and dependence, recent evidence suggests that combinations of opioids with ultra-low doses of the opioid antagonist naloxone may enhance the analgesic effect with increased safety. This study investigated the use of buprenorphine (0.3 mg) plus ultra-low-dose naloxone (0.02 mg) (BUP + ULDN) as compared with buprenorphine alone (0.3 mg) (BUP) for the treatment of pain.

Methods

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over design, 12 study participants with lingering, noncancer pain received each medication intravenously for 5 days of dosing, separated by an intertrial interval of at least 7 days to avoid possible carryover effects.

Results

We found no order effects and no differences between medications in pre- to postdose pain ratings, side effects, or adverse events.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that BUP + ULDN is not more effective in reducing pain than BUP.

5.12 Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function

Buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The doses of buprenorphine and naloxone in this fixed‐dose combination product cannot be individually titrated, and hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine. Therefore, patients with severe hepatic impairment will be exposed to substantially higher levels of naloxone than patients with normal hepatic function. This may result in an increased risk of precipitated withdrawal at the beginning of treatment (induction) and may interfere with buprenorphine's efficacy throughout treatment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the differential reduction of naloxone clearance compared to buprenorphine clearance is not as great as in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. However, buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended for initiation of treatment (induction) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment due to the increased risk of precipitated withdrawal. Buprenorphine/naloxone products may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone. However, patients should be carefully monitored and consideration given to the possibility of naloxone interfering with buprenorphine's efficacy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

5.13 Dental Adverse Events

Cases of dental caries, some severe (i.e., tooth fracture, tooth loss), have been reported following the use of transmucosal buprenorphine-containing products. Reported events include cavities, tooth decay, dental abscesses/infection, rampant caries, tooth erosion, fillings falling out, and, in some cases, total tooth loss. Treatment for these events included tooth extraction, root canal, dental surgery, as well as other restorative procedures (i.e., fillings, crowns, implants, dentures). Multiple cases were reported in individuals without any prior history of dental problems.

Refer patients to dental care services and encourage them to have regular dental checkups while taking SUBOXONE. Educate patients to seek dental care and strategies to maintain or improve oral health while being treated with transmucosal buprenorphine-containing products. Strategies include, but are not limited to, gently rinsing the teeth and gums with water and then swallowing after SUBOXONE has been completely dissolved in the oral mucosa. Advise patients to wait for at least one hour after taking SUBOXONE before brushing teeth [see Dosing and Administration (2.5), Information for Patients (17), Medication Guide].

5.8 Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events

Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated.

5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Cases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine and naloxone containing products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone is a contraindication to the use of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets.

5.10 Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms

Because it contains naloxone, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are highly likely to produce marked and intense withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individual dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone. Because of the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in such persons if administered sublingually before the agonist effects of the opioid have subsided.

5.11 Risk of Overdose in Opioid Naïve Patients

There have been reported deaths of opioid naive individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are not appropriate as an analgesic.

Study visits

Screening

Each subject received naloxone HCl (increments of 0.05 mg IV at 5 minute intervals, up to 0.2 mg total) and was monitored for signs of mild opioid withdrawal (ie, COWS ≥ 5). Mild withdrawal was medically managed with IV midazolam (1–2 mg IV every 2–3 minutes, with no upper limit) and hydromorphone (1–2 mg IV every 5 minutes). Those with mild opioid withdrawal completed the full screening evaluation.

Treatment

Subjects received a single IV bolus dose of each of the following treatments: buprenorphine 0.75 mg (2.5 mL of concentrated 0.3 mg/mL buprenorphine [to equal 0.75 mg of buprenorphine] with 0.5 mL of 5% dextrose for a total volume of 3 mL); buprenorphine 0.75 mg + naloxone 0.1 mg (2.5 mL of concentrated 0.3 mg/mL buprenorphine [to equal 0.75 mg of buprenorphine] with 0.25 mL of concentrated 0.4 mg/mL naloxone [to equal 0.1 mg of naloxone] and 0.25 mL of 5% dextrose for a total volume of 3 mL); buprenorphine 0.75 mg + naloxone 0.2 mg (2.5 mL of concentrated 0.3 mg/mL buprenorphine [to equal 0.75 mg of buprenorphine] with 0.5 mL of concentrated 0.4 mg/mL naloxone [to equal 0.2 mg of naloxone] for a total volume of 3 mL); or placebo (3 mL of 5% dextrose). They were randomly assigned to one of four double-blind treatment sequences according to the four-treatment, four-period Williams design shown in Table 1. Each study treatment was prepared from the commercial product under sterile conditions by the study site's pharmacist and administered in the study center in a double-blind manner as a single IV bolus dose of study drug. In the event subjects experienced mild or greater precipitated withdrawal, rescue medication was provided. Additionally, all doses of background opioid medication were taken in the study center.

Treatment assessments

Table 2 shows the overall timing of key events during the treatment phase of the study. Additionally, 3-lead ECG and pulse oximetry were monitored for 8 hours following each study dose. Adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications were assessed and recorded at any time.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^115tmhun]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Psychosocial treatment should be implemented in conjunction with the use of buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder. This therapy may be provided by the prescribing clinician or by a separate therapist depending on the clinical situation and the skills and training of the prescribing clinician.

Clinicians should take steps to reduce the chance of buprenorphine diversion. Recommended strategies include frequent office visits (weekly in early treatment), urine drug testing, including testing for buprenorphine and metabolites, and recall visits for pill counts.

Patients should be tested frequently for buprenorphine, other substances, and prescription medications. Accessing Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) data may be useful for monitoring other medications that the patient may be receiving. Due to the variation in state PDMP laws, clinicians are encouraged to be familiar with the legal requirements associated with PDMPs and prescribing of controlled substances in their state.

Patients should be seen frequently at the beginning of their treatment. Weekly visits (at least) are recommended until patients are determined to be stable. There is no recommended time limit for treatment.

Buprenorphine taper and discontinuation is a slow process, indefinite in duration, and close monitoring should be done even after buprenorphine is stopped. Buprenorphine tapering is generally accomplished over several months. Patients should be encouraged to remain in treatment for ongoing monitoring past the point of discontinuation. When considering a switch from buprenorphine to naltrexone, 7–14 days should elapse between the last dose of buprenorphine and the start of naltrexone to ensure that the patient is not physically dependent on opioids before starting naltrexone. It may be useful to conduct a naloxone challenge before starting naltrexone to demonstrate an absence of physical dependence.

When considering a switch from buprenorphine to methadone, there is no required time delay because the addition of a full mu-opioid agonist to a partial agonist does not typically result in any type of adverse reaction.

Patients who discontinue agonist therapy and resume opioid use should be made aware of the risks associated with an opioid overdose, and especially the increased risk of death.

5.3 Managing Risks from Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants

Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions including overdose and death. Medication‐assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs. Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone.

As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol.

Develop strategies to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine‐treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delay or omit the buprenorphine dose if appropriate.

Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.

For patients in buprenorphine treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia. Before co‐prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non‐pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia. Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patient's buprenorphine treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use.

If concomitant use is warranted, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, as is recommended for all patients in buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking their medications as prescribed and are not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs. Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.4 Unintentional Pediatric Exposure

Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children who are accidentally exposed to it. Store buprenorphine‐containing medications safely out of the sight and reach of children and destroy any unused medication appropriately [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride (Suboxone) [^117NDHWv]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Respiratory Depression:

Significant respiratory depression has been associated with
buprenorphine, particularly by the intravenous route. A number of deaths have
occurred when addicts have intravenously misused buprenorphine, usually with
benzodiazepines concomitantly. Deaths have also been reported in association
with concomitant administration of buprenorphine with other depressants such as
alcohol or other opioids. Patients should be warned of the potential danger of
the self-administration of benzodiazepines or other depressants while under
treatment with SUBUTEX or SUBOXONE.

IN THE CASE OF OVERDOSE, THE PRIMARY MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE THE
RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF ADEQUATE VENTILATION WITH MECHANICAL ASSISTANCE OF
RESPIRATION, IF REQUIRED. NALOXONE MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN REVERSING ANY
RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION PRODUCED BY BUPRENORPHINE.

SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX should be used with caution in patients with compromised
respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor
pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing
respiratory depression).

CNS Depression:

Patients receiving buprenorphine in the presence of other narcotic analgesics,
general anesthetics, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers,
sedative/hypnotics or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) may exhibit
increased CNS depression. When such combined therapy is contemplated, reduction
of the dose of one or both agents should be considered.

Dependence:

Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opiate receptor and chronic
administration produces dependence of the opioid type, characterized by
withdrawal upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome
is milder than seen with full agonists, and may be delayed in onset.

### Rapid vs standard induction to injectable extended-release buprenorphine: a randomized clinical trial [^113bKH1E]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the only large, completed, multicenter, randomized clinical trial to compare 2 buprenorphine induction strategies onto extended-release buprenorphine. In participants with high-risk opioid use, these findings demonstrate that RI onto extended-release buprenorphine is well tolerated and had higher retention than SI at the second injection (primary end point; 312 [66.4%] vs 138 [54.5%]; difference, 11.8%). Similarly, RI had higher retention than SI in more difficult-to-treat fentanyl-positive participants (difference, 14.8%). RI did not increase the frequency or severity of AEs. These data add to the evolving published evidence supporting effectiveness and safety of single-day buprenorphine initiation, with or without fentanyl use, and are consistent with other instances in which only a single transmucosal buprenorphine dose is administered prior to initiation of an extended-release buprenorphine product.

Buprenorphine induction is the first step to stable buprenorphine maintenance. The ultimate goal of RI is to reach a therapeutic buprenorphine concentration as soon as possible to manage OUD without inducing precipitated withdrawal that could jeopardize continued engagement in extended-release buprenorphine treatment. This study shows that RI with same-day administration of extended-release buprenorphine increases the number of individuals who complete induction and receive injections 2 and 3. It also supports safe administration of the second injection at least 1 week after the first. By receiving the second extended-release buprenorphine injection earlier, patients minimized the time below target plasma buprenorphine levels (≥ 2 ng/mL), which helps to control symptoms of craving and withdrawal.

Many participants in this study reported long-term opioid (including fentanyl) use, daily use, polysubstance abuse, and prior failed attempts at opioid withdrawal or maintenance treatment with buprenorphine or other medications for OUD. Fentanyl use was a particularly strong risk factor for early withdrawal symptoms and discontinuation during buprenorphine therapy initiation. Poorer outcomes associated with fentanyl use were particularly apparent in the SI treatment arm. Despite differences in timing of visits and injection, treatment retention in the fentanyl-negative SI subpopulation in this study appears broadly consistent with expectations from the original phase 3 study conducted before widespread fentanyl availability, which reported induction (run-in) failure in 161 of 665 participants (24.2%). In contrast, the high induction failure rate 94 of 196 (48%) in the fentanyl-positive SI subpopulation supports reports of more difficult buprenorphine induction in the current fentanyl-dominated era.

2.2 Important Dosage and Administration Information

Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are administered sublingually as a single daily dose. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be used in patients who have been initially inducted using Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets.

Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits.

2.3 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid
Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver. Because patients being treated for opioid use disorder have the potential for relapse, putting them at risk for opioid overdose, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Advise patients and caregivers that naloxone may also be administered for a known or suspected overdose with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets itself. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration of naloxone may be necessary due to the long duration of action of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets and its affinity for the mu opioid receptor [see Overdosage (10)].

Inform patients and caregivers of their options for obtaining naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program) [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.8 Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events

Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment, are recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated.

5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Cases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine and naloxone containing products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone is a contraindication to the use of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film.

5.10 Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms

Because it contains naloxone, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film is likely to produce withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone. Because of the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in such persons if administered before the agonist effects of the opioid have subsided.

5.11 Risk of Overdose in Opioid Naïve Patients

There have been reported deaths of opioid-naïve individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film is not appropriate as an analgesic.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The safety of SUBOXONE has been evaluated in 497 opioid-dependent
subjects. The prospective evaluation of SUBOXONE was supported by clinical
trials using SUBUTEX (buprenorphine tablets without naloxone) and other trials
using buprenorphine sublingual solutions. In total, safety data are available
from 3214 opioid-dependent subjects exposed to buprenorphine at doses in the
range used in treatment of opioid addiction.

Few differences in adverse event profile were noted between SUBOXONE and
SUBUTEX or buprenorphine administered as a sublingual solution.

In a comparative study, adverse event profiles were similar for subjects
treated with 16 mg SUBOXONE or 16mg SUBUTEX. The following adverse events were
reported to occur by at least 5% of patients in a 4-week study (Table 3).

The adverse event profile of buprenorphine was also characterized in the
dose-controlled study of buprenorphine solution, over a range of doses in four
months of treatment. Table 4 shows adverse events reported by
at least 5% of subjects in any dose group in the dose-controlled study.

In a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study comparing buprenorphine
ethanolic solution to a full agonist active control, 162 subjects were
randomized to receive the ethanolic sublingual solution of buprenorphine at 8
mg/day (a dose which is roughly comparable to a dose of 12 mg/day of SUBUTEX or
SUBOXONE), or two relatively low doses of active control, one of which was low
enough to serve as an alternative to placebo, during a 3–10 day induction phase.
a 16-week maintenance phase and a 7-week detoxification phase. Buprenorphine was
titrated to maintenance dose by Day 3; active control doses were titrated more
gradually.

Maintenance dosing continued through Week 17, and then medications were
tapered by approximately 20–30% per week over Weeks 18–24, with placebo dosing
for the last two weeks. Subjects received individual and/or group counseling
weekly.

Based on retention in treatment and the percentage of thrice-weekly urine
samples negative for non-study opioids, buprenorphine was more effective than
the low dose of the control, in keeping heroin addicts in treatment and in
reducing their use of opioids while in treatment. The effectiveness of
buprenorphine, 8 mg per day was similar to that of the moderate active control
dose, but equivalence was not demonstrated.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111wkiuZ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Criteria 10 and 11 are not considered to be met for those persons taking opioids solely under appropriate medical supervision. Severity is specified as mild (2–3 criteria), moderate (4–5 criteria), or severe (≥ 6 criteria).

FDA-approved medications indicated for the treatment of opioid use disorder include buprenorphine (a partial agonist opioid), methadone (a full agonist opioid), and naltrexone (an opioid antagonist). Experts from OWG stated that partial agonist opioid, full agonist opioid, and opioid antagonist treatment should not be framed as equal options for opioid use disorder, noting that partial and full agonist opioid treatments have stronger evidence for better outcomes, do not require abstinence, have less challenges with initiation, and are much more widely used than opioid antagonist treatment. Clinical evidence reviews found evidence on the effectiveness of interventions (e.g. medications and behavioral treatments) for opioid use disorder related to prescription opioids to be limited. However, moderate-quality evidence indicated buprenorphine (a partial agonist opioid) and methadone (a full agonist opioid) to be effective in preventing return to drug use among patients with opioid use disorder involving heroin, although the presence of pain among patients in these studies is generally not described. In addition, a small number of studies have evaluated buprenorphine for patients with prescription opioid dependence (using DSM-IV criteria) and found it to be effective in preventing return to drug use. One study found that among persons with opioid use disorder, previous prescription opioid use predicts stabilization on buprenorphine. Another trial that performed buprenorphine initiation and then randomized patients to buprenorphine taper versus maintenance was terminated early without reporting of planned outcomes because all patients randomized to the taper arm switched to maintenance or experienced a return to drug use; five of six patients in the maintenance arm completed the trial. In another trial identified by the clinical evidence reviews, no difference was found between buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone in likelihood of retention in the study and in pain, function, or self-reported side effects. Buprenorphine and methadone treatment of opioid use disorder has been associated with reduced overdose deaths and reduced all-cause deaths. Naltrexone (an opioid antagonist) also can be used for opioid use disorder, particularly for highly motivated persons. Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioids if they are used. Naltrexone has not been evaluated in persons with concomitant pain and opioid use disorder, and opioid medications for pain generally cannot be used in patients receiving naltrexone. Naltrexone requires adherence to monthly, long-acting injections. The effectiveness of oral naltrexone can be limited by poor medication adherence, and oral naltrexone should not be used except under very limited circumstances (e.g. for patients who would be able to comply with observed daily dosing to enhance adherence). Naltrexone also must be started after full withdrawal from opioids, which is a challenge for some patients; however, for patients who have completed or are able to complete withdrawal, naltrexone has comparable effectiveness as buprenorphine in prevention of return to drug use.

2.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Severe Hepatic Impairment

Consider reducing the starting and titration incremental dose by half compared to patients with normal liver function, and monitor for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine.

Moderate Hepatic Impairment

Although no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with moderate hepatic impairment, buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets should be used with caution in these patients and prescribers should monitor patients for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine.

Mild Hepatic Impairment

No clinically significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

2.7 Unstable Patients

Healthcare providers will need to decide when they cannot appropriately provide further management for particular patients. For example, some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs, or unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the healthcare provider does not feel that he/she has the expertise to manage the patient. In such cases, the healthcare provider may want to assess whether to refer the patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment. Decisions should be based on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of treatment.

Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with, or referred to, more intensive and structured treatment.

2.8 Stopping Treatment

The decision to discontinue therapy with buprenorphine and naloxone or buprenorphine after a period of maintenance should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Both gradual and abrupt discontinuation of buprenorphine has been used, but the data are insufficient to determine the best method of dose taper at the end of treatment.

2.3 Induction

Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e., long‐ or short‐acting opioid products), the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence.

Patients dependent on heroin or other short‐acting opioid products

Patients dependent on heroin or other short‐acting opioid products may be inducted with either SUBOXONE sublingual film or with sublingual buprenorphine monotherapy. At treatment initiation, the first dose of SUBOXONE sublingual film should be administered when objective signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, not less than six hours after the patient last used opioids.

It is recommended that an adequate treatment dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, be achieved as rapidly as possible. In some studies, a too‐gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of drop‐out of buprenorphine patients during the induction period.

On Day 1, an induction dosage of up to 8 mg/2 mg SUBOXONE sublingual film is recommended. Clinicians should start with an initial dose of 2 mg/0.5 mg or 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone and may titrate upwards in 2 or 4 mg increments of buprenorphine, at approximately 2‐hour intervals, under supervision, to 8 mg/2 mg buprenorphine/naloxone based on the control of acute withdrawal symptoms.

On Day 2, a single daily dose of up to 16 mg/4 mg SUBOXONE sublingual film is recommended.

Because the exposure to naloxone is somewhat higher after buccal than after sublingual administration, it is recommended that the sublingual site of administration be used during induction to minimize exposure to naloxone, to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

Patients dependent on methadone or long‐acting opioid products

Patients dependent upon methadone or long‐acting opioid products may be more susceptible to precipitated and prolonged withdrawal during induction than those on short‐acting opioid products.

Buprenorphine/naloxone combination products have not been evaluated in adequate and well‐controlled studies for induction in patients who are physically dependent on long‐acting opioid products, and the naloxone in these combination products is absorbed in small amounts by the sublingual route and could cause worse precipitated and prolonged withdrawal. For this reason, buprenorphine monotherapy is recommended in patients taking long‐acting opioids when used according to approved administration instructions. Following induction, the patient may then be transitioned to once‐daily SUBOXONE sublingual film.

2.3 Maintenance

The dosage of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets should be progressively adjusted in increments/decrements of 2 mg/0.5 mg or 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms.
The maintenance dose of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are generally in the range of 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to 24 mg/6 mg buprenorphine/naloxone per day depending on the individual patient. The recommended target dosage of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets is 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine/naloxone/day as a single daily dose. Dosages higher than 24 mg/6 mg have not been demonstrated to provide any clinical advantage.
When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patient's level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication.
There is no maximum recommended duration of maintenance treatment. Patients may require treatment indefinitely and should continue for as long as patients are benefiting and the use of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets contributes to the intended treatment goals.

2.4 Method of Administration

Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets must be administered whole. Do not cut, chew, or swallow buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets. Advise patients not to eat or drink anything until the tablet is completely dissolved.

Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets should be placed under the tongue until they are dissolved. For doses requiring the use of more than two tablets, patients are advised to either place all the tablets at once or alternatively (if they cannot fit in more than two tablets comfortably), place two tablets at a time under the tongue. Either way, the patients should continue to hold the tablets under the tongue until they dissolve; swallowing the tablets reduces the bioavailability of the drug. To ensure consistency in bioavailability, patients should follow the same manner of dosing with continued use of the product.

Proper administration technique should be demonstrated to the patient.

Advise patients to do the following after the product has completely dissolved in the oral mucosa: take a sip of water, swish gently around the teeth and gums, and swallow. Advise patients to wait for at least one hour after taking buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets before brushing teeth [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13), Postmarketing Experience (6.2), Information for Patients (17), and the Medication Guide].

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to buprenorphine/naloxone, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to titrate buprenorphine dose after initiation to alleviate symptoms. Use buprenorphine doses sufficient to enable patients to discontinue illicit opioid use. Consider administering ≥ 16 mg/day rather than lower doses. Insufficient evidence to recommend doses > 24 mg/day as it may increase the risk of diversion.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^112q8rXV]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Switching from methadone to another medication for the treatment of opioid use disorder may be appropriate if the patient experiences intolerable side effects or is not successful in attaining or maintaining treatment goals through the use of methadone.

Patients switching from methadone to buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder should be on low doses of methadone before switching medications. Patients on low doses of methadone (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerate transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort, whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may experience significant discomfort in switching medications.

Patients switching from methadone to oral naltrexone or extended-release injectable naltrexone must be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids, before they can receive naltrexone. This may take up to 14 days, and a naloxone challenge may be useful in determining the lack of physical dependence on opioids. The only exception would apply when an experienced clinician receives consent from the patient to embark on a plan of naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management.

Patients who discontinue agonist therapy with methadone or buprenorphine and then resume opioid use should be made aware of the risks associated with opioid overdose, and especially the increased risk of death.

Part 5: Buprenorphine

Opioid-dependent patients should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before taking the first dose of buprenorphine to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

Induction of buprenorphine should start with a dose of 2–4 mg. Dosages may be increased in increments of 2–4 mg.

Clinicians should observe patients in their offices during induction. Emerging research suggests, however, that many patients need "not" be observed and that home buprenorphine induction may be considered. Home-based induction is recommended only if the patient or prescribing physician is experienced with the use of buprenorphine. This is based on the consensus opinion of the Guideline Committee.

Once it has been established that the initial dose is well tolerated, the buprenorphine dose can be increased fairly rapidly to a dose that provides stable effects for 24 hours and is clinically effective. Buprenorphine doses after induction and titration should be, on average, at least 8 mg per day. The US FDA approves dosing to a limit of 24 mg per day, and there is limited evidence regarding the relative efficacy of higher doses. In addition, the use of higher doses may increase the risk of diversion.

Opioid withdrawal effects:

Because it contains naloxone, SUBOXONE is highly likely to produce marked and
intense withdrawal symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on
opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone. Sublingually, SUBOXONE
may cause opioid withdrawal symptoms in such persons if administered before the
agonist effects of the opioid have subsided.

### Thematic analysis of state medicaid buprenorphine prior authorization requirements [^111XzvMa]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Concerns about diversion may also explain restrictions. However, previous research suggests that nonprescribed use of buprenorphine is primarily motivated by lack of access to treatment, and that people who use nonprescribed buprenorphine do so to treat their withdrawal symptoms. Additionally, more recent evidence shows that any use of buprenorphine contributes to reduced overdose risk, suggesting that while diversion may not be legal, it likely contributes to reducing overall community-level overdose risks where the formal treatment system falls short.

Similarly, restrictions on specific formulations, such as buprenorphine without naloxone (the mono-product), likely stem from concerns about individuals potentially injecting buprenorphine, hence why naloxone was added to buprenorphine as a way to deter misuse. However, more recent evidence suggests that despite the addition of naloxone to buprenorphine, some people do inject the combined buprenorphine-naloxone formulation, though it is less desirable than the mono-product and may have lower street value. This evidence calls into question the utility of separating buprenorphine-only from buprenorphine-naloxone administratively by requiring evidence of allergy to naloxone, lack of tolerability, or pregnancy before initiating the mono-product. Ultimately, the ceiling effect of buprenorphine on the mu-opioid receptor, whether administered sublingually or injected intravenously, makes it such that the risk of overdose in adults is negligible, and in fact, higher frequency of nonprescribed buprenorphine use is associated with a lower risk of a drug overdose. Conversely, while the bioavailability of naloxone in the buprenorphine-naloxone product is reported to be negligible, its adverse effects are not. Some patients report headaches or nausea when taking the combined product, and these symptoms often resolve after switching to the mono-product. Unfortunately, unpleasant adverse effects can lead to patients discontinuing buprenorphine altogether, especially if they face barriers accessing the mono-product.

### Prescribing the buprenorphine monoproduct for adverse effects of buprenorphine-naloxone [^117W2gqx]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Buprenorphine-naloxone (BNX) reduces the risk of mortality from untreated opioid use disorder by 50% or more. However, adverse effects of BNX can be a cause of inconsistent use or discontinuation. The buprenorphine monoproduct (BUP) is effective and is sometimes tolerated better, but practice guidelines and insurance restrictions discourage its prescription due to concerns about diversion and injection. An idiopathic reaction of bilateral flank pain reported by three patients is used as an example to show how to assess the success of a BUP trial. Sublingual absorption of naloxone is discussed as a potential cause of adverse effects of BNX in sensitive individuals. Issues in clinical decision-making are presented to help prescribers assess the risk-benefit ratio of a BUP trial for the individual patient, the prescriber, and society. This commentary may serve as a stimulus for changes in practice guidelines and insurance coverage policies to allow greater flexibility in the prescribing of BUP.

5.8 Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events

Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of preexisting liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role.

exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the
development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Measurements of liver
function tests prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a
baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function tests during treatment is also
recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a
hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, the drug should be carefully
discontinued to prevent withdrawal symptoms and a return to illicit drug use,
and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated.

Allergic Reactions:

Cases of acute and chronic hypersensitivity to buprenorphine have been reported
both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. The most common
signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. Cases of bronchospasm,
angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. A history of
hypersensitivity to buprenorphine is a contraindication to Subutex or Suboxone
use. A history of hypersensitivity to naloxone is a contraindication to Suboxone
use.

Use in Ambulatory Patients:

SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX may impair the mental or physical abilities required for
the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or
operating machinery, especially during drug induction and dose adjustment.
Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including
automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that buprenorphine therapy does
not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities. Like other
opioids, SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory
patients.

Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure:

SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX, like other potent opioids, may elevate cerebrospinal fluid
pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury,
intracranial lesions and other circumstances where cerebrospinal pressure may be
increased. SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX can produce miosis and changes in the level of
consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114qXWPb]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Part 5: Buprenorphine — initiation, dosing, and setting describes that buprenorphine is a recommended treatment for patients with opioid use disorder who can give informed consent and have no specific contraindication. For patients who are currently opioid dependent, buprenorphine should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal, after which buprenorphine administration should start with a dose of 2–4 mg and dosages may be increased in increments of 2–8 mg. The setting for initiation should be carefully considered, with both office-based and home-based initiation considered safe and effective. Following initiation, the dose should be titrated to alleviate symptoms, with evidence suggesting that 16 mg per day or more may be more effective than lower doses, while there is limited evidence regarding the relative efficacy of doses higher than 24 mg per day and higher doses may increase the risk of diversion. The FDA recently approved several new buprenorphine formulations for treatment of opioid use disorder, and as data regarding their effectiveness are currently limited, clinicians should use these products as indicated and be mindful of emerging evidence, and patients' psychosocial needs should be assessed with offers or referrals to psychosocial treatment in conjunction with buprenorphine, noting that declining or absence of such treatment should not preclude buprenorphine treatment.

### Effectiveness of injectable extended-release naltrexone vs daily buprenorphine-naloxone for opioid dependence: a randomized clinical noninferiority trial [^113t2edY]. JAMA Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

To date, extended-release naltrexone hydrochloride has not previously been compared directly with opioid medication treatment (OMT), currently the most commonly prescribed treatment for opioid dependence.

Objective

To determine whether treatment with extended-release naltrexone will be as effective as daily buprenorphine hydrochloride with naloxone hydrochloride in maintaining abstinence from heroin and other illicit substances in newly detoxified individuals.

Design, Setting and Participants

A 12-week, multicenter, outpatient, open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted at 5 urban addiction clinics in Norway between November 1, 2012, and December 23, 2015; the last follow-up was performed on October 23, 2015. A total of 232 adult opioid-dependent (per DSM-IV criteria) individuals were recruited from outpatient addiction clinics and detoxification units and assessed for eligibility. Intention-to-treat analyses of efficacy end points were performed with all randomized participants.

Interventions

Randomization to either daily oral flexible dose buprenorphine-naloxone, 4 to 24 mg/d, or extended-release naltrexone hydrochloride, 380 mg, administered intramuscularly every fourth week for 12 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end points (protocol) were the randomized clinical trial completion rate, the proportion of opioid-negative urine drug tests, and number of days of use of heroin and other illicit opioids. Secondary end points included number of days of use of other illicit substances. Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting.

Results

Of 159 participants, mean (SD) age was 36 (8.6) years and 44 (27.7%) were women. Eighty individuals were randomized to extended-release naltrexone and 79 to buprenorphine-naloxone; 105 (66.0%) completed the trial. Retention in the extended-release naltrexone group was noninferior to the buprenorphine-naloxone group (difference, -0.1; with 95% CI, -0.2 to 0.1; p = 0.04), with mean (SD) time of 69.3 (25.9) and 63.7 (29.9) days, correspondingly (P = 0.33, log-rank test). Treatment with extended-release naltrexone showed noninferiority to buprenorphine-naloxone on group proportion of total number of opioid-negative urine drug tests (mean [SD], 0.9 [0.3] and 0.8 [0.4], respectively, difference, 0.1 with 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.2; P < .001) and use of heroin (mean difference, -3.2 with 95% CI, -4.9 to -1.5; P < .001) and other illicit opioids (mean difference, -2.7 with 95% CI, -4.6 to -0.9; P < .001). Superiority analysis showed significantly lower use of heroin and other illicit opioids in the extended-release naltrexone group. No significant differences were found between the treatment groups regarding most other illicit substance use.

Conclusions and Relevance

Extended-release naltrexone was as effective as buprenorphine-naloxone in maintaining short-term abstinence from heroin and other illicit substances and should be considered as a treatment option for opioid-dependent individuals.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1166utnQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — Formulations of buprenorphine: Recommendations using the term buprenorphine refer to both the buprenorphine only (monoproduct) and the combination buprenorphine/naloxone formulations, and the guideline generally recommends using combination buprenorphine/naloxone for both withdrawal management and treatment of opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine/naloxone products have not been evaluated in adequate and well-controlled studies for initiation in patients physically dependent on long-acting opioid products; for this reason, buprenorphine monotherapy may be considered in patients taking long-acting opioids, with possible transition later to an extended-release or combination formulation. Approved formulations include extended-release injections, an extended-release subdermal implant, and generic versions of sublingual and buccal tablets and films, and clinicians should use the new injectable products as indicated and be mindful of emerging evidence as it becomes available.

Naloxone and naltrexone-related terms — naloxone, naloxone challenge, and naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management — are defined for clinical context: Naloxone is a short-acting opioid antagonist. A naloxone challenge is a test in which naloxone is administered to patients to evaluate their level of opioid dependence before the commencement of naltrexone pharmacotherapy. Naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management is a method of withdrawal management that involves the use of multiple small doses of naltrexone, sometimes in combination with buprenorphine, over several days to manage withdrawal and facilitate the initiation of treatment with naltrexone.

### A prospective, randomized, multicenter acceptability and safety study of direct buprenorphine / naloxone induction in heroin-dependent individuals [^113uHqX3]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To provide controlled data on direct induction with buprenorphine/naloxone (BNX) versus indirect buprenorphine (BPN)-to-BNX induction.

Design

Phase 4, prospective, randomized, active-drug controlled, parallel-group trial consisting of a 2-day, double-blind, double-dummy induction phase followed by 26 days of open-label treatment with BNX.

Setting

Nineteen sites in 10 European countries from March 2008 to December 2009.

Participants

A total of 187 opioid-dependent men and women ≥ 15 years of age.

Measurements

The primary objective was assessment of patient response to direct and indirect BNX induction [proportion of patients receiving the scheduled 16-mg BNX dose on day 3 (i.e. first day post-induction)]. Secondary assessments included illicit drug use, treatment retention and compliance, withdrawal scale scores, and safety.

Findings

Patient response to direct- versus indirect-BNX induction was similar [direct 91.4% (85/93) versus indirect 90.4% (85/94); 95% confidence interval (CI): -7.3%, 9.2%]. Rapid dose induction (16 mg of BPN equivalent on day 2) was acceptable and 72% of patients completed treatment (day 28). There were no significant differences in secondary measures across groups. An average BNX maintenance dose of 15.3 mg across groups was associated with substantial reductions in illicit opioid use and no self-reported intravenous misuse. Treatment compliance and retention rates were similar (98.5% and 81.3%, respectively). Treatment-emergent adverse event rates were comparable: 75% versus 74% for direct- versus indirect-induction groups, respectively.

Conclusions

Direct buprenorphine/naloxone induction was a safe and effective strategy for maintenance treatment of opioid dependence. Response to high-dose direct buprenorphine/naloxone induction appears to be similar to indirect buprenorphine-to-buprenorphine/naloxone induction and was not associated with reports of intravenous buprenorphine/naloxone misuse.

### Clinical practice guideline: assessment and treatment of adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders and problematic substance use (excluding tobacco) [^111T9Kvf]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) in adolescents and young adults — AACAP suggests (2C) that buprenorphine treatment could be offered to adolescents and young adults with opioid use disorder. Evidence from four studies in 13 publications (n = 330 participants; age range, 14–25 years) found longer-course buprenorphine–naloxone treatment (12 weeks) more effective than shorter-course (14 days) for opioid abstinence (OR = 1.34 [0.70, 2.57]; low SOE), and a slow buprenorphine taper over 56 days more effective than a 28-day taper (OR = 2.59 [0.73, 9.18]; low SOE); buprenorphine combined with CBT+CM was more effective than clonidine+CBT+CM (OR = 4.00 [1.00, 16.0], low SOE). Harms noted no serious adverse events and no loss to follow-up due to adverse events, with minor adverse events including nausea, insomnia, stomach ache, vomiting, and anxiety. For all SUD/PSU other than OUD, evidence was insufficient regarding the benefits of pharmacologic treatment, including for concomitant substance use and psychiatric disorders. Additional support indicates no meta-analyses have been published since the AHRQ/Brown review that support or refute this suggestion, and differences of opinion were none, with the CQI Guideline Writing Group voting unanimously in favor. Implementation notes buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone are the only two Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved OUD medications for patients down to age 16 years, with sublingual formulations available as Subutex or combined with naloxone (Suboxone), and naloxone included to deter abuse if injected; a Journal review recommends increasing adolescents' access by increasing screening, decreasing insurance and regulatory barriers, and offering choice, and also recommends psychosocial treatments, concurrent treatment of psychiatric disorders, education on overdose risk factors, and prescribing naloxone for overdose prevention.

Buprenorphine chronic pain management — split dosing of buprenorphine with dosing every 6–8 hours may be adequate for chronic pain management in many patients with opioid use disorder and chronic pain. Chronic opioid therapy, especially at high doses, may heighten pain sensitivity, and some evidence suggests that patients experiencing substantial pain on high doses of full agonist opioids experience improved pain management when switched to buprenorphine. Buprenorphine therapy carries a lower risk of adverse effects, especially overdose, compared to full agonist opioids.

2.4 Maintenance

The dosage of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be progressively adjusted in increments/decrements of 2 mg/0.5 mg or 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms.
The maintenance dose of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets is generally in the range of 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to 24 mg/6 mg buprenorphine/naloxone per day depending on the individual patient. The recommended target dosage of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets is 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine/naloxone/day as a single daily dose. Dosages higher than 24 mg/6 mg have not been demonstrated to provide any clinical advantage.
When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patient's level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication.
There is no maximum recommended duration of maintenance treatment. Patients may require treatment indefinitely and should continue for as long as patients are benefiting and the use of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets contributes to the intended treatment goals.

2.5 Method of Administration

Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets must be administered whole. Do not cut, chew, or swallow Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets. Advise patients not to eat or drink anything until the tablet is completely dissolved.

Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be placed under the tongue until it is dissolved. For doses requiring the use of more than two tablets, patients are advised to either place all the tablets at once or alternatively (if they cannot fit in more than two tablets comfortably), place two tablets at a time under the tongue. Either way, the patients should continue to hold the tablets under the tongue until they dissolve; swallowing the tablets reduces the bioavailability of the drug. To ensure consistency in bioavailability, patients should follow the same manner of dosing with continued use of the product.

Proper administration technique should be demonstrated to the patient.

Advise patients to do the following after the product has completely dissolved in the oral mucosa: take a sip of water, swish gently around the teeth and gums, and swallow. Advise patients to wait for at least one hour after taking Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets before brushing teeth [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13), Postmarketing Experience (6.2), Information for Patients (17), and Medication Guide].

### Low dose initiation of buprenorphine: a narrative review and practical approach [^1153RLms]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Low dose buprenorphine initiation, is an alternative method of initiating buprenorphine in which the starting dose is very low and gradually increased to therapeutic levels over a period of days. This method takes advantage of slow displacement of the full opioid agonist from mu-opioid receptors, avoiding the need for a person with opioid use disorder to experience opioid withdrawal symptoms before initiating buprenorphine, while also minimizing the risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal. With this initiation method, full opioid agonists can be continued as buprenorphine is initiated, expanding the population to which buprenorphine can be offered. To date, the literature on low dose initiation is primarily case-based but rapidly growing. While evidence emerges, guidance for the use of low dose initiation is clearly desired and urgently needed in the context of an increasingly risky and contaminated opioid drug supply, particularly with high potency synthetic opioids, driving overdose deaths. Despite limited evidence, several principles to guide low dose initiation have been identified including: (1) choosing the appropriate clinical situation, (2) initiating at a low buprenorphine dose, (3) titrating the buprenorphine dose gradually, (4) continuing the full opioid agonist even if it is nonmedical, (5) communicating clearly with frequent monitoring, (6) pausing or delaying buprenorphine dose changes if opioid withdrawal symptoms occur, and (7) prioritizing care coordination. We review a practical approach to low dose initiation in hospital-based and outpatient settings guided by the current evidence.

### Emergency department visits and hospitalizations for buprenorphine ingestion by children – United States, 2010–2011 [^111mGTow]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine (Subutex) and buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) received Food and Drug Administration approval in 2002 for the treatment of opioid dependence. Introduction of these drugs expanded the availability of opioid-dependence treatment options to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with opioid abuse, and buprenorphine has become an increasingly prescribed component of office-based treatment. However, unsupervised ingestion of buprenorphine-containing products by children is a growing concern.

During 2010–2011, the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System — Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance project identified 68 cases involving buprenorphine product ingestions (out of 226 cases of opioid product ingestions) by children aged < 6 years. * Based on these cases, CDC estimates that, during 2010–2011, an average of 1,499 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 905–2,092) children aged < 6 years were evaluated each year in U.S. emergency departments (EDs) for buprenorphine-product ingestions; in contrast, zero cases were reported in 2004. Nearly all (95.8%) of the ED visits involved buprenorphine/naloxone. As is typical of unsupervised pediatric exposures to other medications, most ED visits involved boys (59.5%) and children aged 1 and 2 years (76.8%). Because of buprenorphine's long half-life and risk for respiratory depression, 58.4% of ingestion-related ED visits required hospitalization. †

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets are administered sublingually as a single daily dose.

Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets do not contain naloxone and is preferred for use only during induction. Following induction, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film or buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are preferred due to the presence of naloxone when clinical use includes unsupervised administration. The use of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets for unsupervised administration should be limited to those patients who cannot tolerate buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film or buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets; for example, those patients who have been shown to be hypersensitive to naloxone.

Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits.

2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver. Because patients being treated for opioid use disorder have the potential for relapse, putting them at risk for opioid overdose, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Advise patients and caregivers that naloxone may also be administered for a known or suspected overdose with Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets itself. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration of naloxone may be necessary due to the long duration of action of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets and its affinity for the mu-opioid receptor [see Overdosage (10)].

Inform patients and caregivers of their options for obtaining naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program) [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride (Zubsolv) [^112YmfS8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

ZUBSOLV for use as initial treatment was evaluated in two clinical trials that had identical, blinded, two-day induction phases, comparing ZUBSOLV to generic buprenorphine. On the first day, subjects received an initial dose of ZUBSOLV 1.4 mg/0.36 mg or generic buprenorphine 2 mg, followed by ZUBSOLV 4.2 mg/1.08 mg or generic buprenorphine 6 mg 1.5 hours later. In total, safety data were available for 538 opioid-dependent subjects exposed to ZUBSOLV (buprenorphine/naloxone) sublingual tablets when used for initial treatment.

BUP = buprenorphine

ZUBSOLV = buprenorphine/naloxone

The safety of buprenorphine/naloxone for longer-term use (up to 16 weeks of treatment) was evaluated in previous studies in 497 opioid-dependent subjects. The prospective evaluation of buprenorphine/naloxone was supported by clinical trials using buprenorphine tablets without naloxone and other trials using buprenorphine sublingual solutions. In total, safety data were available from 3214 opioid-dependent subjects exposed to buprenorphine at doses in the range used in treatment of opioid addiction. See Table 2.

The adverse event profile of buprenorphine was also characterized in the dose-controlled study of buprenorphine solution, over a range of doses in four months of treatment. Table 3 shows adverse events reported by at least 5% of subjects in any dose group in the dose-controlled study.

*Sublingual solution. Doses in this table cannot necessarily be delivered in tablet form, but for comparison purposes:

"Very low" dose (1 mg solution) would be less than a tablet dose of 2 mg

"Low" dose (4 mg solution) approximates a 6 mg tablet dose

"Moderate" dose (8 mg solution) approximates a 12 mg tablet dose

"High" dose (16 mg solution) approximates a 24 mg tablet dose
