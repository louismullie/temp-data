## Question

what are adverse effect of lithium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the adverse effects of lithium. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence to anchor the profile. Then, I should verify dose–response and the narrow therapeutic index. Next, I will categorize adverse effects by organ system and note which are dose-related versus idiosyncratic. After that, I should quantify risks where possible and flag special populations. Finally, I will integrate monitoring guidance and management strategies, and close with a concise synthesis that distinguishes common, serious, and rare events with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the anchor evidence. The most authoritative synthesis is the 2012 Lancet systematic review and meta-analysis of 385 studies, which quantifies renal, endocrine, weight, and dermatologic effects and provides the backbone for risk estimates and clinical interpretation, so I should rely on it for core assertions and then layer in FDA labeling and contemporary reviews for nuance and updates [^11575o2w].

> I need to check the dose–response relationship and therapeutic index before anything else. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index, with toxicity risk rising as levels approach or exceed about 1.0–1.2 mmol/L, and many adverse effects are dose-related; maintaining plasma levels in the 0.6–0.8 mmol/L range balances efficacy and tolerability, though some patients may be managed at 0.4–0.6 mmol/L with fewer side effects and preserved benefit in select contexts [^112u4xPh] [^113B2BUQ] [^111EfCDM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any single organ system; I will now examine renal effects, which are the most consequential with chronic therapy. Lithium commonly impairs urinary concentrating ability, with a mean reduction of about 15% and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurring in up to 40% of patients, while the average GFR decline is modest at roughly 6 mL/min over years of treatment; importantly, the absolute risk of end-stage renal disease is low at about 0.5% in cohort data, though risk accrues with duration and episodes of toxicity, and some patients develop chronic kidney disease despite optimal monitoring [^1175FsVf] [^1145DeUm] [^1112E86H].

> Wait, let me verify thyroid and parathyroid risks next. Lithium increases the odds of clinical hypothyroidism about sixfold versus placebo, with mean TSH rising by roughly 4 mIU/L, and it also elevates calcium and parathyroid hormone, indicating a higher prevalence of hyperparathyroidism; these endocrine effects are common and warrant baseline and periodic screening with replacement or referral as indicated [^113aBsi9] [^111d1Zaz].

> I will now examine metabolic and gastrointestinal effects. Lithium is associated with weight gain versus placebo, with an odds ratio around 1.9, and early gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are common, particularly during initiation; these GI effects are often transient and can be mitigated by dose adjustment, formulation choice, or taking lithium with food [^1169KfFT] [^112mMGWm].

> Let me consider neurologic and cognitive effects carefully. Tremor is a frequent early adverse effect and can be dose-limiting, while cognitive complaints such as mental slowing and memory problems are reported and may be dose-related; however, objective cognitive changes are heterogeneous and often mild, with some studies showing no decrement or even improvement when mood stabilizes, underscoring the need to distinguish illness-related cognitive deficits from medication effects and to monitor closely in vulnerable patients [^1169KfFT] [^113rJzUo] [^113d4Udf].

> Next, I should review dermatologic and miscellaneous effects. Acne and psoriasis can be worsened or precipitated by lithium, with acneiform eruptions reported in up to 45% in some series, and alopecia, though less common, is also described; these cutaneous effects can impact adherence and may necessitate dermatologic management or, rarely, medication change if refractory [^115SFv6e] [^1169KfFT].

> But wait, what about rare but serious toxicities. Lithium can cause encephalopathy, seizures, and coma at higher levels, and there is a boxed warning emphasizing toxicity near therapeutic concentrations; Brugada-pattern ECG changes and arrhythmias have been reported, and lithium crosses the placenta with risks of neonatal toxicity and a small increase in cardiac malformations, so pregnancy requires shared decision-making, dose adjustments, and coordinated peripartum planning [^111Q6zZt] [^1175FsVf] [^11692qx8] [^113wuWNC].

> I should double-check special populations and monitoring cadence. Older adults are at higher risk of toxicity due to reduced clearance and comorbidities, so lower target levels and more frequent monitoring are prudent; guidelines recommend lithium levels every 3–6 months and renal and thyroid function every 3–6 months in stable patients, with closer surveillance after dose changes, during illness, or when interacting drugs are introduced [^112kn4Ad] [^116aAXMG] [^113XeNUp].

> Let me reconsider management strategies for common adverse effects to ensure they are practical. For polyuria and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, amiloride may help mechanistically, though evidence quality varies; for tremor, beta-blockers or primidone can be effective; for GI upset, take with food or switch to extended-release; for weight gain, lifestyle and, in select cases, pharmacologic adjuncts may be considered; and for hypothyroidism, levothyroxine replacement is standard, while hyperparathyroidism may require calcimimetic therapy or surgical consultation if severe [^1145DeUm] [^115drqKK] [^112mMGWm] [^111d1Zaz].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line and make sure I am not overstating any risk. In sum, lithium's most common adverse effects are polyuria and thirst, tremor, gastrointestinal upset, and hypothyroidism; the most serious risks are renal impairment and neurotoxicity, which are uncommon with proper monitoring but can be severe; most adverse effects are dose-related and modifiable, reinforcing the principle of using the lowest effective dose with routine monitoring of lithium, renal, and thyroid parameters [^1169KfFT] [^112u4xPh] [^116aAXMG].

---

Lithium has a **narrow therapeutic index** [^112u4xPh] and can cause dose-related adverse effects even at therapeutic levels [^11575o2w]. The most common effects are **tremor, polyuria/polydipsia, nausea, and hypothyroidism** [^1169KfFT]; serious risks include nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, chronic kidney disease, and neurotoxicity [^1145DeUm] [^1169KfFT]. Regular monitoring of serum lithium, renal, and thyroid function is essential to mitigate risks [^116aAXMG] [^115Nb2JY].

---

## Common adverse effects (≥ 10%)

- **Tremor**: Fine hand tremor is very common, often dose-related, and may persist with continued therapy [^11575o2w] [^1177hQ6v].

- **Polyuria and polydipsia**: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs in up to 40% of patients, causing excessive urination and thirst [^1145DeUm].

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are common, especially during initiation or dose increases [^11575o2w].

- **Hypothyroidism**: Lithium increases the risk of clinical hypothyroidism approximately fivefold [^1169KfFT].

---

## Serious adverse effects

- **Renal toxicity**: Chronic kidney disease and, rarely, end-stage renal failure can occur with long-term use; risk correlates with duration and cumulative exposure [^1169KfFT] [^114peuD7].

- **Neurotoxicity**: At higher levels, lithium can cause ataxia, confusion, seizures, and coma; persistent neurotoxicity with cerebellar atrophy has been reported [^113aBsi9].

- **Cardiac effects**: Bradycardia, AV block, and Brugada syndrome can occur, particularly in susceptible patients [^1175FsVf].

- **Teratogenicity**: First-trimester exposure is associated with increased risk of cardiac malformations, especially Ebstein's anomaly [^11692qx8] [^117CBtnK].

---

## Dose-related adverse effects

Adverse effects are strongly correlated with serum lithium levels; **maintaining levels within the therapeutic range (0.6–1.0 mmol/L)** minimizes risk [^112u4xPh] [^113B2BUQ]. Mild effects (e.g. tremor, nausea) may occur at 1.0–1.5 mmol/L, moderate effects (e.g. confusion, ataxia) at 1.5–2.0 mmol/L, and severe toxicity (e.g. seizures, coma) above 2.0 mmol/L [^11575o2w].

---

## Monitoring and management

Regular monitoring is essential to detect and manage adverse effects:

| **Parameter** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|
| Serum lithium | Every 3–6 months once stable [^116aAXMG] [^115Nb2JY] |
| Renal function (eGFR, creatinine) | Every 3–6 months [^116aAXMG] [^115Nb2JY] |
| Thyroid function (TSH, free T4) | Every 6–12 months [^116aAXMG] [^115Nb2JY] |
| Calcium (for hyperparathyroidism) | Annually [^1169KfFT] |

---

Management strategies include dose reduction, switching formulations, and treating specific effects (e.g. amiloride for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism) [^1145DeUm] [^111d1Zaz].

---

Lithium is effective but carries a **meaningful adverse effect burden**; careful patient selection, dosing, and monitoring are essential to balance benefits and risks [^1169KfFT].

### Lithium: old drug, new tricks? [^111wfZ5Q]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lithium is considered to have substantial benefits and harms, which constitutes a complex clinical challenge. This article aims to cover five putative strategies to maximise the benefits of lithium therapy while concurrently minimising its harms.

Recent Findings

The strategies range in terms of their evidence base. Some are supported by long-standing evidence, namely the management of some common and/or severe adverse effects. For others, we are seeing emerging research focus, particularly in the use of lithium in 'sub-therapeutic' doses. In considering gradual titration and variable dosing, as well as innovation to enhance the monitoring of lithium, there is limited evidence which is reviewed. We conclude that optimising lithium therapy is not straightforward and clearly individual patient characteristics must be thoroughly prioritised. However, a general rule for optimising can be to maintain lithium at its lowest therapeutic level for an individual patient, with close monitoring of levels and adverse effects as well as careful titration where clinically indicated.

### Commentary on a recent review of lithium toxicity: what are its implications for clinical practice? [^114zqmBg]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

In all treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder (BD), lithium has been recommended as a first-line maintenance treatment. Some directives have gone further; recent evidence-based and consensus-based German guidelines firmly endorse lithium salts as the only first-line maintenance treatment in BD, and some investigators qualify lithium as the only proven mood stabilizer. However, the potential side-effects and risks of lithium treatment may at times make the implementation of these recommendations in daily practice challenging.

The adverse effects (AEs) and all practical aspects of lithium treatment are detailed in a comprehensive textbook published in 2006. In six chapters, the book summarizes the toxicological aspects of lithium treatment, and provides practical recommendations for the safe use of lithium salts in acute and long-term treatment. However, the recent paper by McKnight et al. a research group from Oxford. has provided the first formal meta-analysis of the more common AEs to lithium. This contribution is new, important, and welcome. However, as a guide for practice, such statistical analysis, because of the limitations outlined below, needs to be complemented by other relevant observations and individual patient-focused perspectives. Taking this into account it seems, as we explain later, that the findings from this meta-analysis somewhat underestimate the renal side-effects and distort to some degree or exclude other AEs.

### Lithium: old drug, new tricks? [^1144Zc64]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lithium has long been regarded as the gold standard in the treatment of bipolar disorder, offering significant efficacy in both acute mood episodes and long-term relapse prevention. Its therapeutic benefits extend beyond bipolar disorder to include unipolar depression, suicidality prevention, and emerging evidence for its potential in neuroprotection and cognitive health. This broad therapeutic spectrum highlights lithium's importance in psychiatric care, making it an essential component of clinical guidelines worldwide.

However, the use of lithium is not without challenges. At high therapeutic doses, and particularly with long-term use, lithium is associated with significant risks, including renal impairment, thyroid dysfunction, and neurological side effects. These adverse effects necessitate close monitoring of renal and thyroid function, which can be burdensome for both patients and healthcare systems. Additionally, lithium's narrow therapeutic window raises concerns about toxicity, which can result in life-threatening complications if blood levels are not carefully managed.

Beyond the physiological concerns, treatment adherence is a critical determinant of lithium's effectiveness. Despite its benefits in stabilising mood and reducing suicidality, adherence rates to lithium therapy remain suboptimal, and are most often (up to 62%) due to perceived side effects. Barriers to optimal monitoring and adherence together not only compromise individual outcomes but also exacerbate the cost-benefit considerations of long-term lithium more broadly.

In light of these challenges, there is growing interest in optimising lithium therapy, not only in exploring potential additional indications but also through dose adjustment, more substantive management of its associated risks and innovative monitoring strategies. Emerging evidence suggests that lower doses of lithium can, in some circumstances, retain efficacy while reducing the risk of adverse effects, presenting a promising avenue for maximising therapeutic benefits.

### Commentary on a recent review of lithium toxicity: what are its implications for clinical practice? [^114zpfHe]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Below, we discuss several specific issues that need to be considered critically.

1. Practicing clinicians are primarily interested in the potential AEs experienced by properly treated patients, that is, patients who are correctly selected for long-term lithium treatment, are maintained on a minimum effective dosage, and are regularly monitored and managed. In this context, lithium treatment generates AEs in a relatively small proportion of patients. However, the reports included in the meta-analysis unavoidably included numerous patients with bipolar spectrum disorders for whom lithium treatment was not the optimal treatment choice, and who were treated by physicians with insufficient experience in lithium treatment. Hence, an important aspect of future work would be to compare the rates of side-effects in specialized programs as opposed to general psychiatric practice.

2. Sufficient information about dosage and serum levels of lithium could not be taken into account although the authors made efforts to exclude patients with pre-existing lithium intoxication. Many side-effects, including endocrine and metabolic effects are dose-dependent, and therefore can often be controlled by proper dose titration. Details on patient compliance and the time intervals between lithium plasma levels and AEs would have been important background information, and their absence raises questions about the validity of the data and the statistical processing. This criticism was also raised by Malhi and Berk in the same issue of the journal. As clinicians, we often come across referred patients whose dosage has not been adjusted for many years, and they frequently experience side-effects because their lithium levels are frequently much higher than 1.0 mmol/l.

3. The potential confounding factors of age and sex on lithium treatment could not be considered adequately in the meta-analysis.

4. Another important piece of information for the correct interpretation of side-effects is the patient's clinical response to long-term lithium treatment. Non-responders develop side-effects distinctly more frequently than responders, even at comparable serum lithium levels.

5. There is also the problem of potentially harmful co-medication. McKnight et al. did not elaborate on whether co-prescription of potentially nephrotoxic drugs (for example, antibiotics, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors) or compounds that can change the pharmacokinetics of lithium was controlled for, as this can be a strong potential confounding factor particularly with regard to renal toxicity.

6. Finally, it remains unclear whether AEs such as impaired thyroid function occurred during lithium medication given alone or were seen during treatment with thyroxin supplementation.

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD / IGSLI task force on treatment with lithium [^113B2BUQ]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

3.5 Delphi survey

The Delphi survey was completed by 33 of the 50 (66.6%) Task Force members. Many statements received additional comments, most frequently that evidence regarding a statement or a specified response was lacking.

There was consensus on recommendations regarding timing of blood sampling to measure lithium serum levels during the day and on whether recommendations for optimal serum lithium levels should be the same with once daily dosing compared to twice daily dosing, as well as with different formulations of lithium medication (immediate release vs extended release).

There was a lack of consensus on the overall statement "The higher the lithium serum level, the higher the likelihood of a preventative response " (endorsed by only 54.5%) while several members commented that serum levels in the lower range (below 0.60 mmol/L) are associated with efficacy but in the higher range (above 1.00 mmol/L) with more adverse effects and toxicity. In addition, there was no consensus on the statement "There is a minimum serum cut‐off level below which essentially no patients are likely to experience a preventative effect" (endorsed by 72.7%) while there was a wide range of specified responses regarding for a specific cut‐off level (0.30, 0.40, 0.50, or 0.60 mmol/L, endorsed by 16.7, 41.7, 16.7, or 20.8%, respectively). In contrast, there was consensus on the statement "There is a maximum lithium serum level that should ideally never be exceeded because of the risk of severe intolerance and/or intoxication" (endorsed by 93.9%) but lack of agreement on a specific upper limit to recommend: most frequently supported limits being 1.00 and 1.20 mmol/L, endorsed by 35.5 and 38.7%, respectively.

### Commentary on a recent review of lithium toxicity: what are its implications for clinical practice? [^114g1TgH]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

A recent paper by McKnight et al. in The Lancet has provided the first formal meta-analysis of the more common adverse reactions to lithium. The authors analyzed 385 studies and focused mainly on the harmful effects of lithium on the kidney, the thyroid and parathyroid glands, body weight, skin and congenital malformations. Their contribution is important and welcome, but as a guide for practice, it needs to be complemented by other relevant observations and individual patient-focused perspectives. The findings from that meta-analysis somewhat underestimate the renal side-effects, and distort to some degree or exclude other adverse effects. The glomerular filtration rate is reduced but not more than 0 to 5 ml/min/year of observation; this may not fully reflect the present state of knowledge. A quarter of patients in the study had abnormalities of the thyroid and/or parathyroid gland, and lithium was found to increase body weight significantly less than did olanzapine. Unfortunately, the authors did not consider the observations from spontaneous reporting systems, which may have changed the picture. We feel that some specific limitations of the study were related to the inclusion of patients regardless of adequacy of treatment, quality of monitoring, drug combinations, age and sex, and stabilization response.

Adjunct Therapies to Manage Side Effects

It is firstly relevant (see subsequent sections) that there is a dose association between lithium and its adverse effects. For most, frequency/severity increases notably above serum lithium 0.7/0.8mmol/L. For some (e.g. diarrhoea, tremor, weight gain) complaints are most frequent in early treatment stages and do not tend to worsen with longer term treatment. Others (see below) can decline with longer durations of lithium use.

In a large examination of reasons for lithium discontinuation, the most common was adverse effects and the most common adverse effects noted as reasons for discontinuing were diarrhoea (13%), tremor (11%), polyuria and/or polydipsia (9%), increases in creatinine (9%) and weight gain (7%). Of these, management strategies for common side effects align with those recommended in general (not specifically for lithium) e.g. taking medication alongside a meal for gastrointestinal effects, recommendations for managing weight gain. This section does not comprehensively cover these or many other adverse effects including in cardiovascular, CNS, dermatological and endocrinological domains, though assessment and management guidance is available and recommended for consultation.

Before focusing more on three particular areas of adverse effect (tremor, renal, thyroid), we briefly mention that patients should be informed about the importance of water and salt intake: due to lithium's effects on their metabolism, changes in intake can lead to medical complications in those at risk e.g. in people with a history of normal pressure hydrocephalus, this may increase the risks of raised intracranial blood pressure or a complication leading to lithium toxicity. While this risk primarily applies to those who are prone to circulatory difficulties (e.g. heart failure), it can also affect others exposed to dehydration or sunstroke.

Use of Low-level Lithium

Our understanding of lithium's narrow therapeutic index originates from the seminal 1954 study by Schou et al. where doses were increased after the point of manic resolution until toxicity (diarrhoea, nausea, tremor) was observed. Doses were then lowered, observing reversed toxicity and maintained clinical benefit. Since then, studies have largely supported the use of lithium at 0.6–0.6.8mmol/L (usually for treating depression or bipolar maintenance), and 0.8–1.8.0mmol/L (usually for treating mania) and studies have overwhelmingly employed these 'therapeutic' levels. Regardless, adverse effects at these levels are not negligible and lower levels appear associated with far reduced adverse effects. We briefly summarise below clinical evidence focused on low level (< 0.6mmol/L) lithium. We acknowledge that this is not comprehensive, and note that we do not include here studies using low dose lithium without reporting serum levels. When discussing levels, note that these are lithium levels 12 h after the most recent dose.

Depression

This evidence is observational and taken largely from bipolar populations although there is small-scale support for low-level lithium adjunctively in unipolar depression and people prescribed lithium for depression are at risk of developing bipolar. Despite a lack of controlled trial evidence, efficacy studies generally aim for a minimum lithium concentration of 0.5–0.6 mmol/L.

Suicidality

One clinical study (n = 283) found no significant improvement in suicidality (or affective symptoms) with the use of adjunctive low-level lithium (mean 0.47mmol/L) in symptomatic bipolar patients compared to usual care. Of note, the sample had high rates of comorbidities, ongoing episodes from baseline and those randomised to lithium (as opposed to 'optimised usual care') may have had a more severe mania burden. Distinct from low dosing, is trace dose lithium (< 5 mg ionic lithium), which has its own body of ecological evidence suggesting its benefits on the effects of suicidality though clearly, the quality of evidence behind lithium's benefits on suicidality from such studies is limited.

### Lithium: a review of its metabolic adverse effects [^117LHP6y]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment with lithium has long been recognized to be associated with metabolic adverse effects notably hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, weight gain and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. It is important that clinicians prescribing lithium are aware of these adverse effects and have a strategy for their detection and management. We review aspects of these actions of lithium including their prevalence, risk factors, biochemical changes involved and management, and discuss some advances that have been made in their understanding in recent years.

### The use of lithium for the treatment of bipolar disorder: recommendations from clinical practice guidelines [^115Nj2Tv]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Lithium is an effective mood stabilizer that is used principally for the management of bipolar disorder (BD). Its administration is complex and often requires sophisticated management and assiduous monitoring. When considering the use of lithium therapy for bipolar disorder, clinicians are advised to refer to recommendations outlined in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs); but because of varying emphases placed by different international CPGs, recommendations addressing the practical use of lithium lack consistency.

Method

In order to inform clinicians of optimal lithium therapy for bipolar disorder, we compared and synthesized recommendations for the treatment of bipolar disorder made by recognized CPGs internationally. We conducted a search of the literature and extracted guidance across multiple clinical issues, including clinical indications, disorder subtypes, additional uses, special populations, practical aspects, and side effects.

Results

Collectively, CPGs consider lithium most robustly as a first-line intervention for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder and strongly for the treatment of mania, with relatively modest support for the management of acute bipolar depression. Additionally, there is consensus across the CPGs that lithium tangibly reduces the risk of suicide. Generally, CPGs provide guidance on the many facets of initiating and maintaining patients on lithium therapy, but individually the CPGs varied in terms of depth and practical guidance they provide across these areas. However, consensus was established across many key areas of practice such as the ideal lithium plasma concentration for maintenance and monitoring (0.6–0.8mmol/L), along with the need for regular monitoring of renal and endocrine function. However, with more complex aspects (e.g., atypical presentations) and in special populations (e.g., youth; pregnancy and post-partum; older adults), guidance varied considerably and clear consensus recommendations were more difficult to achieve. In younger adults desirable plasma lithium levels of 0.6–0.8mmol/L can perhaps be achieved with comparatively lower doses and in the very elderly it may be prudent to target lower plasma levels in the first instance. These are important practical points for consideration that, along with many others offered throughout the article, should assist clinicians in dissecting the more complex aspects of management with greater precision.

Limitations

This review was limited to CPGs written in English. CPGs are themselves limited by reliance on evidence that often has little resemblance to real-world presentations. An important area that is not sufficiently addressed in the CPGs is clear guidance on the cessation of lithium therapy.

Conclusions

Further research is needed on many aspects of lithium therapy and this alongside existing knowledge needs to be used more consistently to inform CPGs, which should also incorporate empirical evidence and clinical experience. The recommendations in this paper provide a useful synthesis of guidance available currently.

Further research and clinical implications

Further investigation of lithium's impact on cognition requires larger randomised controlled trials across distinct populations. Longitudinal studies should disentangle lithium's cognitive effects from illness-related confounders by examining different illness stages (e.g. pre, onset and during treatment) and subgroup analyses (e.g. different treatment responses, baseline cognitive deficits and subjective complaints alignment) using more updated, standardised cognitive batteries and performance-based functional measures. Additionally, investigating the association between cognitive function and lithium response – specifically comparing excellent responders to non-responders – could provide further insights. Given the typically mild and potentially reversible nature of cognitive effects observed in affective disorder studies, a critical focus should be on understanding their functional implications for individuals on long-term lithium. Healthcare providers should address non-adherence driven by fear rather than concrete side effects, emphasizing cognitive risks and serum level monitoring. When counselling patients about lithium therapy, clinicians should acknowledge that reported cognitive benefits predominantly reflect the experience of treatment persisters, and discussions should focus on cognitive preservation in the context of mood stabilisation rather than enhancement. For patients with pre-existing cognitive concerns or cognitively demanding occupations, baseline cognitive assessment and early monitoring may identify those at risk for discontinuation and allow for timely dose adjustments or therapeutic alternatives. Ultimately, prioritising resolution of main symptoms should remain the primary therapeutic goal.

Lithium, which has long-standing and wide-ranging evidenced neuropsychiatric benefits, has relatively little research examining specifically its cognitive effects. This systematic review underscores the diverse findings across cognitive domains and populations, highlighting the challenge of interpreting lithium's cognitive impact. There is a clear call for robust, longitudinal controlled studies with an emphasis on subgroup analysis. Amidst these intricacies, recognising the mild changes without immense cognitive decline lays the groundwork for patients' education and informed therapeutic decisions involving lithium.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The occurrence and severity of adverse reactions are generally directly related to serum lithium concentrations and to individual patient sensitivity to lithium. They generally occur more frequently and with greater severity at higher concentrations.

Adverse reactions may be encountered at serum lithium concentrations below 1.5 mEq/L. Mild to moderate adverse reactions may occur at concentrations from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L, and moderate to severe reactions may be seen at concentrations from 2 mEq/L and above.

Fine hand tremor, polyuria and mild thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase and may persist throughout treatment. Transient and mild nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration.

These side effects usually subside with continued treatment or with a temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. If persistent, a cessation of lithium therapy may be required. Diarrhea, vomiting, drowsiness, muscular weakness and lack of coordination may be early signs of lithium intoxication, and can occur at lithium concentrations below 2 mEq/L. At higher concentrations, giddiness, ataxia, blurred vision, tinnitus and a large output of dilute urine may be seen. Serum lithium concentrations above 3 mEq/L may produce a complex clinical picture involving multiple organs and organ systems. Serum lithium concentrations should not be permitted to exceed 2 mEq/L during the acute treatment phase.

### Lithium for acute mania [^1177hQ6v]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bipolar disorder is a common condition associated with high morbidity; developing efficacious, safe treatments is therefore essential. Lithium is an effective maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder. It acts as mood stabiliser and reduces the risk of suicide. However, evidence assessing the efficacy of lithium in the treatment of acute mania is less robust. Current evidence-based guidelines cite multiple anti-dopaminergic and mood-stabilising agents as initial treatments: more definite evidence is needed to decide if lithium should be the first-line therapy.

Objectives

1. To assess the effects of lithium in comparison with placebo or other active treatment in alleviating the acute symptoms of a manic or mixed episode in people with bipolar disorder.2. To review the acceptability and tolerability of treatment with lithium in comparison with placebo or other active treatments in alleviating the acute symptoms of a manic or mixed episode in people with bipolar disorder.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. We also searched the World Health Organization trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We have incorporated studies from searches to 18 May 2018 into the current analyses.

Selection Criteria

Prospective randomised controlled studies comparing lithium with placebo or alternative drug treatment in treatment of acute mania. We included anyone with bipolar disorder, male and female, of any age.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. We used odds ratios (ORs) to analyse binary efficacy outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuously distributed outcomes. We used a fixed-effect model unless heterogeneity was moderate or substantial, in which case we used a random-effects model. We used Review Manager 5 to analyse data. We assessed the certainty of evidence for individual outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We found 36 randomised controlled studies comparing lithium with placebo, one of 12 drugs, or electroconvulsive therapy for treatment of acute mania. Studies included male and female participants (n = 4220), of all ages, who all fitted criteria for a manic episode within the context of a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Risk of bias was variable; 12 studies had a high risk of bias in one domain and 27 gave inadequate information on randomisation leading to an 'unclear' rating for selection bias. Lithium versus placeboHigh-certainty evidence found that lithium was an effective treatment for acute mania and was more effective than placebo at inducing a response (OR 2.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.73 to 2.63; participants = 1707; studies = 6; I² = 16%; high-certainty evidence), or remission (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.69; participants = 1597; studies = 5; I² = 21%; high-certainty evidence). Lithium was more likely than placebo to cause tremor (OR 3.25, 95% CI 2.10 to 5.04; participants = 1241; studies = 6; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence), and somnolence (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.46 to 3.58; participants = 1351; studies = 7; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of lithium for all-cause dropouts (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.25; participants = 1353; studies = 7; I² = 75%; moderate-certainty evidence), and weight gain (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.56 to 3.92; participants = 735, studies = 3; I² = 51%; moderate-certainty evidence). Lithium versus antipsychotics or mood stabilisersFor the outcome of inducing a response, there was only very low-certainty evidence regarding lithium compared to haloperidol (MD -2.40, 95% CI -6.31 to 1.50; participants = 80; studies = 3; I² = 95%), quetiapine (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.55; participants = 335; studies = 2; I² = 71%), and carbamazepine (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.60; participants = 102; studies = 3; I² = 0%). Lithium was probably less likely to induce a response than olanzapine (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.94; participants = 180; studies = 2; I² = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence). Lithium may be less likely to induce a response than risperidone (MD 7.28, 95% CI 5.22 to 9.34; participants = 241; studies = 3; I² = 49%; low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between lithium and valproate (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.70; participants = 607; studies = 5; I² = 22%; moderate-certainty evidence). There was moderate-certainty evidence that lithium was more effective than topiramate at treating acute mania (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.63 to 3.20; participants = 660; studies = 1). Data on adverse events for these comparisons contained too few studies to provide high-certainty evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review indicates that lithium is more effective than placebo as a treatment for acute mania but increases the risk for somnolence and tremor. Limited evidence suggests little or no difference between lithium and other mood stabilisers (valproate, carbamazepine) or antipsychotics (risperidone, quetiapine, haloperidol). Olanzapine may be an exception, as it is probably slightly more effective than lithium. There is uncertain evidence that risperidone may also be more effective than lithium. Lithium is probably more effective at treating acute mania than topiramate. When compared to placebo, lithium was more likely to cause adverse events. However, when compared to other drugs, too few studies provided data on adverse effects to provide high-certainty evidence. More, rigorously designed, large-scale studies are needed to definitively conclude if lithium is superior to other interventions in treating acute mania.

### Lithium toxicity profile: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1169KfFT]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Lithium is a widely used and effective treatment for mood disorders. There has been concern about its safety but no adequate synthesis of the evidence for adverse effects. We aimed to undertake a clinically informative, systematic toxicity profile of lithium.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies. We searched electronic databases, specialist journals, reference lists, textbooks, and conference abstracts. We used a hierarchy of evidence which considered randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and case reports that included patients with mood disorders given lithium. Outcome measures were renal, thyroid, and parathyroid function; weight change; skin disorders; hair disorders; and teratogenicity.

Findings

We screened 5988 abstracts for eligibility and included 385 studies in the analysis. On average, glomerular filtration rate was reduced by -6.22 mL/min (95% CI -14.65 to 2.20, p = 0.148) and urinary concentrating ability by 15% of normal maximum (weighted mean difference -158.43 mOsm/kg, 95% CI -229.78 to -87.07, p < 0.0001). Lithium might increase risk of renal failure, but the absolute risk was small (18 of 3369 [0.5%] patients received renal replacement therapy). The prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism was increased in patients taking lithium compared with those given placebo (odds ratio [OR] 5.78, 95% CI 2.00–16.67; p = 0.001), and thyroid stimulating hormone was increased on average by 4.00 iU/mL (95% CI 3.90–4.10, p < 0.0001). Lithium treatment was associated with increased blood calcium (+0.09 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.02–0.17, p = 0.009), and parathyroid hormone (+7.32 pg/mL, 3.42–11.23, p < 0.0001). Patients receiving lithium gained more weight than did those receiving placebo (OR 1.89, 1.27–2.82, p = 0.002), but not those receiving olanzapine (0.32, 0.21–0.49, p < 0.0001). We recorded no significant increased risk of congenital malformations, alopecia, or skin disorders.

Interpretation

Lithium is associated with increased risk of reduced urinary concentrating ability, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and weight gain. There is little evidence for a clinically significant reduction in renal function in most patients, and the risk of end-stage renal failure is low. The risk of congenital malformations is uncertain; the balance of risks should be considered before lithium is withdrawn during pregnancy. Because of the consistent finding of a high prevalence of hyperparathyroidism, calcium concentrations should be checked before and during treatment.

### Lithium: clinical considerations in internal medicine [^114hGEwj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Bipolar Disorders affect up to 5% of the population. While the pharmacological options for the treatment of bipolar disorder have expanded over the past several years, lithium remains an inexpensive and efficacious treatment for bipolar disorder. Lithium has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for acute mania, bipolar depression, the prophylactic treatment of bipolar disorder, and as an augmentation agent in the treatment of unipolar major depression. Lithium also is the only mood stabilizer that has been demonstrated to lower the suicide rate in patients with bipolar disorder. Use in special populations, side effects and toxicity, and drug interactions are discussed. Important laboratory monitoring guidelines are included in this review. Lithium remains an important intervention for the treatment of mood disorders.

### Lithium in the kidney: friend and foe? [^115u8Ntm]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Trace amounts of lithium are essential for our physical and mental health, and administration of lithium has improved the quality of life of millions of patients with bipolar disorder for > 60 years. However, in a substantial number of patients with bipolar disorder, long-term lithium therapy comes at the cost of severe renal side effects, including nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and rarely, ESRD. Although the mechanisms underlying the lithium-induced renal pathologies are becoming clearer, several recent animal studies revealed that short-term administration of lower amounts of lithium prevents different forms of experimental AKI. In this review, we discuss the knowledge of the pathologic and therapeutic effects of lithium in the kidney. Furthermore, we discuss the underlying mechanisms of these seemingly paradoxical effects of lithium, in which fine-tuned regulation of glycogen synthase kinase type 3, a prime target for lithium, seems to be key. The new discoveries regarding the protective effect of lithium against AKI in rodents call for follow-up studies in humans and suggest that long-term therapy with low lithium concentrations could be beneficial in CKD.

### Commentary on a recent review of lithium toxicity: what are its implications for clinical practice? [^115DfWhr]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

We feel, and McKnight et al. readily admit, that their meta-analysis has limitations, which include both the nature of the available data and the non-consideration of potential confounding variables, and therefore, is likely to lead to a biased estimation of important AEs. The claim by McKnight et al that they undertook 'a clinically informative systematic toxicity profile of lithium' is only partly fulfilled because the group failed to assess and discuss many of the AEs of lithium that are particularly important to patients and may influence compliance, such as gastrointestinal problems, tremor, cognitive impairments, ataxia, or speech disorders. To give one example: in the German spontaneous reporting system of adverse drug reactions, tremor accounted for nearly 9% of the 654 reports (received until 10 October 2008, referring to lithium mono as well as combined treatment), changed gait and ataxia for more than 10%, and confusional states for 9.5% (Drug Commission of the German Medical Association, personal communication).

### The effects of lithium on cognition in humans: a systematic review [^113BYJNz]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite indications of neuroprotection, concerns persist regarding cognitive side effects and potential neurotoxicity after commencing lithium, as exemplified by conflicting evidence in the literature. Evidence suggests that cognitive impairment may be dose dependent, with higher lithium levels increasing the risk of adverse effects such as tremor and memory deficits, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Additionally, older adults and individuals with pre-existing cognitive impairments may be more vulnerable due to higher serum lithium levels per administered dose. Cognitive impairment is even listed as a side effect of long-term lithium treatment in some formularies. In preclinical studies, lithium enhances synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis and neuroprotection by increasing long-term potentiation and synaptic density while also preventing neuronal apoptosis. Lithium-treated rats exhibit better memory retention, rescued cognitive deficits via GSK-3β inhibition and showed cognitive-stabilising effects. A systematic review in 2008 explored lithium's impact on cognition across human and animal studies; while the majority of investigations favoured neuroprotection, non-randomised human trials were more likely to report cognitive impairment or neurotoxicity. The most recent meta-analysis involving healthy individuals and affective disorder patients revealed a small but significant decline in verbal learning and memory associated with lithium, with no notable differences in short-term lithium use. In BD, examining cognition reveals a paradox wherein lithium is also associated with cognitive impairment, particularly in domains such as verbal memory, processing and psychomotor speed, attention, and executive function. Irrespective of lithium treatment, meta-analyses consistently demonstrate a persistence of cognitive deficits across illness phases in BD. Notably, however, there is cognitive heterogeneity within this population, suggesting distinct cognitive profiles among BD patients.

Lithium's impact on cognition remains uncertain, marked by contrasting findings in past research constrained by methodological limitations. Unravelling the gaps in current studies unveils inconsistency in study designs, including variations in sample sizes, participant characteristics, treatment durations and outcome measure methods. The predominant focus on BD patients reveals confounding variables within this population, such as psychiatric comorbidities, illness parameters and responses to lithium (e.g. excellent vs partial responders;). Lithium's cognitive impact in healthy individuals or those with neurodegenerative disorders has also not yet been systematically reviewed. Compared with previous reviews, which are over 15 years old, we aim to include a broader participant pool and consider various lithium treatment factors, such as doses and duration, using a within-subjects approach.

### Management of adverse effects of mood stabilizers [^111oWp94]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Mood stabilizers such as lithium and anticonvulsants are still standard-of-care for the acute and long-term treatment of bipolar disorder (BD). This systematic review aimed to assess the prevalence of their adverse effects (AEs) and to provide recommendations on their clinical management. We performed a systematic research for studies reporting the prevalence of AEs with lithium, valproate, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine. Management recommendations were then developed. Mood stabilizers have different tolerability profiles and are eventually associated to cognitive, dermatological, endocrine, gastrointestinal, immunological, metabolic, nephrogenic, neurologic, sexual, and teratogenic AEs. Most of those can be transient or dose-related and can be managed by optimizing drug doses to the lowest effective dose. Some rare AEs can be serious and potentially lethal, and require abrupt discontinuation of medication. Integrated medical attention is warranted for complex somatic AEs. Functional remediation and psychoeducation may help to promote awareness on BD and better medication management.

### Lithium and nephrotoxicity: a literature review of approaches to clinical management and risk stratification [^114qx7zv]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Whilst lithium remains the most efficacious therapy for bipolar disorder there are some significant toxicities which may be associated with its long-term use. This difficulty is further compounded by the need of people suffering from bipolar disorder to take chronic therapy in order to prevent their risk of relapse. While the ability of lithium to cause CKD remains debated, the weight of evidence appears to favour its ability to do so. There remains no firm decision making algorithm to assist clinicians in the question of when to cease or if to cease lithium therapy in a patient with CKD, and the decision must be weighed against both the mental health of the individual and their risk of subsequent ESKD. Ultimately, a collaborative decision-making process between patient and healthcare provider may be the most useful discussion which may allow clinicians to guide their management.

### Lithium: old drug, new tricks? [^11395spw]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Mania

A few studies have reported notable benefits to mania, one appearing comparable to standard dose lithium (both achieving a response rate of 21%) and another reporting benefits compared to placebo, although it must be highlighted that in many cases, higher doses will be required at least for a brief period.

Together, the evidence for low dose lithium across neuropsychiatric health has recently been systematically reviewed. Being that the most consistent finding from this related to low-dose lithium benefits to cognitive functioning, it is worth mentioning here other indications for low dose lithium. Even at low doses lithium appears to have biological effects that may be neuroprotective and it is worth mentioning other putative indications for low doses including relating to dementia, suicide and various physical outcomes.

Low-dose lithium can be combined with an additional mood stabiliser at just above its minimum therapeutic level to maintain effectiveness with increased tolerability of both medications.

### Lithium: old drug, new tricks? [^1129DCU7]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

This article considers five potential approaches to address the known drawbacks of lithium treatment, which are not mutually exclusive. Some are more strongly supported by evidence than others, and we attempt to make this clear. If evidence across these can be advanced further, it can help to ensure that this cornerstone of psychiatric treatment remains accessible and effective for all who may benefit from it.

Both for the selection of the five approaches included, and the contents of each approach, the following methodological approaches were taken: Key extant works in the field were examined, as were both their reference and citation lists; these reviews were supplemented with separate database searches of PubMed using relevant terms and consensus as to the material included was reached between the authors.

Before progressing further, we emphasise that there is no one-size-fits-all approach across these topics. In some people, pre-lithium assessment and subsequent monitoring should be more frequent/in-depth e.g. in the context of high lithium levels, lifestyle changes, medical concerns or concomitant treatments. Indeed, special considerations and/or adjustments should be made for certain groups of people. This includes but is not limited to those with particular concerns around weight gain and/or polydipsia, those who might become pregnant, those with needle/blood phobia, those taking medication to be used in caution with lithium, those with adherence challenges and suicidality.

### Lithium: old drug, new tricks? [^115F8VcU]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

A proposition is that, prior to any dose reduction, and duration a period of euthymia, a patient can be trained to recognise early warning signs of an impending relapse. Some common early warning signs include an increase in severity and/or duration of any usual inter-episode symptoms, however many individuals will have specific personal warning signs (e.g. an increase in substance use, impulsive spending). If agreed by clinician and patient following early warning signs training, a gradual down titration could be implemented (e.g. over four weeks) to the reduced level. Subsequently, upon the emergence of warning signs or risk of relapse recognition, an agreed strategy can then be implemented. This agreed strategy could include increased lithium dose resulting in a blood level 0.6–0.8 or even above this, maintained until remission or a number of weeks sustained remission. It may be that for mania, this is combined with a low dose of an antimanic such as 2.5 mg olanzapine, or a sedative. Here, it is worth noting that although lithium is widely considered to work more slowly than other mood stabilisation treatments, but it is also evidenced to have rapid efficacy against both mania and depression.

To summarise, evidence could suggest that – for some individuals – lithium treatment could be maintained with clinical stability at a lower dose until a time where an increased dose is warranted (e.g. risk of episode, subsyndromal symptoms) at which point the dose is increased until needed, and then gradually reduced once more. If so, this could maintain lithium's overall mood stabilisation effect while increasing acceptability reducing adverse effects.

### Animal models to improve our understanding and treatment of suicidal behavior [^116m9wqY]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Another role for animal models may exist in helping facilitate the search for 'lithium mimetic' drugs with decreased potential for adverse events. The need to address suicidal behavior risk is often acute, while the time frame for experiencing any adverse effects from lithium treatment is often over years to decades. Adverse effects of lithium on end organs such as the kidneys, thyroid, and parathyroid glands typically take years to even begin to manifest. For instance, in some cases, such as renal insufficiency in men under the age of 60 years, individuals receiving one or more lithium prescriptions, and control individuals, have renal function that appears indistinguishable for more than 20 years, yet, the methodology used to examine such long time frames has limitations. An ideal treatment for suicidal behavior should lack any possible concern about gradually accruing end organ damage. This is an opportunity where investigations in animals would help advance the search for a compound that would convey some or all of the benefit of lithium on suicidal behavior (or at least the most appropriate endophenotypes), while not sharing lithium's adverse effects. Last, the possibility of 'rebound' mood episodes or suicidal behavior after lithium discontinuation is a possible limitation to its use as a short-term suicide prevention strategy. Animal models may allow investigation of whether rebound aggressiveness, impulsivity, or other behaviors occur after sudden withdrawal of lithium, but not of other medications. Thus, it can be appreciated that animal research with lithium has great potential to clarify its mechanisms of actions and potentially allow the development of lithium-like, yet safer, medications, establish dose response and identify safety-based approaches to mitigate side effects to be further tested clinically in humans.

### Lithium carbonate (Lithobid) [^1179eKbQ]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The occurrence and severity of adverse reactions are generally directly related to serum lithium concentrations and to individual patient sensitivity to lithium. They generally occur more frequently and with greater severity at higher concentrations.

Adverse reactions may be encountered at serum lithium concentrations below 1.5 mEq/L. Mild to moderate adverse reactions may occur at concentrations from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L, and moderate to severe reactions may be seen at concentrations from 2.0 mEq/L and above.

Fine hand tremor, polyuria, and mild thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase and may persist throughout treatment. Transient and mild nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration.

These side effects usually subside with continued treatment or with a temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. If persistent, a cessation of lithium therapy may be required. Diarrhea, vomiting, drowsiness, muscular weakness, and lack of coordination may be early signs of lithium intoxication, and can occur at lithium concentrations below 2.0 mEq/L. At higher concentrations, giddiness, ataxia, blurred vision, tinnitus, and a large output of dilute urine may be seen. Serum lithium concentrations above 3.0 mEq/L may produce a complex clinical picture involving multiple organs and organ systems. Serum lithium concentrations should not be permitted to exceed 2.0 mEq/L during the acute treatment phase.

### Lithium: old drug, new tricks? [^116r4pQi]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Dose Reduction during Periods of Stability

Dose modification clearly is not suitable for all patients and must be personalised, based on a patient's unique profile including the observed natural history of the condition, the degree of risk when unwell, their preferences, physical health status and experience of side effects. Indeed, variable dosing based on current wellness and risk of relapse is another strategy which is not empirically validated. However, we know that:

Many people with bipolar disorders are able to sustain long periods of time without affective symptoms, particularly while taking lithium.
Reduced dose and/or frequency of lithium is associated with reduced adverse renal effects.
Gradual down-titration appears to substantially reduce the time to symptom recurrence; even when ultimately discontinued, one study has reported a time to relapse of 2.5 months when lithium was rapidly discontinued, compared with 14 months when gradually discontinued.
Empowerment in managing one's own treatment is evidenced to improve acceptability and adherence.
There are other interventions, which could be employed concomitantly with lithium, that decrease relapse through enhanced recognition of episode risk e.g. early warning signs training.

Thus, for some patients, lithium dose could be maintained at a lower level when stably euthymic and increased when at risk of relapse or upon the emergence of subsyndromal symptoms. For these patients, dose modifications should be clinician-led and with agreement between both the patient and clinician as to the logistics and level of autonomy in dose management.

It is anticipated that this approach may not be suitable for people who experience high rates of relapse or ongoing inter-episode symptoms. These individuals may require maintenance of a lithium level within 0.6–0.6.8mmol/l (compared to 0.4–0.5 mmol/l). It is perhaps those (often with bipolar type I) who do not experience more than trivial symptoms when between episodes who could benefit from lithium levels between 0.4–0.4.5mmol/L when well.

### The effects of lithium on cognition in humans: a systematic review [^113d4Udf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Lithium's side effects and neurotoxicity

From a clinical perspective, lithium's cognitive effects pose challenges for both patients and clinicians. Patients often report subjective cognitive difficulties, such as memory problems, attention deficits and mental slowing, which can affect daily functioning and medication adherence. Interestingly, despite these reported cognitive challenges, our findings revealed an increase overall in memory performance following lithium treatment, which seems to correlate with mood improvements. This discrepancy between subjective experience and objective test performance is important and may be driven by mood-related bias, medication expectations, and patients' insights or illness parameters in psychiatric populations.

Our analysis revealed an important methodological consideration that may partially explain this discrepancy. When comparing studies by analytical approach, a pattern emerged: completer-only studies reported memory improvements while ITT studies showed no memory improvements at all. This suggests that selection bias in completer-only analyses could operate through multiple mechanisms. First, bidirectional attrition excludes both those experiencing cognitive side effects and early non-responders who experience neither mood stabilisation nor cognitive enhancement. Second, a 'therapeutic alliance bias' may influence outcomes, as patients maintaining positive relationships with treatment teams demonstrate better engagement and potentially enhanced motivation during cognitive testing. Third, the phenomenon of 'cognitive adaptation' – whereby initial cognitive complaints resolve with continued treatment – remains captured only in completers, while those experiencing the most severe early effects discontinue before adaptation might occur. This finding reconciles the conflict between clinical observations of cognitive complaints leading to discontinuation and research reports of cognitive enhancement, suggesting both phenomena coexist in different subpopulations.

### Lithium carbonate (lithane) [^113zCJ65]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions are seldom encountered at serum lithium levels below 1.5 mEq./l., except in the occasional patient sensitive to lithium. Mild to moderate toxic reactions may occur at levels from 1.5–2.5 mEq./l., and moderate to severe reactions may be seen at levels from 2.0–2.5 mEq./l., depending upon individual response to the drug.

Fine hand tremor, polyuria, and mild thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase, and may persist throughout treatment. Transient and mild nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration.

These side effects are an inconvenience rather than a disabling condition, and usually subside with continued treatment or a temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. If persistent, a cessation of dosage is indicated.

Diarrhea, vomiting, drowsiness, muscular weakness, and lack of coordination may be early signs of lithium intoxication, and can occur at lithium levels below 2.0 mEq./l. At higher levels, giddiness, ataxia, blurred vision, tinnitus, and a large output of dilute urine may be seen. Serum lithium levels above 3.0 mEq./l. may produce a complex clinical picture involving multiple organs and organ systems. Serum lithium levels should not be permitted to exceed 2.0 mEq./l. during the acute treatment phase.

Side Effects of Lithium

Given the lack of specificity, it is surprising that lithium's therapeutic action is so potent and the toxic side effects not more pronounced. It is, however, a close-run race — the therapeutic index of lithium is very narrow, indicating dosages with therapeutic action are close to dosages with toxic side effects. Patients undergoing lithium treatment require regular blood tests to ensure that safe and effective levels are maintained. They also undergo occasional assessment of kidney and parathyroid function: the 2 organs most susceptible to lithium toxicity. This potential for harm provides a strong motivation to deconvolute the biological action of lithium to identify targets that could be pharmacologically manipulated with more specific and less risky drugs and, in addition, to define harmful "off-target" effects.

Multiple side effects of lithium have been described since it was licensed for the treatment of acute mania and then bipolar disorder in the 1970s. These include hypothyroidism, nausea, diarrhea, and weight gain. However, it is the damage to the kidneys correlated with long-term use and excessive serum concentrations that is the most well documented and characterized. This primarily manifests as a common (~50% of patients) increase in thirst resulting from polyuria — excessive urination — and, less commonly, as a progression to nephrogenic diabetes. Both states indicate a failure to concentrate urine in the collecting duct of the nephron. The epithelial cells of the collecting duct permit the entry of lithium through amiloride-sensitive ENaC sodium channels. As an aside, a recent paper described a screen for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants in selected candidate genes that predispose those prescribed with lithium to long-term deterioration of estimated glomerular filtration rates. A CC genotype at SNP rs378448, located in ACCN1, was identified as the most significant predisposing factor. Additionally, a SNP in the first exon of this gene has been associated with lithium response in a small Sardinian cohort. ACCN1 encodes a member of the ENaC superfamily, but it is not known if this plays a role in the collecting duct pathology. Once lithium enters the duct cells, there are many and, in some instances, hotly debated routes of pathological action, including increased cyclooxygenase-2 expression generating prostaglandin E 2, inhibition of GSK3β/vasopressin action, decreased urea transporter expression, increased cell-cycle activity leading to cellular remodeling, and reduced inositol monophosphate/cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling. Ultimately, there is reduced induction and expression of the aquaporin-2 channels in the duct cell wall, preventing the passive reuptake of water from the duct and therefore leading to the production of excess, dilute urine. Much less common (~1%) in those prescribed lithium is a further chronic progression to nephrotoxicity and histologically visible damage to the kidney.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for lithium toxicity, more specifically with respect to laboratory monitoring of patients taking lithium, BAP 2016 guidelines recommend to obtain serum lithium level monitoring in patients with bipolar disorder taking lithium to check whether it is within the therapeutic range (0.6–0.8 mEq/L; mmol/L), aiming for a higher serum levels within that range. Recognize that concentrations of 0.8–1.0 mEq/L (0.8–1.0 mmol/L) carry a greater risk of renal impairment, especially in female patients.

### The lithiumeter: a measured approach [^116dy6dX]. Bipolar Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Lithium has long been recognised for its mood-stabilizing effects in the management of bipolar disorder (BD) but in practice its use has been limited because of real and 'imagined' concerns. This article addresses the need for lithium to be measured with respect to its clinical and functional effects. It introduces a visual scale, termed lithiumeter, which captures the optimal lithium plasma levels for the treatment of BD.

Methods

Key words pertaining to lithium's administration, dosing, and side effects as well as its efficacy in acute and long-term treatment of BD were used to conduct an electronic search of the literature. Relevant articles were identified by the authors and reviewed.

Results

This paper outlines the considerations necessary prior to initiating lithium therapy and provides a guide to monitoring lithium plasma levels. Current recommendations for optimal plasma lithium levels in the management of BD are then discussed with respect to indications for use in the acute phases of the illness and maintenance therapy. The risks associated with lithium treatment are also discussed.

Conclusions

The lithiumeter provides a practical guide of optimal lithium levels for the clinical management of BD.

### The effects of lithium on cognition in humans: a systematic review [^116hCsME]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings contribute to the ongoing debate regarding lithium's neuroprotective versus neurotoxic effects. While evidence suggests that higher lithium levels may increase cognitive risks, maintaining lower therapeutic concentrations (0.4–0.6 mmol/L) can, in some cases, reduce these effects without compromising efficacy. However, defining an optimal lithium dose remains clinically challenging, as cognitive impairment may also result from other lithium-induced (and dose related) side effects, such as tremor, fatigue and polyuria, which can indirectly affect cognitive function. Additionally, older adults and individuals with pre-existing cognitive impairments are more vulnerable due to higher serum lithium levels per administered dose. Despite these concerns, our study did not identify a clear dose–outcome relationship, likely due to minimal dosage variation across participants and the reliance on averaged data rather than detailed dose-cognition analyses. Indeed, generally, doses were higher in psychiatric populations than neurocognitive illness populations, but a lack of difference between these may be related to the mood effects (and mood-cognition correlations) in those with affective disorders. This underscores the need for more precise research on lithium's dose-dependent cognitive effects to optimise its therapeutic use while minimising risks.

Strengths and limitations

Definitive trends regarding lithium's cognitive impact remain inconclusive based on the studies reviewed, although several determinants potentially influencing this outcome were identified. The findings within affective disorders are still debated, particularly in delineating lithium's raw cognitive efficacy from illness-related indicators, such as mood improvement. This complexity is further compounded by the existence of responder subgroups and cognitive reserve clusters within affective illness populations, particularly BD, which adds variability to the observed outcomes. We were limited by the heterogeneity of the included populations, which may have obscured potential lithium-related cognitive effects specific to certain groups. It is also important to note that there was only a limited number of studies in most populations, including those where lithium is most commonly used, such as individuals with BD, where there is a known cognitive aspect to the disorder.

### Lithium exposure during pregnancy increases fetal growth [^116XvBpe]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Our results are important for the estimation of all effects associated with lithium use during pregnancy. These effects may not only be limited to pregnancy but might also be carried into child development later in life. The theory of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease refers to the concept that early life events could explain an individual's risk for non-communicable disease in later life. According to this theory, the intrauterine environment can change fetal programming, which bears an impact on much more than just birth weight, including changes in physiology and metabolism. This means small prenatal changes, such as the increased fetal growth we found in our study, can have impact in later life. As an example, LGA fetuses have an increased risk of developing components of the metabolic syndrome during childhood. Only one study investigated the postnatal growth of 15 children exposed to lithium in utero and reported outcomes within the normal range. Therefore, there is an urgent need for studies with a larger sample size. The rate of fetal death, also before 20 weeks of gestational age, clearly warrants further investigation.

Women of a fertile age who use lithium should be preconceptionally informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with lithium use during pregnancy. Together with their treating physician, women should weigh up the benefits of lithium treatment during pregnancy against the risks of adverse fetal and neonatal (long-term) outcomes and compare these risks with those associated with the use of alternative medication.

### Commentary on a recent review of lithium toxicity: what are its implications for clinical practice? [^115AqyF2]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Lithium and renal function

For the meta-analysis, nearly 6000 publications on various aspects of potential lithium toxicity were screened, and 385 studies published in English, French and German were included in their analysis. The report focuses on the harmful effects of lithium on the kidney, the thyroid and parathyroid, body weight, skin and congenital malformations. The authors searched primarily for controlled studies (22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, and case-control studies) but, in their absence, also considered prospective observations and case reports. Expanding the review beyond time-limited RCTs is important because lithium treatment is usually applied long term, and the initial and later side-effects differ. Such an inclusive approach is in accordance with the policy of most regulatory agencies, and is important for early identification of suspected AEs. Unfortunately, the authors did not consider data from national or international spontaneous reporting systems for AEs.

McKnight et al. discuss in detail the effects of long-term lithium on renal function particularly. They found that the reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was relatively small: 0 to 5 ml/min over each year of observation, while urinary concentration ability was on average reduced by 15%. As for long-term consequences, the authors refer to a Swedish registry showing that renal failure occurred in 18 of 3369 patients (0.5%), that is, double the incidence in the general Swedish population. McKnight et al. conclude that 'there is little evidence for a clinically significant reduction in renal function in most patients, and the risk of end-stage renal failure is low'.
However, a meta-analysis is not equipped to assess this issue fully. Reduced GFR, or rather end-stage renal failure, only starts appearing in some patients after continuous treatment for more than 15 to 20 years, whereas meta-analyses will unavoidably include numerous patients treated for shorter periods. In this respect, more informative are the recent studies on prolonged lithium treatment that have shown that the risk of renal end-stage failure might not be that rare, even in subjects properly managed on lithium for more than 15 years. Unfortunately, regular kidney function monitoring is often lacking in practice: a large French study shockingly showed that serum creatinine serum levels had not been performed in 40% of patients on lithium between 1997 and 2004.

### Lithium: old drug, new tricks? [^115vxtsG]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Closing Points

The authors highlight that the evidence synthesised in this piece was not conducted as a systematic review. We also emphasise that the article primarily focuses on bipolar disorders as lithium's primary indication; although some material applies across populations (e.g. unipolar depressive or neurodegenerative conditions), the content here is not fully generalisable.

As well as the above suggested strategies, we must bear in mind that there are many more approaches to be considered. The first, is to ensure clinical practice meets clinical demands: The importance of proper medical screening (calcium, thyroid, renal, cardiac), proper monitoring, management of polypharmacy and contraindications should not be underestimated. Beyond this, we should consider the benefits of specifics such as: increased monitoring in certain cases or at certain times; alternative formulations; once (versus twice) daily dosing and patient education. Precision psychiatry will likely assist with predicting candidates for excellent or poor lithium response a priori and we know already of factors associated with response to lithium (e.g. family history of lithium response).

### Use of lithium in the treatment of bipolar disorder in late-life [^112Rkvzg]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Lithium is the oldest and still one of the most frequently prescribed mood stabilizers in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Nonetheless, the evidence for lithium efficacy in older patients with bipolar disorder is almost entirely extrapolated from younger adult patients. Here we review the literature on lithium in older patients with bipolar disorder, concentrating on the past 3 years. A definitive study demonstrating the efficacy and safety of lithium in older patients with bipolar disorder is still missing. However, several lines of indirect evidence suggest that it is beneficial and advantageous over other mood stabilizers in the acute and maintenance treatment of late-life bipolar disorder. In addition, lithium may have unique properties as a regenerative therapeutic with specific benefits in reducing the cognitive impairment and suicide rates associated with bipolar disorder across the adult lifespan. Aging-associated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes as well as increased rates of medical comorbidities and polypharmacy predispose older patients to a higher risk of lithium toxicity. Careful monitoring and adjustment of lithium dosage is especially important in older adults to minimize the risk of toxicity.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Bipolar Disorder — pregnancy and lithium continuation: For individuals with bipolar disorder who are or might become pregnant and are stabilized on lithium, we suggest continued treatment with lithium at the lowest effective dose in a framework that includes psychoeducation and shared decision making. It is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. The guideline notes that the benefits of stable lithium therapy slightly outweighed the potential harms from lithium discontinuation (e.g., recurrence of manic symptoms) and risks to the fetus from continuing lithium (e.g., serious, but rare, teratogenic effects).

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary:

Lithium may cause harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Early voluntary reports to international birth registries suggested an increase in cardiovascular malformations, especially for Ebstein's anomaly, with first trimester use of lithium. Subsequent case-control and cohort studies indicate that the increased risk for cardiac malformations is likely to be small; however, the data are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk. There are concerns for maternal and/or neonatal lithium toxicity during late pregnancy and the postpartum period [see Clinical Considerations]. Published animal developmental and toxicity studies in mice and rats report an increased incidence of fetal mortality, decreased fetal weight, increased fetal skeletal abnormalities, and cleft palate (mouse fetuses only) with oral doses of lithium that produced serum concentrations similar to the human therapeutic range. Other published animal studies report adverse effects on embryonic implantation in rats after lithium administration. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations:

Dose Adjustments During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period: If the decision is made to continue lithium treatment during pregnancy, serum lithium concentrations should be monitored and the dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Two to three days prior to delivery, lithium dosage should be decreased or discontinued to reduce the risk of maternal and/or neonatal toxicity. Lithium may be restarted in the post-partum period at preconception doses in medically stable patients as long as serum lithium levels are closely monitored [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions: Lithium toxicity may occur in neonates who were exposed to lithium in late pregnancy. A floppy baby syndrome including neurological, cardiac, and hepatic abnormalities that are similar to those seen with lithium toxicity in adults have been observed. Symptoms include hypotonia, respiratory distress syndrome, cyanosis, lethargy, feeding difficulties, depressed neonatal reflexes, neonatal depression, apnea, and bradycardia. Monitor neonates and provide supportive care until lithium is excreted and toxic signs disappear, which may take up to 14 days.

Consider fetal echocardiography between 16 and 20 weeks gestation in a woman with first trimester lithium exposure because of the potential increased risk of cardiac malformations.

### Cutaneous adverse effects of lithium: epidemiology and management [^115SFv6e]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Acneiform eruption, psoriasis, folliculitis, and maculopapular eruption have been described as adverse reactions to lithium therapy. In controlled studies, patients treated with lithium developed more cutaneous reactions, particularly acne and psoriasis, than patients receiving other psychotropics, with a prevalence in lithium-treated patients as high as 45%. Male patients taking lithium are more susceptible to developing cutaneous reactions than their female counterparts. Lithium tends to worsen or precipitate cutaneous conditions that are characterized by the pathological findings of neutrophilic infiltration. As lithium-related cutaneous adverse effects can be distressing to patients and may affect medication compliance, attention should be paid to skin problems in patients receiving lithium therapy. Management without cessation of lithium therapy is usually feasible except in some patients with psoriasis that is resistant to treatment. Paradoxically, therapeutic effects of topically applied lithium have been noted in seborrheic dermatitis and recurrent herpes infections.

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD / IGSLI task force on treatment with lithium [^112u4xPh]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Lithium has been licensed in Europe and North America for the long‐term maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder (BD) for more than 45 years and is justifiably considered one of the first line options in major global treatment guidelines, such as the WFSBP guideline, 1 the NICE guideline, 2 the RANZCP guideline, 3 the Dutch guideline, 4 the BAP guideline, 5 the CINP guideline 6 and the CANMAT/ISBD guideline. 7 However, lithium has a very low therapeutic index, that is, a low ratio between the dose (or serum level) that is associated with toxicity (mainly CNS and renal toxicity) and the dose associated with therapeutic effect. The therapeutic index for lithium is approximately 2. 8

For maintenance treatment of BD several reviews recommend differing minimum effective lithium serum levels ranging from 0.40 mmol/L 9, 10, 11 and 0.50 mmol/L, 12 or 0.60 mmol/L 13 to as high as 0.80 mmol/L. 14, 15 In addition, some major clinical practice guidelines recommend optimal ranges, but these also lack consistency. For instance, the NICE guideline, 2 the RANZCP guideline 3, 16 and the BAP guideline 5 recommend 0.60‐0.80 mmol, the CANMAT/ISBD guideline 7 0.60‐1.00 mmol/L, and the CINP guideline 6 0.60‐1.20 mmol/L, whereas other guidelines, for example, the WFSBP guideline, 1 do not provide specific recommendations. Finally, some reviews more specifically recommend targeting serum levels for individual patients " on the basis of efficacy and tolerability" without further specification 15 or " primarily at 0.60‐0.75/0.80 guided by clinical response and tolerability" 16 within a broad range of 0.40‐1.20 mmol/L, 10 which is also recommended in the Dutch guideline. 4 The major problem underlying these different recommendations is that large studies, well designed to assess the optimal serum level in maintenance treatment, specifically the serum level that best balances efficacy and tolerability for most patients, are lacking.

Thyroid

Common, potentially severe, and eminently treatable adverse effects relate to the thyroid. Hypothyroidism is most common, with levothyroxine (T4) as the mainstay treatment. Parathyroidism is also a risk following increases in calcium with lithium treatment and the most common intervention options are calcimimetics e.g. cinacalcet (see also below). Lithium does not carry known risks for hyperthyroidism or other associated disorders. Hypothyroidism and/or elevated thyroid stimulating hormone in lithium treated patients may be associated with BD severity or rapid cycling BD, and in these patients treatment with thyroxine may also improve affective outcomes. It may be worth mentioning that hypothyroidism in lithium-treated patients may not reflect genuine thyroid dysfunction, and instead be related to iodine uptake. As such, it can be useful to examine other symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism e.g. cold intolerance or slow pulse. Finally, when considering intervening with thyroid test abnormalities, it is recommended to first conduct repeated tests, since single measures of thyroid function can be unrepresentative of an ongoing issue where intervention is indicated. Increased parathyroid hormone is associated with a greater illness burden in people with bipolar disorder, but is not always associated with increased calcium. Since both can exacerbate, potentially independently, health conditions (renal, other medical, and psychiatric), it is important to examine both and consider other potential causes. This may require endocrinology referrals.

Box 1 summarises one real-world clinical case demonstrating the importance of thorough thyroid examination.

The key summary messages for this section are that firstly, adverse effects are not necessarily a sufficing reason to avoid lithium, and that secondly it is important to address adverse effects particularly as they can have concerning consequences for physical and/or mental health.

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: a Swedish population-based cohort study [^1117iRvE]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lithium is well-established as an effective first-line treatment for bipolar disorder, a major psychiatric condition affecting 2% of the global population. With an average age of disease onset of 25 years, many women of reproductive age are offered lithium. Deciding whether to continue lithium during pregnancy requires balancing the risk of exposure to the fetus with the benefits of treatment for the mother. The maternal advantages of continuing lithium during pregnancy are clear. Women who stop treatment during pregnancy are almost threefold more likely to experience recurrence or relapse compared to those continuing prophylactic medications. Lithium is also effective in preventing suicide. Thus, discontinuation may put women at risk of self-harm and deterioration of psychosocial and medical well-being.

In contrast, associations between lithium exposure in utero and the risk of adverse pregnancy or neonatal outcomes are unclear. Associations between lithium use and congenital malformations have been reported, including cardiac malformations, which suggest an increased likelihood of malformation. Studies exploring potential associations between lithium and adverse pregnancy outcomes have been limited to small observational studies and case reports. Meta-analyses of these have reported an increased likelihood of spontaneous abortion and neonatal readmission to hospital.

Better information on the possible impact of lithium administration and adverse pregnancy outcomes could aid clinical decision-making and surveillance in the management of psychiatric illness during and after pregnancy. To address this gap in knowledge, we performed a population-based study examining whether maternal lithium use was associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Tremor

Tremor is a common side effect that can occur even in the presence of low-level lithium. It is suggested that tremor is most common in the early stages of lithium treatment and becomes less prevalent in those treated for longer. Tremor varies widely in severity (as well as type). To emphasise its clinical importance, tremor can be an indicator for lithium toxicity, though it can also be triggered by concomitant agents or comorbidities. Assessment, including for parkinsonism, is important. In addition to addressing other factors (e.g. thyroid, other medication use, anxiety disorders, substance use, essential tremor etc.), beta-blockers, primidone or other anticonvulsants can be beneficial if required. In fact, lamotrigine, valproate, carbamazepine and quetiapine are examples of these which clearly have mood stabilising effects themselves. A general recommendation (see more below) is to adjust doses so that mood stabilising medications are at a minimal therapeutic level can be helpful and this may be especially important for antipsychotics where a therapeutic level in bipolar disorders is lower than for pure psychotic illness.

Renal

Best known and most severe of lithium's adverse effects relates to renal health. Renal function appears negatively associated with both dose and duration of lithium treatment and is less readily manageable than those above. In instances of creatinine increase or more relevantly, decreasing estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), guidelines are available though management options are limited. Guidelines include advice in terms of seeking nephrology input and in the absence of other strategies, the subject of down-titrating or discontinuing lithium has been widely discussed. Polyuria is common and may be mild or more severe in cases of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). It has long been advised to treat polyuria/NDI with amiloride, however the evidence remains extremely scant despite clearly positive findings and understood mechanisms of action.

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: a Swedish population-based cohort study [^114yKn4J]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of lithium during pregnancy is associated with a 2–3-fold increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth, birth of a large for gestational age infant and cardiac malformations. It is important to note that the absolute risk of malformations remained low. Lithium use may also be associated with neonatal hypoglycaemia. Lithium was not associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia or birthing a small for gestational age infant. These findings should be weighed against the need to effectively manage maternal psychiatric illness during pregnancy and should be used to guide shared treatment decision making and appropriate surveillance for those on treatment during pregnancy.

### Lithium and nephrotoxicity: a literature review of approaches to clinical management and risk stratification [^1112E86H]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Despite lithium being the most efficacious treatment for bipolar disorder, its use has been decreasing at least in part due to concerns about its potential to cause significant nephrotoxicity. Whilst the ability of lithium to cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is well established, its ability to cause chronic kidney disease is a much more vexing issue, with various studies suggesting both positive and negative causality. Despite these differences, the weight of evidence suggests that lithium has the potential to cause end stage kidney disease, albeit over a prolonged period.

Methods

A search strategy for this review was developed to identify appropriate studies, sourced from the electronic databases EMBASE, PubMed (NLM) and MEDLINE. Search terms included lithium with the AND operator to combine with nephrotoxicity or nephropathy or chronic kidney disease or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus or renal and pathophysiology.

Results

The risks for the development of lithium induced nephropathy are less well defined but appear to include the length of duration of therapy as well as increasing age, as well as episodes of over dosage/elevated lithium levels. Whilst guidelines exist for the routine monitoring of lithium levels and renal function, it remains unclear when nephrological evaluation should occur, as well as when cessation of lithium therapy is appropriate balancing the significant attendant mental health risks as well as the potential for progression to occur despite cessation of therapy against the risks and morbidity of bipolar disorder itself.

Conclusion

This paper will elucidate on the current evidence pertaining to the topic of the clinical management of lithium induced nephrotoxicity and provide a guide for clinicians who are faced with the long-term management of these patients.

### Evaluation of clarity of presentation and applicability of monitoring instructions for patients using lithium in clinical practice guidelines for treatment of bipolar disorder [^112UGe5U]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Lithium is used in the treatment and prevention of mood episodes in patients with bipolar disorder (BD), as well as in an augmenting strategy in patients with treatment‐resistant depression. 1, 2 Adequate monitoring of lithium treatment is essential in order to assess, at the level of the individual patient, the balance between efficacy and side effects, and to adjust the treatment if necessary. 3 Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index with high inter‐ and intra‐individual variability of the dose‐concentration relationship. High lithium levels increase the risk of side effects and intoxication, rendering patient monitoring even more important than for most other drugs. 4 Known long‐term side effects of lithium treatment include the development of renal impairment and hypothyroidism. 5 For the early identification of patients with an increased risk of these side effects, regular measurement of biomarkers is considered standard of care.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide guidance to health care professionals on patient monitoring. 6, 7 CPGs thus aim to bridge the gap between clinical research and clinical practice and to aid health care professionals in evidence‐based decision making. 7 A good‐quality guideline has been defined as providing: "the confidence that the potential biases inherent in guideline development have been addressed adequately and that the recommendations are both internally and externally valid (i.e. supported by evidence and applicable to target populations), and are feasible for practice". 8 In addition to the quality of the monitoring instructions in CPGs, it is important that monitoring instructions are easily identifiable and applicable for health care professionals. In a recent study from our research group, 74% of lithium prescribers stated that their monitoring policy was based on a guideline or institutional protocol. 9

To be applicable for health care professionals, it is important that guidelines address which and how clinical or biomarker parameters need to be monitored. Information is needed on when to start monitoring, when to stop monitoring, how frequently to monitor, what critical values are and how to respond to these values. 10, 11 CPGs should preferably include monitoring parameters that are specific, sensitive, accessible, affordable and applicable, and that provide early results to enable intervention. 12 Previous studies by our group revealed that instructions for monitoring in Summary of Product Characteristics of (psychotropic) drugs in general were often found to be too ambiguous to be applicable in clinical practice. 13, 14 The applicability of monitoring instructions for patients using lithium in CPGs for treatment of BD is still unknown.

The objective of this study was to assess the clarity of presentation and applicability of monitoring instructions for patients using lithium in CPGs for treatment of BD.

### Adverse effects in the pharmacologic management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy [^114fAGRH]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy often involves medications with potential adverse effects, including risks to the mother and fetus. Although some specifics are known, many medications continue to have incompletely characterized reproductive safety profiles. Women with bipolar disorder who are planning pregnancy face challenging decisions about their treatment; careful risk-benefit discussions are necessary. With the goal of further informing these discussions, this article reviews the data currently available regarding medication safety in the management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy, with specific attention to lithium, valproic acid, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and antipsychotic medications.

### Genomics of lithium action and response [^113P5kzj]. Neurotherapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Lithium is the most successful mood stabilizer treatment for bipolar disorder. However, unlike conventional drugs that are designed to interact with a specific molecular target, the actions of lithium are distributed across many biological processes and pathways. Treatment response is subject to genetic variation between individuals and similar genetic variation may dictate susceptibility to side effects. Transcriptomic, genomic, and cell-model research strategies have all been deployed in the search for the genetic factors and biological systems that mediate the interaction between genetics and the therapeutic actions of lithium. In this review, recent findings from genome-wide studies and patient cell lines will be summarized and discussed from a standpoint that genuine progress is being made to define clinically useful mechanisms of this treatment, to place it in the context of bipolar disorder pathology, and to move towards a time when the prescription of lithium is targeted to those individuals who will derive the greatest benefit.

Advise patients that lithium is a mood stabilizer, and should only be taken as directed. Emphasize the importance of compliance with the prescribed treatment and to not adjust the dose of lithium without first consulting their healthcare provider. Inform patients that they will need to have regular blood draws to determine if their dose of lithium is appropriate.

Instruct patients not to double the dose if a dose is missed, due to the complexity of individualized dosing and potential for lithium toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Lithium Toxicity:

Inform patients on adverse reactions related to lithium toxicity that require medical attention. Advise patients to discontinue lithium treatment and contact their healthcare provider if clinical signs of lithium toxicity such as diarrhea, vomiting, tremor, lack of muscle coordination, drowsiness, abnormal heart rhythm or muscular weakness occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Lithium-Induced Polyuria:

Counsel patients on the adverse reactions related to lithium-induced polyuria, when to seek medical attention, and the importance of maintaining normal diet with salt and staying hydrated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Efficacy and tolerability of combination treatments for major depression: antidepressants plus second-generation antipsychotics vs. esketamine vs. lithium [^112Kshuh]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Lithium is effective for treating affective disorders with evidence of reduction of suicidal risk and mortality, but is underutilized especially in MDD. Concerns that limit the use of lithium include a narrow therapeutic index, with risks of intoxication at circulating concentrations only 2–3 times above therapeutic levels, as well as of adverse long-term effects on thyroid and renal function. In addition, lithium salts have lacked commercial promotion as unpatentable minerals in competition with other treatments.

NNT is a convenient and clinically readily interpretable measure of therapeutic effect-size and may support comparisons of different treatments given under comparable conditions, but it has important limitations. In the present analyses, lithium yielded an NNT of 5 (4–10), indicating that approximately one out of five patients treated would respond to adding lithium to an antidepressant in comparison with adding placebo. Generally, small NNTs are preferable, although larger values (> 10) may be acceptable if the outcome is the prevention of mortality or severe morbidity. Also, meaningful interpretation of NNT requires consideration of response rate: a relatively low response rate with an active treatment may be significantly superior to that with placebo, but not be clinically valuable. NNH and the risk/benefit ratio (NNH/NNT) are also subject to limitations, notably including the clinical significance of the adverse effect being considered.

Limitations

Most trials of adding lithium to antidepressants for major depressive episodes involved older, mainly tricyclic, antidepressants, and dosing of all reported adjunctive treatments were not optimized. We also found poor systematization of the adverse effect profile in some trials, especially involving lithium. Use of NNT and NNH to compare treatments is limited by the comparability of different trials and further limited by the rarity of desirable, head-to-head comparisons of different active treatments under identical conditions.

### The effects of lithium on cognition in humans: a systematic review [^113rJzUo]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Lithium, a mainstay treatment for bipolar disorders, has shown promise in treating cognitive impairments. However, concerns about cognition-related side effects persist.

Aims:

We aimed to synthesise the evidence on how lithium affects cognition by comparing cognitive performance before and after starting lithium treatment.

Methods:

A systematic search was conducted to identify studies examining lithium's effects on cognition. The review considered studies with adult human participants that reported quantitative cognitive outcomes using within-subject comparisons between lithium-absent and lithium-present conditions.

Results:

Thirty-two articles describing 30 studies were included (727 participants, approximately 54% female, mean age ± 50 years old). The studies exhibited significant heterogeneity within cognitive domains, including global cognition (15 studies), memory (19 studies), processing and psychomotor speed (8 studies), attention (9 studies), verbal fluency (4 studies) and executive function (6 studies). The included studies comprised 16 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 14 non-RCTs, with study populations ranging from individuals with affective disorders (13 studies) to neurocognitive disorders (11 studies) and healthy individuals (6 studies). Some studies reported cognitive enhancements, particularly in individuals with affective disorders, while others documented declines or mixed results.

Conclusions:

Definitive conclusions regarding lithium's isolated cognitive effects remain elusive, particularly considering the influence of factors such as affective state, population and methodological heterogeneity among studies. Further research is needed to conclusively determine the raw cognitive impacts of lithium therapy, requiring larger RCTs across distinct populations. Prioritising the resolution of main symptoms should remain the primary therapeutic goal of lithium treatment.

### Bipolar depression: a review of treatment options [^112mMGWm]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Managing adverse effects

A number of strategies have been developed to help manage adverse effects associated with the treatment options available. Lifestyle interventions, such as exercise and dietary changes, may be important to mitigate weight gain and may also positively impact residual mood symptoms. Some have suggested that, in some cases, weight gain can be addressed pharmacologically with topiramate, metformin or betahistine. In patients experiencing akathisia in the setting of antipsychotic medication use, several strategies have been proposed, including cautious dose reduction, cross-tapering or the addition of propranolol or benztropine. Other EPS, such as parkinsonism, should similarly be addressed by first considering dose reduction or switching to a different pharmacological agent before considering the addition of other agents like benztropine. The effects of sedation, a common side effect across several drug classes, can often be at least partially managed by consolidating medications at night-time. Stimulants, which are sometimes used to counter cognitive side effects and cognitive symptoms of depression, are controversial in the context of BD-D as they may increase the risk of switch to hypomanic, manic or mixed states.

Managing the adverse effects of lithium has been well studied. In fact, many issues with intolerability can be avoided by slow titration and providing reassurance that many patients experience reduction in side effects over time. Renal and thyroid effects should be monitored regularly. If hypothyroidism develops, treatment with levothyroxine is indicated. For patients who develop polyuria, maintaining adequate hydration is essential. Additionally, there is some evidence that diuretics may be helpful, although fluid balance, renal function and electrolyte levels should be monitored closely. For lithium-associated nausea, lithium should be taken with food or after meals, and a sustained release formulation may be helpful.

VA/DoD suicide risk guideline — lithium in mood disorders: Lithium might be particularly useful for the management of bipolar disorder, but providers should consider the use of lithium on an individualized basis using shared decision making with careful consideration of potential alternative treatment options. The Work Group notes this is a Reviewed, New-replaced recommendation and that the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. The benefits of lithium for decreasing the risk of suicide or suicide attempts were balanced with the potential harm of adverse events. Accordingly, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against lithium to reduce the risk of suicide or suicide attempts for patients with mood disorders.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^115wscg4]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) maintenance — evidence and adverse effects for lithium, quetiapine, and olanzapine: Evidence suggests that treatment with lithium, quetiapine, or olanzapine can help prevent the recurrence of depressive episodes in individuals with BD. Evidence regarding which of the three medications is the most efficacious is mixed, though there is some evidence that quetiapine and olanzapine performed better than other SGAs in the prevention of depression. Of note, the studies referenced above included individuals with BD 1 and BD 2 and did not distinguish between the groups when presenting the results. These medications have side effect profiles that include sedation, risk of prolonged QTc intervals, and metabolic syndrome; however, olanzapine carries a much higher metabolic risk than quetiapine or lithium, and the metabolic effects of olanzapine are a strong counterbalance to its efficacy as monotherapy and are ultimately the reason why the Work Group decided to suggest this drug as a less favorable alternative than lithium and quetiapine.

4.8 Practical considerations regarding lithium level monitoring

Due to lithium's low therapeutic index, its serum levels should always be monitored during treatment, at least when treatment is initiated, after each dose increase and every 3‐6 months thereafter. The blood samples for measuring the lithium level must be drawn at steady state occurring after 5‐6 times the half‐life of lithium, which is approximately 24 hours in the nonelderly with normal renal function. Thus, the lithium level should be measured after 5‐6 days at constant daily dosing. In the elderly or in patients with impaired renal function, the time to steady state increases, implying that the lithium level should also be measured after 10‐12 days. In individual patients treated with a given schedule with a given lithium formulation, at steady state, the ratio of daily lithium dose, and the 12 hours lithium level is constant. An additional requirement for safe use of lithium is to monitor renal function at baseline and also every 3‐6 months.

Finally, it should be taken into account that subjects with a relatively high renal function, in particular young men, may have an unexpectedly low 12‐hours lithium level despite a relatively high daily lithium dose due to relative large variations in lithium levels over the day. If the dose is increased to obtain a lithium level within the recommended range, such patients may become intoxicated. 46

### Renal function during long-term lithium treatment: a cross-sectional and longitudinal study [^114peuD7]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

These results confirm that reduction in renal function, even if rarely progressing to end-stage renal failure, should be reconsidered in the debate on the lithium toxicity profile. Duration of lithium treatment is to be added to advancing age as a risk factor. However, the risk of renal dysfunction must be weighed against the protective effects of lithium on the recurrence of mood disorders, quality of life, and suicide. As continuation or discontinuation of lithium does not appear to significantly influence the progression to ESRD once kidneys are already damaged, it would be desirable that future studies identify early markers of lithium nephrotoxicity.

### Is there consensus across international evidence-based guidelines for the psychotropic drug management of bipolar disorder during the perinatal period? [^1147ndjr]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinicians treating a patient with bipolar disorder who is pregnant or breastfeeding may seek advice from bipolar management guidelines that provide recommendations for perinatal treatment. We examine the consistency of such recommendations across several evidence-based guidelines.

Methods

A literature search in the National Guideline Clearinghouse, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PsycInfo and PubMed was undertaken using the search terms "bipolar disorder" and "guidelines", which generated 11 sets of evidence-based guidelines published by professional organizations during the 2005–2015 period. Information relevant to management during the perinatal period was reviewed by two independent reviewers, with key themes qualitatively analysed.

Results

There was a moderate level of agreement across guidelines regarding the potential teratogenic effects of lithium, sodium valproate and carbamazepine, with most highlighting caution in using these medications during the perinatal period. There was less agreement regarding the safety risks associated with lamotrigine, antipsychotics, and antidepressants, and little agreement regarding the risks and recommendations of medications during breastfeeding.

Limitations

Some differences in recommendations are likely due to varying publication dates, with recent guidelines having more up-to-date evidence available to use when formulating recommendations. Further, due to ethical issues surrounding pregnancy and infant research, the evidence used to formulate perinatal recommendations is largely based on retrospective reports and/or case studies. It is therefore unrealistic to expect such recommendations to be entirely consistent and based on rigorous evidence.

Conclusions

While there was some consistency across guidelines on key recommendations, there were also substantial inconsistencies, with the latter risking compromising clinical management.

### Atorvastatin lowers serum calcium levels in lithium-users: results from a randomized controlled trial [^112YoTxN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

An additional metabolic side effect of lithium is hypothyroidism. Lithium users have a two-fold increased risk of hypothyroidism in comparison to the general population, and 33% of chronic lithium users over 65 years of age developed hypothyroidism, usually within 1–7 years of initiation.

New treatments for lithium-associated adverse effects are needed. Observational and animal data suggest that statins may be helpful to improve lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). NDI is closely linked to other adverse effects associated with lithium use, and can have shared mechanisms (e.g. GSK3Beta inhibition with lithium use has been linked to effects on kidney function, diabetes, cancer). Thus, statins, given their pleiotropic effects, could be explored as a potential candidate for reducing serum calcium and other endocrine/metabolic adverse effects.

This secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will assess whether atorvastatin use in lithium users can have an effect on serum calcium and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).

### Lithium in maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder [^111HW5t3]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Lithium has been used for the medical treatment of bipolar disorder for over 50 years. The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence base supporting the use of lithium in the maintenance phase of treatment of bipolar disorder and the limitations which reduce the clinical effectiveness of this medication. A selective review of the relevant literature was carried out. It is concluded that lithium is efficacious in the maintenance phase treatment of bipolar disorder, with the available evidence supporting a beneficial effect which prevents recurrence of mania; it is less clear if lithium prevents depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. A number of lines of evidence support the notion that lithium reduces suicidal acts and completed suicide. Lithium has a significant side effect burden and a narrow therapeutic index. It is also associated with an increased liability for new episodes, both manic and depressive, consequent upon stoppage of treatment. These factors limit the clinical effectiveness of lithium.

### Cancer risk and estimated lithium exposure in drinking groundwater in the US [^114dsSLy]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The associations between lithium exposure and reduced cancer risk observed in this study do not necessarily promote intake of lithium-rich water as a public health strategy. Clinical evidence has illustrated an adverse association between lithium medication and kidney and thyroid functions. However, the lithium-related toxic effects appeared to only be related to higher lithium doses. For example, a clinical trial reported no significant changes in kidney function among patients randomized to low-dose lithium treatment compared with the placebo group. The serum lithium levels were maintained at 0.25 to 0.50 mEq/L (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 1) among the treatment group in that study, which would typically take about 40 to 150 mg/d of elemental lithium to achieve. A more recent, prospective cohort study did not find any increased risk for kidney disease in lithium users except for those with high serum levels (> 1.0 mEq/L). Considering the average daily water consumption is about 1.3 L for adults, even those living in areas with the highest lithium concentration in the drinking water would only ingest about 0.2 mg of lithium each day from water intake. This daily dose is highly unlikely to cause kidney disorders based on current evidence given the substantially lower environmental lithium exposure level.

Patient preferences and perceived burdens with lithium in bipolar disorder indicate that patient preferences vary largely, and lithium has a reputation that can be favorable or unfavorable because of stigmatizing side effects, including tremor, weight gain (which can be rapid from water retention), hair loss, and a requirement for periodic blood tests; it might also have an unfavorable reputation because of potential for more serious harms, including kidney and thyroid dysfunction, gastrointestinal symptoms, and toxicity associated with high blood levels.

1 INTRODUCTION

Lithium was identified as a treatment for bipolar disorder in 1949 and remains a first line of treatment for both mania and depression, with particular benefit in reducing suicidality. While highly effective, the use of lithium is limited by its narrow therapeutic range (0.4–1.2 mmol/L), and common occurrence of adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, tremors, drowsiness, disorientation, and renal and thyroid dysfunction. These side effects are commonly dose related but can occur even at therapeutic doses. At higher serum concentrations, the potential for side effects and risk of toxicity increases further. The presence of side effects may contribute to poor outcomes and medication non‐adherence. For these reasons, lithium requires frequent monitoring of blood serum levels. International guidelines recommend that patients on lithium medication undergo lithium level monitoring at least every 3–6 months, and even more frequently after dosage change, in case of relapse, or upon symptoms of intoxication.

### Lithium for maintenance treatment of mood disorders [^115zG6dd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Mood disorders are common, disabling and tend to be recurrent. They carry a high risk of suicide. Maintenance treatment, aimed at the prevention of relapse, is therefore of vital importance. Lithium has been used for some years as the mainstay of maintenance treatment in bipolar affective disorder, and to a lesser extent in unipolar disorder. However, the efficacy and effectiveness of prophylactic lithium therapy has been disputed. Low suicide rates in lithium-treated patients have led to claims that lithium has a specific anti-suicidal effect. If so, this is of considerable importance as treatments for mental disorders in general have not been shown convincingly to be effective in suicide prevention.

Objectives

1. To investigate the efficacy of lithium treatment in the prevention of relapse in recurrent mood disorders. 2. To examine the effect of lithium treatment on consumers' general health and social functioning, its acceptability to consumers, and the side-effects of treatment. 3. To investigate the hypothesis that lithium has a specific effect in reducing the incidence of suicide and deliberate self-harm in persons with mood disorders.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) and The Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register (CCTR) were searched. Reference lists of relevant papers and major text books of mood disorder were examined. Authors, other experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies were contacted for knowledge of suitable trials, published or unpublished. Specialist journals concerning lithium were hand searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing lithium with placebo, where the stated intent of treatment was maintenance or prophylaxis. Participants were males and females of all ages with diagnoses of mood disorder. Discontinuation studies (in which all participants had been stable on lithium for some time before being randomised to either continued lithium treatment or placebo substitution) were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted from the original reports independently by two reviewers. The main outcomes studied were related to the objectives stated above. Data were analysed for all diagnoses of mood disorder and for bipolar and unipolar disorder separately. Data were analysed using Review Manager version 4.0.

Main Results

Nine studies were included in the review, reporting on 825 participants randomly allocated to lithium or placebo. Lithium was found to be more effective than placebo in preventing relapse in mood disorder overall, and in bipolar disorder. The most consistent effect was found in bipolar disorder (random effects OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.93). In unipolar disorder, the direction of effect was in favour of lithium, but the result (when heterogeneity between studies was allowed for) did not reach statistical significance. Considerable heterogeneity was found between studies in all groups of patients. The direction of effect was the same in all studies; no study found a negative effect for lithium. Heterogeneity may have been due to differences in selection of participants, and to differing exposures to lithium in the pre-study phase resulting in variable influence of a discontinuation effect. There was little reported data on overall health and social functioning of participants under the different treatment conditions, or on the participants' own views of their treatment. Descriptive analysis showed that assessments of general health and social functioning generally favoured lithium. Small absolute numbers of deaths and suicides, and the absence of data on non-fatal suicidal behaviours, made it impossible to draw meaningful conclusions about the place of lithium therapy in suicide prevention.

Reviewer's Conclusions

This systematic review indicates that lithium is an efficacious maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder. In unipolar disorder the evidence of efficacy is less robust. This review does not cover the relative efficacy of lithium compared with other maintenance treatments, which is at present unclear. There is no definitive evidence from this review as to whether or not lithium has an anti-suicidal effect. Systematic reviews and large scale randomised studies comparing lithium with other maintenance treatments (e.g. anti-convulsants, antidepressants) are necessary. Outcomes relating to death and suicidal behaviour should be included in all future maintenance studies of mood disorder.

This is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low; the benefits of these drugs outweighed the potential harms (e.g., weight gain, sedation, metabolic side effects), and patient values and preferences varied because of the potential for adverse effects. Olanzapine is included in this recommendation rather than in Recommendation 5 because of concerns about the burden of side effects and the risk for adverse reactions, and the metabolic effects of olanzapine are ultimately the reason why the Work Group decided to suggest this drug alongside (and not higher than) risperidone and paliperidone.

### Lithium nephrotoxicity revisited [^1145DeUm]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

Lithium is widely used to treat bipolar disorder. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is the most common adverse effect of lithium and occurs in up to 40% of patients. Renal lithium toxicity is characterized by increased water and sodium diuresis, which can result in mild dehydration, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and renal tubular acidosis. The concentrating defect and natriuretic effect develop within weeks of lithium initiation. After years of lithium exposure, full-blown nephropathy can develop, which is characterized by decreased glomerular filtration rate and chronic kidney disease. Here, we review the clinical and experimental evidence that the principal cell of the collecting duct is the primary target for the nephrotoxic effects of lithium, and that these effects are characterized by dysregulation of aquaporin 2. This dysregulation is believed to occur as a result of the accumulation of cytotoxic concentrations of lithium, which enters via the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) on the apical membrane and leads to the inhibition of signaling pathways that involve glycogen synthase kinase type 3beta. Experimental and clinical evidence demonstrates the efficacy of the ENaC inhibitor amiloride for the treatment of lithium-induced NDI; however, whether this agent can prevent the long-term adverse effects of lithium is not yet known.

### Lithium and nephrotoxicity: a literature review of approaches to clinical management and risk stratification [^111ZFP69]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

In regards to a decision making analysis of whether to cease lithium, concerns about relapse of otherwise stable bipolar disorder, as well as the potential for an increased risk of suicide with the use of alternative therapeutic options are significant and have to be balanced against the risk of potential future ESKD. Stopping at an earlier stage of CKD may be appropriate if the mood disorder has been stable and another efficacious therapeutic option may exist for a particular patient and if there is clear evidence of a persistent decline in renal function over time with no other alternative cause found. In addition, given the concerns that lithium induced nephropathy may continue to progress despite cessation of lithium and may even do so at a relatively innocuous creatinine clearance of < 40 ml/min or creatinine level of < 220 mmol/L, a time where patients would likely still be asymptomatic from their CKD, this rise in risk needs to be carefully considered in the decision-making algorithm. Alternatively, if the patient has had prior relapses and lithium is clearly the most efficacious medication then continuing with vigilant monitoring may be appropriate. A process of shared informed decision making is essential, incorporating the person's viewpoint on the available choices and their consequences. This is a decision best made gradually over time, in consultation with their treating psychiatrist, nephrologist, primary care physician and significant others if appropriate. If lithium is ceased, this should be done very gradually and with close monitoring, together with understanding of early warning signs and engagement of caregivers if appropriate.

### Safety of available agents used to treat bipolar disorder: focus on weight gain [^113yR2v7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmacotherapeutic management of bipolar disorder has advanced considerably since the introduction of lithium therapy nearly 50 years ago. The sizable percentage of patients who do not respond adequately to lithium and/or are intolerant to its side effects has served as an impetus for identifying alternative pharmacotherapeutic agents. Recent advances in the understanding of the neurotransmitter systems and their receptors as it applies to treatment of bipolar disorder has, in part, led to progress in delineating applications of anticonvulsant/antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in this area. Although the efficacy of many drugs has been evaluated in patients with this disorder, medication tolerability and adherence issues related to unfavorable side effect profiles are substantial impediments to the development of novel pharmacotherapies. The potential for excessive weight gain as a side effect of certain psychopharmacologic agents remains a concern to both clinicians and patients.

Method

English-language literature from 1985–2001 in MEDLINE was searched for the terms bipolar disorder, anticonvulsant, antiepileptic, lithium, antipsychotic, weight, and compliance. This article reviewed current therapeutic options for bipolar disorder, including newer AEDs and atypical antipsychotic drugs, with emphasis on the issue of weight gain and possible approaches to minimizing this risk.

Results

Certain newer AEDs are characterized by more favorable safety and tolerability profiles that include weight loss as a desirable side effect. Because bipolar disorder is associated with unacceptably high rates of relapse, recurrence, and morbidity, the concept of pharmacotherapeutic efficacy logically not only includes symptom relief but also necessarily encompasses issues related to regimen tolerability and adherence.

Conclusion

There is a need for guidelines to help physicians carefully formulate and individualize management plans to reach safe, effective, and cost-efficient patient outcomes. Monitoring the weight of patients with bipolar disorder and educating them regarding this issue should be standard components of any treatment plan.

### Delphi survey of maintenance lithium treatment in older adults with bipolar disorder: an ISBD task force report [^112kn4Ad]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, lithium, just like all of the other mood stabilizers including antipsychotic agents, represents a double‐edged sword for older adults. One concern has been its possible role in increasing the risk of chronic renal failure 15, 16 although there is also considerable recent epidemiological evidence that the risk is not as concerning as originally considered. 17 Other concerns include hypothyroidism, 18 hypercalcemia, 19 neurotoxicity, 20 and parkinsonism. 21 As the cohort of bipolar patients successfully maintained on lithium reaches their 70's and 80's, the age associated decrease in renal clearance may lead to higher lithium levels. This in turn leads to increased risk of side effects and outright toxicity if typical adult doses are not lowered. 20, 22 Several commonly used drugs in older adults, such as diuretics, ACE Inhibitors and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, can interact with lithium and cause higher serum levels, thereby increasing the risk of toxicity. 23 Furthermore, symptoms of toxicity (eg, tremor, gastrointestinal upset, and neurological disturbance) can be misinterpreted as other conditions commonly seen in later life, such as parkinsonism or dementia. 21 A "prescribing cascade" may ensue, 24 with additional medications introduced unnecessarily to assist in the management of the observed symptoms (eg, dopaminergic agents, cognitive enhancers, and gastrointestinal drugs). Clearly, more evidence and guidelines are needed that balance the risks and benefits of lithium use in OABD. 25, 26

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^113wuWNC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Lithium use in pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum — dosing, toxicity, placental transfer, and lactation are detailed as follows: To minimize fetal exposure, avoidance of high peak concentrations can be achieved by changing the dose to twice daily. Lithium toxicity often presents at serum lithium concentrations of 1.5 mEq/L or greater. Due to changes in the glomerular filtration rate and plasma volume around delivery and with conditions such as preeclampsia, hyperemesis, or acute blood loss, careful dose adjustment and closer monitoring are required; after delivery, careful but rapid down-titration is required to prevent toxicity. Lithium crosses the placenta with umbilical cord levels mirroring maternal levels, and higher neonatal lithium levels are associated with hypotonia, lethargy, and respiratory difficulties; some experts recommend holding the lithium dose at the onset of labor or 24–48 hours before a scheduled induction or cesarean delivery and then reinitiating postpartum at the pre-pregnancy dose or guided by drug trough levels for the first 2 weeks postpartum. Breastfeeding guidance is controversial; serum infant levels in breastfed infants ranged from 10% to 60% of maternal serum concentrations, and because toxicity is a clinical risk in newborns, if lactation is considered, close coordination among the obstetrician, pediatrician, and psychiatrist is required.

If the decision is made to continue lithium treatment during pregnancy, serum lithium concentrations should be monitored and the dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Two to three days prior to delivery, lithium dosage should be decreased or discontinued to reduce the risk of maternal and/or neonatal toxicity.

### Managing the risk of lithium-induced nephropathy in the long-term treatment of patients with recurrent affective disorders [^116kdGaC]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Lithium has been the most effective psychopharmacological drug in the long-term treatment of patients with recurrent unipolar and bipolar affective illness. As a result of its widespread and longtime use in patients with recurrent affective disorders, psychiatrists have become increasingly aware of the whole spectrum of lithium's potential side effects. One of the side effects associated with its chronic use is lithium-induced nephropathy. In a recent cross-sectional study published in BMC Medicine, Alberto Bocchetta et al. add further information to this topic, demonstrating that duration of lithium treatment is associated with impaired glomerular function in patients with recurrent or chronic affective disorders. The present paper will discuss the implications of this and other related recent research on our management of patients with recurrent affective disorders. In this context the importance of shared decision making and close monitoring of kidney function is highlighted, including the regular assessment of the glomerular filtration rate, to provide best possible care to our patients maintained on lithium treatment.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^114bTgzQ]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

Lithium safety in bipolar disorder — kidney risk and therapeutic drug levels note that the disadvantages of lithium include greater potential for kidney harm, and kidney harm can be minimized by maintaining patients' lithium plasma levels in the optimal range of 0.6–0.8 mEq/L, which was determined to offer the optimum balance of efficacy and side effects.

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: a Swedish population-based cohort study [^117CBtnK]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lithium is prescribed during pregnancy, but there is limited information about pregnancy and neonatal outcomes following in utero exposure. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the associations between lithium use and adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.

Methods

This population-based cohort study examined associations between maternal lithium use and major adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes via inverse probability weighted propensity score regression models.

Results

Of 854,017 women included in this study, 434 (0.05%) used lithium during pregnancy. Among pre-specified primary outcomes, lithium use during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth (8.7% vs 3.0%; adjusted relative risk [aRR] 2.64 95% CI 1.82, 3.82) and birth of a large for gestational age infant (9.0% vs 3.5%; aRR 2.64 95% CI 1.91, 3.66), but not preeclampsia nor birth of a small for gestational age infant. Among secondary outcomes, lithium use was associated with an increased risk of cardiac malformations (2.1% vs 0.8%; aRR 3.17 95% CI 1.64, 6.13). In an analysis restricted to pregnant women with a diagnosed psychiatric illness (n = 9552), associations remained between lithium and spontaneous preterm birth, birth of a large for gestational age infant, and cardiovascular malformations; and a positive association with neonatal hypoglycaemia was also found. These associations were also apparent in a further analysis comparing women who continued lithium treatment during pregnancy to those who discontinued prior to pregnancy.

Conclusions

Lithium use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth and other adverse neonatal outcomes. These potential risks must be balanced against the important benefit of treatment and should be used to guide shared decision-making.

### Delphi survey of maintenance lithium treatment in older adults with bipolar disorder: an ISBD task force report [^113TvSC3]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

With regard to lithium administration, the experts did not reach consensus on the value of twice compared to once daily dosing. The uncertainty in the literature on this point was reflected by the fact that some experts gave the same reason (less stress on the kidneys) for both options. The majority favored once daily dosing but this did not reach the consensus threshold.

Guidelines for safe monitoring of lithium levels and related laboratory and clinical testing suggest that older adults with bipolar disorder should be seen routinely at least every three to six months with specific laboratory tests and clinical assessments administered as described in the results: renal functioning every 3‐6 months, metabolic and endocrine testing every 6 months, and hematology yearly. Routine clinical assessment of gait and tremor should take place every 3‐6 months and routine cognitive testing should be done annually using the MMSE 34 or MoCA. 35 By seeing OABD every 3‐6 months, clinicians will be able to monitor the clinical course and detect significant clinical or medical concerns at an early stage. In centers where the availability of psychiatrists is limited, family physicians or allied health professionals can supplement the necessary frequency of clinical monitoring. Special attention must be given to the signs of lithium toxicity in order to avoid the "prescribing cascade" that mistakes lithium side effects and signs of toxicity for another disorder such as parkinsonism, dementia, or gastrointestinal disorder. As most side effects of lithium are dose dependent, these guidelines offer room to lower the dose and serum level without loss of effectiveness.

### Lithium and nephrotoxicity: a literature review of approaches to clinical management and risk stratification [^115VnyTT]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

A search strategy for this review was developed to identify appropriate studies, sourced from the electronic databases EMBASE, PubMed (NLM) and MEDLINE. All relevant articles published between 1977 and January 2018 were included for analysis. There was no language restriction on articles. Duplicate studies were removed. The reference lists of articles were examined for additional studies which met the inclusion criteria. Search terms included lithium with the AND operator to combine with nephrotoxicity or nephropathy or chronic kidney disease or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus or renal and pathophysiology. Studies which examined the efficacy and safety of lithium and the subsequent risks for CKD in those with bipolar affective disorder were included and could be incorporate both randomised and non-randomised trials. Animal based studies and duplicates were excluded. The data was independently extracted from the included studies by the primary reviewer and collated within a Microsoft Word document and included general study characteristics and intervention design. The data extracted was verified by the other two co-authors with all discrepancies resolved through discussion and consensus.
