## Question

What are sinus arrythmias

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what sinus arrhythmias are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and whether "sinus arrhythmia" refers to a single entity or a family of rhythms. Then, I should verify the major subtypes and their distinguishing features. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology, especially autonomic mechanisms and the role of respiratory modulation. After that, I need to check the clinical significance, including when these rhythms are benign versus when they reflect disease. Finally, I will review diagnostic evaluation and management principles, making sure I align with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislabel the condition. "Sinus arrhythmia" is not a single rhythm but an umbrella term for variations in sinus rhythm that share a common origin in the sinoatrial node yet differ in mechanism and clinical implications; I should explicitly distinguish physiologic respiratory sinus arrhythmia from pathologic sinus node dysfunction and inappropriate sinus tachycardia to avoid confusion in counseling and management [^650c6eb6] [^e359b8a4].

> I will now examine the major subtypes, starting with respiratory sinus arrhythmia, which is a normal, physiologic phenomenon characterized by heart rate acceleration during inspiration and deceleration during expiration due to phasic vagal modulation. Wait, let me verify the current nomenclature — recent expert consensus recommends renaming this to "respiratory heart rate variability" to avoid implying pathology, so I should note that shift while still using RSA for historical context and clarity in this explanation [^de45e07c] [^046f6a32].

> Next, I should review inappropriate sinus tachycardia, which is a persistent resting sinus rate above 100 bpm with a mean 24-hour rate above 90 bpm in the absence of secondary causes such as hyperthyroidism, anemia, or dehydration. Hold on, I should confirm the diagnostic criteria — yes, IST is a diagnosis of exclusion and is commonly associated with autonomic dysfunction and distressing symptoms like palpitations and fatigue, particularly in younger patients [^e359b8a4] [^29319109].

> Let me consider sinus node dysfunction, historically termed sick sinus syndrome, which encompasses intrinsic sinus node disease with bradyarrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses or arrest, sinoatrial exit block, chronotropic incompetence, and the tachy-brady syndrome with alternating bradycardia and atrial tachyarrhythmias. I should double-check that these are the canonical ECG manifestations — yes, guidelines consistently list these patterns and emphasize correlating symptoms with rhythm disturbances [^650c6eb6] [^c6d89d63].

> Now, I need to check the pathophysiology so I don't overgeneralize. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia reflects phasic parasympathetic modulation synchronized with respiration, improving ventilation–perfusion matching and serving as a marker of vagal tone; importantly, recent work cautions that RSA amplitude should not be equated with global vagal tone, which is a common misconception I should correct here [^de45e07c] [^046f6a32]. In contrast, inappropriate sinus tachycardia likely involves autonomic imbalance with enhanced sympathetic tone and impaired vagal restraint, though mechanisms remain incompletely defined and multifactorial [^29319109]. Sinus node dysfunction arises from age-related degenerative fibrosis of the sinus node and atrial myocardium, ion channel dysfunction, and remodeling that impair impulse formation and conduction, with frequent coexistence of atrial fibrillation in tachy-brady phenotypes [^92ec3d46] [^cc31fe6c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical significance without context. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia is generally benign and even protective, and its presence in athletes and healthy individuals reflects high vagal tone; I should confirm that this is compatible with normal activities — yes, aviation and sports medicine literature accept RSA as a normal variant in appropriately screened individuals [^cec2ed3f]. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia, while not life-threatening, can cause substantial quality-of-life impairment and may warrant therapy if symptoms are intolerable, though long-term outcomes are generally favorable [^29319109]. Sinus node dysfunction is clinically significant when symptomatic, with risks of syncope, falls, and tachy-brady–related complications; pacing improves symptoms and may reduce atrial fibrillation burden in selected patients, though it does not reduce mortality [^650c6eb6] [^3190b697].

> I should confirm the diagnostic approach so I don't miss reversible causes. For suspected sinus node dysfunction, obtain a 12-lead ECG to document rhythm and screen for structural disease, use ambulatory monitoring to correlate symptoms with bradyarrhythmias, and consider exercise testing when chronotropic incompetence is suspected. But wait, I need to ensure I don't overuse invasive testing — electrophysiology study is not routinely indicated unless the noninvasive evaluation is nondiagnostic and symptoms persist, and even then it has limited sensitivity for SND [^0591bff4] [^dce44694] [^f9e5e22b]. For inappropriate sinus tachycardia, exclude secondary causes with targeted labs and, if needed, ambulatory monitoring to confirm resting tachycardia and mean 24-hour rate criteria; autonomic reflex testing is not routinely recommended [^686d5a07].

> Next, I should review management principles and make sure I align with guidelines. For respiratory sinus arrhythmia, no treatment is needed beyond reassurance and recognition of its physiologic value. For inappropriate sinus tachycardia, address reversible contributors, initiate lifestyle measures, and consider beta-blockers or ivabradine for symptom control; I should double-check ablation guidance — sinus node modification is not first-line due to modest durability and meaningful complication risks, and should be reserved for highly symptomatic, refractory cases after shared decision-making [^0603c54f] [^132d1b2a]. For symptomatic sinus node dysfunction, permanent pacing is indicated to relieve symptoms and enable safe pharmacotherapy for tachyarrhythmias; atrial-based pacing is preferred when feasible, and special populations such as those with congenital heart disease may require individualized pacing strategies [^3190b697] [^c601d460].

> Let me reconsider any potential pitfalls in my explanation. I initially implied that RSA directly measures vagal tone; wait, I should correct that — RSA amplitude indexes respiratory modulation of cardiac vagal outflow but does not capture tonic vagal activity, which is why the field is moving toward "respiratory heart rate variability" to avoid misinterpretation, and I need to ensure readers understand that distinction to prevent overstatement of RSA as a global autonomic metric [^de45e07c]. I also briefly considered grouping sinus tachycardia broadly with sinus arrhythmias; hold on, I should verify — while sinus tachycardia is a sinus rhythm, guidelines and reviews typically treat it as a separate entity from the arrhythmic variations encompassed by sinus node dysfunction, so I will keep IST and physiologic sinus tachycardia distinct from the bradyarrhythmic spectrum of SND to maintain clinical clarity [^e359b8a4] [^650c6eb6].

> In summary, sinus arrhythmias are sinus-origin rhythms that include physiologic respiratory sinus arrhythmia, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and sinus node dysfunction with its bradyarrhythmic and tachy-brady phenotypes. I need to ensure the key takeaway is explicit: respiratory sinus arrhythmia is normal and beneficial, inappropriate sinus tachycardia is a benign but symptomatic diagnosis of exclusion, and sinus node dysfunction is clinically important when symptomatic and often requires pacing, with evaluation focused on correlating symptoms, excluding reversible causes, and tailoring therapy to phenotype and patient preferences [^de45e07c] [^e359b8a4] [^650c6eb6].

Sinus arrhythmias are **normal variants** of sinus rhythm characterized by **heart rate variability** that is typically linked to respiration (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) [^de45e07c] or autonomic tone, with **no clinical significance** in healthy individuals [^cec2ed3f]. They are identified on ECG by **regular P waves** and PR intervals with **cyclical R-R variation**, most often with inspiration-accelerated and expiration-slowed rates [^046f6a32]. No treatment is needed unless symptoms occur or other arrhythmias coexist; management is supportive and focused on reassurance and addressing underlying factors if present [^notfound].

---

## Types of sinus arrhythmias

Sinus arrhythmias are classified into **two main types**:

| **Type** | **Description** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) | Cyclical heart rate variation with respiration; rate increases during inspiration and decreases during expiration due to vagal modulation [^de45e07c] | Normal physiological variant, especially in young, healthy individuals; indicates intact autonomic function [^cec2ed3f] |
| Non-respiratory sinus arrhythmia | Heart rate variability not linked to respiration, often due to autonomic fluctuations or medication effects | Usually benign; evaluate for underlying causes if persistent or symptomatic |

---

## Physiological mechanisms

The **primary mechanism** is autonomic modulation: parasympathetic (vagal) activity dominates at rest, causing cyclical R-R variation with respiration; sympathetic activity rises during inspiration and wanes during expiration, producing the characteristic pattern [^de45e07c]. Non-respiratory forms reflect autonomic imbalance or external influences such as medications or metabolic factors [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance

Respiratory sinus arrhythmia is a **normal finding** in healthy individuals, particularly the young and athletic, and indicates intact autonomic function [^cec2ed3f]. Non-respiratory sinus arrhythmia is usually benign but may warrant evaluation if persistent or symptomatic, to exclude underlying autonomic or cardiac disease [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

On ECG, sinus arrhythmia is characterized by:

- **Regular P waves** and PR intervals.
- **Cyclical R-R variation** (typically with respiration).
- **Normal QRS complexes**.

Ambulatory monitoring may be used to **confirm the diagnosis** and correlate symptoms with rhythm variations [^e108a13c].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Sinus arrhythmias are **generally benign** and require no treatment; management is supportive, with reassurance and education. Address underlying factors (e.g. anxiety, medications) if symptomatic or persistent. Pacing is not indicated unless there is coexisting significant bradyarrhythmia or sinus node dysfunction [^0da29db1].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis is **excellent** for respiratory sinus arrhythmia, reflecting normal autonomic function [^cec2ed3f]. Non-respiratory sinus arrhythmia has a favorable outlook when underlying causes are identified and managed; persistent cases may need further evaluation to exclude autonomic or cardiac disease [^notfound].

---

Sinus arrhythmias are **benign variants** of sinus rhythm with heart rate variability, most often respiratory in origin; they require no treatment unless symptomatic or associated with other arrhythmias, and carry an excellent prognosis [^cec2ed3f].

### Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options to maintain sinus rhythm: guideline-based and new approaches [^86cb27cf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia in patients with heart failure and is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. Restoration and preservation of sinus rhythm, therefore, has a premium. Of the numerous treatment options available, many must be avoided because of their potential for adverse effects or because of limited proof of efficacy in defined populations. Published guidelines provide help by synthesizing clinical trial data into a recommended approach. This article summarizes current information regarding the best methods applicable to patients with left ventricular dysfunction for rate control, sinus rhythm restoration and maintenance, and stroke prevention. New and evolving therapies and how they might fit into the evolving treatment paradigm are also briefly reviewed.

### The sinus tachycardias [^f4c035c0]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

Sinus tachycardia, in the forms of four distinct rhythm disturbances, is frequently encountered in clinical practice but is often overlooked. The most common rhythm, normal sinus tachycardia, whether physiologic, pathologic or iatrogenic, is predominantly catecholamine driven, is virtually asymptomatic and is managed by identifying and treating the underlying cause. The other so-called primary sinus tachycardias, which include inappropriate sinus tachycardia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and sinus node re-entry tachycardia, have fundamentally different clinical features, basic underlying etiologic mechanisms and treatment strategies. Differentiation of these types from normal sinus tachycardia and from other atrial arrhythmias is crucial for successful management. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy of the sinus tachycardias not only prevents multiple consultations but might also have important long-term prognostic implications.

### Deciphering the sinus tachycardias [^d46400a5]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Sinus tachycardia is the most common rhythm disturbance encountered in clinical practice. Primary sinus tachycardia without an underlying secondary cause, despite often being associated with troublesome symptoms, is often neglected leading to multiple consultations and frustration on part of both the practitioner and the patient. The fact that primary sinus tachycardias are a heterogeneous group of disorders is seldom appreciated; hence, a firm diagnosis is rarely reached and management is haphazard. Furthermore, there may be prognostic implications for prolonged or recurrent sinus tachycardia, making it imperative that this group of arrhythmias receive adequate and appropriate attention. Normal sinus tachycardia (i.e., secondary), inappropriate sinus tachycardia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and sinus node reentry tachycardia make up this group of arrhythmias. Their definitions, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and optimum management are discussed in this review.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a progressive disease in which arrhythmia-induced remodeling facilitates evolution from paroxysmal AF to persistent and permanent AF. Changes in electrical, structural, and contractile properties of cardiac tissue that are thought to underlie AF maintenance and progression are reviewed. Also examined is the negative impact of AF on clinical outcomes, as well as the potential benefits of restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm. Because of the limited efficacy and adverse effects of current antiarrhythmics, new antiarrhythmic drugs need to be developed that provide safer and more effective rhythm control in AF.

### The coronary sinus: passive bystander or source of arrhythmia? [^e985c7ac]. Heart Rhythm (2004). Low credibility.

The coronary sinus provides access to the epicardial space of the heart allowing ablation of epicardial accessory pathways, foci of ventricular arrhythmia, and arrhythmogenic areas such as the vein or ligament of Marshall. In addition, its musculature may form atrioventricular accessory connections, participate in macroreentrant atrial arrhythmias, and generate foci of microreentrant atrial tachycardia and fibrillation. Thus, the coronary sinus may serve both as a bystander to arrhythmia circuits as well as an original source of cardiac arrhythmia.

### Abnormal sinus node function in clinical arrhythmias [^56028caf]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2003). Low credibility.

To understand abnormal sinus node function in clinical atrial arrhythmias, it is essential to understand the normal function of the sinus node. Much of our understanding of the sinus node comes from work done in rabbits. In small animals, the node is a thin structure and can be modeled in two dimensions. However, in canines and humans, the node is a more complex structure completely surrounded by myocytes. Recent data suggest that the node may be insulated from the surrounding atrial myocytes, except at a limited number of exit sites. A model of the node with discrete exit sites explains how atrial activation can be initiated from multiple sites simultaneously. Within the node there may exist specialized pathways that explain the complex conduction within the node. Multiple cell types, with different intrinsic rates, combined with the nonuniform distribution of autonomic receptors, provide a basis for understanding the dynamics of heart rate control and the initiation of atrial activation. In addition, this model of the sinus node provides a framework to propose novel mechanisms underlying various atrial arrhythmias, such as atrial premature depolarizations or sinus node reentry.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Sinus tachycardia definitions — physiologic versus inappropriate: sinus tachycardia is a rhythm arising from the sinus node in which the rate of impulses exceeds 100 bpm; physiologic sinus tachycardia is an appropriate increased sinus rate in response to exercise and other situations that increase sympathetic tone; inappropriate sinus tachycardia is defined by sinus heart rate > 100 bpm at rest with a mean 24-h heart rate > 90 bpm not due to appropriate physiological responses or primary causes such as hyperthyroidism or anemia.

Sinus tachyarrhythmias — definition and ECG features: In normal individuals, the sinus rate at rest is generally between 50 bpm and 90 bpm, reflecting vagal tone, and sinus tachycardia refers to the circumstance in which the sinus rate exceeds 100 bpm; on the electrocardiogram (ECG), the P wave is upright in leads I, II, and aVF and is biphasic in lead V1, and as the sinus rate increases, activation arises from more superior aspects of the right atrium, resulting in a larger-amplitude P wave in the inferior leads.

### Sick sinus syndrome: a review [^bf7607c5]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Sick sinus syndrome refers to a collection of disorders marked by the heart's inability to perform its pacemaking function. Predominantly affecting older adults, sick sinus syndrome comprises various arrhythmias, including bradyarrhythmias with or without accompanying tachyarrhythmias. At least 50 percent of patients with sick sinus syndrome develop alternating bradycardia and tachycardia, also known as tachy-brady syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome results from intrinsic causes, or may be exacerbated or mimicked by extrinsic factors. Intrinsic causes include degenerative fibrosis, ion channel dysfunction, and remodeling of the sinoatrial node. Extrinsic factors can be pharmacologic, metabolic, or autonomic. Signs and symptoms are often subtle early on and become more obvious as the disease progresses. They are commonly related to end-organ hypoperfusion. Cerebral hypoperfusion is most common, with syncope or near-fainting occurring in about one-half of patients. Diagnosis may be challenging, and is ultimately made by electrocardiographic identification of the arrhythmia in conjunction with the presence of symptoms. If electrocardiography does not yield a diagnosis, inpatient telemetry monitoring, outpatient Holter monitoring, event monitoring, or loop monitoring may be used. Electrophysiologic studies also may be used but are not routinely needed. Treatment of sick sinus syndrome includes removing extrinsic factors, when possible, and pacemaker placement. Pacemakers do not reduce mortality, but they can decrease symptoms and improve quality of life.

### Respiratory sinus arrhythmia: why does the heartbeat synchronize with respiratory rhythm? [^046f6a32]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is heart rate variability in synchrony with respiration, by which the R-R interval on an ECG is shortened during inspiration and prolonged during expiration. Although RSA has been used as an index of cardiac vagal function, it is also a physiologic phenomenon reflecting respiratory-circulatory interactions universally observed among vertebrates. Previous studies have shown that the efficiency of pulmonary gas exchange is improved by RSA, suggesting that RSA may play an active physiologic role. The matched timing of alveolar ventilation and its perfusion with RSA within each respiratory cycle could save energy expenditure by suppressing unnecessary heartbeats during expiration and ineffective ventilation during the ebb of perfusion. Furthermore, evidence has accumulated of a possible dissociation between RSA and vagal control of that heart rate, suggesting differential controls between the respiratory modulation of cardiac vagal outflow and cardiac vagal tone. RSA or heart rate variability in synchrony with respiration is a biological phenomenon, which may have a positive influence on gas exchange at the level of the lung via efficient ventilation/perfusion matching.

For IST, "Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is defined as sinus tachycardia that is unexplained by physiological demands", and "Patients with IST commonly show resting heart rates > 100 bpm and average rates that are > 90 bpm in a 24-hour period". The section emphasizes that "Thus, IST is a diagnosis of exclusion".

### 2018 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline on the Evaluation and management of Patients with bradycardia and cardiac Conduction delay: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^8994cc35]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia definitions — sinus node dysfunction: Sinus bradycardia is defined as a sinus rate < 50 bpm, and ectopic atrial bradycardia is atrial depolarization from an atrial pacemaker other than the sinus node with a rate < 50 bpm. Sinoatrial exit block is evidence of blocked conduction between the sinus node and adjacent atrial tissue. A sinus pause is sinus node depolarizations ≥ 3 s after the last atrial depolarization, and sinus node arrest is no evidence of sinus node depolarization. Tachycardia-bradycardia ("tachy-brady") syndrome consists of sinus bradycardia, ectopic atrial bradycardia, or sinus pause alternating with periods of abnormal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, or AF. Chronotropic incompetence is broadly the inability of the heart to increase its rate commensurate with demand and in many studies translates to failure to attain 80% of expected heart rate reserve during exercise, and isorhythmic dissociation is atrial depolarization slower than ventricular depolarization from an atrioventricular nodal, His, bundle, or ventricular site.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

2015 ACC/AHA/HRS supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), paroxysmal SVT (PSVT), atrial fibrillation (AF), and sinus tachycardia definitions — SVT is an umbrella term for tachycardias with atrial and/or ventricular rates in excess of 100 bpm at rest involving tissue from the His bundle or above and includes inappropriate sinus tachycardia, atrial tachycardia (AT), macroreentrant AT (including typical atrial flutter), junctional tachycardia, AVNRT, and accessory pathway–mediated reentrant tachycardias, and in this guideline does not include AF; PSVT is a clinical syndrome with a regular and rapid tachycardia of abrupt onset and termination and represents a subset of SVT; AF is a supraventricular arrhythmia with uncoordinated atrial activation with ECG characteristics of irregular atrial activity, absence of distinct P waves, and irregular R-R intervals, and is not addressed in this document; sinus tachycardia is a rhythm from the sinus node in which the rate of impulses exceeds 100 bpm; physiologic sinus tachycardia reflects appropriate rate increases to exercise or other situations increasing sympathetic tone, whereas inappropriate sinus tachycardia is defined by sinus heart rate > 100 bpm at rest with a mean 24-h heart rate > 90 bpm not due to appropriate physiological responses or primary causes such as hyperthyroidism or anemia.

### Sinus node and atrial arrhythmias [^cc31fe6c]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Although sinus node dysfunction (SND) and atrial arrhythmias frequently coexist and interact, the putative mechanism linking the 2 remain unclear. Although SND is accompanied by atrial myocardial structural changes in the right atrium, atrial fibrillation (AF) is a disease of variable interactions between left atrial triggers and substrate most commonly of left atrial origin. Significant advances have been made in our understanding of the genetic and pathophysiologic mechanism underlying the development and progression of SND and AF. Although some patients manifest SND as a result of electric remodeling induced by periods of AF, others develop progressive atrial structural remodeling that gives rise to both conditions together. The treatment strategy will thus vary according to the predominant disease phenotype. Although catheter ablation will benefit patients with predominantly AF and secondary SND, cardiac pacing may be the mainstay of therapy for patients with predominant fibrotic atrial cardiomyopathy. This contemporary review summarizes current knowledge on sinus node pathophysiology with the broader goal of yielding insights into the complex relationship between sinus node disease and atrial arrhythmias.

### Inappropriate sinus tachycardia [^1577e5db]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a syndrome in which the sinus heart rate is inexplicably faster than expected and associated symptoms are present. The heart rate at rest, even in a supine position, can exceed 100 beats/min; minimal activity accelerates the rate rapidly and substantially. Patients with IST may require restriction from physical activity. Mechanisms responsible for IST are understood incompletely. It is important to distinguish IST from so-called appropriate sinus tachycardia and from postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, with which overlap may occur. Because the long-term outcome seems to be benign, treatment may be unnecessary or may be as simple as physical training. However, for patients with intolerable symptoms, therapeutic measures are warranted. Even at high doses, β-adrenergic blockers, the first-line therapy, often are ineffective; the same is true for most other medical therapies. In rare instances, catheter- or surgically- based right atrial or sinus node modification may be helpful, but even this is fraught with limited efficacy and potential complications. Overtreatment, in an attempt to reduce symptoms, can be difficult to avoid, but is discouraged.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — table of definitions for sinus node dysfunction details: Sinus bradycardia is defined as sinus rate < 50 bpm, and ectopic atrial bradycardia is atrial depolarization attributable to an atrial pacemaker other than the sinus node with a rate < 50 bpm. Sinoatrial exit block is evidence that blocked conduction between the sinus node and adjacent atrial tissue is present. Sinus pause occurs when the sinus node depolarizes > 3 s after the last atrial depolarization, whereas sinus node arrest indicates no evidence of sinus node depolarization. Tachycardia-bradycardia ("tachy-brady") syndrome consists of sinus bradycardia, ectopic atrial bradycardia, or sinus pause alternating with periods of abnormal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, or AF. Chronotropic incompetence is broadly defined as failure to attain 80% of expected heart rate reserve during exercise, and isorhythmic dissociation describes atrial depolarization slower than ventricular depolarization.

### Redefining respiratory sinus arrhythmia as respiratory heart rate variability: an international expert recommendation for terminological clarity [^de45e07c]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

The variation of heart rate in phase with breathing, known as 'respiratory sinus arrhythmia' (RSA), is a physiological phenomenon present in all air-breathing vertebrates. RSA arises from the interaction of several physiological mechanisms but is primarily mediated by rhythmic changes in cardiac parasympathetic (vagal) activity, increasing heart rate during inspiration and decreasing heart rate during expiration. RSA amplitude is an indicator of autonomic and cardiac health; RSA is diminished or absent in common pathological conditions such as chronic heart failure and hypertension. In this Expert Recommendation, we argue that the term 'RSA', although historically important, is semantically inaccurate and carries misleading pathological connotations, contributing to misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the origin and the physiological importance of the phenomenon. We propose replacing 'RSA' with the term 'respiratory heart rate variability' (RespHRV), which avoids pathological connotations and emphasizes the specific respiratory contribution to heart rate variability. We clarify that RespHRV encompasses respiratory-related heart rate variations in both the low-frequency and high-frequency bands traditionally defined in heart rate variability analysis, and that its amplitude should not be misconstrued as a measure of vagal tone. Adopting the proposed term 'RespHRV' is expected to unify understanding and stimulate further experimental and clinical research into the physiological mechanisms and functional importance of this phenomenon.

### Guidelines for reporting articles on psychiatry and heart rate variability (GRAPH): recommendations to advance research communication [^750b2a7d]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Erratic sinus arrhythmia is a less well-recognized form of persistent arrhythmia that differs from ectopy in that heart beats appear to have normal electrocardiographic morphology (that is, they have sinus origin) but display short-term variation that is non-respiratory in origin. Although erratic sinus arrhythmia has been strongly associated with serious cardiovascular illness, predicting post-infarction survival, this does not preclude it from occurring in other healthy or patient populations. An inspection of the Poincaré plot (a scatterplot where each point represents two consecutive heart periods) for regularity may be sufficient to reveal the presence of erratic sinus arrhythmia, and should be performed on IBI series with inexplicably high HRV. Consequently, how beat inspection was performed, the percentage of beats identified per participant and any exclusions because of abnormal sinus rhythm should be explicitly stated.

### Inappropriate sinus tachycardia: etiology, pathophysiology, and Management: JACC review topic of the week [^29319109]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a clinical syndrome that generally affects young patients and is associated with distressing symptoms. Although the most common symptom is palpitations, it can be accompanied by a myriad of symptoms, including anxiety, dizziness, presyncope, and syncope. The pathogenesis of IST is not well understood and considered multifactorial, with autonomic dysfunction being the central abnormality. IST is a diagnosis of exclusion. Management presents a clinical challenge. The overall efficacy of lifestyle modifications and medical therapy may be limited. Recent advances in catheter and surgical sinus node sparing ablation techniques have led to improvement in outcomes. In addition, increased focus has led to development of multimodality team-based interventions to improve outcomes in this group of patients. In this review, we discuss the mechanistic basis of IST, review current approaches to diagnosis, and outline contemporary therapeutic approaches.

### Sinus tachycardia: a multidisciplinary expert focused review [^81f252f8]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Sinus tachycardia (ST) is ubiquitous, but its presence outside of normal physiological triggers in otherwise healthy individuals remains a commonly encountered phenomenon in medical practice. In many cases, ST can be readily explained by a current medical condition that precipitates an increase in the sinus rate, but ST at rest without physiological triggers may also represent a spectrum of normal. In other cases, ST may not have an easily explainable cause but may represent serious underlying pathology and can be associated with intolerable symptoms. The classification of ST, consideration of possible etiologies, as well as the decisions of when and how to intervene can be difficult. ST can be classified as secondary to a specific, usually treatable, medical condition (eg, pulmonary embolism, anemia, infection, or hyperthyroidism) or be related to several incompletely defined conditions (eg, inappropriate ST, postural tachycardia syndrome, mast cell disorder, or post-COVID syndrome). While cardiologists and cardiac electrophysiologists often evaluate patients with symptoms associated with persistent or paroxysmal ST, an optimal approach remains uncertain. Due to the many possible conditions associated with ST, and an overlap in medical specialists who see these patients, the inclusion of experts in different fields is essential for a more comprehensive understanding. This article is unique in that it was composed by international experts in Neurology, Psychology, Autonomic Medicine, Allergy and Immunology, Exercise Physiology, Pulmonology and Critical Care Medicine, Endocrinology, Cardiology, and Cardiac Electrophysiology in the hope that it will facilitate a more complete understanding and thereby result in the better care of patients with ST.

The following constitutes key background information on sick sinus syndrome:

- **Definition**: Sick sinus syndrome is a group of heart rhythm disorders characterized by abnormal functioning of the sinus node leading to various cardiac arrhythmias, particularly bradycardia.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of sick sinus syndrome involves intrinsic abnormal impulse formation and/or propagation from the sinus node. Age-related interstitial fibrosis is considered a common pathophysiological mechanism. In some cases, the dysfunction also favors the onset of atrial arrhythmias, leading to a more complex clinical condition known as "bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome".
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of sick sinus syndrome in the US is estimated at 0.8 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for sick sinus syndrome include advanced age, AF, hypertension, elevated levels of N-terminal pro-BNP and cystatin C, greater height and BMI, white race, history of CVDs, and genetic factors.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of sick sinus syndrome can vary widely. Early stages may be inconspicuous, but as the disease progresses, patients may present with symptoms and signs of end-organ hypoperfusion, particularly cerebral hypoperfusion, that may lead to intermittent symptoms such as syncope and pre-syncope. Mild symptoms such as irritability, lassitude, inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, palpitations, and dizziness are common. Bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome may further lead to hemodynamic changes and cause peripheral vascular embolism, stroke, and other serious consequences such as syncope and Adams-Stokes syndrome.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of sick sinus syndrome is variable and depends on the severity of the condition and the presence of other comorbidities. Pacemaker implantation is the first-line treatment for symptomatic patients with sick sinus syndrome and documented bradycardia history, which can significantly improve symptoms and QoL.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Definitions — sinus node dysfunction include sinus bradycardia defined as sinus rate < 50 bpm and ectopic atrial bradycardia as atrial depolarization attributable to an atrial pacemaker other than the sinus node with a rate < 50 bpm; sinoatrial exit block is evidence that blocked conduction between the sinus node and adjacent atrial tissue is present; sinus pause occurs when the sinus node depolarizes ≥ 3 s after the last atrial depolarization; sinus node arrest denotes no evidence of sinus node depolarization; tachycardia‑bradycardia ("tachy‑brady") syndrome consists of sinus bradycardia, ectopic atrial bradycardia, or sinus pause alternating with periods of abnormal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, or atrial fibrillation (AF), with the tachycardia possibly associated with suppression of sinus node automaticity and a sinus pause of variable duration when the tachycardia terminates; chronotropic incompetence is broadly the inability of the heart to increase its rate commensurate with activity or demand and in many studies translates to failure to attain 80% of expected heart rate reserve during exercise; and isorhythmic dissociation describes atrial depolarization slower than ventricular depolarization.

2.3. Definitions

The previous EHRA/HRS expert consensus on catheter ablation of VA in 2009 proposed several definitions to standardize nomenclature in the field. The current consensus statement repeats the majority of these recommendations for VT ablation. In the last 10 years, knowledge and experience of PVC ablations have significantly increased. In the current report, new proposals are made to facilitate understanding of clinical characteristics and reporting of the ablation outcomes of these arrhythmias (Table 2). Note that different cutoff rates for VT and (accelerated) idioventricular rhythm could be appropriate for children, who have a higher resting sinus rate than adults: the mechanism, symptoms, and clinical setting of the VA are more important than the rate.

2.4. Standard Anatomical Terminology

The following are the suggested anatomical terminology for use in the description of catheter ablation of VA (Table 3). While these generally represent the most commonly used terms, the writing committee recognizes that several variants or alternatives are in use and may also be valid.

Sleep disordered breathing and bradyarrhythmias — prevalence, screening prompt, and treatment effects: Sleep disordered breathing has an estimated prevalence in the United States of 24% in men and 9% in women, and prevalence is higher in populations with cardiovascular diseases, ranging as high as 47% to 83%. Estimated rates of profound nocturnal sinus bradycardia range from 7.2% to 40%, second- or third-degree atrioventricular block ranges from 1.3% to 13.3%, and sinus pauses range from 3.3% to 33%. Because of these associations, the presence of nocturnal bradyarrhythmias should prompt screening for sleep apnea, starting with solicitation of suspicious symptoms and pursuing additional testing if appropriate. Nocturnal arrhythmias associated with obstructive sleep apnea are effectively suppressed with treatment of the underlying sleep apnea, with episodes of profound sinus bradycardia, prolonged sinus pauses, and atrioventricular conduction block reduced by 72% to 89%; in one follow-up, patients were followed for 54 ± 10 months on continuous positive airway pressure therapy with 58% complete compliance rate, and none of the 17 participants without pacemakers experienced symptomatic bradycardia during this time.

### Diagnosis and treatment of sick sinus syndrome [^1e233a6b]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Sick sinus syndrome comprises a variety of conditions involving sinus node dysfunction and commonly affects elderly persons. While the syndrome can have many causes, it usually is idiopathic. Patients may experience syncope, pre-syncope, palpitations, or dizziness; however, they often are asymptomatic or have subtle or nonspecific symptoms. Sick sinus syndrome has multiple manifestations on electrocardiogram, including sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinoatrial block, and alternating patterns of bradycardia and tachycardia (bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome). Diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome can be difficult because of its nonspecific symptoms and elusive findings on electrocardiogram or Holter monitor. The mainstay of treatment is atrial or dual-chamber pacemaker placement, which generally provides effective relief of symptoms and lowers the incidence of atrial fibrillation, thromboembolic events, heart failure, and mortality, compared with ventricular pacemakers.

### Clinical significance of unexplained persistent sinus tachycardia in women with structurally normal heart during the peripartum period [^65344332]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Sinus tachycardia is generally considered a benign arrhythmia, subsequently management recommendations are absent from newly published guidelines. Therefore, the question remains: if persistent sinus tachycardia is considered a benign occurrence, with the only intervention to the patient being reassurance, why do women with persistent ST of unclear etiology experience higher rates of c-sections Answering this question may be of vital significance as it may shorten then LOS but also prevent unnecessary C-sections which can be associated with short- and long-term effects for both mother and child.

In almost 70% of the patients in our cohort, the etiology of persistent ST could not be elucidated, and could be deemed as either inappropriate tachycardia or sinus tachycardia of unknown etiology. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia, defined by the 2015 HRS consensus as "sinus heart rate more than 100 bpm at rest with mean 24‐hour heart rate more than 90 bpm, in absence of secondary causes", has been shown to predominately affect young females. Shabtae et al. found pregnancy to be the most common precipitating factor for inappropriate ST. Dysregulation of the compensatory mechanisms to increase cardiac output, namely sympathetic and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system activation create autonomic dysfunction, is a known etiology for inappropriate ST. Only small case series in the literature report women who experience inappropriate ST during the peripartum may be at risk for adverse maternal outcomes. Sharp et al. found an increased rate of induction of labor among the 19 patients they identified, although they did not find elevated rates of c-section in this study conducted in the England.

As shown in our study, sinus tachycardia cannot be explained solely by indolent infection or hypovolemia. Autonomic dysfunction, hormonal fluctuations, catecholamine surge, and medications have been proposed as explanations for sinus tachycardia of unknown etiology. Although clinicians must balance between extensive diagnostic investigation to determine the etiology of inappropriate ST and reassurance when it is a benign incident, reflecting physiologic changes, distinguishing between the two may have an impact on preventing adverse maternal outcomes. Further evidence is needed to understand the clinical significance and to deliver evidence-based care.

Through this analysis we emphasize the importance of not dismissing ST in the obstetric population and seek to raise awareness of its significance in predicating complications and poor maternal outcomes. ST is one of the earliest and most insidious signs of a poor prognosis, however it is frequently considered "physiologic", even in the absence of a clear etiology. ST could be a surrogate of underlying pathology leading to poor outcomes and should prompt further investigation in obstetric patients.

### Smartwatch-based detection of cardiac arrhythmias: beyond the differentiation between sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation [^c55f2aef]. Heart Rhythm (2021). Medium credibility.

Within the span of a few years, watches have functionally morphed from objects that tell time to wearable minicomputers that allow real-time recording of electrocardiograms (ECGs). Considerable information can be deduced from these single lead tracings, and it is now not uncommon to see patients in whom diagnostic tracings of clinically relevant but elusive arrhythmias are captured using a smartwatch. Empowering individuals to record their own ECG tracings in scenarios such as palpitations, syncope, and for risk stratification of sudden death intuitively has considerable potential, but its value remains to be robustly demonstrated. The main objective of this review is to describe the information that can be obtained from smartwatch-based single-lead ECG recordings beyond simply differentiating between sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation. We also review the strengths and limitations of using these devices in clinical settings and offer potential solutions to address the latter.

Rhythm and conduction disturbances

Bradyarrhythmias and conduction disturbances

Sinus node dysfunction

Sinus bradycardia and sinus arrhythmia are common findings in active people; these findings often normalise during exercise and are usually asymptomatic. Individuals who maintain cardiovascular fitness also often have increased vagal tone, and may have a higher incidence of junctional rhythm, and increased heart rate variability. These findings, in isolation, are compatible with all aircrew duties, including in single seat, high performance aircraft.

In contrast, aircrew with syncope or presyncope caused by sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest or sino-atrial block should be grounded. In asymptomatic individuals, sino-atrial arrest > 3 s during the daytime and > 4 s at night should also lead to temporary withdrawal of aircrew privileges (table 4). Such individuals require further investigation to confirm or exclude underlying cardiac disease.

Sleep disordered breathing and nocturnal bradyarrhythmias — epidemiology, patterns, and treatment effects: Sleep disordered breathing is common with an estimated prevalence in the United States of 24% in men and 9% in women, and prevalence is higher in cardiovascular disease populations, ranging as high as 47% to 83%. Estimated rates of profound nocturnal sinus bradycardia range from 7.2% to 40%, second- or third-degree atrioventricular block range from 1.3% to 13.3%, and sinus pauses range from 3.3% to 33%, and the prevalence of these arrhythmias appears to increase with the severity of sleep apnea. A stereotypical pattern of progressive bradycardia during apnea/hypopnea followed by tachycardia and hypertension during partial arousal has been frequently described. Nocturnal arrhythmias associated with obstructive sleep apnea are effectively suppressed with treatment of the underlying sleep apnea, with episodes reduced by 72% to 89%. One study followed patients for 54 ± 10 months on continuous positive airway pressure therapy with a 58% complete compliance rate, and none of the 17 participants without pacemakers experienced symptomatic bradycardia during this time. Because both conditions are relatively common and treatment reduces arrhythmias, the presence of nocturnal bradyarrhythmias should prompt screening for sleep apnea, starting with solicitation of suspicious symptoms and pursuing additional testing if appropriate.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) epidemiology and pathophysiology — SND, historically referred to as sick sinus syndrome, is most often related to age-dependent, progressive, degenerative fibrosis of the sinus nodal tissue and surrounding atrial myocardium, leading to abnormalities of impulse formation/propagation and bradycardia or pause-related syndromes; atrial arrhythmias can coexist with sinus node disease in the "tachy-brady syndrome". There is evidence that heart block occurs in a portion of patients who have required permanent atrial pacing for SND, suggesting fibrotic involvement of the specialized atrioventricular conduction system. Data from permanent pacemaker studies and large cohorts suggest that SND is most common in individuals who are in their 70s or 80s, and common concurrent issues include ischemic heart disease, heart failure, valvular heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and atrial fibrillation. Intrinsic sinus or atrioventricular nodal disease can present similarly to extrinsic/secondary processes (e.g., myocardial ischemia or infarction, infiltrative diseases, collagen vascular disease, surgical trauma, endocrine abnormalities, autonomic effects, neuromuscular disorders) that compromise impulse initiation and propagation, and whether intrinsic or extrinsic, the clinical manifestations can be identical.

### Respiratory sinus arrhythmia as a potential measure in substance use treatment – outcome studies [^7929feba]. Addiction (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Dysfunction of physiological regulation systems may underlie the disrupted emotional and self-regulatory processes among people with substance use disorder (SUD). This paper reviews evidence as to whether or not respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), as a psychophysiological index of emotional regulation, could provide useful information in treatment-outcome research to provide insights into recovery processes.

Methods

We reviewed the use of RSA in clinical research and studies on SUD treatment. Search terms for the review of RSA in clinical research included respiratory sinus arrhythmia, heart rate variability, vagal, cardiac vagal control, psychophysiology, intervention, treatment, mindfulness, mind-body, mental health, substance use, chemical dependence, regulation and emotion regulation. For the review of RSA in intervention studies, we included only those that provided adequate description of psychophysiological methods, and examined RSA in the context of an intervention study.

Results

RSA appears to be able to provide an index of self-regulatory capacity; however, it has been little used in either intervention or treatment research. Of the four intervention studies included in this review, all were mindfulness-based interventions. Two studies were with substance-using samples, and both showed pre-post increases in RSA and related improved substance use outcomes. Two of the three studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and both showed significant increases in RSA in the experimental compared to comparison condition.

Conclusion

Respiratory sinus arrhythmia may be a useful index of emotional regulation in people with substance use disorder, and a potential measure of underlying mechanisms for SUD treatment studies, particularly mindfulness-based interventions.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmias — automaticity explains that normal automaticity results from phase 4 spontaneous depolarization of the transmembrane action potential arising from a normal resting potential, reaching threshold and initiating an action potential, and that an initiating current (I f) is responsible for spontaneous phase 4 depolarization in the sinus node. In contrast, abnormal automaticity arises from a partially depolarized membrane potential that is usually close to the activation potential for calcium channels in the cell membrane, and in the acute phase of an myocardial infarction (MI) or during transient ischemia increased extracellular potassium causes partial depolarization of the resting membrane potential creating injury currents between the infarcted/ischemic tissue and healthy myocardium. These injury currents may initiate spontaneous activity.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Bradycardia — clinical manifestations and definition state that bradycardia can be broadly classified into 2 general categories: sinus node dysfunction (SND) and atrioventricular block, with SND electrocardiographic findings including sinus bradycardia, ectopic atrial rhythm, junctional rhythm or ventricular escape, intermittent sinus pauses, and blunted heart rate response with exercise (chronotropic incompetence). Vagally mediated atrioventricular block during sleep can be recognized by concomitant sinus node slowing (P–P prolongation), and a sudden increase in parasympathetic tone with vasovagal syncope can cause bradycardia, usually sinus node slowing or sinus arrest but sometimes atrioventricular block. The term "symptomatic bradycardia" is used and defined as a documented bradyarrhythmia directly responsible for syncope or presyncope, transient dizziness or lightheadedness, heart failure symptoms, or confusional states from cerebral hypoperfusion attributable to slow heart rate, and direct attribution of bradycardia as the sole source of symptoms is challenging with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue being multifactorial and difficult to correlate particularly in modest resting sinus bradycardia or with exercise.

Ambulatory electrocardiography (AECG) for bradyarrhythmias — detected conditions and correlation guidance: Detected bradyarrhythmias include transient and paroxysmal high-degree atrioventricular block and sinus node dysfunction. AECG allows detection of a sudden interruption of atrioventricular conduction without sinus slowing, suggesting a vagal or neurocardiogenic mechanism and suggesting avoidance of pacemaker implantation. For sinus node dysfunction, it is strongly recommended to establish symptom/rhythm correlation, and although formalized cutoffs are arbitrary, a sinus rate < 40 bpm is considered potentially causative in a symptomatic patient; AECG recorders can indicate whether sinus node competency is inadequate to match metabolic demands and produce symptoms.

### REM-related bradyarrhythmia syndrome [^0e14febe]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrhythmias during sleep are relatively common and include a diverse etiology, from benign sinus bradycardia to potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias. Predisposing factors include obstructive sleep apnea and cardiac disease. Rapid eye movement (REM)-related bradyarrhythmia syndrome (including sinus arrest and complete atrioventricular block with ventricular asystole) in the absence of an underlying cardiac or physiologic sleep disorder was first described in the early 1980s. Although uncertain, the underlying pathophysiology likely reflects abnormal autonomic neural-cardiac inputs during REM sleep. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is a known key modulator of heart rate fluctuations and rhythm during sleep and nocturnal heart rate reflects a balance between the sympathetic-parasympathetic systems. Whether the primary trigger for REM-related bradyarrhythmias reflects abnormal centrally mediated control of the ANS during REM sleep or anomalous baroreflex parasympathetic influences is unknown. This review focuses on the salient features of the REM-related bradyarrhythmia syndrome and explores potential mechanisms with a particular assessment of the relationship between the ANS and nocturnal heart rate fluctuations.

### ACC / AHA / HRS 2008 guidelines for device-based therapy of cardiac rhythm abnormalities [^ef6a3199]. Heart Rhythm (2008). Medium credibility.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) definition, manifestations, and epidemiology are summarized as follows: SND involves abnormalities in sinus node and atrial impulse formation and propagation, including persistent sinus bradycardia, chronotropic incompetence, and sinus arrest with escape rhythms in the atrium, atrioventricular (AV) junction, or ventricular myocardium, and the frequent association of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) and sinus bradyarrhythmias accompanied by symptoms is termed "tachy-brady syndrome". SND is primarily a disease of the elderly, is typically diagnosed in the seventh and eighth decades of life, and collected data from 28 different studies on atrial pacing showed a median annual incidence of acute and/or AV block of 0.6% (range 0% to 4.5%) with a total prevalence of 2.1% (range 0% to 11.9%). Identical clinical manifestations may occur at any age as a secondary phenomenon due to conditions that result in destruction of sinus node cells, including ischemia or infarction, infiltrative disease, collagen vascular disease, surgical trauma, endocrinologic abnormalities, and autonomic insufficiency. Chronotropic incompetence denotes an inadequate heart rate response to physical activity, and many clinicians would consider failure to achieve 80% of the maximum predicted heart rate (220 minus age) at peak exercise as evidence of a blunted heart rate response, although none of these approaches have been validated clinically. The natural history of untreated SND is highly variable, but the majority of patients with syncope because of a sinus pause or marked sinus bradycardia will have recurrent syncope.

### Alcohol consumption, sinus tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias at the munich octoberfest: results from the munich beer related electrocardiogram workup study (munichBREW) [^9ce83ee0]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we have conducted a large prospective analysis of acute alcohol consumption on ECG-assessed cardiac arrhythmias. We thereby report good technical feasibility of ECG screening even under lively conditions at the Munich Octoberfest. Acute and — to a lesser extent — chronic alcohol consumption were associated with sinus tachycardia. Analysis of respiratory sinus arrhythmia as a measure of autonomic tone suggested that acute alcohol intake confers autonomic imbalance. Additional research is warranted to investigate if autonomic imbalance constitutes the link between sinus tachycardia and the occurrence of arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation, as implicated by reports of the so-called 'Holiday Heart Syndrome' (Figure 3).

### Diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of exercise-induced arrhythmias [^6c80de18]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

The cardiovascular benefits of physical activity are indisputable. Nevertheless, growing evidence suggests that both atrial fibrillation and right ventricular arrhythmia can be caused by intense exercise in some individuals. Exercise-induced atrial fibrillation is most commonly diagnosed in middle-aged, otherwise healthy men who have been engaged in endurance training for > 10 years, and is mediated by atrial dilatation, parasympathetic enhancement, and possibly atrial fibrosis. Cardiac ablation is evolving as a first-line tool for athletes with exercise-induced arrhythmia who are eager to remain active. The relationship between physical activity and right ventricular arrhythmia is complex and involves genetic and physical factors that, in a few athletes, eventually lead to right ventricular dilatation, followed by subsequent myocardial fibrosis and lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular conduction blocks are common in athletes, most of whom remain asymptomatic, although incomplete reversibility has been shown after exercise cessation. In this Review, we summarize the evidence supporting the existence of exercise-induced arrhythmias and discuss the specific considerations for the clinical management of these patients.

Because complications "can be significant and may include symptomatic sinus or junctional bradycardia necessitating pacemaker placement, phrenic nerve injury with paralysis of the right hemidiaphragm, and significant facial and upper-extremity swelling caused by narrowing of the superior vena cava/RA junction", "sinus node modification should be considered only for patients who are highly symptomatic and cannot be adequately treated by medication, and then only after informing the patient that the risks may outweigh the benefits of ablation".

Automaticity mechanisms in ventricular arrhythmia are described as follows: normal automaticity results from phase 4 spontaneous depolarization of the transmembrane action potential arising from a normal resting potential, reaching threshold and initiating an action potential. An initiating current (I f) is responsible for spontaneous phase 4 depolarization in the sinus node. In contrast, abnormal automaticity arises from a partially depolarized membrane potential that is usually close to the activation potential for calcium channels in the cell membrane. In the acute phase of a myocardial infarction (MI) or during transient ischemia, increased extracellular potassium causes partial depolarization of the resting membrane potential creating injury currents between the infarcted/ischemic tissue and healthy myocardium, and these injury currents may initiate spontaneous activity.

### Fractal ventilation enhances respiratory sinus arrhythmia [^0ab1d196]. Respiratory Research (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our findings may have important implications for the design of life support devices used clinically. Buchman has suggested that multiple organ dysfunction, often seen in patients requiring life support in the intensive care unit, is a consequence of lost coupling between "communicating" organ systems. The inability to re-couple following the perturbation of critical illness may be an important reason why multi-organ system dysfunction is so lethal. Fractal ventilation, by augmenting respiratory sinus arrhythmia, may be one approach to enhance organ system re-coupling.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Genetic contributions to sinus node dysfunction (SND) and conduction disease — Although most sinus node disorders and conduction disturbances in adults are attributable to increased vagal tone or acquired disease, genetic mutations may also contribute. An international consensus panel has endorsed mutation‑specific genetic testing for "family members and appropriate relatives" after identification of a progressive cardiac conduction disease‑causative mutation in an index case, and such testing can be deferred in asymptomatic children. Asymptomatic family members who carry the conduction disease‑associated mutation and those first‑degree relatives of an affected proband who have not undergone mutation‑specific genetic testing should be followed regularly for signs of evolving conduction disease, cardiomyopathy or tachyarrhythmia, and before mutation‑specific testing, genetic counseling is essential to determine whether to proceed in an individual case. The most common identifiable gene responsible for inherited conduction disease (SCN5A) accounts for only 5% of progressive conduction disease cases, and mutations in HCN4 have been implicated in idiopathic SND; nonetheless, most SND is physiologic or acquired, and genetic testing is not routinely indicated. Citing undefined diagnostic yield and "signal‑to‑noise" ratio and uncertain rates of rare variants of uncertain significance, a consensus document suggests that the diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value of genetic testing is limited in evaluating an index case.

### Sinus node dysfunction [^650c6eb6]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Sinus node dysfunction, previously known as sick sinus syndrome, describes disorders related to abnormal conduction and propagation of electrical impulses at the sinoatrial node. An abnormal atrial rate may result in the inability to meet physiologic demands, especially during periods of stress or physical activity. Sinus node dysfunction may occur at any age, but is usually more common in older persons. The causes of sinus node dysfunction are intrinsic (e.g., degenerative idiopathic fibrosis, cardiac remodeling) or extrinsic (e.g., medications, metabolic abnormalities) to the sinoatrial node. Many extrinsic causes are reversible. Electrocardiography findings include sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses or arrest, sinoatrial exit block, chronotropic incompetence, or alternating bradycardia and tachycardia (i.e., bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome). Clinical symptoms result from the hypoperfusion of end organs. About 50% of patients present with cerebral hypoperfusion (e.g., syncope, presyncope, lightheadedness, cerebrovascular accident). Other symptoms include palpitations, decreased physical activity tolerance, angina, muscular fatigue, or oliguria. A diagnosis is made by directly correlating symptoms with a bradyarrhythmia and eliminating potentially reversible extrinsic causes. Heart rate monitoring using electrocardiography or ambulatory cardiac event monitoring is performed based on the frequency of symptoms. An exercise stress test should be performed when symptoms are associated with exertion. The patient's inability to reach a heart rate of at least 80% of their predicted maximum (220 beats per minute - age) may indicate chronotropic incompetence, which is present in 50% of patients with sinus node dysfunction. First-line treatment for patients with confirmed sinus node dysfunction is permanent pacemaker placement with atrial-based pacing and limited ventricular pacing when necessary.

### Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and treatment [^62af18a6]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. It impairs cardiac function and increases the risk of stroke. The incidence of atrial fibrillation increases with age. Key treatment issues include deciding when to restore normal sinus rhythm, when to control rate only, and how to prevent thromboembolism. Rate control is the preferred management option in most patients. Rhythm control is an option for patients in whom rate control cannot be achieved or who have persistent symptoms despite rate control. The current recommendation for strict rate control is a resting heart rate of less than 80 beats per minute. However, one study has shown that more lenient rate control of less than 110 beats per minute while at rest was not inferior to strict rate control in preventing cardiac death, heart failure, stroke, and life-threatening arrhythmias. Anticoagulation therapy is needed with rate control and rhythm control to prevent stroke. Warfarin is superior to aspirin and clopidogrel in preventing stroke despite its narrow therapeutic range and increased risk of bleeding. Tools that predict the risk of stroke (e.g. CHADS2) and the risk of bleeding (e.g. Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index) are helpful in making decisions about anticoagulation therapy. Surgical options for atrial fibrillation include disruption of abnormal conduction pathways in the atria, and obliteration of the left atrial appendage. Catheter ablation is an option for restoring normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and normal left atrial size. Referral to a cardiologist is warranted in patients who have complex cardiac disease; who are symptomatic on or unable to tolerate pharmacologic rate control; or who may be candidates for ablation or surgical interventions.

### Alcohol consumption, sinus tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias at the munich octoberfest: results from the munich beer related electrocardiogram workup study (munichBREW) [^875c0fd2]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Aims

Alcohol is a risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias. Retrospective analyses suggest supraventricular arrhythmias consecutive to acute alcohol consumption, but prospective data are limited. We intended to prospectively associate acute alcohol consumption with cardiac arrhythmias.

Methods and results

At the 2015 Munich Octoberfest, we enrolled 3028 voluntary participants who received a smartphone-based ECG and breath alcohol concentration (BAC) measurements. ECGs were analysed for cardiac arrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia, premature atrial/ventricular complexes, atrial fibrillation/flutter) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia. By multivariable adjusted logistic regression we associated BACs with cardiac arrhythmias. Similarly, we analysed 4131 participants of the community-based KORA S4 Study (Co-operative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) and associated cardiac arrhythmias with chronic alcohol consumption. In our acute alcohol cohort (mean age 34.4 ± 13.3 years, 29% women), mean BAC was 0.85 ± 0.54 g/kg. Cardiac arrhythmias occurred in 30.5% (sinus tachycardia 25.9%; other arrhythmia subtypes 5.4%). Breath alcohol concentration was significantly associated with cardiac arrhythmias overall (odds ratio (OR) per 1-unit change 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50–2.05; P < 0.001) and sinus tachycardia in particular (OR 1.96, 95%CI 1.66–2.31; P < 0.001). Respiratory sinus arrhythmia measuring autonomic tone was significantly reduced under the influence of alcohol. In KORA S4, chronic alcohol consumption was associated with sinus tachycardia (OR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01–1.06; P = 0.006).

Conclusions

Acute alcohol consumption is associated with cardiac arrhythmias and sinus tachycardia in particular. This partly reflects autonomic imbalance as assessed by significantly reduced respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Such imbalance might lead to sympathetically triggered atrial fibrillation resembling the holiday heart syndrome.

### Alcohol consumption, sinus tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias at the munich octoberfest: results from the munich beer related electrocardiogram workup study (munichBREW) [^728dc8c9]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Whereas ours is the largest prospective analysis to describe the association of acute alcohol consumption and sinus tachycardia under real life conditions, the relation has previously been noted. Prior studies have reported an increase in heart rate following alcohol intake in experimental settings. Consistently, these studies have identified alcohol induced alterations of the autonomic nervous system to elevate heart rate. Thereby, both an increase in sympathetic activity, and a decrease in vagal tone, have been described. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia is a simple measure of cardiac vagal tone and autonomic balance. In our acute alcohol cohort, participants with increased BAC presented with a significantly reduced prevalence of respiratory sinus arrhythmia. This finding concurs with the interpretation that the observed alcohol induced increase in heart rate is the consequence of changes in autonomic balance. Autonomic imbalance is strongly predisposing to the development of atrial fibrillation. Alcohol induced autonomic imbalance could thus hypothetically be a link to the later development of atrial fibrillation. Possibly, the short duration of our ECG recordings immediately during acute alcohol exposition resulted in an underestimation of alcohol induced cardiac arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation in particular. These considerations ask for additional research including longer ECG recordings during follow-up of hours and days after acute alcohol consumption.

A number of considerations are warranted when interpreting our study. Given the public environment of our study, we were restricted in assessing personal questions and conducting physical examinations. Hence, several possible confounding factors remained unaddressed, including but not limited to the amount of alcohol consumption prior to BAC measurement, the participants' common alcohol consumption behaviour, their use of recreational drugs, or their usual physical activity. A single 30 s ECG recording prevented the investigation of temporal relations between alcohol consumption and arrhythmia occurrence. Importantly, we cannot comment on the relevance of baseline heart rate prior to alcohol intake. We were thus only able to assess the prevalence but not the incidence of arrhythmias during follow-up. Future studies with longer ECG recordings will need to fill this gap. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia only partially reflects the influence of autonomic tone on heart rate variability. Additional research is warranted to investigate more elaborate measures of autonomic tone in relation to alcohol consumption. Due to our exclusion criteria, we were not able to study severely intoxicated individuals (BAC ≥ 3.00 g/kg). In KORA S4, chronic alcohol consumption was rather low compared with other community-based cohorts. We might thus have underestimated arrhythmia prevalence secondary to long-term alcohol use. Information on chronic alcohol consumption in our acute alcohol cohort was unavailable.

### Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy: focus on atrial fibrillation [^ade90406]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Arrhythmias and heart failure (HF) are common causes of morbidity and premature death worldwide, and patients who present with both conditions have particularly poor outcomes. Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy (AIC) is a condition in which arrhythmias, often atrial fibrillation (AF), but also frequent atrial or ventricular ectopic beats, cause or aggravate HF. The hallmark of this condition is partial or complete reversibility of left ventricular systolic dysfunction after restoration of normal sinus rhythm. Differentiation between HF that causes arrhythmias and arrhythmias that cause HF remains challenging, leads to the underuse of rhythm-control therapy and, consequently, to the under-diagnosis of AIC. In this Review, we describe the various pathophysiological mechanisms of AIC, with a focus on AF as the underlying arrhythmia. We then discuss the epidemiology, clinical presentation and assessment of patients with AIC, with consideration of the complex interactions between AF and left ventricular dysfunction. We also present the therapeutic approach taken in patients presenting with suspected AIC, including restoration of sinus rhythm to unmask a diagnosis of AIC and treatment of HF. We conclude with a discussion of priorities for future research and the observation that there is an urgent need for objective, easily quantifiable parameters to identify patients with AIC.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) management — pharmacotherapy and ablation guidance: β-adrenergic blockers are "not usually effective and can cause adverse effects".

Availability is limited as ivabradine is "not yet available in all countries" and "might appear in the next 2–3 years". Sinus node modification/ablation shows "a high rate of symptom recurrence" with "significant" complications (including "permanent pacing, transient or permanent phrenic nerve paralysis, and transient superior vena cava syndrome"), and "we do not recommend that they be part of routine care", though ablations "may be offered in highly select circumstances or as part of research protocols".

### 2012 ACCF / AHA / HRS focused update incorporated into the ACCF / AHA / HRS 2008 guidelines for device-based therapy of cardiac rhythm abnormalities: a report of the American college of cardiology foundation / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^ecf56954]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for sick sinus syndrome, more specifically with respect to permanent pacing, indications, asymptomatic bradycardia, ACC/AHA/HRS 2013 guidelines recommend to consider performing permanent pacing in patients with asymptomatic sinus bradycardia after biventricular repair of congenital heart disease with a resting HR < 40 bpm or pauses in ventricular rate > 3 sec.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^3e513179]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Atrioventricular (AV) block and sinus bradycardia in pregnancy — clinical course and delivery considerations — are summarized as follows: Sinus bradycardia is described as rare because the pulse typically accelerates 10–20 bpm over baseline during pregnancy, and Mobitz type I AV block is common; both can be benign when there is no hemodynamic impairment or structural heart disease (SHD). In reported high-grade AV block without pacemaker across 32 pregnancies, all patients did well during pregnancy, but 1 patient had syncope and sudden death 1 month postpartum; close surveillance of pregnant patients with complete AV block is warranted, and pacemaker implantation during or after pregnancy should follow guidelines-based recommendations for the general population. Delivery appears well tolerated in hemodynamically stable, asymptomatic advanced AV block with an acceptable ventricular rate, a narrow QRS complex, and normal ventricular function; reported cases support conservative management, and pacemaker implantation is not indicated around the time of delivery in these patients.

### 2018 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline on the evaluation and management of patients with bradycardia and cardiac conduction delay: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines, and the Heart Rhythm Society [^107d5a94]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for sick sinus syndrome, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a TTE in selected patients with suspected structural heart disease presenting with bradycardia.
