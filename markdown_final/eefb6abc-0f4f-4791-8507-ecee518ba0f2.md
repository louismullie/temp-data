## Question

Typical picture of bacterial meningitis on glucose and protein

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the typical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose and protein findings in bacterial meningitis, including thresholds, mechanisms, exceptions, and how to interpret results in context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core CSF triad and what "typical" means. Then, I should verify evidence-based thresholds for hypoglycorrhachia and hyperproteinorrhachia. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology linking glucose and protein changes. After that, I need to check important exceptions that can blunt or normalize these findings. Finally, I will integrate clinical context, age-specific nuances, and guideline-based testing to synthesize a practical, cautious interpretation framework.

> Let me first confirm the core CSF triad that clinicians rely on. In bacterial meningitis, the typical pattern is neutrophilic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and decreased CSF glucose relative to serum, often quantified as a reduced CSF-to-serum glucose ratio; WHO and ESCMID emphasize measuring CSF WBC with differential, protein, glucose, and the CSF-to-blood glucose ratio as foundational tests in suspected acute bacterial meningitis, which anchors the "typical" biochemical signature we interpret at the bedside [^116DoYRE] [^116dQtEh].

> Now, I should verify the glucose thresholds. Hypoglycorrhachia is commonly defined as CSF glucose less than about 40 mg/dL, and a CSF-to-serum glucose ratio less than about 0.4 is often used as supportive of bacterial etiology; however, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — specificity rises and sensitivity falls as thresholds drop, with ratios around 0.3–0.36 yielding higher specificity but missing more cases, so I need to state these as supportive, not absolute, discriminators [^112KXb8C] [^1118L1Dv] [^116tzqsh].

> Next, I will examine the protein side. Elevated CSF protein is expected, and in adults protein above roughly 100–120 mg/dL supports bacterial meningitis, with marked elevations above about 220 mg/dL being particularly worrisome. I should double-check that these adult cutoffs align with contemporary adult data, and yes, adult series and guideline summaries consistently cite protein greater than 2.2 g/L as a strong predictor of bacterial meningitis, while acknowledging that protein levels vary with age and blood–brain barrier integrity [^116tzqsh] [^112EY6Z4].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic link between glucose and protein changes. Low CSF glucose in bacterial meningitis reflects both increased consumption by leukocytes and pathogens and impaired transport across an inflamed blood–brain barrier. Importantly, inflammation alone is insufficient — studies show that hypoglycorrhachia tracks with the presence of glucophagic microorganisms plus substantial inflammation, and CSF protein correlates more strongly than cell count with low glucose, suggesting protein serves as a proxy for microbial load and barrier dysfunction. I should also note that CSF lactate rises in parallel, reflecting anaerobic glycolysis and serving as a complementary marker when available [^111thoJd] [^114gx3vm] [^112NcocW].

> But wait, what if the CSF looks "normal"? I need to ensure I cover exceptions. Early presentations within 24 hours, neonates and young infants, immunocompromised hosts, and prior antibiotics can blunt pleocytosis and normalize glucose and protein; indeed, culture-proven bacterial meningitis without pleocytosis has been documented, and pretreatment with antibiotics is associated with higher CSF glucose and lower protein without changing WBC, so a normal protein or glucose does not exclude disease; in healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis, CSF indices may be unreliable altogether, reinforcing the need to integrate clinical suspicion and microbiology rather than rely on any single biochemical marker [^111rCKzu] [^115MGqSu] [^112jjCLs] [^115fLa61].

> Let me consider age-specific nuances more carefully. In neonates and young infants, normal CSF protein is higher and declines with age, so "mild" protein elevations may be physiologic. Conversely, very high protein in this group is more concerning, and meta-analytic data suggest CSF protein and WBC have better diagnostic accuracy than glucose in infants, with glucose showing good specificity but poor sensitivity. I should confirm that these infant thresholds differ from older children and adults, and yes, pediatric studies and systematic reviews support age-adjusted interpretation and caution against overreliance on glucose alone in this age group [^117EQ8HN] [^114Nz4ut] [^116ryfJu].

> Hold on, I should verify how to operationalize this at the bedside. A practical approach is to treat a low CSF glucose — especially less than about 40 mg/dL or a CSF-to-serum glucose ratio less than about 0.4 — as supportive of bacterial meningitis when accompanied by neutrophilic pleocytosis and elevated protein, while recognizing that viral meningitis typically has normal glucose and protein and lymphocytic predominance. However, I need to emphasize that no single parameter is definitive, and definitive diagnosis rests on culture or molecular testing, so I should recommend obtaining CSF Gram stain, culture, and PCR where available while not delaying empiric antibiotics for imaging unless there are clear contraindications [^116DoYRE] [^116dQtEh] [^113NwW9t] [^1143Bp56].

> I should double-check the role of adjunctive markers. CSF lactate can outperform conventional markers for distinguishing bacterial from aseptic meningitis in meta-analyses, but it is not specific and must be interpreted in clinical context. Similarly, emerging biomarkers like heparin-binding protein show promise but are not yet replacements for standard CSF chemistries. Thus, I will position lactate and novel biomarkers as supportive, not substitutes, for the glucose–protein–WBC triad [^113swvgh] [^112NcocW] [^117H2Yfw].

> Let me reconsider the final synthesis to ensure internal consistency. The typical CSF pattern in bacterial meningitis is hypoglycorrhachia with CSF glucose less than about 40 mg/dL or a CSF-to-serum glucose ratio less than about 0.4, together with hyperproteinorrhachia generally above about 100–120 mg/dL and often markedly higher, in the setting of neutrophilic pleocytosis. However, because early disease, host factors, and prior antibiotics can normalize these values, normal glucose or protein cannot safely exclude bacterial meningitis, and management must integrate clinical suspicion, CSF cell count with differential, microbiology, and, when indicated, adjunctive markers and repeat sampling if the initial picture is discordant with the clinical course [^116tzqsh] [^116DoYRE] [^116dQtEh] [^111rCKzu].

---

The typical CSF profile in bacterial meningitis shows **low glucose (< 40 mg/dL or CSF/serum ratio < 0.4)** and **high protein (> 100–150 mg/dL)** [^116tzqsh], reflecting impaired glucose transport and increased BBB permeability from meningeal inflammation [^1168oJqi] [^112BSvak]. These changes are most pronounced in bacterial meningitis and help distinguish it from viral meningitis, where glucose is usually normal and protein is only mildly elevated [^111f3wnb]. However, **early or partially treated cases may have atypical CSF**, so results must be interpreted in clinical context and alongside WBC count, Gram stain, and culture [^115birFF] [^115MGqSu].

## Cerebrospinal fluid glucose in bacterial meningitis

### Typical findings

- **Low CSF glucose**: CSF glucose is typically < 40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L) in bacterial meningitis [^112Q5R23].
- **CSF/serum glucose ratio**: The ratio is usually < 0.4, indicating impaired glucose transport into the CSF [^112EY6Z4].
- **Mechanism**: Inflammation and bacterial metabolism reduce CSF glucose via impaired transport and increased consumption [^1168oJqi].

---

### Pathophysiology

The **blood-brain barrier** becomes more permeable during inflammation, reducing glucose entry into the CSF [^117XYA1z]. Bacteria and leukocytes also consume glucose, further lowering CSF levels [^114gx3vm].

---

## Cerebrospinal fluid protein in bacterial meningitis

### Typical findings

- **Elevated CSF protein**: Protein is typically > 100–150 mg/dL (1.0–1.5 g/L) in bacterial meningitis [^112EY6Z4].
- **Mechanism**: Increased BBB permeability allows more protein to enter the CSF [^112BSvak].

---

### Pathophysiology

Inflammation increases **BBB permeability**, allowing more protein to enter the CSF [^117XYA1z]. Proteins may also be produced locally during the inflammatory response [^115s1sDy].

---

## Clinical significance of glucose and protein levels

Glucose and protein levels help **distinguish bacterial from viral meningitis** [^1119wX33]. Low glucose with high protein strongly suggests bacterial meningitis, whereas normal glucose with mildly elevated protein favors viral meningitis [^111f3wnb]. These parameters also correlate with severity and prognosis; lower glucose and higher protein are associated with worse outcomes [^112BSvak].

---

## Limitations and exceptions

- **Early presentation**: CSF may be normal early in disease or after partial antibiotic treatment [^111rCKzu].
- **Patient factors**: Age, immune status, and comorbidities can alter CSF findings [^115birFF].
- **Other causes**: Low glucose and high protein can occur in fungal, tuberculous, or carcinomatous meningitis [^115sMTBL] [^1168oJqi].

## Typical CSF findings in bacterial meningitis

| **Parameter** | **Typical finding in bacterial meningitis** |
|-|-|
| CSF glucose | < 40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L) |
| CSF/serum glucose ratio | < 0.4 |
| CSF protein | > 100–150 mg/dL (1.0–1.5 g/L) |

---

The hallmark CSF pattern in bacterial meningitis is **low glucose and high protein**, reflecting impaired glucose transport and increased BBB permeability from meningeal inflammation [^116tzqsh]. These findings, interpreted with clinical context and other CSF parameters, support timely diagnosis and management [^116dQtEh].

### Clinical features and long-term outcomes of children with pneumococcal meningitis in China: a 10-year single-centre retrospective analysis [^112BSvak]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Typical changes in the CSF during BM infection include increased protein and decreased glucose concentration. Vasilopoulou et al. found that a decrease in CSF glucose concentration (< 40 mg/dL) and an increase in protein concentration (> 1.00 g/L) were high-risk factors for poor prognosis in children with BM. Previous studies from our group have shown that CSF protein > 1.00 g/L and CSF glucose < 1.5 mmol/L may indicate a poor prognosis in children with BM. Here, the median CSF protein concentration was significantly higher in the poor prognosis group than in the good prognosis group (P < 0.001), while the median CSF glucose concentration was significantly lower in the poor prognosis group compared to the good prognosis group (P < 0.05). The balance between the inflow across the blood–brain barrier and outflow with CSF determines the CSF protein content. Therefore, the increase in protein levels may be related to the degree of blood–brain barrier damage or circulation in the CSF.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^114pm8ah]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the relative contribution of CSF inflammation vs microbial infection in driving hypoglycorrhachia in the clinical context of microbial and aseptic meningitis. We made the hypothesis that because all leukocytes (neutrophils, lymphocytes, or monocytes) have the capability of catabolizing glucose, they could be a major determinant of hypoglycorrhachia, including in aseptic meningitis. We retrospectively collected meningitis CSF profiles — defined as the presence of pleocytosis — with confirmed microbial and aseptic etiologies. This dichotomization offered a natural experiment to compare CSF glucose levels along a continuum of varying degrees of CNS inflammation in the presence (microbial) or the absence (aseptic) of microorganisms capable of catabolizing glucose across a broad range of meningitis etiologies.

A quick and accurate diagnosis of maladies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) is imperative. Procurement and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are paramount in helping the clinician determine a patient's clinical condition. Various staining methods, measurement of white blood cell counts, glucose and protein levels, recognition of xanthochromia, and microbiologic studies are CSF parameters that are collectively important in the ultimate determination by a clinician of the presence or absence of a catastrophic CNS condition. Many of these CNS parameters have significant limitations that should be recognized to minimize under treating patients with catastrophic illness.

### Effect of antibiotic pretreatment on cerebrospinal fluid profiles of children with bacterial meningitis [^115MGqSu]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of antibiotic administration before lumbar puncture on cerebrospinal fluid profiles in children with bacterial meningitis.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records of all children (1 month to 18 years of age) with bacterial meningitis who presented to 20 pediatric emergency departments between 2001 and 2004. Bacterial meningitis was defined by positive cerebrospinal fluid culture results for a bacterial pathogen or cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis with positive blood culture and/or cerebrospinal fluid latex agglutination results. Probable bacterial meningitis was defined as positive cerebrospinal fluid Gram stain results with negative results of bacterial cultures of blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Antibiotic pretreatment was defined as any antibiotic administered within 72 hours before the lumbar puncture.

Results

We identified 231 patients with bacterial meningitis and another 14 with probable bacterial meningitis. Of those 245 patients, 85 (35%) had received antibiotic pretreatment. After adjustment for patient age, duration and severity of illness at presentation, and bacterial pathogen, longer duration of antibiotic pretreatment was not significantly associated with cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count, cerebrospinal fluid absolute neutrophil count. However, antibiotic pretreatment was significantly associated with higher cerebrospinal fluid glucose and lower cerebrospinal fluid protein levels. Although these effects became apparent earlier, patients with ≥ 12 hours of pretreatment, compared with patients who either were not pretreated or were pretreated for < 12 hours, had significantly higher median cerebrospinal fluid glucose levels (48 mg/dL vs 29 mg/dL) and lower median cerebrospinal fluid protein levels (121 vs 178 mg/dL).

Conclusions

In patients with bacterial meningitis, antibiotic pretreatment is associated with higher cerebrospinal fluid glucose levels and lower cerebrospinal fluid protein levels, although pretreatment does not modify cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count or absolute neutrophil count results.

### Case report: greater meningeal inflammation in lumbar than in ventricular region in human bacterial meningitis [^117GVVCR]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Recurrent meningitis led us to increase the antibiotic dosage to achieve a better concentration in CSF. Surprisingly, only a transient increase in CSF cefepim concentration and no change in CSF ciprofloxacine concentration were observed despite a more than 50% increase in plasma concentrations of both antibiotics. The transient increase in cefepim in CSF paralleled that of protein in CSF and could be related to the transient alteration in meningeal permeability.

In summary, this case report shows that the maximal rostrocaudal gradient of leukocytes, protein and glucose was seen in the very acute phase of meningitis. This strongly suggests a greater alteration in the meningeal barrier and very probably a greater meningeal inflammation in the lumbar than the ventricular regions.

### Cerebrospinal fluid lactate concentration to distinguish bacterial from aseptic meningitis: a systemic review and meta-analysis [^1121xbgq]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Making a differential diagnosis between bacterial meningitis and aseptic meningitis is a critical clinical problem. The utility of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate assay for this purpose has been debated and is not yet routinely clinically performed. To adequately evaluate this assay, a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of the CSF lactate concentration as a marker for both bacterial meningitis and aseptic meningitis was performed.

Methods

Electronic searches in PubMed, Scopus, the MEDION database and the Cochrane Library were conducted to identify relevant articles published before March 2009. A manual search of reference lists from selected articles was also conducted. Two reviewers independently selected relevant articles and extracted data on study characteristics, quality and accuracy.

Results

Twenty-five articles were identified that met the eligibility criteria. Diagnostic odds ratios were considerably homogenous (Chi-square P = 0.1009, I² = 27.6%), and the homogeneity was further confirmed by a Galbraith plot and meta-regression analysis using several covariates. The symmetrical summary receiver-operator characteristic curve (SROC), fitted using the Moses-Shapiro-Littenberg method, was positioned near the upper left corner of the SROC curve. The Q value and area under the curve were 0.9451 and 0.9840, respectively, indicating excellent accuracy. The diagnostic accuracy of the CSF lactate concentration was higher than those of other four conventional markers (CSF glucose, CSF/plasma glucose quotient, CSF protein, and CSF total number of leukocytes) using a head to head meta-analysis of the 25 included studies.

Conclusions

To distinguish bacterial meningitis from aseptic meningitis, CSF lactate is a good single indicator and a better marker compared to other conventional markers.

### Cerebrospinal fluid analysis [^1119wX33]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is a diagnostic tool for many conditions affecting the central nervous system. Urgent indications for lumbar puncture include suspected central nervous system infection or subarachnoid hemorrhage. CSF analysis is not necessarily diagnostic but can be useful in the evaluation of other neurologic conditions, such as spontaneous intracranial hypotension, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and malignancy. Bacterial meningitis has a high mortality rate and characteristic effects on CSF white blood cell counts, CSF protein levels, and the CSF:serum glucose ratio. CSF culture can identify causative organisms and antibiotic sensitivities. Viral meningitis can present similarly to bacterial meningitis but usually has a low mortality rate. Adjunctive tests such as CSF lactate measurement, latex agglutination, and polymerase chain reaction testing can help differentiate between bacterial and viral causes of meningitis. Immunocompromised patients may have meningitis caused by tuberculosis, neurosyphilis, or fungal or parasitic infections. Subarachnoid hemorrhage has a high mortality rate, and rapid diagnosis is key to improve outcomes. Computed tomography of the head is nearly 100% sensitive for subarachnoid hemorrhage in the first six hours after symptom onset, but CSF analysis may be required if there is a delay in presentation or if imaging findings are equivocal. Xanthochromia and an elevated red blood cell count are characteristic CSF findings in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis can mimic central nervous system infection. It has a poor prognosis, and large-volume CSF cytology is diagnostic.

- Most people recover from bacterial meningitis if managed properly.
- Those who recover can have permanent disabilities.
- Learn when to see medical care for meningitis. What it is Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective lining of the brain and spinal cord that can be caused by a bacterial infection. Several bacteria can cause meningitis. Leading U. S. causes vary by risk factors and include: Streptococcus pneumoniae
- Group B Streptococcus Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Neisseria meningitidis Listeria monocytogenes Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes tuberculosis or TB, is a less common cause. Symptoms People with bacterial meningitis usually have typical meningitis symptoms. When to seek emergency care Complications Complications can include seizures, coma, and death.

Many of these bacteria are associated with another serious illness, sepsis. Keep ReadingSepsis. Risk factors Certain factors increase a person's risk for getting bacterial meningitis. Age Some causes are more likely to affect certain age groups:

### Tuberculous meningitis across the lifespan [^115sMTBL]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL AND RADIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

The international research consensus criteria by Marais et al is commonly used in research to categories tuberculous meningitis diagnosis as definite, probable, or possible. The criteria are based on typical clinical, radiological, and CSF findings. Common clinical characteristics include long duration of symptoms (≥ 5 days), systemic symptoms of tuberculosis, history of tuberculosis contact, and focal neurology (including a decreased level of consciousness) (Figure 2). Typical radiological findings include hydrocephalus, basal meningeal enhancement, infarcts, and tuberculomas, and CSF findings include an increased cell count (10–500 per μL) with lymphocyte predominance (> 50%), increased protein (> 1 g/L), and decreased glucose (< 2.2 mmol/L) (Figure 2). Definite tuberculous meningitis is diagnosed based on successful isolation of M. tuberculosis from CSF using either culture, nucleic amplification tests, or microbiological staining. Other diagnostic scoring tools are also available, but their performance varies across populations.

Figure 2.
Commonly reported characteristics of tuberculous meningitis. Clinical characteristics include fever, vomiting, a decreased level of consciousness, malnourishment, and seizures, headache, meningism, and signs of pulmonary tuberculosis. Imaging findings often show hydrocephalus, basal meningeal enhancement, and infarcts. Cerebrospinal fluid characteristics include elevated white blood cell count, lymphocyte predominance, and increased protein. Created in BioRender. Rohlwink, U. (2025)

We have not performed a formal meta-analysis, and studies were not selected on uniform criteria, therefore no absolute conclusions regarding differences in these characteristics between adults and children can be drawn. Table 1 reports the range of reported frequencies for these key tuberculous meningitis characteristics to describe possible trends and stimulate further research.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^1128Gooq]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The mechanism of hypoglycorrhachia-low CSF glucose-in meningitis remains unknown. We sought to evaluate the relative contribution of CSF inflammation vs microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) in lowering CSF glucose levels.

Methods

We retrospectively categorized CSF profiles into microbial and aseptic meningitis and analyzed CSF leukocyte count, glucose, and protein concentrations. We assessed the relationship between these markers using multivariate and stratified linear regression analysis for initial and repeated CSF sampling. We also calculated the receiver operating characteristics of CSF glucose and CSF-to-serum glucose ratios to presumptively diagnose microbial meningitis.

Results

We found that increasing levels of CSF inflammation were associated with decreased CSF glucose levels in the microbial but not aseptic category. Moreover, elevated CSF protein levels correlated more strongly than the leukocyte count with low CSF glucose levels on initial (R² = 36%, p < 0.001) and repeated CSF sampling (R² = 46%, p < 0.001). Hypoglycorrhachia (< 40 mg/dL) was observed in 50.1% of microbial cases, but only 9.6% of aseptic cases, most of which were neurosarcoidosis. Absolute CSF glucose and CSF-to-serum glucose ratios had similar low sensitivity and moderate-to-high specificity in diagnosing microbial meningitis at thresholds commonly used.

Conclusions

The main driver of hypoglycorrhachia appears to be a combination of microbial meningitis with moderate to high degrees of CSF inflammation and proteins, suggesting that the presence of microorganisms capable of catabolizing glucose is a determinant of hypoglycorrhachia in meningitis. A major notable exception is neurosarcoidosis. Low CSF glucose and CSF-to-serum glucose ratios are useful markers for the diagnosis of microbial meningitis.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^113yiBLY]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Second, to add longitudinal information on individual patients and assess the validity of following CSF glucose as a marker for response to treatment, we checked whether a linear relationship between logP and G was conserved over time. For each repeat CSF sample obtained between 1 week and 1 month of the initial CSF sample (n = 83 samples in 52 patients), we plotted the change in glucose (deltaG) vs the change in logP compared with its corresponding initial CSF sample: Third, to complement analysis of the average trend (linear regression) with an analysis of the extremes and to quantify the performance of CSF glucose and the glucose ratio in diagnosing microbial meningitis, we performed a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. True-positive rate and false-positive rate were calculated for detection thresholds on CSF glucose or the glucose ratio incrementing in 100 linear steps over the full range of values. All values are reported as mean ± SD, unless otherwise specified, and significance was accepted at p < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction.

### Bacterial meningitis in the absence of pleocytosis in children: a systematic review [^111rCKzu]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

One of the main features of bacterial meningitis is pleocytosis. However, when children with meningitis present within hours of onset of symptoms, there is the possibility that the meninges are not yet sufficiently inflamed to lead to a raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell count. A systematic search was done to identify published studies reporting children with culture- or polymerase chain reaction-proven bacterial meningitis in the absence of pleocytosis. We identified 26 studies describing 62 children (18 neonates). In those in whom fever duration was specified, 32 (80%) of 40 had a fever for less than or equal to 24 hours before lumbar puncture (LP). In those in whom the glucose level was reported, it was normal in 14 (82%) of 17 neonates and 33 (80%) of 41 older infants and children. The protein level was normal in 8 (44%) of 17 neonates and 32 (80%) of 40 older infants and children. Twelve of the 62 children had a Gram stain of their CSF and this was positive in 2 (17%). Simultaneous blood cultures were positive in 5 (28%) of 18 neonates and 21 (68%) of 31 older infants and children. There was no association between the absence of pleocytosis and particular bacteria. All of the 10 children who had a second LP had an abnormal CSF including pleocytosis. These findings indicate that the absence of pleocytosis does not exclude bacterial meningitis reliably and should be interpreted in the context of the duration of illness. CSF samples, particularly those from cases with relatively short symptom duration, should be cultured even when the cell count and biochemistry are normal. A second LP can be helpful when bacterial meningitis is suspected despite a normal initial CSF.

### Typhus group Rickettsia community-acquired bacterial central nervous system infections: we must think outside the box! [^112ekESP]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

Typhus group rickettsiosis (TGR), caused by Rickettsia typhi and Rickettsia prowazekii, are globally distributed vector-borne diseases with increasing cases. Diagnosis is usually clinical, confirmed by seroconversion of IgG antibodies. Human infection occurs in diverse geographic areas with some developing CNS infection characterized by fever, headache, meningismus, and/or focal signs - usually beyond the first week of initial symptomatology. Seizures and other CNS manifestations have been observed. When untreated, infection may result in neurologic sequelae and even death. This study presents a systematic review of all documented cases of Rickettsia typhi meningoencephalitis published since 2015 with the addition of five cases of TGR in South Coastal Texas, USA. This review followed the guidelines outlined in PRISMA. A schematic explanation of the pathophysiology is offered. CSF may present with high opening pressure, mild to moderate pleocytosis, mildly elevated protein levels, and low csf/serum glucose ratio, or normal findings. Meningeal enhancement, intracranial hypertension, and focal abnormalities have been described in imaging studies, but can be normal. Treatment with doxycycline leads to prompt resolution of symptoms. Failure to initiate early empiric treatment can lead to serious consequences. The study recommends routine testing for TGR in patients from endemic areas with classical symptoms when other diagnoses are inconclusive or in cases with atypical presentations. The authors advocate for incorporating empiric treatment for murine typhus into community-acquired bacterial meningitis guidelines in endemic areas; and stress the importance of enhancing laboratory diagnostic capabilities in public health entities world-wide. Further studies of community acquired mengingoencephalitis caused by TGR are highly encouraged.

Ventricular or lumbar drains — diagnostic definitions and classification: In patients with lumbar or ventricular drains, definite infection is defined as a positive CSF culture (obtained from the ventricular or lumbar catheter) associated with CSF pleocytosis, and progressively decreasing CSF glucose and increasing CSF protein with advancing CSF pleocytosis in the absence of a positive CSF culture or positive Gram stain is considered a suspected infection in the absence of another source of infection. The proposed modification for patients with ventricular drains defines contamination as an isolated positive CSF culture or Gram stain with normal CSF cell count and glucose and protein concentrations and with lack of clinical symptoms suspicious for ventriculitis or meningitis; colonization as multiple positive CSF cultures or Gram stain with normal CSF cell count and glucose and protein concentrations and with lack of clinical symptoms suspicious for ventriculitis or meningitis; and infection as single or multiple positive CSF cultures with CSF pleocytosis and/or hypoglycorrhachia, or an increasing cell count, and clinical symptoms suspicious for ventriculitis or meningitis.

### Dilemmas in the diagnosis of acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis [^115birFF]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Rapid diagnosis and treatment of acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis reduces mortality and neurological sequelae, but can be delayed by atypical presentation, assessment of lumbar puncture safety, and poor sensitivity of standard diagnostic microbiology. Thus, diagnostic dilemmas are common in patients with suspected acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis. History and physical examination alone are sometimes not sufficient to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. Lumbar puncture is an essential investigation, but can be delayed by brain imaging. Results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination should be interpreted carefully, because CSF abnormalities vary according to the cause, patient's age and immune status, and previous treatment. Diagnostic prediction models that use a combination of clinical findings, with or without test results, can help to distinguish acute bacterial meningitis from other causes, but these models are not infallible. We review the dilemmas in the diagnosis of acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis, and focus on the roles of clinical assessment and CSF examination.

### Pentraxin 3: a novel biomarker in pediatric central nervous system infections [^1175CkMn]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Bacterial meningitis (Group A) inclusion criteria

Group A was further subdivided into 2 groups (with known and unknown pathogens).

Bacterial meningitis with known pathogens

Children with clinical manifestations suggesting bacterial meningitis, combined with one or more of the following criteria:

a CSF cell count ≥ 250 cells/mm³ with a dominance (≥ 60%) of polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
b Positive CSF culture.
c A positive blood culture, along with one or more CSF abnormalities indicated as follows: protein > 100 mg/dL and CSF glucose < 40 mg/dL.
d Bacteria were observed in the CSF Gram staining.

Bacterial meningitis with an unknown organism

The clinical criteria outlined above, along with the following CSF parameters, were taken into account: > 10 × 10⁶ cells/L with a dominance of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, low CSF glucose (< 40 mg/dL), and high protein content > 100 mg/dL. In addition, CSF samples may be turbid and have high opening pressure. This group of patients had negative microscopy, blood, and CSF cultures.

Aseptic meningoencephalitis (Group B) inclusion criteria

The CSF aspect was clear with a normal opening pressure. Cerebrospinal leukocytes > 10 × 10⁶ cells/L with a mononuclear dominance with mildly elevated protein, mildly decreased glucose concentration, and no alternative diagnosis were considered (with serum laboratory findings indicating a viral infection and a complete clinical cure on antiviral therapies). Bacterial meningitis was excluded by microscopy, blood, and CSF cultures. Aseptic meningoencephalitis might be caused by various pathogens:

- Viruses (such as Herpes, Varicella, Arbo-, and Entervirusus).
- Bacteria (such as Mycobacteria, Rickettsia, Mycoplasma, and Listeria Monocytogenes).
- Fungi (such as Cryptococci).
- Parasitic (such as Acanthamoeba species).

Methodology

Comprehensive clinical, demographic, biochemical, and bacteriological data from the blood and CSF were obtained. Short-term follow-up for neurological consequences was conducted, with results assessed in the month following discharge. Clinical outcomes were categorized at both discharge and follow-up as follows: complete recovery, neurological sequelae, or death.

A full history was taken, and a physical evaluation for focal neurological deficits was part of the follow-up hospital visit for neurological sequelae. Questions regarding neurological symptoms were also asked. Blood and CSF samples were collected on the day of admission.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for febrile infant, more specifically with respect to CSF analysis, AAP 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining CSFs analysis (WBC, differential, protein, glucose, Gram stain) and bacterial culture in well-appearing febrile infants 29–60 days of age. Obtain testing for enterovirus if CSF pleocytosis is observed or during enterovirus season if any obtained inflammatory marker is positive.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^111h83sQ]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The strengths of this study include a relatively large sample size as compared to previously published data that encompassed a wide variety of confirmed etiologies including more recently recognized entities in the aseptic category, such as meningitides related to immunologic disturbances. The baseline characteristics were fairly balanced aside from an overrepresentation of men in the microbial category that we could not explain, as there are no reports suggesting a sex difference in this disease. As planned, the microbial category encompassed cases with a history of neurosurgery that may have had an impact on the blood-brain barrier permeability and thus bias glucose measurements. However, we feel that this is part of the variability of the clinical setting and serves to increase the generalizability of our findings. Indeed, repeating the analysis excluding cases with a history of neurosurgery yielded the same results (supplemental data).

In conclusion, the data presented here shed light on meningitis pathophysiology by suggesting that the presence of a pathogen and the induced changes in CSF milieu, rather than inflammation alone, underlie hypoglycorrhachia. The practical correlate is that aseptic meningitis, even with a high level of leukocytes, should remain a diagnosis of exclusion if low — especially very low (< 30 mg/dL) — CSF glucose is present. Our data also support trending CSF glucose as a marker of treatment response and suggest that CSF glucose alone is a relatively specific marker of microbial meningitis, although the CSF-to-serum ratio may be better in borderline cases. The early assessment of CSF glucose remains a vital component of the workup when a patient presents with signs of meningitis, as it can help distinguish between microbial meningitis requiring antimicrobial therapy and aseptic cases requiring very different treatment.

### Emergency department management of meningitis and encephalitis [^1175ctfn]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Bacterial meningitis and viral encephalitis are infectious disease emergencies that can cause significant patient morbidity and mortality. Clinicians use epidemiologic, historical, and physical examination findings to identify patients at risk for these infections, and central nervous system (CNS) imaging and lumbar puncture (LP) may be needed to further evaluate for these diagnoses. The diagnosis of bacterial meningitis can be challenging, as patients often lack some of the characteristic findings of this disease with presentations that overlap with more common disorders seen in the emergency department. This article addresses considerations in clinical evaluation, need for CNS imaging before LP, interpretation of cerebrospinal fluid results, standards for and effects of timely antibiotic administration, and recommendations for specific antimicrobial therapy and corticosteroids.

Key messages

- 	The paper describes a patient that developed, after surgery for a chordoma of the clivus, three episodes of recurrent meningitis due to Ps. aeruginosa O12.

- 	Episodes were monitored by biochemical and bacteriological daily analysis of CSF withdrawn in parallel from lumbar space and ventricles by external lumbar and ventricular damamge.

- 	We observed a permanent ventricular-to-lumbar CSF gradients of leukocytes, protein and glucose that increased during the acute phase of meningitis, with the greatest amplitude observed when bacteria was present in both ventricular and lumbar CSF.

- 	This may suggest a greater extent of meningeal inflammation in lumbar than in ventricular region

### Tuberculous meningitis: pathogenesis, immune responses, diagnostic challenges, and the potential of biomarker-based approaches [^111f3wnb]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The methods currently used for diagnosing TBM in children are unreliable. Symptoms and signs of the disease are not specific, and the tests used for diagnosis of the disease are highly invasive and time-consuming. General diagnostic tests, including CSF white cell count (WBC) with differential, total protein, and glucose level measurements, are performed for the diagnosis of meningitis. Typical CSF findings in TBM include increased total protein, decreased CSF-to-serum glucose ratio, and increased total WBC with lymphocytic pleocytosis. Bacterial meningitis is characterized by mild-to-marked elevated total protein, mild-to-marked decreased CSF-to-serum glucose ratio, and increased total WBC with neutrophil predominance. In viral meningitis, there are normal-to-elevated levels of total protein, usually normal CSF-to-serum glucose ratio, and minimal total WBC, with lymphocyte predominance; while fungal meningitis is characterized by elevated total protein, low CSF-to-serum glucose ratio, and minimal total WBC with lymphocyte predominance. Various diagnostic algorithms that take into account the symptoms and signs, in conjunction with results from laboratory and imaging tests, have been suggested for use in classifying individuals suspected of having TBM, at least for research purposes. The clinical management of TBM is challenging due to an incomplete understanding of the immunopathogenesis underlying the disease. Further investigations are required to update and refresh the body of knowledge for management of the disease, including the development of effective TB drugs, host-directed therapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. In the current review, we summarize evidence published in the literature on different diagnostic approaches for TBM in children, the pathogenesis and immunology of TBM, and the recent advances in the search for novel approaches, mainly biomarkers, in the diagnosis of the disease.

### Pyrexia in a young infant-is height of fever associated with serious bacterial infection? [^115VUJun]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Variables – investigations

The following investigations were performed following admission in the well-looking infant who had 2 separate readings of fever ≥ 38.0 °C (including the temperature from triage) or a single temperature reading of ≥ 38.5 °C, or earlier if there were clinical findings of an unwell infant: full blood count (FBC) – looking specifically at the total white blood cell (WBC) count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), haemoglobin levels, platelets, and the C-reactive protein (CRP). Bacteraemia was defined as bacterial growth in blood cultures (excluding common contaminants such as coagulase-negative staphylococcus). Urine for analysis and culture were routinely performed. Urinary tract infections were defined as a positive urine culture with a growth of a single bacteria of more than 10⁵ colony forming units (CFU)/L from a mid-stream urine sample, or 10⁴ CFU/L from a catheterized specimen. Lumbar puncture, CSF analysis and culture were performed when clinically indicated as decided by the attending physician. The diagnosis of bacterial meningitis was made following a positive CSF culture, or if the CSF fluid was suggestive of a bacterial meningitis such as significant pleocytosis (> 1000 cells/mm³), low CSF glucose or low CSF glucose to serum ratio (< 0.4), high CSF protein levels (> 100 mg/dL), in the absence of a positive culture. We included the latter because bacteria growth from CSF culture depends on the amount of bacteria present (which may be transient) and other supportive biochemical features on CSF analysis are vital for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. In specific cases, cultures would be obtained from stool, wounds or abscesses. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were also obtained from infants with respiratory symptoms to test for common viral respiratory infections. In infants with hemodynamic instability or evidence of shock, resuscitation with fluid resuscitation, consideration for inotropic support and emergency intravenous antibiotics were initiated in the ED.

### Cerebrospinal fluid characteristics of infants who present to the emergency department with fever: establishing normal values by week of age [^1132pM7z]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

BACKGROUND This study describes differences in the values of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell (WBC), glucose, and protein counts in infants less than 60 days of age with fever who were not proven to have viral or bacterial meningitis.

Methods

Three independent retrospective medical record reviews were conducted using a population of infants less than 60 days of age who presented to the Emergency Department with fever. Full-term infants were included if a lumbar puncture was performed within 24 hours of admittance and bacterial or viral meningitis was not identified as the cause of fever.

Results

A total of 1091 infants were included and grouped by week of age. Significant trends were found for CSF WBC and CSF protein with the highest values observed during the first week of life. Mean for CSF WBC was 8.63 cells/mm for infants aged 0 to 1 week and decreased for each age group ending with infants 8 weeks of age having a mean of 2.22 cell/mm. For CSF protein, a similar trend was observed. No significant differences were found for CSF glucose.

Conclusions

Significant differences exist for infants by week of age for CSF WBC and CSF protein. These values can be used to assist in interpreting laboratory findings and making management decisions for infants less than 60 days of age.

Pleocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid is a key finding for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Bacterial meningitis presenting in normal cerebrospinal fluid is rare in adult patients. We describe the case of a patient with pneumococcal meningitis without cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. This case suggests that immediate antibiotic therapy should be started when meningitis is suspected, even with normal cerebrospinal fluid findings. (See Figure.)

### Case report: greater meningeal inflammation in lumbar than in ventricular region in human bacterial meningitis [^117XYA1z]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our case report followed ventriculo-lumbar CSF gradients in leukocytes, protein and glucose concentration during two episodes of post-operative recurrent meningitis due to Ps. aeruginosa O12. It showed the presence of a rostrocaudal gradient of leukocytes and protein and an inverse gradient of glucose. This confirmed previous work that showed greater leukocytes and protein concentration in lumbar than in ventricular CSF in patients with a central neural system infection, mostly after neurosurgery. However, patients from those studies each had only one pair (ventricular and lumbar) of measurements within a 24-hour interval and glucose concentration in CSF was measured in only six patients.

We extend previous studies by showing that the greatest amplitude of ventricular-to-lumbar gradients for all measured parameters (leukocytes, protein and glucose concentration) were seen during the very acute phase of meningitis, when bacteria were present in the meningeal cavity. The mechanisms of such ventricular-to-lumbar gradients are unknown. Our data strongly suggest a compartmentalization of meningeal inflammation in the ventricular and lumbar area. Indeed, similar bacteria, here Ps. aeroginusa O12, in similar quantities, seemed to induce a greater alteration of meningeal permeability with greater leukocyte and protein concentrations and a lower glucose concentration in the lumbar than the ventricular CSF region. Although still debatable, the decrease in glucose concentration in CSF seems to be less related to a 'leukocyte-induced glucose consumption' but rather to a meningeal shift of glucose metabolism to anaerobic glycolysis, as indicated by the concomitant increase in CSF lactate concentration and/or a decrease in meningeal glucose transport; the latter is probably directly related to the degree of meningeal inflammation. An alternative explanation of the existence of a rostrocaudal gradient of leukocytes is that leukocytes from ventricular CSF might fall by gravity to lumbar CSF. However, as explained above, a greater concentration of leukocytes cannot by itself explain a greater protein concentration and a lower glucose concentration in lumbar CSF. Accordingly, our study suggests that meningeal inflammation was greater in the lumbar than the ventricular region in our patient with CSF infection due to a pharyngeal fistula.

### Proposal for a new score-based approach to improve efficiency of diagnostic laboratory workflow for acute bacterial meningitis in adults [^113QDWts]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Microbiological tests on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) utilize a common urgent-care procedure that does not take into account the chemical and cytological characteristics of the CSF, resulting sometimes in an unnecessary use of human and diagnostic resources. The aim of this study was to retrospectively validate a simple scoring system (bacterial meningitis-Careggi score [BM-CASCO]) based on blood and CSF sample chemical/cytological parameters for evaluating the probability of acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) in adults. BM-CASCO (range, 0 to 6) was defined by the following parameters: CSF cell count, CSF protein levels, CSF lactate levels, CSF glucose-to-serum glucose ratio, and peripheral neutrophil count. BM-CASCO was retrospectively calculated for 784 cases of suspected ABM in adult subjects observed during a four-and-a-half-year-period (2010 to 2014) at the emergency department (ED) of a large tertiary-care teaching hospital in Italy. Among the 28 confirmed ABM cases (3.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent cause (16 cases). All ABM cases showed a BM-CASCO value of ≥ 3. Most negative cases (591/756) exhibited a BM-CASCO value of ≤ 1, which was adopted in our laboratory as a cutoff to not proceed with urgent microbiological analysis of CSF in cases of suspected ABM in adults. During a subsequent 1-year follow-up, the introduction of the BM-CASCO in the diagnostic workflow of ABM in adults resulted in a significant decrease in unnecessary microbiological analysis, with no false negatives. In conclusion, BM-CASCO appears to be an accurate and simple scoring system for optimization of the microbiological diagnostic workflow of ABM in adults.

### Meta-analysis of cerebrospinal fluid cell count and biochemistry to diagnose meningitis in infants aged [^114Nz4ut]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell (WBC) count, protein, and glucose (cytochemistry) are performed to aid in the diagnosis of meningitis in young infants. However, studies have reported varying diagnostic accuracies. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of CSF cytochemistry in infants below 90 days and determined the certainty of evidence.

Study Design

We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Ovid, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Scopus databases in August 2021. We included studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of CSF cytochemistry compared with CSF culture, Gram stain, or polymerase chain reaction in neonates and young infants < 90 days with suspected meningitis. We pooled data using the hierarchical summary receiver operator characteristic (ROC) model.

Results

Of the 10,720 unique records, 16 studies were eligible for meta-analysis, with a cumulative sample size of 31,695 (15 studies) for WBC, 12,936 (11 studies) for protein, and 1,120 (4 studies) for glucose. The median (Q 1, Q 3) specificities of WBC, protein, and glucose were 87 (82, 91), 89 (81, 94), and 91% (76, 99), respectively. The pooled sensitivities (95% confidence interval [CI]) at median specificity of WBC count, protein, and glucose were 90 (88, 92), 92 (89, 94), and 71% (54, 85), respectively. The area (95% CI) under ROC curves were 0.89 (0.87, 0.90), 0.87 (0.85, 0.88), and 0.81 (0.74, 0.88) for WBC, protein, and glucose, respectively. There was an unclear/high risk of bias and applicability concern in most studies. Overall certainty of the evidence was moderate. A bivariate model-based analysis to estimate the diagnostic accuracy at specific thresholds could not be conducted due to a paucity of data.

Conclusion

CSF WBC and protein have good diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of meningitis in infants below 90 days of age. CSF glucose has good specificity but poor sensitivity. However, we could not identify enough studies to define an optimal threshold for the positivity of these tests.

Key Points

· Median specificity of CSF leucocyte count, protein and glucose are similar in young infants. · At median specificity, CSF leukocyte count and protein are more sensitive than glucose. · Owing to inadequate data, bivariate modelling to suggest optimal diagnostic thresholds is not possible.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^116e5Six]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

METHODS

Samples.

We included 225 inflammatory CSF (pleocytosis ≥ 6 × 10⁶ cell/L) obtained by lumbar puncture at the time of clinical presentation into the main analysis and 83 additional repeat samples belonging to the same patients (cutoff: 7 days to 1 month) into the longitudinal analyses (supplemental information and figure e-1). The University of California, San Francisco Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol and granted a waiver of informed consent for retrospective chart review with no patient contact.

Variables.

Absolute CSF glucose (mg/dL, n = 225) and CSF-to-serum glucose ratios (abbreviated glucose ratio, with a cutoff for serum glucose within 12 hours of CSF, n = 156, 69.0% and 67.0% of the microbial and aseptic cases, respectively) were tabulated alongside CSF protein, CSF cell count and differential (missing for 13), and serum leukocyte count (obtained within 24 hours of CSF sampling), age at presentation, sex, HIV and diabetes status, and whether the meningitis was immediately (postoperative) or remotely (shunt infections) associated with neurosurgery. In the case of CSF samples with a high number of red blood cells, we reviewed the chart to check whether the lumbar puncture was traumatic and accordingly selected data coming from the last tube collected (aseptic, n = 9 and microbial, n = 8). We dichotomized the diagnoses into 2 groups: microbial and aseptic meningitis (supplemental information for details). All statistical analyses were performed on the entire database on absolute CSF glucose and repeated for the subset of patients on the glucose ratio to ensure congruent results.

Conclusions

The present meta-analysis study indicated that for discrimination of BM from AM, the CSF lactate concentration is a good single indicator and a better marker compared to other conventional markers including CSF glucose, CSF/plasma glucose quotient, CSF protein, and CSF total number of leukocytes. Cost-effectiveness studies should be performed to investigate the economic impact of using this technique as a routine assay in hospital to distinguish BM from AM.

### Cerebrospinal fluid analysis [^11342pRF]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Lumbar puncture is frequently performed in primary care. Properly interpreted tests can make cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) a key tool in the diagnosis of a variety of diseases. Proper evaluation of CSF depends on knowing which tests to order, normal ranges for the patient's age, and the test's limitations. Protein level, opening pressure, and CSF-to-serum glucose ratio vary with age. Xanthochromia is most often caused by the presence of blood, but several other conditions should be considered. The presence of blood can be a reliable predictor of subarachnoid hemorrhage but takes several hours to develop. The three-tube method, commonly used to rule out a central nervous system hemorrhage after a "traumatic tap", is not completely reliable. Red blood cells in CSF caused by a traumatic tap or a subarachnoid hemorrhage artificially increase the white blood cell count and protein level, thereby confounding the diagnosis. Diagnostic uncertainty can be decreased by using accepted corrective formulas. White blood cell differential may be misleading early in the course of meningitis, because more than 10 percent of cases with bacterial infection will have an initial lymphocytic predominance and viral meningitis may initially be dominated by neutrophils. Culture is the gold standard for determining the causative organism in meningitis. However, polymerase chain reaction is much faster and more sensitive in some circumstances. Latex agglutination, with high sensitivity but low specificity, may have a role in managing partially treated meningitis. To prove herpetic, cryptococcal, or tubercular infection, special staining techniques or collection methods may be required.

Chronic meningitis is a syndrome characterised by persistent and progressive signs and symptoms of meningitis along with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis and elevated protein that fail to improve over 4 weeks. A detailed and careful history and examination is required along with CSF parameters to guide a clinician towards the aetiology of the problem. Neuroimaging modalities have become a useful tool in the quest for a diagnosis in such cases.

### Cerebrospinal fluid metabolome in central nervous system infections: a study of diagnostic accuracy [^113sD25i]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Population and Data Collection

For this study we included adult patients from 3 prospective cohort studies, the PACEM (Pediatric and Adult Causes of Encephalitis and Meningitis) study, the I‐PACE (Improving Prognosis by Using Innovative Methods to Diagnose Causes of Encephalitis) study, and the MeninGene study. The PACEM study (2012–2015) served as a single‐center pilot study for the ongoing multicenter cohort study, the I‐PACE study, which started in 2017. Detailed information on the methods and the study population have been described previously. Both studies were conducted in the Netherlands, and included patients aged ≥ 16 years, suspected of a CNS infection, who underwent a diagnostic lumbar puncture. The MeninGene study started in 2006, and is an ongoing nationwide cohort study of community‐acquired bacterial meningitis in the Netherlands. Briefly, patients aged ≥ 16 years were included with either a positive CSF culture or a positive CSF bacterial antigen test, a positive bacterial CSF PCR and/or a positive blood culture in combination with an individual CSF predictor for bacterial meningitis (CSF leukocytes > 2,000 cells/mm³, CSF granulocytes > 1,180 cells/mm³, glucose < 1.9 mmol/L, CSF serum glucose ratio < 0.23, or protein concentration > 2.2 gram/L). Exclusion criteria were similar across all studies, and consisted of neurosurgery or severe head trauma (1–3 months) prior to the lumbar puncture, the presence of a neurosurgical or neurostimulator device, or a diagnosis of hospital‐acquired bacterial meningitis (defined as bacterial meningitis occurring during admission or within 1 week after discharge).

### Accuracy of the cerebrospinal fluid results to differentiate bacterial from non bacterial meningitis, in case of negative gram-stained smear [^116xiVfs]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of various laboratory results for differential diagnosis of bacterial (BM) and nonbacterial meningitis (NBM) with negative initial Gram stain.

Design and Setting

A prospective multicenter study was conducted in the emergency departments of 3 teaching hospitals.

Participants and Methods

Consecutive adult patients with a diagnosis of meningitis based on compatible clinical features and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture findings with a CSF leukocyte count greater than 5/mm³ were included in the study. Symptoms, examination findings, data from laboratory results, including CSF results and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and clinical outcome were assessed.

Results

One hundred fifty-one patients (age, 35 ± 15 years) with confirmed meningitis were admitted: 133 with NBM and 18 with BM. CRP and procalcitonin (PCT) levels, CSF white cell and absolute neutrophil counts, and CSF glucose/blood glucose and CSF protein levels were significantly higher in the BM group. However, as diagnostic indicators of BM, none of these variables except PCT was more efficient than that of the emergency physician. Values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21–0.82), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.47–0.92), 0.18 (95% CI, 0.0–0.43), 0.70 (95%CI, 0.30–0.89), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.58–0.92), and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.83–1.0) for CSF leukocyte count, percentage of CSF leukocyte, CSF/blood glucose ratio, CSF protein level, serum CRP, and serum PCT (P < .05 vs CRP), respectively.

Conclusion

CSF results have a modest role in distinguishing BM from NBM in a negative Gram stain for bacteria. PCT serum levels seem to be an excellent predictor of BM.

### Case report: greater meningeal inflammation in lumbar than in ventricular region in human bacterial meningitis [^112y127Z]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Differences in the composition of ventricular and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) based on single pairs of samples have previously been described. We describe a patient that developed post-surgical recurrent meningitis monitored by daily biochemical and bacteriological CSF analysis, simultaneously withdrawn from lumbar space and ventricles. A 20-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to the ICU after a resection of a chordoma that extended from the sphenoidal sinus to the anterior face of C2. CSF was continuously leaking into the pharyngeal cavity after surgery, and three episodes of recurrent meningitis, all due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa O12, occurred. Our case showed permanent ventricular-to-lumbar CSF gradients of leukocytes, protein and glucose that were increased during the acute phase of meningitis, with the greatest amplitude being observed when bacteria were present in both ventricular and lumbar CSF. This might suggest a greater extent of meningeal inflammation in the lumbar than in the ventricular region. Our case also showed that the increase in intravenous antibiotics (cefepim from 8 to 12 g/day and ciprofloxacine from 1.2 to 2.4 g/day) led to an increase in concentration in plasma but not in CSF.

### Normal values for cerebrospinal fluid in neonates: a systematic review [^117EQ8HN]. Neonatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of neonatal meningitis often rests on microscopic and biochemical findings in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). There is ongoing uncertainty about age-related normal values for CSF findings in neonates, and many previous studies have included infants in whom antibiotics were administered before lumbar puncture or in whom viral meningitis was not excluded.

Methods

A systematic search was done using MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify original studies which investigated CSF normal values in either healthy neonates or febrile neonates in whom bacterial and viral meningitis were reliably excluded.

Results

We identified seven studies investigating 270 term and 96 preterm neonates. There were minimal differences between preterm and term neonates in the CSF white blood cell (WBC) count and glucose concentration. In contrast, the CSF neutrophil count and protein concentration were influenced by gestational and chronological age. In the four studies that reported individual patient data, in 95% of cases the CSF WBC count was < 12 cells/μL in preterm and < 10 cells/μL in term neonates, the neutrophil count was < 16 and 8 cells/μL, and the protein concentration was < 210 and 110 mg/dL, respectively.

Conclusion

The normal range for CSF parameters in neonates is different to that in older infants, and some parameters are influenced by gestational and chronological age. CSF parameters alone are not sufficiently reliable to exclude meningitis.

### Cerebrospinal fluid / blood glucose ratio as an indicator for bacterial meningitis [^112KXb8C]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial meningitis is an emergent disease requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment with appropriate antimicrobials. Although the lumbar puncture is widely used as a diagnostic tool for bacterial meningitis, it remains unclear which value in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis in emergency laboratory tests precisely predicts the presence of bacterial meningitis.

Methods

This is a single-center, retrospective review of medical records to determine which emergency laboratory CSF test results are useful for predicting bacterial meningitis. The diagnosis of meningitis is made when the white blood cell count in CSF exceeds 5 cells/μL, while the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis additionally requires the growth of a pathogen from a CSF culture or the identification of a pathogen in Gram staining of CSF specimen.

Results

We identified 15 patients with bacterial meningitis and 129 patients with aseptic meningitis. While neutrophil-predominant pleocytosis and a decreased glucose level in CSF can predict the presence of bacterial meningitis, the CSF/blood glucose ratio is more precise (optimal cut-off = 0.36, sensitivity = 92.9%, specificity = 92.9%, area under the curve = .97) even after administration of antimicrobials prior to examination in the emergency department.

Conclusion

This study suggests that the CSF/blood glucose ratio may be a better single indicator for bacterial meningitis. Since the CSF glucose and blood glucose values are promptly and easily obtained from a lumbar puncture, the CSF/blood glucose ratio should be considered as a timely diagnostic indicator of bacterial meningitis. It may also help exclude the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis especially in cases in which no microorganisms can be cultured.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^1168oJqi]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Hypoglycorrhachia — low CSF glucose — has been recognized since the 1930s, as a critical clinical laboratory finding with the potential to influence treatment of meningitis and is therefore reported within 1 hour by most laboratories. Marked hypoglycorrhachia has traditionally been viewed as a predictor of microbial meningitis (caused by bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and parasites, but not viruses) in both adults and childrenand heralds poor outcomes including death. The differential diagnosis for hypoglycorrhachia includes not only microbial but also neoplastic causes as well as select primary inflammatory meningitides such as neurosarcoidosis. While neoplastic meningitis can usually be suspected when it presents in the context of a known malignancy, microbial and aseptic etiologies (viral, chemical, and autoimmune) can be difficult to distinguish on clinical grounds alone. To date, and more than a hundred years after the first observations, hypoglycorrhachia remains an important CSF marker for etiologic diagnosis, as serology, microbiology, and cytology have low sensitivity and can take days until results are available. Finding the etiology is key, as immediate initiation of the correct targeted treatment against specific pathogens improves prognosis.

Despite intense experimental meningitis research in the 1960s, the pathophysiology underlying CSF glucose depletion remains controversial. Because hypoglycorrhachia is associated with higher degrees of CSF inflammation, it has long been debated whether inflammation or microbial load is most responsible for depleting CSF glucose. Commonly cited mechanisms include increased glucose catabolism by leukocytes, microorganisms, or the brain parenchyma, as well as altered glucose transport across inflamed meninges. The introduction of bacteria in cisternal CSF decreased glucose within a few hours, arguing in favor of direct microbial catabolism, but the effect was not confirmed in leukopenic dogs, suggesting that the host inflammatory response is also necessary to cause hypoglycorrhachia. Induction of chemical meningitis did not alter CSF glucose, showing that inflammation alone may not be sufficient and suggesting the presence of a synergy with microbial metabolism. Finally, the uptake of radiolabeled glucose was increased in neutrophils derived from purulent CSF, showing that they contribute to glucose depletion. To our knowledge, these experimental results have never been correlated with large human clinical data sets, despite recent advances in the understanding of immune mechanisms at play in meningitis.

Key messages

- The diagnostic accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate assay for differential diagnosis between bacterial meningitis and aseptic meningitis was excellent with Q value of 0.9451 and area under the curve of 0.9840.

- CSF lactate was a better marker for distinguishing bacterial meningitis from aseptic meningitis compared to other conventional markers including CSF glucose, CSF/plasma glucose quotient, CSF protein, and CSF total number of leukocytes

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^113DzNiq]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Patients and CSF samples.

We included 115 aseptic and 110 microbial meningitis cases with similar demographics (tables 1 and 2). Both included a minority of pediatric cases (10.4% vs 10.9%), with ages ranging from 2 to 88 and 5–90 years, respectively. Microbial cases were more likely to be men, to have a history of neurosurgery and to be HIV infected. As expected in the microbial category, the white blood cell count was slightly increased, average absolute CSF glucose and glucose ratios were decreased, and, conversely, CSF inflammatory markers were increased. These variables were tested as potential confounders in the model below.

### Performance of a predictive rule to distinguish bacterial and viral meningitis [^113NCVTP]. The Journal of Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Although diagnostic performance has recently improved by using new diagnostic methodologies, acute patient management is usually initiated after considering only fairly elementary findings of CSF examination. Using these early findings it is often difficult to distinguish between bacterial and aseptic (viral) meningitis. In order to help distinguish these two categories, scoring tools have been proposed that are more or less complex and validated.

Methods

The aim of this study was to establish a simple scoring tool and compare it to other available decision making systems. We retrospectively analysed all the meningitis cases from our patients at our institution and established a scoring tool for pediatric meningitis and for meningitis in adults by using categorized analysis tree methodology.

Results

Main categories for bacterial etiology were, leucocytosis > 15 giga, CSF leucocytes count > 1700 per ml, CSF neutrophil percentage > 80, CSF protein > 2.3g/l and glucose CSF/blood ratio < 0.33 for adults and CSF leucocytes count > 1800, CSF neutrophil percentage > 80, CSF protein > 1.2g/l and glucose CSF/blood ratio < 0.3 for children. Additionally, our new scoring tool and five published ones were compared using our data and two external data sets; from these scores, three, including ours, exhibited good sensitivity and specificity. We then performed several thousand Monte Carlo simulations of both bacterial and viral meningitis for children and adults. We found that our scoring tool (Meningitest) had very high performances with positive and negative predictive values of 97% and 94%, respectively.

Conclusion

Thus, from this analysis of five meningitis scoring systems, we believe that our new tool is simple, does not need any complex calculation and is effective in identifying bacterial vs viral meningitis in fully immunocompetent children and adults.

### Cortisol levels in cerebrospinal fluid correlate with severity and bacterial origin of meningitis [^113dCaYR]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial meningitis represents a serious disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Outcomes of bacterial meningitis has remained stable since the advent of antibiotics, with the case fatality being as high as 25%. Furthermore, long-term sequelae such as hearing loss, palsies and personality changes affect approximately 40% of survivors. Early antibiotic therapy is crucial for optimizing the outcome of bacterial meningitis. Therefore, it is important to distinguish bacterial meningitis from aseptic meningitis during the acute phase of the disease, when clinical symptoms are often similar. Current microbiological tests are highly specific, but they lack sufficient sensitivity. Use of various biological markers in blood (C-reactive protein, white blood cell count [WBC], and procalcitonin) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; for instance, protein, glucose, WBC, lactate, inflammatory cytokines and combinations thereof) has been suggested to improve sensitivity in determining the aetiological diagnosis. However, a sensitive laboratory test that is easy to perform is still required, so that all patients with bacterial meningitis can be identified reliably on admission.

### Case report: greater meningeal inflammation in lumbar than in ventricular region in human bacterial meningitis [^111dBS5m]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial meningitis and ventriculitis remain the most frequent complication in neurosurgery. Diagnosis is based almost exclusively on biochemical and bacteriological analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) withdrawn either by puncture in the lumbar space or through an external drain located either in the lumbar or ventricular space. It is established that CSF infection is strongly suspected in the presence of a positive CSF culture and/or of a CSF: serum glucose ratio of less than 0.6 and/or of a CSF leukocyte count of more than 11/mm³ in the lumbar space.

Differences in the composition of ventricular and lumbar CSF, based on single pairs of CSF samples, were previously described. These studies showed a rostrocaudal gradient of leukocytes and protein and an inverse gradient of glucose in the first CSF withdrawn in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of meningitis. However, the time course of a ventricular-to-lumbar gradient of leukocytes, glucose and protein, during the occurrence and the relief of meningitis, remains unknown.

Here we describe a patient who developed, after surgery for a chordoma of the clivus, three episodes of recurrent meningitis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa O12. The last two episodes were monitored by daily biochemical and bacteriological analysis of CSF withdrawn in parallel from the lumbar space and ventricles by external lumbar drainage (ELD) and external ventricular drainage (EVD).

### Heparin-binding protein in cerebrospinal fluid as a biomarker for bacterial meningitis: a study of diagnostic accuracy [^117H2Yfw]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Bacterial meningitis is a life‐threatening disease and rapid diagnosis and treatment are essential for a good prognosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination is the cornerstone of the diagnostic work‐up in bacterial meningitis and is typically characterized by an elevated CSF leukocyte count, elevated CSF protein, and a decreased CSF to blood glucose ratio. Yet, these CSF abnormalities can also be present in other central nervous system (CNS) infections such as viral meningitis or encephalitis and even in non‐infectious CNS disorders, where an elevated CSF leukocyte count can be present in up to 50% of cases. Additionally, not all patients with bacterial meningitis present with the typical CSF changes, and approximately 2% have completely normal CSF parameters at presentation. A definite diagnosis of bacterial meningitis can be made through microbiological examination such as CSF culture or molecular‐based diagnostics. However, the turnaround time for such investigations may be prolonged and the yield impaired by delayed lumbar puncture and administration of antibiotics. Hence, there is a continued need for novel ways to diagnose bacterial meningitis in a timely and accurate manner.

Heparin‐binding protein (HBP), also known as azurocidin, is a protein that resides in the secretory vesicles of neutrophils from which it is released after neutrophil activation. Since it is a prefabricated protein, release occurs promptly after the activation of neutrophils and causes a rapid increase in HBP concentration. HBP has several functions in the inflammatory response after release into the bloodstream where it acts an attractant for more leukocytes and stimulates cytokine release. Previous studies have investigated HBP as a potential biomarker for sepsis in plasma and found it to be correlated with the development of severe sepsis and septic shock in patients with fever and to outperform traditional biomarkers such as C‐reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count, procalcitonin and lactate. This has demonstrated the potential of HBP as a marker in bacterial infections.

In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of HBP in the CSF for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in patients with a suspected central nervous system infection.

### Assessment of diagnostic yield of nonculture infection testing on cerebrospinal fluid in immune-competent children [^115oZucH]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute central nervous system (CNS) infections, such as meningitis and encephalitis, require prompt recognition of treatable etiologies (eg, bacterial pathogens, herpes simplex virus [HSV]) to reduce potentially significant morbidity and mortality. Infections of the CNS are typically identified with lumbar puncture and evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell counts, protein, glucose, Gram stain, bacterial culture, and nonculture infection tests. A CSF white blood cell (WBC) count lower than 5 cells/μL in immune-competent children older than 2 months is considered normal, whereas a count of 5 cells/μL or higher suggests infection and/or inflammation(to convert to ×10⁹ per liter, multiply by 0.001). The presence of red blood cells (RBCs) in CSF samples represents either intrathecal blood (eg, subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage) or introduction of peripheral blood into CSF during the performance of the lumbar puncture. Introduction of peripheral blood into otherwise sterile CSF may result in the potential contamination of a bloodstream pathogen, and it also makes the CSF WBC difficult to clinically interpret because an elevated count may reflect a true pleocytosis and/or peripheral blood WBCs.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of CSF and antigen or antibody assays are used to identify specific pathogens in suspected CNS infection; however, their overall diagnostic yield is variable. Nonculture CSF infection test sensitivity and specificity are high for some organisms (eg, HSV PCR, enterovirus PCR) but are low for others (eg, Borrelia burgdorferi PCR and antibody assays). The positive and negative predictive values, as well as the clinical advantages of these tests in populations with a low pretest probability for CNS infection (such as immune-competent children with normal CSF cell counts), are unknown.

Laboratory testing with little clinical advantage but a disproportionately high cost is one example of low-value care. When a lumbar puncture is performed, frontline clinicians often order nonculture CSF infection tests concurrently with CSF cell counts, protein level, glucose level, and Gram stain to optimize administrative workflow and minimize the potential need later to collect more CSF. Even though lumbar puncture has a low complication rate, it often requires sedation for children, making a repeated procedure undesirable. To determine if ordering practices and laboratory workflow for nonculture CSF infection tests may be a target to reduce low-value care in pediatrics, we sought to identify the frequency of positive nonculture CSF infection tests and their association with the clinical care of immune-competent children with normal CSF cell counts.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^113EdUS6]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Because the model included a significant interaction term between CSF protein and diagnostic category, we followed up with a stratified analysis to achieve a better understanding of the effects of each variable separately (figure 1). First, CSF protein significantly predicted CSF glucose only in the microbial category (β = −21.7, R² = 0.18, p < 0.001, figure 1B), meaning that CSF glucose inversely varied with the degree of inflammation only in the presence of a pathogen. Second, binning CSF protein levels and comparing diagnostic categories showed that CSF glucose and glucose ratios were significantly decreased in the microbial compared with the aseptic group (p ≤ 0.01 for all except p = 0.07 for absolute glucose with mild CSF protein, t test).

Figure 1
Linear relationship between CSF inflammation and glucose in meningitis; analysis stratified by diagnostic category (aseptic, n = 115 and microbial, n = 110) and levels of CSF protein

(A) Trend showing lower CSF glucose level with the higher CSF leukocyte count in the microbial category (β = −9.1, R² = 13%, p < 0.001, black line) but not in the aseptic category (yellow line, p = 0.23). (B) The CSF glucose level is significantly lowered with the elevated CSF protein level in the microbial category (β = −20.2, R² = 17%, p < 0.001, black line) but not in the aseptic category (yellow line, p = 0.28). (C–E) Stratified analysis of the effect of the diagnostic category on CSF glucose within similar degrees of inflammation as assessed by the protein levels, low (p = 0.07), intermediate (p = 0.01), and high (p < 0.01). Note that the glucose level is significantly decreased only in microbial meningitis at intermediate and high levels of CSF protein. ✱ p ≤ 0.01.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^1118L1Dv]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Longitudinal analysis of CSF glucose.

Calculating changes in glucose and proteins in repeated CSF samples compared with the corresponding initial CSF sample in microbial meningitis revealed that a linear relationship was conserved over time between these 2 markers with absolute CSF glucose (n = 83 samples in 52 patients, β = −35.1, R² = 46%, p < 0.001, figure 2) or the glucose ratio (n = 52 samples in 47 patients, β = −0.3, R² = 49%, p < 0.001).

Figure 2
Longitudinal relationship between CSF glucose and protein changes

Delta glucose and changes in proteins represent the difference between a repeat CSF sample and the corresponding initial CSF sample. Note the strong linear relationship (p = 10⁻¹²) and the fact that most data points fall either in the upper left quadrant (improvement) or in the lower right quadrant (worsening), indicating an inverse correlation between CSF glucose and protein levels.

Receiver operating characteristics.

As shown in figure 3, thresholds that are typically used clinically (CSF glucose < 40 mg/dL or glucose ratio < 0.4) yielded sensitivities around 53% and 55% and specificities around 89% and 82%, respectively. The specificity for microbial meningitis was increased to more than 90% at the expense of poorer sensitivity by decreasing the threshold to CSF glucose < 30 mg/dL or glucose ratio < 0.3, reflecting the very low CSF glucose levels seen more frequently in microbial meningitis cases (table 1).

Figure 3
Receiver operating characteristics for CSF glucose (n = 225) and serum/CSF glucose ratio (n = 156) as predictors for microbial meningitis

The sensitivity and specificity of different clinically meaningful threshold levels are shown in the inset table and at corresponding dots on the curves (low, middle, and high thresholds). Note that when a low threshold is chosen, the raw glucose and glucose ratio perform similarly with high specificity for microbial cases but very low sensitivity. On the other hand, when a high threshold is chosen, the glucose ratio performs approximately 10% better than raw glucose in terms of sensitivity for equivalent specificity. Thresholds typically used in clinical practice are in the middle range. CSFg = CSF glucose; Gr = Glucose ratio.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count, glucose, and protein — Abnormalities of CSF cell count, glucose, and/or protein may not be reliable indicators for the presence of infection in patients with healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis (weak, moderate), and normal CSF cell count, glucose, and protein may not reliably exclude infection (weak, moderate); a negative CSF Gram stain does not exclude the presence of infection, especially in patients who have received previous antimicrobial therapy (strong, moderate). Supporting data note that CSF white blood cell counts and lactate concentrations were normal in approximately 20% of episodes in adults with shunt-associated infection, CSF eosinophilia (> 8% of the differential count) has been associated with an indolent infection, and using a looser definition (ie, > 1% of the differential count) eosinophilia correlated with CSF infection but also with subcutaneous CSF extravasation, blood in the CSF, younger age at shunt insertion, and intraventricular hemorrhage as a cause of the hydrocephalus. The CSF white blood cell count tends to be lower in samples obtained by shunt aspiration or from ventricular fluid than when obtained after lumbar puncture. In a cohort of patients with external CSF drains, lumbar catheters were placed in 125 patients (54.3%), ventricular catheters in 97 (42.2%), and more than 1 type in 8 (3.5%), with external drainage–related bacterial meningitis developing in 22 patients (9.6%); analyses of 1516 CSF samples showed no significant differences during the first 3 days of infection or during the 3 days preceding infection in leukocyte count, protein concentration, glucose concentration, or CSF-to-blood glucose ratio.

### Meningitis in adult patients with a negative direct cerebrospinal fluid examination: value of cytochemical markers for differential diagnosis [^112EY6Z4]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Low CSF glucose levels (2 to 2.5 mmol/L) and a low CSF/serum glucose ratio (on the order of 0.30 to 0.40) have been classically described as a feature of BM. Spanos reported a median CSF glucose level of 3.4 mmol/L (CSF/serum glucose ratio, 0.45) in patients with BM and a negative direct examination of the CSF, compared with 1.7 mmol/L (CSF/serum glucose ratio, 0.23) in 134 patients with BM and a positive direct CSF examination. Similar values were seen in the patients included in our study, although CSF glucose levels were more markedly reduced.

Elevated CSF protein levels are also seen in patients with BM, mean values ranging from 1 to 2.5 g/L. With regard to the differential diagnosis of BM, the reported sensitivity of this parameter ranged from 63% to 86% with a specificity of 94% to 98%. Normal CSF protein values were found in 10% of patients with BM and a negative direct CSF examination. In our study, a CSF protein level of 1.88 g/L gave a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 93% for the diagnosis of BM. Normal levels of protein in the CSF were seen in 5% of the patients with BM in our study.

We retrospectively reviewed CSF results from October 2015 to August 2017 in patients 0 to 18 years at a US children's hospital. Noninfectious evaluations were excluded. Test characteristics were calculated for CSF WBC, protein, and glucose in isolation and in parallel for prediction of microbiologically confirmed IM. Chart review was performed to identify consideration of protein and glucose in medical decision-making (MDM).

Results

We identified 735 patients including 446 < 2 months; 45 (6.1%) had microbiologically-confirmed IM, including 23 (5.2%) age < 2 months. Multiplex PCR and/or CSF WBC identified all IM patients. When added to CSF WBC, measurement of glucose made no contribution to sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) or negative predictive value (NPV), and protein had no impact on sensitivity and decreased the specificity, PPV, and NPV compared with CSF WBC alone. Abnormal protein was documented in MDM in 6 (0.8%) patients, all of whom had elevated WBC counts also cited. Glucose was not mentioned in MDM.

Conclusions

Multiplex PCR testing and WBC may be sufficient to predict meningitis in children in low incidence settings. Protein and glucose did not contribute significant additional information. More intentional use of protein and glucose testing in patients with suspected IM may achieve higher value care.

### Cerebrospinal fluid lactate concentration to distinguish bacterial from aseptic meningitis: a systemic review and meta-analysis [^112tZAsW]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

The present meta-analysis revealed that the AUC of CSF lactate concentration was 0.9840 (Figure 4), indicating an excellent level of overall accuracy. The overall performance was highest for the CSF lactate concentration compared to the performances of the four conventional markers (CSF glucose, CSF/plasma glucose quotient, CSF protein, and CSF total number of leukocytes) based on head-to-head meta-analytic SROC curves and their AUC (Figure 5), which was in good agreement with previous literature. CSF lactate is less useful if it has a low concentration, but the assay is supportive if it is positive, especially if the diagnosis was otherwise not conclusive. In such cases, increased CSF lactate should be considered a sign of BM. Because of the lactate assay, several BM patients with elevated CSF lactate and minimal CSF abnormalities have been treated with antibiotics prior to culture test results. Moreover, an increased CSF lactate level has been also proposed as a good indicator of CSF infection in intra-ventricular hemorrhagic patients with an external ventricular drain. However, clinicians should be aware that CSF lactate is also increased in several central nervous system diseases such stroke (2 to 8 mmol/l), convulsion (2 to 4 mmol/l), cerebral trauma (2 to 9 mmol/l), hypoglycemic coma (2 to 6 mmol/l).

The measurement of CSF lactate concentration is a simple, rapid, inexpensive assay, takes just 15 minutes, and can be performed at the bedside. In addition, the CSF lactate concentration is useful during the course of treatment, because a rapid CSF lactate decrease is indicative of good prognosis. Since the CSF lactate concentration is not specific for BM, the results of this assay should be interpreted in parallel with clinical findings and the results of conventional assays including CSF concentrations of protein, cells, glucose, and a microbiological examination of CSF. The cut-off value for CSF lactate concentration ranges from 2.1 to 4.44 mmol/L, suggesting a variance between instrument, hospital labs, and the method. Therefore, every center should set its own cut-off value for CSF lactate concentration. Another disadvantage of CSF lactate is that it is not useful in the choice of antibiotic selection, which must be based on the results of microscopic examination of a smear or culture for bacteria, as well as the other clinical data.

### Ten years of clinical experience with adult meningitis at an urban academic medical center [^115F5jcu]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical presentation and bacteriology of adult patients admitted to an urban academic medical center with bacterial meningitis over a 10-year period. In this retrospective review, we identified all adult patients discharged from a tertiary care facility between November 1992 and March 2003 with a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Data regarding demographics, vital signs, presenting symptoms, seven predisposing factors, body fluid cultures, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, and mortality were abstracted. Data were analyzed using descriptive methods. We identified 38 cases. Overall mortality rate was 18.4% (95% confidence interval 7.7–34.3%). The most common of the seven predisposing factors was an immunocompromised state (31.6%). Streptococcus pneumoniae (24.3%), other streptococcus species (24.3%), and Gram-negative rods (16.2%) were the most commonly identified organisms. The classic meningitis triad (fever, neck stiffness, mental status change or headache) was present in only 21.1% of cases. CSF analysis demonstrated WBC ≥ 100/mm³ in 81.3%, decreased glucose (< 50 mg/dL) in 50%, and elevated protein (> 45 mg/dL) in 91.2%. With increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients, atypical presentations of bacterial meningitis seem to be more common. A higher percentage of bacterial meningitis cases seem to be caused by Gram-negative rods and Streptococcus species other than Streptococcus pneumoniae. The classic meningitis triad occurred in fewer cases than previously described.

### Bacterial meningitis in Sudanese children; critical evaluation of the clinical decision using clinical prediction rules [^115YzLhf]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sudan falls in the meningitis belt where most global cases of bacterial meningitis are reported. Highly accurate decision support tools have been developed by international specialized societies to guide the diagnosis and limit unnecessary hospital admissions and prolonged antibiotic use that have been frequently reported from countries around the world. The goals of this study are to critically evaluate the clinical decision of bacterial meningitis in children in Sudan using clinical prediction rules and to identify the current bacterial aetiology.

Methods

This cross-sectional hospital-based study was conducted in October to July of 2010 in a major referral pediatric hospital in Khartoum, Sudan. Febrile children age 1 day to 15 years who were provisionally diagnosed as having meningitis on admission were included (n = 503). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were obtained from all patients while clinical and demographic data were available for only 404. Conventional laboratory investigations were performed. The clinical decision was evaluated by the International Classification of Diseases–Clinical Modification code 320.9 and the Bacterial Meningitis Score. Ethical clearance and permissions were obtained.

Results

Out of 503 provisionally diagnosed bacterial meningitis patients, the final clinical confirmation was assigned to 55.9%. When codes were applied; 5.7% (23/404) with CSF pleocytosis were re-classified as High Risk for bacterial meningitis and 1.5% (6/404) with confirmed bacterial aetiology as Proven Bacterial Meningitis. Neisseria meningitidis was identified in 0.7% (3/404) and Streptococcus pneumoniae in another 0.7%. Typical laboratory findings (i.e. CSF pleocytosis and/or low glucose and high protein concentrations, Gram positive or Gram negative diplococcic, positive bacterial culture) were seen in 5 (83%). Clinically, patients showed fever, seizures, chills, headache, vomiting, stiff neck and bulging fontanelle. All confirmed cases were less than 5 years old and were admitted in summer. All patients were prescribed with antibiotics; they were all recovered and discharged.

Conclusions

Bacterial meningitis is over-diagnosed in hospitals in Khartoum therefore clinical prediction rules must be adopted and applied to guide the clinical decision. The sole bacterial aetiology in this selected group of Sudanese children remain N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae, but with significant decrease in prevalence. Some cases showed atypical clinical and laboratory findings.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^114gx3vm]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we showed that, contrary to our hypothesis, the presence of glucophagic microorganisms (bacteria, mycobacteria, fungus, or parasite) is the predominant determinant of hypoglycorrhachia and that depletion of CSF glucose is more pronounced in the setting of more severe infections with higher pleocytosis and proteins. In the absence of such a pathogen, a similar degree of CSF inflammation is per se, not sufficient to significantly decrease CSF glucose on average, with a few notable exceptions including cases of biopsy-confirmed neurosarcoidosis. Furthermore, the degree of pleocytosis was not an independent predictor of hypoglycorrhachia when CSF protein was taken into account, and the type of pleocytosis did not play a crucial role.

From these data, we understand that either (1) the presence of both glucophagic microorganisms and a significant degree of inflammation synergistically induce hypoglycorrhachia; or (2) CSF protein is a marker for another variable we could not measure, such as microbial load and/or function of the blood-brain barrier. Of note, CSF protein in meningitis can be of microbial (e.g. bacterial wall) or endogenous origin (e.g. immunoglobulins), which may explain its predictive strength in our model as it combines 2 variables into 1 metric. Unfortunately, microbial load is not routinely measured in CSF, so we could not test this hypothesis. Taking into account early work on animal experimental meningitis, it is conceivable that a synergy between CSF inflammatory mechanisms and the presence of glucophagic microorganisms stimulates leukocytic glucose catabolism. Alternatively, glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier might be reduced as proposed in cases of tuberculous meningitisand experimental meningitis.

### Progress and challenges in bacterial meningitis: a review [^116tzqsh]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Bacterial meningitis is a worldwide health problem, with incidence rates ranging from approximately 0.9 per 100 000 individuals per year in high-income countries to 80 per 100 000 individuals per year in low-income countries. In low-income countries, bacterial meningitis has a mortality rate of up to 54%. Up to 24% of those who survive develop chronic neurological sequelae, such as hearing loss or focal neurological deficits.

Observations

Streptococcus pneumoniae causes about 72% and Neisseria meningitidis causes about 11% of cases of bacterial meningitis in people older than 16 years. Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae cause about 35% of cases of early-onset neonatal meningitis. In adults, risk factors for bacterial meningitis include older age and immunosuppressive conditions. The most common symptoms are headache (84%), fever (74%), stiff neck (74%), altered mental status (median [IQR] Glasgow Coma Scale score of 11 [9–14] on a scale ranging from 3–15), and nausea (62%). Brain imaging should be performed before lumbar puncture if patients present with altered mental status, focal neurological deficits, papilledema, or history of immunocompromising conditions or central nervous system disease. Bacterial meningitis should be suspected if any of the following are present on admission: serum leukocytes greater than 10.0 × 10⁹/L, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leukocytes greater than 2000/μL, CSF granulocytes greater than 1180/μL, CSF protein greater than 2.2 g/L, CSF glucose less than 34.23 mg/dL, or fever. A positive Gram stain result for bacteria is diagnostic, but the sensitivity of a positive Gram stain result for bacterial meningitis ranges from 50% to 90%. In countries in which the prevalence of ceftriaxone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae exceeds 1%, vancomycin and ceftriaxone are the empirical antibiotics of choice, with the addition of ampicillin in neonates, older patients, and immunocompromised patients. Adjunctive dexamethasone should be used in patients with bacterial meningitis but stopped if Listeria monocytogenes is confirmed.

Conclusions and Relevance

Bacterial meningitis affects approximately 0.9 per 100 000 individuals to 80 per 100 000 individuals per year and has a mortality rate as high as 54%. First-line therapy is prompt empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy and adjunctive dexamethasone.

### Guidelines on routine cerebrospinal fluid analysis. report from an EFNS task force [^115s1sDy]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

A great variety of neurological diseases require investigation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to prove the diagnosis or to rule out relevant differential diagnoses. The objectives were to evaluate the theoretical background and provide guidelines for clinical use in routine CSF analysis including total protein, albumin, immunoglobulins, glucose, lactate, cell count, cytological staining, and investigation of infectious CSF. The methods included a Systematic Medline search for the above-mentioned variables and review of appropriate publications by one or more of the task force members. Grading of evidence and recommendations was based on consensus by all task force members. It is recommended that CSF should be analysed immediately after collection. If storage is needed 12 mL of CSF should be partitioned into three to four sterile tubes. Albumin CSF/serum ratio (Qalb) should be preferred to total protein measurement and normal upper limits should be related to patients' age. Elevated Qalb is a non-specific finding but occurs mainly in bacterial, cryptococcal, and tuberculous meningitis, leptomingeal metastases as well as acute and chronic demyelinating polyneuropathies. Pathological decrease of the CSF/serum glucose ratio or increased lactate concentration indicates bacterial or fungal meningitis or leptomeningeal metastases. Intrathecal immunoglobulin G synthesis is best demonstrated by isoelectric focusing followed by specific staining. Cellular morphology (cytological staining) should be evaluated whenever pleocytosis is found or leptomeningeal metastases or pathological bleeding is suspected. Computed tomography-negative intrathecal bleeding should be investigated by bilirubin detection.

### Cerebrospinal fluid composition of infants with ischemic stroke [^111Lj7tp]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to characterize the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of infants with stroke and compare those findings to the CSF of infants with bacterial meningitis and neither condition in the first 14 postnatal days. Cohort study of 30,092 infants who received a lumbar puncture in the first 14 postnatal days discharged from > 400 neonatal intensive care units from 1997 to 2020. CSF parameters were compared between infants with stroke and bacterial meningitis using non-parametric hypothesis testing and quantile regression. Compared to infants with bacterial meningitis, infants with stroke had a significantly lower median protein concentration, higher median glucose concentration, higher median red blood cell count, and higher median monocyte count. Using quantile regression at the 75th percentile, infants with stroke had a significantly lower white blood cell count, segmented neutrophil count, and lymphocyte count than infants with bacterial meningitis. This study addresses the paucity of literature describing the CSF of infants with ischemic stroke. Knowledge of the differences in CSF parameters between infants with stroke and meningitis may allow for faster recognition and intervention before CSF culture results are available. · Neonatal stroke is a serious and morbid event. · Neonatal stroke and meningitis can present similarly. · The CSF of neonatal stroke is poorly described.

### Accuracy of clinical and cerebrospinal fluid indicators in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in infants [^113QsDkw]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of bacterial meningitis (BM) is problematic in young infants, as clinical features may be nonspecific or even absent. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis usually confirms the diagnosis, but the CSF parameters can be normal also in culture-proven BM. Our objective was to identify the clinical and CSF indices, that quickly and without laboratory likely lead to the diagnosis of confirmed of probable BM in young infants in Angola.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, observational, single-site study from February 2016 to October 2017 in the Pediatric Hospital of Luanda. All assessed infants showed symptoms and signs compatible of BM or neonatal sepsis and were < 90 days of age.

Results

Of the 1088 infants, 212 (19%) showed bacteria in CSF, while 88 (8%) had probable BM. Independent clinical indicators of BM were not-clear CSF, seizures, weight < 2500g and illness > 7 days. In infants with BM, CSF leukocytes were > 10 × 10⁶/L in 46%, CSF glucose < 25mg/dL in 43% and CSF protein > 120mg/dL in 58%. All measured parameters were in normal range in 25% of patients. In 515 infants with normal CSF parameters, bacteria were found in 74 (14%). In these infants, illness > 7 days, weight < 2500g and malnutrition increased the probability of BM.

Conclusions

Our study confirms and underlines the problems in diagnosing BM in young infants. While the CSF parameters were normal in 25% of infants, the easily recognizable unclear appearance of CSF was the single strongest predictor of BM.

### Accuracy and test characteristics of ancillary tests of cerebrospinal fluid for predicting acute bacterial meningitis in children with low white blood cell counts in cerebrospinal fluid [^113qAUFg]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether ancillary tests of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), specifically, the total protein concentration, glucose concentration, and percent neutrophils, provide information for diagnosing acute bacterial meningitis among children with low white blood cell (WBC) count in CSF.

Methods

The authors retrospectively reviewed CSF from children aged 1 month to 18 years undergoing lumbar puncture at Children's Hospital in Boston from 1993 to 1999. Data were supplemented with CSF test results obtained from children with 0–30 WBCs/mm(3) in CSF diagnosed with acute bacterial meningitis at the same institution from 1984 to 1992. For each test, the incremental value of ancillary tests was estimated by calculating indices of performance such as the area under receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC) and interval likelihood ratios that are relatively insensitive to disease prevalence.

Results

Among children with 0–30 WBCs/mm(3) in CSF who met study criteria, acute bacterial meningitis was identified in ten of 7,701 (0.1%) for the period from 1993 to 1999 and supplemented with 11 additional cases for the period from 1984 to 1992. AUC values for ancillary tests were 0.61 for total protein concentration, 0.69 for glucose concentration, and 0.90 for percent neutrophils. Interval likelihood ratios were unremarkable for mildly abnormal test results. In contrast, interval likelihood ratios for markedly abnormal test results were higher: 22 for total protein concentration > 120 mg/dL, 57 for neutrophils > 75%, 15 for glucose concentration < 20 mg/dL, and 20 for glucose concentration > 120 mg/dL.

Conclusions

When markedly abnormal, results of CSF total protein concentration, glucose concentration, and percent neutrophils have value for diagnosing acute bacterial meningitis, even among children with a low WBC count in CSF.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^1175HULb]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

In the second part of this study, longitudinal analysis with repeated CSF sampling in a subset of patients with microbial meningitis revealed an inverse correlation between CSF protein and glucose concentration. This was interpreted as a marker of the response to treatment or the lack thereof. When microorganisms are effectively killed, inflammation decreases and glucose catabolism decreases as well. The strong linear relationship found here suggests that CSF glucose and CSF protein are valuable biomarkers to track the clinical progression of microbial meningitis.

Third, ROC analysis showed that both CSF raw glucose and the CSF-to-serum glucose ratio were specific but not sensitive tests to detect microbial meningitis at thresholds used in clinical practice. In our study, there was a mild benefit of using the glucose ratio (with serum levels obtained within 12 hours) instead of raw glucose to achieve higher sensitivity (approximately 10% increase), and it therefore probably reflects a more accurate estimation of glucose repartition in the 2 compartments. For these reasons, it should be preferred over absolute CSF glucose when making clinical predictions; however, our data illustrate that it is not a widespread practice. We did not have enough time points to investigate whether the glucose ratio obtained within shorter time frames (e.g. ± 2 hours) would yield better ROC.

The limitations of the study include its use of single-center retrospectively collected laboratory measures without the ability to further explore pathologic mechanisms or control for uniform collection of variables. In a prospective study asking the same questions, a number of additional control variables could be collected. The blood-brain barrier integrity could be assessed by parallel measurement of albumin in the plasma and CSF. Lactate quantification could clarify a potential role for anaerobic metabolism. Proteins could be further separated into those of microbial origin and immunoglobulins. Microbial load could be quantified using PCR, and a tight CSF-to-serum glucose ratio could be assessed systematically. Although promising, newer biomarkers such as serum or CSF procalcitoninand serum C-reactive proteinhave not yet replaced CSF glucose in the evaluation of meningitis and were not systematically available in our data set. We did not include carcinomatous meningitis in our analysis, but doing this could provide yet another interesting angle, as cancerous cells are known to be highly catabolic. Overall, the aim of our analyses was to describe the relationship between CSF variables, as opposed to building a predictive score for the diagnosis of microbial meningitis that should be the focus of a larger prospective study. The percentage of diagnoses should be considered as information on the data used here and not as a cross-sectional study on meningitis differential diagnosis.

However, a nonculture diagnostic laboratory test or antibody test for specific organisms are not often used in patients with healthcare-associated ventriculitis or meningitis.

### Predictive performance of cerebrospinal fluid parameters for diagnosis of meningitis in infants: a cohort study [^116ryfJu]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The gold standard for diagnosis of meningitis is the isolation of a pathogen from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by culture or PCR. However, treatment is routinely commenced based on CSF findings prior to microbiological results. This study determined the predictive value of CSF parameters for diagnosing bacterial and viral meningitis in young infants.

Methods

Multicentre retrospective (2010–2020) cohort study of 1088 CSF results from infants aged 0–90days. The predictive value of CSF parameters (white blood cell count (WCC), neutrophil, protein, glucose) was evaluated in 538 meningitis cases (39 bacterial, 499 viral) compared with controls with negative CSF microbiological testing and no prior antibiotics.

Results

For bacterial meningitis, the sensitivity of the commonly used CSF WCC cut-off of 20×10⁶/L for neonates, 15×10⁶/L for infants 1–2months old and 5×10⁶/L for infants 2–3months old was 89%, 91% and 86% and the specificity was 78%, 77% and 61%, respectively. CSF protein levels ≥ 1g/L in neonates and ≥ 0.8g/L in infants aged 1–3month, or CSF neutrophils ≥ 2×10⁶/L, independently increased the likelihood of bacterial meningitis (positive likelihood ratios ≥ 5and ≥ 3, respectively). 3 of 39 cases of bacterial meningitis would have been missed using the commonly used WCC cut-offs alone. However, two would have been identified using CSF protein and neutrophil thresholds. All CSF parameters were poor at identifying viral meningitis.

Conclusion

A single CSF parameter cannot reliably diagnose bacterial meningitis. For identification of bacterial meningitis, elevation of CSF WCC, neutrophil count or protein levels above threshold values improves accuracy of diagnosis.
