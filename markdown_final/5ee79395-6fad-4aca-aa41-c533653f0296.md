## Question

How does irbesartan affect potassium levels?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how irbesartan affects potassium levels, with interest in the underlying mechanism, population-specific risk, and guidance on monitoring and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanism of irbesartan and its expected physiologic consequences for potassium handling. Then, I should verify what randomized and label data show about potassium changes in general hypertension populations versus high-risk groups like diabetic nephropathy. Next, I will review risk modifiers such as renal function, dual RAAS blockade, potassium supplements, and concomitant drugs. After that, I need to examine special populations and whether dialysis alters risk. Finally, I should synthesize a pragmatic monitoring and management approach and close with a balanced conclusion that weighs benefits against potassium risks, anchoring each point to guideline or pivotal trial data.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism, because the directionality of potassium change depends on it. Irbesartan blocks the AT1 receptor, removing angiotensin II's stimulation of aldosterone; with less aldosterone, distal sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion tend to decrease, so in principle serum potassium should rise, but wait, let me verify the clinical magnitude in typical patients with preserved kidney function [^113sfSok] [^113uZvKr].

> Hold on, I should verify what the labels say about potassium at therapeutic doses. The FDA labeling repeatedly notes that while aldosterone generally declines with irbesartan, serum potassium is not significantly affected at recommended doses in hypertensive patients without kidney disease, which aligns with a small expected potassium rise that is usually subclinical in this population [^113sfSok] [^113uZvKr].

> Next, I should review hard outcome data to ensure this is not just a theoretical point. In the IDNT trial of patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy, potassium greater than 6.0 mEq/L occurred in 18.6% with irbesartan versus 6.0% with placebo, with discontinuations for hyperkalemia at 2.1% versus 0.4%, which is a much higher signal than in general hypertension cohorts. Let me double-check those numbers to avoid misquoting, and yes, that's correct per FDA and pivotal trial summaries [^113LEbE3] [^11236Ufb].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost concluded that irbesartan has no clinically meaningful potassium effect at all, but I should correct that oversimplification. The lack of a significant effect applies to patients with preserved renal function, whereas CKD fundamentally alters potassium handling and magnifies the impact of RAAS blockade, so I need to keep the risk stratification explicit here [^1155wSxQ].

> I will now examine risk modifiers, starting with renal function. Let me think about this: as eGFR declines, the kidney's capacity to excrete potassium falls, so even a modest reduction in aldosterone-driven kaliuresis from ARB blockade can push potassium upward. Observational and guideline data consistently flag CKD as the strongest predictor of hyperkalemia with RAAS inhibitors, and IDNT specifically enrolled patients with reduced eGFR and proteinuria, explaining the higher hyperkalemia rates seen there [^1155wSxQ] [^113LEbE3].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions. Dual RAAS blockade with an ARB plus an ACE inhibitor or aliskiren increases hyperkalemia risk without added benefit and should be avoided. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and potassium-containing salt substitutes also raise potassium when combined with ARBs. NSAIDs can worsen renal perfusion and reduce kaliuresis, further increasing potassium, so I need to ensure I'm checking for these combinations at baseline and during titration [^1135kkQV] [^1156Tgxf] [^112neJCV].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with diabetes and heart failure. Patients with diabetes often have reduced renal reserve and autonomic or hormonal dysregulation that blunts potassium excretion, increasing hyperkalemia risk with RAAS blockade; in heart failure, the combination of ACEi/ARB plus MRA compounds potassium risk, though contemporary HF guidance still supports RAAS strategies with structured potassium monitoring because of mortality benefits [^113JwUf2] [^111RKLXp].

> But wait, what if the patient is on peritoneal dialysis or has ESRD? Does RAAS blockade still matter for potassium? Initially, I thought dialysis would neutralize potassium effects, but I should double-check; small studies in PD suggest ACEi/ARB can be used with modest, manageable potassium changes, and in ESRD, RAAS blockade may have minimal effect on potassium given minimal residual renal function, though individualization and close monitoring remain prudent [^116hMuC6] [^114spaLn] [^114PLQTx].

> Next, I should review monitoring guidance to make this clinically actionable. Major guidelines advise checking potassium and creatinine within 1–2 weeks after initiating or uptitrating an ARB, shortening intervals if CKD is present or if baseline potassium is borderline. Practical algorithms often extend monitoring every 3–4 months once stable, and in patients at higher risk or on interacting drugs, I should intensify checks and coordinate any potassium-lowering strategies rather than reflexively stopping the ARB [^1125hA23] [^111r5wu5].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to hyperkalemia management so I don't jump to conclusions about stopping RAAS blockade. Contemporary kidney guidelines recommend treating hyperkalemia with dietary modification, diuretics, and potassium binders to preserve RAAS inhibition when possible, reserving dose reduction or discontinuation for refractory or life-threatening cases; potassium binders such as patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate have RCT and label support for maintaining normokalemia while continuing RAAS therapy in CKD [^116VQePY] [^113j7oLg] [^114wAyzd].

> Let me reconsider the balance of benefits and risks to frame counseling. RAAS blockade with ARBs like irbesartan slows CKD progression, reduces proteinuria, and improves cardiovascular outcomes, with the IDNT program showing durable eGFR benefits. Although hyperkalemia risk is higher in CKD, absolute changes are typically modest and manageable, and under-treatment due to fear of hyperkalemia leads to worse outcomes, reinforcing the need for proactive potassium management rather than premature withdrawal [^114gWar3] [^116ZjmAN] [^114wAyzd].

> I should double-check a few clinical pearls that often get missed. Combining an ARB with a thiazide diuretic can mitigate the potassium-raising effect of ARBs and may normalize potassium in some patients, though thiazides lose efficacy at low eGFR and loop diuretics become preferable; SGLT2 inhibitors may modestly lower potassium and can be considered as part of a CKD-protective regimen; finally, careful attention to potassium additives in processed foods and sample handling can prevent false alarms and overtreatment [^116xsjtZ] [^114ZQiCr] [^114XbkSR] [^111Fa4pA].

> Putting this together, my final synthesis is that irbesartan's AT1 blockade reduces aldosterone and, in principle, can raise potassium, but in patients with preserved renal function the average effect is small and not clinically significant. However, in CKD, especially diabetic nephropathy, hyperkalemia occurs more frequently and can be severe, with risk amplified by dual RAAS blockade, potassium-raising drugs, and NSAIDs. With guideline-directed monitoring and modern potassium-lowering strategies, most patients can remain on beneficial RAAS therapy while keeping potassium safely in range [^113sfSok] [^113LEbE3] [^117QJepm] [^116VQePY].

Irbesartan can cause **hyperkalemia** [^113LEbE3] by blocking aldosterone via AT1 receptor antagonism [^113sfSok], which reduces renal potassium excretion. The risk is **higher in patients with CKD, diabetes, or when combined with potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, or potassium supplements** [^1135kkQV] [^113MwkGx]. In IDNT, potassium > 6.0 mEq/L occurred in 18.6% on irbesartan vs 6.0% on placebo, with 2.1% vs 0.4% discontinuations for hyperkalemia [^113LEbE3] [^11236Ufb]. Routine monitoring of serum potassium is recommended, especially in high-risk patients [^1147RCNo] [^1125hA23]; hyperkalemia is often managed with dietary changes, diuretics, or potassium binders rather than stopping irbesartan [^116VQePY] [^113Rtdb8].

---

## Mechanism of irbesartan-induced hyperkalemia

Irbesartan **blocks the AT1 receptor**, reducing aldosterone and thereby decreasing renal potassium excretion, which can raise serum potassium, particularly in patients with impaired renal function or on other potassium-raising drugs [^113sfSok] [^1135kkQV].

---

## Clinical evidence of hyperkalemia with irbesartan

Clinical trials and postmarketing data show a **dose-dependent increase in serum potassium** with irbesartan, with higher risk in CKD and diabetes:

- **IDNT trial**: Potassium > 6.0 mEq/L in 18.6% on irbesartan vs 6.0% on placebo; discontinuations for hyperkalemia were 2.1% vs 0.4% [^113LEbE3] [^11236Ufb].
- **Postmarketing reports**: Hyperkalemia has been reported with irbesartan monotherapy [^11236Ufb] [^115Wqetq].
- **Combination therapy**: Hyperkalemia risk rises with potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, or potassium supplements [^1135kkQV] [^113MwkGx].

---

## Risk factors for hyperkalemia with irbesartan

Several factors **increase hyperkalemia risk** with irbesartan:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Chronic kidney disease (CKD) | Reduced potassium excretion [^112d5T7d] [^1155wSxQ] |
| Diabetes mellitus | Impaired potassium handling [^112AL756] [^113JwUf2] |
| Concurrent medications | - Potassium-sparing diuretics <br/> - ACE inhibitors <br/> - NSAIDs <br/> - Potassium supplements [^1135kkQV] [^112fTEBd] |
| Age | Elderly patients have higher risk [^115oDXRd] |
| Baseline potassium | Potassium > 4.5 mEq/L increases risk [^113jWG18] |

---

## Clinical significance and management of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can cause **arrhythmias and muscle weakness**; monitor potassium and renal function, especially in high-risk patients [^113MwkGx] [^1147RCNo]. Management includes:

- **Dietary changes**: Reduce potassium intake [^113Rtdb8].
- **Medication adjustments**: Use diuretics or potassium binders [^113Rtdb8].
- **Monitor potassium**: Recheck within 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose changes [^115MCQ91] [^1125hA23].

---

## Comparison with other ARBs

ARBs have a **class effect** of increasing potassium, but risk varies by agent and patient factors. Irbesartan's risk is comparable to other ARBs, with higher risk in CKD and diabetes [^1155wSxQ] [^113LEbE3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend **routine potassium monitoring** with irbesartan, especially in CKD or when combined with potassium-raising drugs; check potassium and renal function 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose changes, and manage hyperkalemia to preserve RAAS blockade when possible [^116xsjtZ] [^1125hA23] [^116VQePY].

---

Irbesartan can cause **hyperkalemia**, particularly in CKD, diabetes, or when combined with other potassium-raising drugs; monitor potassium and manage proactively to maintain the renal and cardiovascular benefits of RAAS blockade [^113LEbE3] [^1147RCNo].

Hyperkalemia risk is greater in patients with diabetes, which may be partly attributed to hyperosmolarity caused by hyperglycemia, resulting in a shift in potassium out of cells. Impaired elimination of potassium can also increase the risk of hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with reduced renal function or those treated with ACE inhibitors, ARBs or potassium-sparing diuretics.

Monitoring potassium levels is an important consideration in patients with diabetes, particularly as these patients often have hypertension and may be treated with ACE inhibitors, ARBs and/or potassium-sparing diuretics, making them more susceptible to hyperkalemia. Likewise, potassium monitoring may be important in patients with renal impairment, who are also considered to be at high risk of hyperkalemia. Clinicians should balance the opposing risks of avoiding hyperkalemia and causing hypokalemia, or vice versa. For example, potassium-sparing diuretics have been shown to prevent diuretic-induced hypokalemia but are associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia. Furthermore, combinations of drugs with an associated risk of hyperkalemia (e.g. ACE inhibitor, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics) or hypokalemia (e.g. thiazides or loop diuretics) may rapidly precipitate serious serum electrolyte abnormalities. Therefore, knowledge of the presence or absence of an effect on potassium homeostasis with antidiabetic drugs is important. Previous studies indicate that dapagliflozin does not affect potassium levels when taken in combination with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazides or loop diuretics.

A limitation of this analysis was the low number of patients in some of the subgroups (i.e. patients on potassium-sparing diuretics or with low eGFR), restricting the reliability of the assessment of risk for the AEs or marked abnormalities in these patients.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining serum potassium monitoring in patients taking potassium-sparing medications, such as some diuretics, ACEis, ARBs, or spironolactone, if dietary potassium is being increased.

### Serum potassium in the PARADIGM-HF trial [^115DFfsZ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

There was also an association between low potassium and higher mortality and the risk associated with low potassium was greater than that found for high potassium and was strengthened in the time‐updated model. Although all patients were on a full dose of enalapril or sacubitril–valsartan, MRA use was less frequent in individuals in the lowest potassium category, in contrast to those with high potassium concentrations. However, MRA use was included in the multivariable adjustment and therefore neither the lower use of MRAs nor the underuse of ACEi or ARBs seem to account for the association between hypokalaemia and higher risk for death. More surprisingly, perhaps, the association between low potassium and outcomes also appeared to lack specificity, with similarly elevated risk for various types of death, as seen with higher potassium concentrations. Moreover, the risk for HF hospitalization was elevated to the same degree as that for overall and cause‐specific mortality. This suggests that the association between hypokalaemia and worse outcomes is non‐specific in nature and low potassium may also be a marker of disease severity. At first sight, this conclusion may seem to be at variance with the finding that the 'correction' of hypokalaemia (and hyperkalaemia) was associated with a better outcome than a persisting abnormality of potassium. However, the patients who shifted from an abnormal to a normal potassium category may have been patients whose clinical status improved.

Discussion

The effect of dapagliflozin on serum potassium levels in over 4000 patients with T2DM across the dapagliflozin clinical trials program, and for a duration of up to 24 weeks was explored. No clinically relevant mean changes from baseline in serum potassium were noted in patients receiving dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo, and few marked abnormalities of serum potassium were reported in either group; all cases resolved without treatment and did not lead to discontinuation. Furthermore, no clinically relevant changes from baseline in serum potassium and no differences in marked abnormalities in serum potassium were reported with dapagliflozin 10 mg compared with placebo in patients at higher risk of hyperkalemia, such as those with moderate renal impairment or those receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors, ARBs or potassium-sparing diuretics. While this analysis indicated that dapagliflozin did not increase hyperkalemia risk in patients with moderate renal impairment, dapagliflozin is not indicated for use in patients with moderate or low renal function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2). The frequency of any hyperkalemia episode (i.e. serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) in the overall pooled population was approximately 9% for both the dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo groups, whereas moderate or severe episodes of hyperkalemia (i.e. patients with a serum potassium level ≥ 6.0 mmol/L) occurred in 3% of patients in both groups. The majority of these episodes were asymptomatic and few AEs of potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L were reported (0.3% vs. 0.0% with dapagliflozin and placebo, respectively).

### Comparative effect of olmesartan and candesartan on lipid metabolism and renal function in patients with hypertension: a retrospective observational study [^111TUoaH]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical trials have shown that ARBs have renoprotective effects in diabetes and can slow the progression of microalbuminuria. Although ARBs have a significant antiproteinuric effect, there may be concern about complications, including increased serum creatinine level and hyperkalemia. In the CHARM (Candesartan in Heart failure-Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity) study, the risk of hyperkalemia increased with addition of candesartan. In the CHARM-Added trial and CHARM-Overall trial, more patients discontinued candesartan than placebo because of adverse effects, particularly hypotension, increased serum creatinine and hyperkalemia. In this study, serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels tended to increase from baseline, but were not significant in both olmesartan and candesartan users. Also, we showed no significant change of potassium level in both olmesartan and candesartan users. Our study, showing no clinically significant aggravation of renal function, suggests that olmesartan or candesartan monotherapy may be safely used for patients with hypertension. The reason for this discrepancy between our study and those trials may be variations in study design and cofounding variables. In the CHARM-Added trial and CHARM-Overall trial, the candesartan group included patients with ACEI treatment. Although combination therapy with an ARB and an ACEI has greater improvement with regard to target organ damage, especially heart failure and proteinuria, it may be associated with complications including worsening of renal function and increased serum potassium level. Therefore, when prescribing an ARB, regular checks of serum potassium and creatinine levels should be performed, especially when combined with an ACEI.

Introduction

Hyperkalemia, defined as a serum potassium level of greater than 5.5 mmol/L, is a potentially life-threatening condition that causes increased cardiac depolarization and can lead to rapid electrocardiographic changes and an increased risk of arrhythmias. Conversely, hypokalemia is defined as a serum potassium level of less than 3.5 mmol/L (mild) or less than 2.5 mmol/L (severe) and can lead to an increase in the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. In addition to the risk associated with serum potassium outside the normal range (i.e. below or above normal levels), maintaining stable serum potassium values within physiological levels is important, as high serum potassium fluctuations are associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of hyperkalemia and diabetes is an independent risk factor for hyperkalemia. In an outpatient population of patients with diabetes, the prevalence of hyperkalemia has been estimated at 4%, whereas in a separate investigation in the general population, it has been estimated to be lower (0.3%). Additionally, diabetes is associated with a high incidence of renal impairment, which in turn is an independent risk factor for hyperkalemia.

Antihypertensive medications, which are frequently prescribed to these patients, can also increase serum potassium. For example, medications that reduce renal potassium excretion by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)], and drugs that inhibit the epithelial sodium channel (known as potassium-sparing diuretics) are associated with a greater hyperkalemia risk. The combination of an ACE inhibitor or ARB and a potassium-sparing diuretic is likely to further increase potassium levels and has been shown to precipitate life-threatening hyperkalemia in patients with diabetes. Conversely, other diuretics such as thiazides or loop diuretics are generally associated with an increased risk of hypokalemia.

Older patients with diabetes have an increased susceptibility to hyperkalemia due to a number of factors, including an age-related decline in renal function and pharmaceutical side effects, such as those associated with ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment.

Monitoring

In the general patient population, potassium levels are often elevated. Approximately 6.8% of the Japanese population is estimated to have hyperkalemia (defined as at least two serum potassium readings ≥ 5.1 mEq/L) based on the results of a medical database analysis. Similarly, a Swedish study examining 364,955 patients who accessed healthcare over a 3-year period revealed a 7% incidence of hyperkalemia (defined as potassium > 5 mEq/L) with a 35.7% rate of recurrence.

Regular monitoring allows drug dosages to be adjusted based on serum potassium levels. A long-term potassium monitoring study in patients with heart failure suggested that maintenance of serum potassium levels within the normal range should be considered a therapeutic target, allowing clinicians to modify treatment and mitigate risks to improve clinical outcomes for patients. In patients with diabetes being treated with an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or spironolactone, compared with no monitoring, regular monitoring of serum potassium has been shown to decrease the risk of hyperkalemia-related adverse events (adjusted relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.37–0.66). According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, the suggested frequency of serum potassium monitoring after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy is as follows: every 4–12 weeks for serum potassium ≤ 4.5 mEq/L, every 2–4 weeks for 4.6–5 mEq/L, and more frequently than every 2 weeks for > 5 mEq/L. The American Heart Association states that potassium levels and renal function should typically be checked on days 3 and 7 after initiating therapy with aldosterone antagonists and then at least monthly for the first 3 months. However, the frequency of serum potassium measurement is not described in the guidelines published by the Japanese Society of Nephrology or Japanese societies related to CVD.

To avoid the risk of false positive findings, serum potassium levels need to be measured carefully. Causes of false positives include hemolysis, delay in sample processing, long-term cold storage, and contamination of blood samples with antiseptics or potassium salts from blood collection tubes. Careful collection techniques and proper sample handling and storage are therefore essential.

Additional suggestions for clinicians intending to prescribe RAASis include pretreatment GFR and baseline serum potassium determination (to identify or exclude high-risk patients), dosage titration, and discontinuation of potassium supplements or concomitant maintenance treatment with loop or thiazide diuretics.

8.7 Renal Impairment

Patients with renal impairment have reduced urinary excretion of potassium and are at substantially increased risk of hyperkalemia. Patients with impaired renal function, particularly if the patient is on ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should usually be started at the low end of the dosing range because of the potential for development of hyperkalemia. The serum potassium level should be monitored frequently. Renal function should be assessed periodically.

Renin–angiotensin system therapy in diabetes — monitor for increased serum creatinine and increased serum potassium when ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are used, or for hypokalemia with diuretics, at routine visits and 7–14 days after initiation of therapy or a dose change; an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is not recommended for the primary prevention of CKD in people with diabetes who have normal blood pressure, normal UACR (< 30 mg/g creatinine), and normal eGFR; and continue renin-angiotensin system blockade for mild to moderate increases in serum creatinine (≤ 30%) when there are no signs of extracellular fluid volume depletion.

Renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy in chronic kidney disease — practice points are as follows: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose. Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m^2). Consider starting people with CKD with normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1) on RASi (ACEi or ARB) for specific indications (e.g., to treat hypertension or heart failure with low ejection fraction). Continue ACEi or ARB in people with CKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m^2.

### Better renoprotective effect of angiotensin II antagonist compared to dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker in childhood [^117QLLp5]. Kidney International (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the angiotensin II antagonist irbesartan effectively reduce blood pressure in hypertensive children.

Methods

Eligible for the open-label, randomized study were nephropathic children between 6.0 and 18 years of age with plasma creatinine < 177 micromol/L, overt proteinuria, untreated arterial hypertension (systolic, 5 to 30 mm Hg; and diastolic, 1 to 15 mm Hg; > 95th centile) and stable immunosuppressive treatment. The initial dose of amlodipine was 5 mg (body weight, 20 to 40 kg) and 10 mg (body weight, > 40 kg), respectively, that of irbesartan, which was 75 mg (body weight, 20 to 40 kg) and 150 mg (body weight, > 40 kg), respectively. The dosage was doubled if necessary.

Results

A total of 26 children aged 6.1 to 17 years were allocated to receive either amlodipine (N = 13) or irbesartan (N = 13) for 16 weeks. Severe edema and headache occurred in two patients on amlodipine who withdrew from the study. No adverse experiences were noted in patients given irbesartan. Amlodipine [by 12 (10 to 14)/7 (5 to 10) mm Hg; median and interquartile range, respectively] and irbesartan [by 13 (9 to 16)/9 (7 to 11) mm Hg, respectively] reduced blood pressure (P < 0.01) in a similar fashion. Heart rate, plasma sodium, and creatinine did not change. Irbesartan slightly increased plasma potassium [by 0.1 (0.0 to 0.2) mmol/L; P < 0.05]. Plasma albumin and the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio were similar before and with amlodipine. On the contrary, irbesartan increased plasma albumin [by 4 (3 to 5) g/L; P < 0.03] and decreased the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio [by 242 (68 to 312) mg/mmol; P < 0.03].

Conclusion

The study demonstrates that in children the effect of angiotensin II antagonists on proteinuria is better than that of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

### Irbesartan (Avapro) [^113uZvKr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system, and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Irbesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively binding to the AT1angiotensin II receptor found in many tissues (e.g., vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). There is also an AT2receptor in many tissues, but it is not involved in cardiovascular homeostasis.

Irbesartan is a specific competitive antagonist of AT1receptors with a much greater affinity (more than 8500-fold) for the AT1receptor than for the AT2receptor and no agonist activity.

Blockade of the AT1receptor removes the negative feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II do not overcome the effects of irbesartan on blood pressure.

Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE or renin or affect other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be involved in the cardiovascular regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In healthy subjects, single oral irbesartan doses of up to 300 mg produced dose-dependent inhibition of the pressor effect of angiotensin II infusions. Inhibition was complete (100%) 4 hours following oral doses of 150 mg or 300 mg and partial inhibition was sustained for 24 hours (60% and 40% at 300 mg and 150 mg, respectively).

In hypertensive patients, angiotensin II receptor inhibition following chronic administration of irbesartan causes a 1.5-fold to 2-fold rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration and a 2-fold to 3-fold increase in plasma renin levels. Aldosterone plasma concentrations generally decline following irbesartan administration, but serum potassium levels are not significantly affected at recommended doses.

In hypertensive patients, chronic oral doses of irbesartan (up to 300 mg) had no effect on glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, or filtration fraction. In multiple dose studies in hypertensive patients, there were no clinically important effects on fasting triglycerides, total cholesterol or HDL-cholesterol concentrations. There was no effect on serum uric acid during chronic oral administration, and no uricosuric effect.

### Adequate intake of potassium does not cause hyperkalemia in hypertensive individuals taking medications that antagonize the renin angiotensin aldosterone system [^116SJRPS]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Reduced potassium excretion caused by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase the risk of hyperkalemia (serum potassium concentration > 5 mmol/L) in the setting of increased potassium intake.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of increasing dietary potassium on serum potassium concentration in hypertensive individuals with normal renal function treated with an ACEi or ARB. We hypothesized that an increase in dietary potassium would not provoke hyperkalemia in this population despite treatment with either an ACEi or ARB.

Design

We conducted a controlled, parallel-design clinical trial in 20 hypertensive subjects with normal renal function treated with an ACEi or ARB, with random assignment to a usual diet or a high-potassium diet (HKD). Fruit and vegetable intake was used to increase potassium intake. Serum potassium concentration, 3-d food records, and 24-h urine collections were completed at baseline and 4 wk.

Results

In the usual-diet group there were no statistically significant differences for potassium excretion, intake, or serum levels at end of study compared with baseline. The HKD group had significant differences in urinary potassium excretion (83 ± 26 mmol/d at baseline compared with 109 ± 35 mmol/d at 4 wk, P = 0.01) and dietary potassium intake (3775 ± 1189 mg/d at baseline compared with 5212 ± 1295 mg/d at 4 wk, P = 0.02). Despite increased potassium intake in the HKD group, serum potassium concentrations did not significantly increase from baseline at midpoint or end of study (4.1 ± 0.6, 4.3 ± 0.3, and 4.2 ± 0.4 mmol/L, respectively).

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that an increase in dietary potassium over a 4-wk period is safe in hypertensive subjects who have normal renal function and are receiving ACEi and/or ARB therapy. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02759367.

Chronic renal failure with Hypertension

Hypertension can be caused by chronic kidney disease(CKD) but it itself can worsen the renal failure. The guidelines state that management of hypertension in CKD should focus on reducing BP, with some also emphasizing reducing protein excretion. Choice of agent will primarily depend on the presence of proteinuria as there is a direct relationship between the degree of proteinuria and progression to end stage renal disease. In proteinuric kidney first line agents include an ACEIor ARB, and often requires the addition of a diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. Diuretics are a useful alternative for non-proteinuric patients or as an add-on to renin-angiotensin system blockade. Multiple drug therapy is often needed to maintain BP below the 90th percentile target, but adequate BP control is essential for better renal and cardiovascular long-term outcomes. Thiazide diuretics can be used if glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is greater than or equal to 40 mL per minute per 1.73m 2 (body surface area), and loop diuretics are used in GFR less than or equal to 40 to 50 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 Various trials like AASK (African American Study of Kidney Disease), IDNT (Irbesartan in Diabetic Nephropathy Trail), RENAAL (Reduction of Endpoints in Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan) show significant risk reduction for CKD progression when proteinuria was reduced by greater than 30% at 6 months.

Recently, combined therapy with an ACEI and an ARB has been shown to provide a greater reduction in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) than monotherapy with either of these agents in patients with diabetic nephropathy. However, such combinations may be associated with potential hazards, including increased serum potassium concentrations and worsening of renal anemia, especially in patients whose kidney function is mildly to moderately impaired.

Fogari et al. evaluated the effect of a combination therapy with the ARB telmisartan and the long-acting CCB amlodipine on urinary albumin excretion rate(UAER) in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. The results of this study demonstrated that the high-dose telmisartan/low-dose amlodipine combination was as effective as low-dose telmisartan/high-dose amlodipine combination in reducing BP values during the 48-week study period without affecting glycemic control or electrolyte plasma levels, but the effect on UAER was significantly more pronounced with the high-dose telmisartan combination, despite equivalent BP-lowering effect.

7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Co-administration of losartan with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

7.2 Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use.

7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
(NSAIDs) Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including losartan) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving losartan and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including losartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

7.4 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy.

The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes (VA NEPHRON-D) trial enrolled 1,448 patients with type 2 diabetes, elevated urinary-albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR 30 to 89.9 mL/min), randomized them to lisinopril or placebo on a background of losartan therapy and followed them for a median of 2.2 years. Patients receiving the combination of losartan and lisinopril did not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy for the combined endpoint of decline in GFR, end stage renal disease, or death, but experienced an increased incidence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury compared with the monotherapy group.

In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on losartan and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with losartan in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with losartan in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min).

Clinical Approach for Monitoring

First, appropriate monitoring of patients at the initiation and shortly after the commencement of therapy with RAASi is critical. Careful monitoring and cautious dose adjustment are absolutely essential to successfully maintain high‐risk patients on maximal RAASi therapy.

Before starting or changing RAASi dose, it is necessary to completely review prescribed (eg, trimethoprim or β‐blockers, both shown to increase serum potassium) and over‐the‐counter medications (such as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory agents), in addition to assessing intravascular volume status. Having an accurate assessment of the patient's ideal weight is helpful in this regard. Patients significantly lower than their target body weight may already be sodium avid and not provide the distal sodium delivery needed to support potassium excretion. Patients who are significantly greater than their target body weight may have cardiac decompensation, which will reduce renal blood flow, activate the RAAS, and reduce distal sodium delivery. It is important to avoid starting or increasing RAASi dose until patients are optimized with regard to intravascular volume, with stable kidney function, and when other medications that increase serum potassium have been stopped or reduced as much as possible. Clearly starting RAASi in the setting of hyperkalemia is not advisable. Repeat laboratory testing 10 to 14 days after delaying or after starting or changing RAASi dose is important and should include close monitoring once a stable RAASi dose is achieved. The intervals for monitoring should be tailored to the patient's history and comorbidities but at a minimum at least every 4 months.

7.2 Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of thiazide diuretics or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including telmisartan. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide and lithium.

7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors

Telmisartan

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ARBs, including telmisartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. The antihypertensive effect of ARBs may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Therefore, monitor renal function and blood pressure periodically in patients receiving telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide and NSAIDs.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, including a selective COX-2 inhibitor, can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics. Therefore, when telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective COX-2 inhibitors are used concomitantly, observe closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111FakZw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — special populations and medication effects on renin with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy: Achieving an increase in renin with MRA therapy is challenging in individuals with CKD, and the ability to produce and secrete renin may be impaired with advanced CKD and higher MRA doses, which may increase the risk for hyperkalemia, so targeting an increase in renin in CKD may not always be a feasible or practical clinical objective. It is reasonable to treat individuals with PA and CKD with MRAs as long as serum potassium is monitored, and when encountering hyperkalemia in CKD, the use of loop diuretics, sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT2) inhibitors, and potassium binders has been shown to mitigate the risk of MRA-induced hyperkalemia in RCTs. The use of some concurrent medications may confound the interpretation of renin, as β-Adrenergic blockers can lower renin secretion; high dietary sodium intake can lower renin, whereas a sodium-restricted diet can increase renin; and diuretics are a confounder as they increase renin.

### Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (avalide) [^115CxnzT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2	Pharmacodynamics

Irbesartan

In healthy subjects, single oral irbesartan doses of up to 300 mg produced dose-dependent inhibition of the pressor effect of angiotensin II infusions. Inhibition was complete (100%) 4 hours following oral doses of 150 mg or 300 mg and partial inhibition was sustained for 24 hours (60% and 40% at 300 mg and 150 mg, respectively).

In hypertensive patients, angiotensin II receptor inhibition following chronic administration of irbesartan causes a 1.5-fold to 2-fold rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration and a 2-fold to 3-fold increase in plasma renin levels. Aldosterone plasma concentrations generally decline following irbesartan administration, but serum potassium levels are not significantly affected at recommended doses.

In hypertensive patients, chronic oral doses of irbesartan (up to 300 mg) had no effect on glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow or filtration fraction. In multiple dose studies in hypertensive patients, there were no clinically important effects on fasting triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, or fasting glucose concentrations. There was no effect on serum uric acid during chronic oral administration and no uricosuric effect.

Hydrochlorothiazide

After oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours.

Drug Interactions

Hydrochlorothiazide

Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics: Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.

Skeletal muscle relaxants: Possible increased responsiveness to muscle relaxants such as curare derivatives.

Corticosteroids, ACTH: Intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia.

Pressor amines (e.g., norepinephrine): Possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use.

Irbesartan

Irbesartan is an orally active agent that does not require biotransformation into an active form. The oral absorption of irbesartan is rapid and complete with an average absolute bioavailability of 60% to 80%. Following oral administration of irbesartan, peak plasma concentrations of irbesartan are attained at 1.5 to 2 hours after dosing. Food does not affect the bioavailability of irbesartan.

Irbesartan exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range.

The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan averaged 11 to 15 hours. Steady-state concentrations are achieved within 3 days. Limited accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing.

Importantly, hyper‐ and hypokalemia have been shown to independently contribute to mortality in several observational studies. Collins and colleagues published data in 2017 from > 900 000 patients demonstrating that all‐cause mortality continuously increased with potassium values above or below the 4.0 to 5.0 mEq/L range. 5 As well, in a large meta‐analysis of population‐based evaluations of dietary sodium and potassium intake, reduced potassium intake associates significantly with patient mortality. With all of these concerns, how do we rectify the competing risks and benefits of RAASi therapy and hyperkalemia in CHF and CKD patients?

### Strategies to meet lower blood pressure goals with a new standard in angiotensin II receptor blockade [^115WHzoc]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

The continued poor rates of blood pressure (BP) control to the recommended target BP of < 140/90 mm Hg in patients with hypertension indicate a persistent need for improved antihypertensive therapy. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) constitute the newest approved class of antihypertensive agents. As with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, ARBs block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, but do so through a more specific mechanism. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, but angiotensin II may be produced by several alternate pathways. Angiotensin II receptor blockers, by contrast, inhibit the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, independent of the pathway of angiotensin II production. Comparative safety and efficacy trials indicate that ARBs are similar to other antihypertensive drugs in terms of BP-lowering effectiveness and have superior tolerability. Olmesartan medoxomil is the newest and one of the most effective of the ARBs. In controlled trials, it has been shown to provide 24-h BP control with antihypertensive efficacy at least as good as that of the calcium channel blockers amlodipine besylate and felodipine and the beta-blocker atenolol. In a comparative study, olmesartan medoxomil demonstrated significantly greater reductions in diastolic BP than did three other leading ARBs-losartan potassium, irbesartan, and valsartan. With the convenience of placebo-like tolerability and once-daily dosing, combined with excellent antihypertensive efficacy, olmesartan medoxomil may be a useful addition to our management of hypertension.

In patients who are elderly, volume depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including irbesartan) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not coadminister aliskiren with irbesartan in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with irbesartan in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min)

### A clinical trial in type 2 diabetic nephropathy [^114JByww]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

A prospective, randomized, three-armed, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial has been completed in 210 sites worldwide to determine whether the angiotensin II receptor blocker irbesartan or the calcium channel blocker amlodipine has a renoprotective effect in patients with overt type 2 diabetic nephropathy. A total of 1,715 subjects randomized during a 3-year period were followed a minimum of 2 years. The goal for all treatment groups was to achieve equivalent blood pressure control, with the blinded study drug (irbesartan, amlodipine, or placebo) as primary therapy with additional antihypertensive drugs, excluding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, to achieve seated systolic blood pressure less than 135 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure less than 85 mm Hg. The primary outcome was the combined endpoint of time to doubling of entry serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease, or death. Secondary outcomes included fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. A Clinical Management Committee monitored the conduct of the study. An Outcome Confirmation Committee classified all study outcome events in blinded fashion. An external Data Safety Monitoring Committee monitored unblinded data for interim safety and efficacy analyses of the study. Eligibility criteria included informed consent, age 30 to 70 years, adult-onset diabetes, hypertension, urine protein excretion greater than 900 mg/24 hours, and serum creatinine values of 90 to 265 micromol/L in women and 110 to 265 micromol/L in men. Baseline characteristics were age, 59 ± 8 years; body mass index, 31 ± 7 kg/m(2); 67% male; 73% white, 14% black, and 13% other; duration of diabetes, 15 ± 9 years; retinopathy, 66%; neuropathy, 48%; congestive heart failure, 7.5%; screening seated systolic blood pressure, 156 ± 18 mm Hg, and diastolic blood pressure, 85 ± 11 mm Hg; urine protein excretion, 4.0 ± 3.5 g/24 hours; serum creatinine, 150 ± 53 micromol/L; serum potassium, 4.6 ± 0.5 mEq/L; total cholesterol, 229 ± 58 mg/dL; and hemoglobin A(1c), 8.1 ± 1.7%. This large-scale international trial should help define the clinical course and standards of care for hypertensive adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy. Results available on May 19, 2001, will help in defining the current controversy of the risks and benefits of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system versus calcium channel blockade versus standard antihypertensive therapy in this large patient population.

### Irbesartan [^113sfSok]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system, and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Irbesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively binding to the AT1angiotensin II receptor found in many tissues (e.g., vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). There is also an AT2receptor in many tissues, but it is not involved in cardiovascular homeostasis.

Irbesartan is a specific competitive antagonist of AT1receptors with a much greater affinity (more than 8500-fold) for the AT1receptor than for the AT2receptor and no agonist activity.

Blockade of the AT1receptor removes the negative feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II do not overcome the effects of irbesartan on blood pressure.

Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE or renin or affect other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be involved in the cardiovascular regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In healthy subjects, single oral irbesartan doses of up to 300 mg produced dose-dependent inhibition of the pressor effect of angiotensin II infusions. Inhibition was complete (100%) 4 hours following oral doses of 150 mg or 300 mg and partial inhibition was sustained for 24 hours (60% and 40% at 300 mg and 150 mg, respectively).

In hypertensive patients, angiotensin II receptor inhibition following chronic administration of irbesartan causes a 1.5-fold to 2-fold rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration and a 2-fold to 3-fold increase in plasma renin levels. Aldosterone plasma concentrations generally decline following irbesartan administration, but serum potassium levels are not significantly affected at recommended doses.

In hypertensive patients, chronic oral doses of irbesartan (up to 300 mg) had no effect on glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, or filtration fraction. In multiple dose studies in hypertensive patients, there were no clinically important effects on fasting triglycerides, total cholesterol or HDL-cholesterol concentrations. There was no effect on serum uric acid during chronic oral administration, and no uricosuric effect.

Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Serum potassium

Overall, no incidence of serum potassium level ≥ 6.0 mEq/L was observed, although the risk of hyperkalemia with esaxerenone and risk of hypokalemia with trichlormethiazide are known class effects. The percentage of patients with serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mEq/L was higher in the esaxerenone group than the trichlormethiazide group, but the incidence was lower than in other studies of esaxerenone. The incidence of serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mEq/L was higher in the ARB subgroup than the CCB subgroup (esaxerenone: ARB, 4.2% and CCB, 0.6%), but the ARB subgroup had lower eGFR and higher UACR than the CCB subgroup, suggesting that more patients with impaired renal function were in the ARB subgroup. Since renal dysfunction, as well as ARB use, are known risk factors for hyperkalemia, our results do not necessarily suggest that esaxerenone is less compatible with ARBs than CCBs. In fact, there was no notable difference in serum potassium levels at 12 weeks between the ARB and CCB subgroups (esaxerenone: 4.22 ± 0.37 and 4.25 ± 0.33 mEq/L, respectively). Thus, even with the addition of esaxerenone to an ARB, serum potassium elevation can be managed in the same way when added to a CCB by dose reduction and titration of esaxerenone along with regular serum potassium monitoring according to the package insert. The serum potassium trend peaked at Week 2 and decreased thereafter, suggesting that monitoring in the early stages of administration may be more important.

### Serum potassium in the PARADIGM-HF trial [^111Sp68S]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

PARADIGM‐HF

The design, methods and principal results of the PARADIGM‐HF trial have been previously reported. 13 In brief, the trial was a randomized, double‐blind, prospective comparison of the effect of sacubitril (97 mg) and valsartan (103 mg) administered twice daily (LCZ696, 200 mg twice daily) and that of enalapril (10 mg twice daily) in 8399 patients with chronic HF [New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II–IV] and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤ 40%. Prior to randomization, all participants underwent single‐blind, sequential run‐in periods to ensure the tolerability of both study drugs at target doses. Eligible patients were those treated with an appropriate regimen of background HF medications at stable doses for at least 4 weeks, including an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (at a dose equivalent to enalapril 10 mg/day or greater) and a beta‐blocker (unless not tolerated). The use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) was left to the discretion of the investigators but was encouraged if tolerated. Key exclusion criteria included symptomatic hypotension, a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of < 100 mmHg at screening or 95 mmHg at randomization, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of < 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 at screening/randomization or a decrease in the eGFR of > 25% (amended to 35%) between screening and randomization, and a serum K + level of > 5.2 mmol/L at screening or > 5.4 mmol/L at randomization. Serum K + was measured at every study visit (Supplementary material online, Table S1). The protocol recommended that any patient with serum potassium of > 5.3 mmol/L after randomization required regular, repeated checks of potassium concentration (beyond that prescribed in the protocol) until it was clear that the potassium concentration was stable and not rising to levels of concern (≥ 5.5 mmol/L and < 6.0 mmol/L) or potential danger (≥ 6.0 mmol/L). 13 No recommendation for dose adjustment in the setting of hypokalaemia was given. The primary composite endpoint was death from cardiovascular (CV) causes or first hospitalization for HF (CV death/HF hospitalization). The present analysis also examines CV, all‐cause and sudden cardiac death (or resuscitated cardiac arrest). The median follow‐up time was 810 (range: 564–1069) days or 116 (range: 81–153) weeks. The trial was approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each participating site, and all participants provided written informed consent prior to participation.

### Irbesartan [^114febe9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Irbesartan tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Irbesartan tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover study.

Patients and Methods

Blood pressure and hormonal responses to 2-week courses of placebo/irbesartan (150 mg/day given by mouth at 08.05 h) were assessed in 10 patients with hyperaldosteronism. Clinic blood pressure was measured by sphygmomanometer, and plasma concentrations of aldosterone, cortisol, angiotensin II, electrolytes and renin activity (PRA) were determined weekly. Automated 24 h ambulatory blood pressure recordings were made at the end of the active and placebo phases.

Results

Irbesartan caused a post-dose decrease in ambulatory blood pressure (systolic, P = 0.02; diastolic, P = 0.05) in the period from 10.00 h to 20.00 h. Clinic blood pressure, measured at trough, was not significantly decreased. Plasma aldosterone decreased (P < 0.03) and PRA increased (P < 0.04) in the first week of active treatment with irbesartan, but differences between the placebo and active-treatment groups were not significant in the second week. There were no significant changes in plasma concentrations of angiotensin II, cortisol or potassium in either week. In the second week of irbesartan treatment, there were associations between change in plasma aldosterone and maximal change in ambulatory blood pressure (systolic and diastolic).

Conclusion

Irbesartan has a role in combination antihypertensive treatment of patients with hyperaldosteronism.

4 Pediatric Use In infants with histories of in utero exposure to an angiotensin II receptor antagonist observe for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required as means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE or renin or affect other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be involved in the cardiovascular regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis.
12. 2 Pharmacodynamics In healthy subjects, single oral irbesartan doses of up to 300 mg produced dose-dependent inhibition of the pressor effect of angiotensin II infusions. Inhibition was complete 4 hours following oral doses of 150 mg or 300 mg and partial inhibition was sustained for 24 hours.

In hypertensive patients, angiotensin II receptor inhibition following chronic administration of irbesartan causes a 1. 5- to 2-fold rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration and a 2- to 3-fold increase in plasma renin levels. Aldosterone plasma concentrations generally decline following irbesartan administration, but serum potassium levels are not significantly affected at recommended doses.

Conclusions

MR blockers, including the new agent esaxerenone, have antihypertensive activity and organ protective effects. However, a careful approach to therapy and proper management of serum potassium is required to ensure safe clinical use of these agents. This includes awareness of at-risk patient groups, choosing appropriate dosages for therapy initiation and dosage titration, and monitoring of serum potassium during therapy. It is important that physicians take these important factors into consideration to optimize MR blocker therapy in patients with hypertension.

### Clinical impact of suboptimal RAASi therapy following an episode of hyperkalemia [^116ZjmAN]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis) have been shown to reduce blood pressure and proteinuria, delay estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline, and lower the risk of kidney failure, cardiovascular morbidity, and all-cause mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). They also decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure (HF). Evidence-based guidelines for medical therapy for CKD and HF support the use of RAASis at the maximum tolerated dose to achieve optimal treatment benefits. However, RAASis also increase the risk of hyperkalemia (HK), mediated by blockade of the RAAS and reducing renal potassium excretion. HK is an electrolyte disorder characterized by elevated levels of serum potassium (sK +). If left untreated, HK can lead to fatal cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. In a population-based cohort study, 28% of patients with CKD and 39% of patients with HF had at least one episode of HK, which occurred at a median of 1.2 and 0.6 years from the first CKD or HF diagnosis, respectively. In addition, 40% of CKD and 49% of HF patients had a recurrent episode of HK within 6 months. A meta-analysis found that RAASi treatment was associated with a 2-fold higher risk of HK compared with control groups not receiving RAASis.

### Serum potassium as a predictor of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease: new risk equations using the UK clinical practice research datalink [^114czH4D]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Approximately half of patients (48.06%) received RAASi therapy, with ACE inhibitors being the most commonly used agent (35.36%). When stratified according to baseline serum potassium, patients with increasing potassium levels were typically more likely to receive ACE inhibitors, ARBs and MRAs. Other frequently prescribed medications included statins (43.14%), diuretics (40.19%), β-blockers (25.30%), and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (23.78%).

In the absence of CKD-specific dosing guidelines, Table 2 presents the proportion of patients who received RAASi agents at doses recommended in European Society of Cardiology guidelines for heart failure management. Over one-third of patients receiving ACE inhibitors or MRAs (36.11% and 36.02%, respectively) achieved the target maintenance dose for these therapies; in contrast, 3.28% of those receiving ARBs achieved the target dose. The majority of ARB-treated patients (59.48%) achieved less than 50% of the recommended target dose, compared to 37.38% of patients receiving ACE inhibitors. No patients in receipt of MRAs achieved less than 50% of the recommended target dose.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II to IV symptoms, an MRA (spironolactone or eplerenone) is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality if eGFR is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium is < 5.0 mEq/L, with careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and thereafter. In this population, MRA therapy provides high economic value. In patients taking MRA whose serum potassium cannot be maintained at < 5.5 mEq/L, MRA should be discontinued to avoid life-threatening hyperkalemia. MRAs show consistent improvement in all-cause mortality, HF hospitalizations, and SCD in HFrEF, and eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L are contraindications to MRA initiation.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hyperkalemia: Patients with decreased renal function, diabetes, proteinuria or patients who are taking ACEs and ARBs, NSAIDs or moderate CYP3A inhibitors are at increased risk. Monitor serum potassium levels and adjust dose as needed. (5.1)

5.1 Hyperkalemia

The risk of hyperkalemia is higher in patients with impaired renal function, proteinuria, diabetes and those concomitantly treated with ACEs, ARBs, NSAIDs and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Minimize the risk of hyperkalemia with proper patient selection and monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.2), and Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor patients for the development of hyperkalemia until the effect of INSPRA is established. Patients who develop hyperkalemia (5.5–5.9 mEq/L) may continue INSPRA therapy with proper dose adjustment. Dose reduction decreases potassium levels. Patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors that cannot be avoided should have their dose of eplerenone reduced [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Comparative effect of angiotensin II type I receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers on laboratory parameters in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes [^112DY61Q]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we evaluated and compared the effects of ARB and CCB monotherapy on biochemical parameters including serum TG, TC, non-fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, sodium, potassium, creatinine, ALT, AST and GGT and hematological parameters including hemoglobin, hematocrit, and WBC, RBC and PLT counts in patients with mild to moderate hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found a significant reduction of serum TC, HbA1c, hemoglobin, hematocrit and RBC count in ARB users, and a reduction of serum TC and hemoglobin level in CCB users, from the baseline period to during the exposure period. The reductions of RBC count, hemoglobin and hematocrit in ARB users were significantly greater than those in CCB users. The increase of serum potassium level in ARB users was significantly greater than that in CCB users. These results suggest that hematological adverse effects and electrolyte imbalance are greater with ARB monotherapy than with CCB monotherapy.

It is known that renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, ACEIs and ARBs, occasionally cause anemia, while having protective effects on various organs. Valsartan decreases hematocrit in recipients of kidney transplantation. Losartan decreases hematocrit, hemoglobin and erythrocyte count in recipients of kidney transplantation. In animals, candesartan decreases hematocrit, hemoglobin, erythrocyte count, and erythropoietin level in the rat. Confirming these previous reports, our 'real-world' study showed adverse effects of ARB monotherapy on hemoglobin, hematocrit and RBC count.

There are some reports that the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, including ARBs, is associated with hyperkalemia. The serum level of potassium is significantly higher in ARB users than in CCB users after renal transplantation. The relative risk of hyperkalemia was 2-fold higher with dual therapy (ARB plus ACEI) than with monotherapy (ARB or ACEI). Use of ARBs and ACEIs is associated with a high prevalence of hyperkalemia, and the prevalence of hyperkalemia is significantly higher in ARB users than in ACEI users. Supporting these previous reports of hyperkalemia, our study showed that ARB monotherapy caused electrolyte imbalance with respect to the serum level of potassium. Our study, in combination with previous reports, suggested that regular checks of serum potassium level may be advisable in ARB users.

Age

Distal renal tubule function and the ability to eliminate potassium decline as age increases. As a result, elderly individuals are at increased risk of developing hyperkalemia, especially those who also have CKD or CVD. In a group of patients with heart failure, the mean (± standard deviation) age was significantly older in those with serum potassium > 5.0 mEq/L (76 ± 9 years) than in those with lower potassium levels (73 ± 11 years). Similarly, in a retrospective study of patients with CVD and CKD, patients with hyperkalemia were significantly older (66.1 ± 10.3 years) than those with normal potassium levels (63.9 ± 11.2 years). The results of another retrospective analysis using electronic medical records showed that older patients were at greater risk of developing hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.0 mEq/L) than younger patients (OR (95% CI) values for age 45–64, 65–74, and ≥ 75 years versus age 18–44 years were 1.41 (1.36–1.47), 1.66 (1.59–1.73) and 1.72 (1.65–1.79), respectively).

RAASi medication

Treatment with antihypertensive agents, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), a direct renin inhibitor, and MR blockers are all known to increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Elevated serum potassium levels are observed with single-agent administration, and the level increases further with combination therapy. A systematic review showed that a combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and an ARB resulted in a small, but significant, increase in serum potassium levels (weighted mean difference, 0.11 mEq/L; 95% CI 0.05–0.17).

In a study of normokalemic patients with hypertension who were randomly assigned to treatment with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, the diuretic chlorthalidone, or the CCB amlodipine, the incidence of hyperkalemia was found to be greater in the patients treated with lisinopril (3.6%) than in those treated with either of the other agents (p < 0.01 for both). In another study of patients with systemic hypertension, monotherapy with either the ACE inhibitor enalapril or the MR blocker eplerenone was associated with elevated serum potassium levels.

### Effects of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker on potassium in CAPD patients [^116hMuC6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have shown numerous benefits to the cardiovascular system. However, using both drugs is associated with hyperkalemia, especially in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. To the authors' knowledge, there has been no prospective systematic study of the safety and potassium homeostasis of both drugs in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients.

Methods

Twenty-nine stable, normokalemic CAPD patients without potassium-interference drugs were selected randomly to receive, for 4-week periods, 8 mg candesartan or 10 mg enalapril daily. After completion of the initial drug, both treatment groups were crossed.

Results

Twenty-one patients completed the study. Baseline blood pressure, serum potassium level, plasma aldosterone, adequacy of dialysis, and residual renal function were not different between both groups. For the total group, serum potassium changes were not significantly different between baseline and at 4 weeks after treatment in both groups. The incidence of hyperkalemia (potassium ≥ 5.5 mEq/L [mmol/L]) was 13% and not different between groups. Nine of 11 events of hyperkalemia were associated with Kt/V urea less than 2, and 8 of 11 had low or low-average peritoneal equilibrium tests.

Conclusion

In ESRD patients on CAPD, the standard dose of ACE inhibitor, enalapril, or ARB, candesartan, has little effect on serum potassium, despite drops of plasma aldosterone observed. Both drugs should be considered in CAPD patients with hypertension or cardiovascular complications. However, use of both drugs requires caution in patients with inadequate dialysis or low solute transporters, and dietary noncompliant patients as well.

### Potassium homeostasis and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors [^1155wSxQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a key strategy in treating hypertension and cardiovascular and renal diseases. However, RAAS inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and direct renin inhibitors) increase the risk of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L). This review evaluates the effects on serum potassium levels of RAAS inhibitors. Using PubMed, we searched for clinical trials published up to December 2008 assessing the effects on serum potassium levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and direct renin inhibitors, alone and in combination, in patients with hypertension, heart failure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD); 39 studies were identified. In patients with hypertension without risk factors for hyperkalemia, the incidence of hyperkalemia with RAAS inhibitor monotherapy is low (≤ 2%), whereas rates are higher with dual RAAS inhibition (approximately 5%). The incidence of hyperkalemia is also increased in patients with HF or CKD (5% to 10%). However, increases in serum potassium levels are small (approximately 0.1 to 0.3 mmol/L), and rates of study discontinuation due to hyperkalemia are low, even in high-risk patient groups (1% to 5%). Patients with HF or CKD are at greater risk of hyperkalemia with RAAS inhibitors than those without these conditions. However, the absolute changes in serum potassium are generally small and unlikely to be clinically significant. Moreover, these patients are likely to derive benefit from RAAS inhibition. Rather than denying them an effective treatment, electrolyte levels should be closely monitored in these patients.

### Management of hyperkalaemia consequent to mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist therapy [^117Stwit]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

Mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists (MRAs) reduce blood pressure and albuminuria in patients treated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II-receptor blockers. The use of MRAs, however, is limited by the occurrence of hyperkalaemia, which frequently occurs in patients older than 65 years with impaired kidney function, and/or diabetes. Patients with these characteristics might still benefit from MRA therapy, however, and should not be excluded from this treatment option. This limitation raises the question of how to optimize the therapeutic use of MRAs in this population of patients. Understanding the individual variability in patients' responses to MRAs, in terms of albuminuria, blood pressure and serum potassium levels, might lead to targeted intervention. MRA use might be restricted to patients with high levels of mineralocorticoid activity, evaluated by circulating renin and aldosterone levels or renal excretion of potassium. In addition, reviewing the patient's diet and concomitant medications might prove useful in reducing the risk of developing subsequent hyperkalaemia. If hyperkalaemia does develop, treatment options exist to decrease potassium levels, including administration of calcium gluconate, insulin, β(2)-agonists, diuretics and cation-exchange resins. In combination with novel aldosterone blockers, these strategies might offer a rationale with which to optimize therapeutic intervention and extend the population of patients who can benefit from use of MRAs.

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^113MwkGx]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2 Risk factors of hyperkalemia

Abnormal serum potassium concentrations represent one of the most important electrolyte disorders in clinical practice. In this regard, potassium plays a critical role in normal cell membrane electrophysiology, with both hyperkalemia and hypokalemia leading to electrophysiological perturbations. While mild hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic, high potassium concentrations can cause life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or paralysis. The kidneys play a central role in potassium homeostasis. Kidney dysfunction and acquired or inherited defects in potassium excretion in the distal nephron are among the most important risk factors for hyperkalemia. Accordingly, the main risk factors for hyperkalemia are kidney failure, diabetes mellitus, and adrenal disease.

An international meta‐analysis of over 1.2 million patients with CKD from 27 different cohorts examined the risk factors leading to hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia correlated strongly with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): a decrease in eGFR of 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 approximately doubled the risk of hyperkalemia. While lower eGFR was a strong risk factor for hyperkalemia, higher albuminuria was a weaker risk factor. Furthermore, medications such as potassium‐sparing diuretics, MRAs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, direct renin antagonists, β‐blockers, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, heparin, and penicillin are associated with hyperkalemia. Potassium supplements and potassium‐based salt substitutes may also be a cause of hyperkalemia, especially in patients with underlying CKD or concomitant use of hyperkalemia‐inducing drugs.

### Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^113wjJwo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Irbesartan

Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the RAS and also stimulates aldosterone synthesis and secretion by adrenal cortex, cardiac contraction, renal resorption of sodium, activity of the sympathetic nervous system, and smooth muscle cell growth. Irbesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively binding to the AT1angiotensin II receptor. There is also an AT2receptor in many tissues, but it is not involved in cardiovascular homeostasis.

Irbesartan is a specific competitive antagonist of AT1receptors with a much greater affinity (more than 8500-fold) for the AT1receptor than for the AT2receptor, and no agonist activity.

Blockade of the AT1receptor removes the negative feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II do not overcome the effects of irbesartan on blood pressure.

Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE or renin or affect other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be involved in the cardiovascular regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis. Because irbesartan does not inhibit ACE, it does not affect the response to bradykinin; whether this has clinical relevance is not known.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.

The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.

### Discontinuing renin-angiotensin system inhibitors after incident hyperkalemia and clinical outcomes: target trial emulation [^116p7reh]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The neutral association between RASi discontinuation after incident hyperkalemia and kidney outcome may imply that hyperkalemia diminishes the kidney protective effect of RASi. Notably, hyperkalemia induces aldosterone secretion independently of the renin-angiotensin system. Thus, it can be speculated that RASi-related hyperkalemia may contribute to aldosterone breakthrough, thereby attenuating the benefits of these drugs. In this case, RASi might confer their protective effect if hyperkalemia can be appropriately controlled and/or MRAs are used concomitantly, although such evidence is currently lacking. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the role of serum potassium levels on the efficacy of RASi.

A post-hoc analysis of the STOP-ACEi trial suggested the difference between ACEIs and ARBs. While discontinuation of ACEIs showed an increased risk of kidney failure or KRT initiation, discontinuation of ARBs did not significantly affect kidney outcomes, though the statistical power was limited. Since more than 80% of our patients received ARBs, our findings may not apply to discontinuation of ACEIs.

### The management of hyperkalemia in patients with cardiovascular disease [^113km3w7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The development of hyperkalemia is common in patients with cardiac and kidney disease who are administered drugs that antagonize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). As the results of large-scale clinical trials in hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure demonstrate benefits of RAAS blockade alone or, in some cases, in combination therapies, the incidence of hyperkalemia has increased in clinical practice. Although there is potential for adverse events in the presence of hyperkalemia, there also are potential benefits of RAAS blockers that support their use in high-risk patient populations. Management of hyperkalemia may be improved by identifying the levels of potassium that may potentially induce harm and using appropriate strategies to avert the levels that may be dangerous or life threatening.

### Renal effects of aliskiren compared with and in combination with irbesartan in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and albuminuria [^114txtVi]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The most frequent adverse events were urinary tract infection (four patients, one male), pneumonia (three patients), and cough (three patients), occurring during different treatments. Anemia and hypomagnesemia were detected in two patients during the combination treatment. Compared with each monotherapy, combination treatment showed an increase in plasma potassium by 0.2 mmol/l (P = 0.036). No patients developed hyperkalemia (defined as plasma potassium > 5.5 mmol/l). There were no incidences of hypotension. One patient dropped out during the placebo period after several systolic blood pressure readings > 180 mmHg.

Two patients died before the first measurement of albuminuria after the randomization and were not included in the final end point analysis. The first death was that of a 42-year-old obese man (BMI 42 kg/m 2) with a history of ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and hypertension 4 years before study entry. The patient experienced sudden cardiac arrest, seemingly after a myocardial infarction during aliskiren treatment. The second death was that of a hypertensive, obese, 73-year-old man with diabetes duration of 16 years. Sudden death was possibly caused by a pulmonary embolism during the placebo period. The deaths were instantly reported to relevant authorities and were not suspected as being related to any of the drugs studied. Subsequently, home blood pressure measurement frequency was increased from twice weekly to twice daily, and patients were instructed to contact the investigator by direct phone (available around the clock), if any measurement was > 160/100 mmHg. Extra measurements of sodium, potassium, and creatinine were introduced 3 weeks into each treatment period.

### Effects of sacubitril-valsartan in the treatment of chronic heart failure patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis [^114PLQTx]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In clinical practice, potential deterioration of renal function is often the biggest limiting factor for prescribing LCZ696 in CKD patients. Thus, the safety of LCZ696 in renal function and electrolytes has also attracted much attention in various studies. In the subgroup analysis of PARADIGM‐HF and PARAMOUNT‐HF trails, it was found that LCZ696 delayed the deterioration of renal function in patients with HFrEF or HFpEF compared with RAAS inhibitors, but eGFR persisted in 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. The UK HARP‐III trial demonstrated that in CKD (GFR 20–60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) patients that LCZ696 had no additional protective effect on kidney function or albuminuria compared with irbesartan, but it lowered BP and cardiac biomarker levels. Therefore, the effects of LCZ696 on renal function in overall CKD patients require further study, especially in ESRD patients. Our results showed that LCZ696 treatment did not have a significant effect on SCr and serum potassium levels in CHF patients with ESRD on dialysis. This may be because ESRD patients only have residual renal function or total loss of renal function, and therefore SCr and serum potassium levels did not show significant improvement during follow‐up. Nevertheless, the use of LCZ696 in ESRD patients was relatively safe in terms of renal function and electrolytes.

Several limitations of this study should be recognized. First, the study is a single‐center retrospective study with a small sample size and short follow‐up time. It was therefore difficult to assess the long‐term changes of cardiac and renal function. Second, this study is a retrospective cohort study with unmeasured confounding factors (including duration of HF, HF types, and etiology of HF and CKD). Finally, all the patients selected in this study are ESRD on dialysis patients, and thus the effects of volume load could not be excluded. Therefore, larger prospective, long‐term follow‐up studies including RCT should be warranted. At the same time, prospective and retrospective studies in the real world are also needed to provide clinical evidence in the future.

### Impact of renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibition on serum potassium levels among peritoneal dialysis patients [^114spaLn]. American Journal of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The chronic use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blocker has been associated with hyperkalemia in patients with reduced renal function even after the initiation of hemodialysis. Whether such medications may cause a similar effect in peritoneal dialysis patients is not well established. So, the aim of our study was to analyze the impact of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors on the serum levels of potassium in a national cohort of peritoneal dialysis patients.

Method

A prospective, observational, nationwide cohort study was conducted. We identified all incident patients on peritoneal dialysis that had angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) prescribed for at least 3 months and a similar period of time without these medications. Patients were divided into 4 groups: Groups I and III correspond to patients using, respectively, an ACEi or ARB and then got the drug suspended; Groups II and IV started peritoneal dialysis without the use of any renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitor and then got, respectively, an ACEi or ARB introduced. Changes in potassium serum levels were compared using 2 statistical approaches: (1) the non-parametric Wilcoxon test for repeated measures and (2) a crossover analysis.

Results

Mean potassium serum levels at the first phase of the study for Groups I, II, III, and IV were, respectively, 4.46 ± 0.79, 4.33 ± 0.78, 4.41 ± 0.63, and 4.44 ± 0.56. Changes in mean potassium serum levels for Groups I, II, III, and IV were -0.10 ± 0.60, 0.02 ± 0.56, -0.06 ± 0.46, and 0.03 ± 0.50, respectively.

Conclusion

The use of ACEi and ARB was not associated with a greater risk for hyperkalemia in stable peritoneal dialysis patients independently of residual renal function.

Despite the guideline recommendations advocating the use of ACEis/ARBs in patients with T2D and CKD, reported rates of the use of these agents remain low. Although specific data regarding the use of ACEis/ARBs in patients with T2D and CKD are lacking, rates of use in patients with CKD and hypertension are low (only 36% of patients received an ACEi/ARB between 2010 and 2014) and have decreased since 2006. There is evidence to suggest that patients with CKD who are comanaged by a PCP and a nephrologist have higher ACEi/ARB prescription rates and that patients with more severe renal impairment are more likely to receive an ACEi/ARB when they have received care from both a PCP and a nephrologist compared with a PCP alone. Notably, PCPs may have reservations about prescribing ACEis/ARBs given the potential risk for developing hyperkalemia. To mitigate the risk of hyperkalemia, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines recommend starting ACEi/ARBs at a lower dose and titrating upwards in patients with an eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Importantly, eGFR and serum potassium should be monitored within a few weeks of a patient starting an ACEi/ARB. If hyperkalemia develops, consideration for a nephrology referral is appropriate. Additional strategies that can be considered include identification and restriction of dietary potassium, treatment of metabolic acidosis where required, initiation/up titration of thiazide or loop diuretic(s) to increase potassium excretion, and treatment with a potassium-binding exchange resin.

### ASN kidney health guidance on potassium and phosphorus food additives [^114XbkSR]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Potassium additives — clinical relevance and homeostasis — Higher potassium consumption is shown to be associated with cardiovascular and kidney health, but as kidney function declines the risk of hyperkalemia increases and potassium additives are often overlooked as a source of potassium intake. There is strong evidence that dietary potassium can acutely raise serum potassium levels in the postprandial period, and once absorbed, potassium is shifted into the cells in an insulin-dependent and aldosterone-dependent process. Ingested potassium stimulates an acute kaliuretic response through feed-forward and feedback mechanisms with natriuretic effects, but these regulatory mechanisms are impaired as kidney function declines and are further blunted by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — initial combination therapy and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) — Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a diuretic, and replacing thiazide-type diuretics with thiazide-like diuretics may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that the addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour systolic BP (SBP) by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and eGFR ≥ 45 mL/ min/1.73 m2, with reductions greater than with doxazosin, bisoprolol, or clonidine. Nevertheless, 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects; eplerenone is a potential alternative, but RCTs have not demonstrated reduction of home BP or 24-hour BP at doses between 25 and 100 mg daily and effective treatment may require higher dosages, and nonsteroidal MRA for moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not been tested in a clinical trial but may be considered in selected patients with close monitoring of serum potassium.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in CKD [^115MCQ91]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

KDOQI US commentary — RAS inhibitor safety, monitoring, and hyperkalemia management: Since RAS inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia, monitoring for hyperkalemia within 1–2 weeks after initiation remains appropriate. Although serum creatinine concentrations often increase acutely with RAS inhibitor initiation, an initial increase of ≤ 30% followed by stabilization within 2 months is associated with long-term preservation of kidney function. Therefore, every effort to maintain adequate dosing of RAS inhibitors, even in individuals more likely to develop hyperkalemia, could be useful, and an approach to maintain adequate RAS inhibition may be facilitated by dietary restrictions and/or potassium binders. The guideline also notes that the concurrent use of ACEIs and ARBs or inclusion of direct renin inhibitors in conjunction with an ACEI or ARB increases adverse outcomes and should be avoided. Consistent with practice point 1.2.6, ACEIs or ARBs should only be reduced or discontinued as a last resort in patients with hyperkalemia, and a recent retrospective cohort study found a higher risk of death and major cardiovascular outcomes after discontinuation of ACEI or ARB therapy in individuals who reached eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

### Association of serum potassium time in target range with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with HFpEF [^1173Htm4]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the frequency of potassium monitoring in the TOPCAT trial, we recommended the schedule for sK measurements as follows: first, the sK levels should be measured prior to initiating ACEI/ARB/diuretic therapy; then, they should be monitored again within 1 week of drug administration. For those patients with abnormal potassium levels, repeat measurement within 7 days was recommended. For those patients with stable potassium levels, it is recommended to monitor the potassium levels every 4 weeks and eventually extend to 6-month intervals. In cases involving medication adjustment, potassium monitoring should be carried out within 1 week of the adjustment. To effectively maintain sK levels, interventions for hyperkalaemia include dietary potassium restriction, reduction of RAAS inhibitor usage and the use of newer medications. Potassium binders or dialysis may be required for precise potassium control in specific patients such as those with renal impairment. Conversely, in cases of mild hypokalaemia in patients with HF, it is recommended to increase the dosage of ACEIs/ARBs/angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) to meet guideline-recommended targets. In patients with persistent fluid overload and more severe hypokalaemia, loop diuretics are preferred to manage congestion, and potassium supplementation may also be considered. Further studies are warranted to determine whether aggressive management of dyskalaemia using potassium supplements for hypokalaemia or potassium binders for hyperkalaemia can reduce mortality in patients with HFpEF. The comprehensive application of these measures helps maintain potassium levels within the target range, ensuring long-term potassium stability and improving overall CV outcomes.

### Short-term changes in serum potassium and the risk of subsequent vascular events and mortality: results from a randomized controlled trial of ACE inhibitors [^117TxVCA]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia after starting renin-angiotensin system inhibitors has been shown to be subsequently associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. However, whether to continue or discontinue the drug after hyperkalemia remains unclear.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Data came from the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial, which included a run-in period where all participants initiated angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-based therapy (a fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide). The study population was taken as patients with type 2 diabetes with normokalemia (serum potassium of 3.5 to < 5.0 mEq/L) at the start of run-in. Potassium was remeasured 3 weeks later when a total of 9694 participants were classified into hyperkalemia (≥ 5.0 mEq/L), normokalemia, and hypokalemia (< 3.5 mEq/L) groups. After run-in, patients were randomized to continuation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-based therapy or placebo; major macrovascular, microvascular, and mortality outcomes were analyzed using Cox regression during the following 4.4 years (median).

Results

During active run-in, 556 (6%) participants experienced hyperkalemia. During follow-up, 1505 participants experienced the primary composite outcome of major macrovascular and microvascular events. Randomized treatment of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-based therapy significantly decreased the risk of the primary outcome (38.1 versus 42.0 per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.00; P = 0.04) compared with placebo. The magnitude of effects did not differ across subgroups defined by short-term changes in serum potassium during run-in (P for heterogeneity = 0.66). Similar consistent treatment effects were also observed for all-cause death, cardiovascular death, major coronary events, major cerebrovascular events, and new or worsening nephropathy (P for heterogeneity ≥ 0.27).

Conclusions

Continuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-based therapy consistently decreased the subsequent risk of clinical outcomes, including cardiovascular and kidney outcomes and death, regardless of short-term changes in serum potassium.

7.1	Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Coadministration of AVAPRO with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

7.2	Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan and lithium. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving irbesartan and lithium.

7.3	Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including irbesartan) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

7.4	 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on AVAPRO and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not coadminister aliskiren with AVAPRO in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with AVAPRO in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min).

### High-versus low-dose losartan and serum potassium: an analysis from HEAAL [^113MYhq6]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with heart failure (HF) experience frequent alterations of serum potassium. Despite the high risk of events associated with hypokalemia, hyperkalemia is feared by clinicians and often leads to interruption or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Data on serum potassium of patients treated with different doses of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors are scarce.

Methods and Results

The effects of high-dose vs low-dose losartan on clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure (HEAAL) trial randomized 3834 patients with HFrEF intolerant to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to losartan 150 mg/d (high dose) vs 50 mg/d (low dose). We studied the associations of serum potassium (baseline and time updated) with study outcomes and the effect of the randomized treatment on serum potassium. Patients with higher baseline potassium were older, had diabetes, poorer renal function, and used mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists more frequently. In time-updated models, hyperkalemia (> 5.0 or ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) was not associated with cardiovascular death or the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization. Hypokalemia (serum potassium of ≤ 3.5 mmol/L, in particular) was associated with a higher risk of the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR] 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19–2.08), all-cause death (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.26–2.24), and sudden cardiac death or resuscitated cardiac arrest (HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.11–2.73). High-dose losartan decreased the risk of hypokalemia (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63–0.92) and increased the risk of hyperkalemia (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.05–1.39). High-dose losartan decreased the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalizations consistently across the full spectrum of serum potassium at baseline (interaction P = .85).

Conclusions

In patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction intolerant to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and treated with either high- or low-dose losartan, incident hypokalemia had a stronger association with poor outcomes than incident hyperkalemia. High-dose losartan reduced the incidence of hypokalemia, and its benefits were maintained across the full spectrum of serum potassium.

### Hyperkalemia after initiating renin-angiotensin system blockade: the stockholm creatinine measurements (SCREAM) project [^113jWG18]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE‐I) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have demonstrated efficacy in reducing blood pressure and proteinuria, slowing progression of kidney disease, and improving outcomes in patients with heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and post–myocardial infarction. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 However, these medications have also been associated with adverse events, including hyperkalemia. 6, 7, 8, 9 Although adverse events can occur at any level of kidney function, the risk is thought to be greatest in those with chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure. 6 Thus, concern for adverse effects may lead to underutilization in the subgroups of patients who are expected to derive the greatest benefit. 10

Clinical detection of hyperkalemia requires laboratory evaluation, and close laboratory monitoring is recommended during ACE‐inhibitor or ARB use. The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline on chronic kidney disease evaluation and management recommends assessing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and potassium within 1 week after initiating or increasing the dose of an ACE‐I or ARB, regardless of baseline potassium level. 11 The 2004 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) suggests a more detailed algorithm: monitor laboratory values within the first 4 weeks after initiation or dose change for high‐risk patients (defined as having systolic blood pressure < 120 mm Hg, potassium > 4.5 mmol/L, or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2) and within 4 to 12 weeks for all others. 12 The American Heart Association recommends checking serum electrolytes and creatinine before and 1 week after starting an ACE‐I. 13 Clinical trials suggest that the rate of hyperkalemia after initiating renin–angiotensin system blockade is low 14, 15; however, the frequency of monitoring and rates of hyperkalemia in clinical practice are not well defined.

Do not use in combination with ACEI or direct renin inhibitor. There is an increased risk of hyperkalemia in CKD or in those on K+ supplements or K+-sparing drugs. There is a risk of acute renal failure in patients with severe bilateral renal artery stenosis. Do not use if patient has history of angioedema with ARBs. Patients with a history of angioedema with an ACE inhibitor can receive an ARB beginning 6 weeks after ACE inhibitor is discontinued. Avoid use in pregnancy.

### Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (avalide) [^116ort4P]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

Irbesartan

Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the RAS and also stimulates aldosterone synthesis and secretion by adrenal cortex, cardiac contraction, renal resorption of sodium, activity of the sympathetic nervous system, and smooth muscle cell growth. Irbesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively binding to the AT1angiotensin II receptor. There is also an AT2receptor in many tissues, but it is not involved in cardiovascular homeostasis.

Irbesartan is a specific competitive antagonist of AT1receptors with a much greater affinity (more than 8500-fold) for the AT1receptor than for the AT2receptor, and no agonist activity.

Blockade of the AT1receptor removes the negative feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II do not overcome the effects of irbesartan on blood pressure.

Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE or renin or affect other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be involved in the cardiovascular regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis. Because irbesartan does not inhibit ACE, it does not affect the response to bradykinin; whether this has clinical relevance is not known.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.

The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.

### Management of hyperkalemia during treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers: findings from esaxerenone [^111GvgLG]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In patients with diabetes, multiple studies have reported that treatment with MR blockers, ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or a direct renin inhibitor is associated with an increase in potassium levels and a risk of severe hyperkalemia in a small number of patients. In patients with systolic heart failure, large randomized studies investigating ACE inhibitors or ARBs have demonstrated significant increases in serum potassium during treatment. In one study, the mean serum potassium level increased by 0.2 mEq/L during treatment with enalapril, and the proportion of patients with a serum potassium level > 5.5 mEq/L was significantly higher in the enalapril group than in the placebo group (6.4% vs. 2.5%; p < 0.01). Similarly, the rate of hyperkalemia leading to treatment discontinuation was higher in the candesartan group than in the placebo group in a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) (1.9% vs. 0.3%; p = 0.0005).

Combination therapy has the potential to further worsen the risk of hyperkalemia. In one study, the addition of spironolactone or losartan to ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and albuminuria was associated with significant increases in serum potassium level compared to the outcome in the placebo group (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.03, respectively). In parallel-group RCTs of spironolactone added to an ACE inhibitor and/or ARB, increases in serum potassium ranged between 0.1 and 0.8 mEq/L. Corresponding increases in serum potassium in crossover RCTs were 0.1–0.3 mEq/L, and in nonrandomized trials, they were 0.1–0.4 mEq/L.

Management of hyperkalemia in hypertension

To ensure patient safety, it is important to monitor and manage potassium at a personalized level owing to interindividual variations in risk, symptoms, and treatments.

### Management of hyperkalemia: an update for the internist [^112sDH5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications (especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system) have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represent an undesirable clinical compromise. The emergence of 2 new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies, and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### Irbesartan [^113LEbE3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.

Hypertension

Irbesartan has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more.

In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported in at least 1% of patients treated with irbesartan (n = 1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n = 641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs 1%), and fatigue (4% vs 3%).

Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo.

Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients

Hyperkalemia: In the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) (proteinuria ≥ 900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0–3.0 mg/dL), the percent of patients with potassium > 6 mEq/L was 18.6% in the irbesartan group versus 6.0% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the irbesartan group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group.

In IDNT, the adverse reactions were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms which occurred more frequently in the irbesartan versus placebo group: dizziness (10.2% vs 6.0%), orthostatic dizziness (5.4% vs 2.7%) and orthostatic hypotension (5.4% vs 3.2%).

RAASi/MRA management in CKD with hyperkalemia includes a stepwise approach: Optimize serum bicarbonate levels; Consider potassium-exchange agents; Third-line (Last resort): Reduce or discontinue RAASi/MRA; restart in future if patient condition allows. Providers may consider reducing or stopping ACEI/ARB when eGFR drops below a given eGFR threshold or when hyperkalemia develops, but hyperkalemia associated with use of ACEI/ARB can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping ACEI/ARB. Protocols for RCTs of finerenone held the medication at potassium > 5.5 mmol/L; however, it may be appropriate to continue these medications in people with potassium of 5.5–6.0 mmol/L. We recommend involvement of nephrology when there is consideration of continuing ACEI/ARB/MRA when potassium > 5.5 mmol/L. The International Society of Nephrology provides an Optimization of RAASi Therapy Toolkit that includes guidance for managing hyperkalemia in patients on RAASi.

### Combination therapy in hypertension: an update [^111pcno2]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

ACEIs/ARBs with Diuretics

RAAS inhibitor and a diuretic combination will offset the diuretic-induced increase in plasma renin activity. The salt loss will add to the antihypertensive effect of RAAS blocker. Besides, an ARB will also attenuate the metabolic effects of thiazide diuretics like hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Several studies have demonstrated the antihypertensive effectiveness of this combination in low doses, showing substantially greater reductions in BP and higher response rates than either of the treatments alone.

The Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE), trial compared the effects of BP lowering with a perindopril/indapamide combination or placebo, in high-risk type 2 diabetic subjects. The risk of combined primary outcome, a major macrovascular or microvascular event was reduced by 9% (p = 0.041) with a 14% (p = 0.025) reduction in all-cause mortality and an 18% (p = 0.027) reduction in cardiovascular mortality. The study extrapolated saving one death over 5 years for every 79 patients with this ACEI/Diuretic combination. Similarly clinical studies have shown combination of the ARB, irbesartan with HCTZ to be safe and effective in patients with moderate to severe hypertension, irrespective of baseline BP level, age, obesity, race, diabetic status, and the metabolic syndrome and has a significantly greater dose-dependent BP lowering effect than either agent alone. One study suggested that although a goal BP of < 140/90 mm Hg can be reached in the majority of patients with SBP < 160 mm Hg with irbesartan monotherapy, most patients with moderate to severe (stage 27 or grade 2 or 3) hypertension (baseline SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg) require combination therapy for BP goal to be reached.

### Irbesartan delays progression of nephropathy as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate: post hoc analysis of the irbesartan diabetic nephropathy trial [^114gWar3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) demonstrated that irbesartan significantly slowed established Type 2 diabetic nephropathy progression. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), now widely used to monitor chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, was not previously examined in IDNT. This post hoc analysis aimed to confirm IDNT results using eGFR as principal outcome measure.

Methods

Mean change in eGFR from baseline (ΔeGFR) was analysed using linear mixed-effects models over time and analysis of covariance at end of study on an intention-to-treat basis. Potential treatment response moderators and/or mediators assessed were CKD stage, blood pressure (BP) and proteinuria.

Results

Irbesartan significantly slowed the rate of ΔeGFR decline from 6 to 21 months (P = 0.0048) and 24 to 48 months (P < 0.0001) versus amlodipine and placebo, despite a faster decline in the first month. The longer patients remained on irbesartan the greater the benefit (model-derived estimates for 6–21 and 24–48 month periods were -0.3354 and -0.1947 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/month, respectively). Irbesartan slowed the rate of ΔeGFR decline irrespective of baseline CKD stage, BP or proteinuria level. Irbesartan produced rapid and sustained proteinuria reductions, which only partially mediated treatment response. Irbesartan increased serum potassium, but levels stabilized from 6 to 48 months.

Conclusions

In patients with established Type 2 diabetic nephropathy and CKD Stages 1–5, irbesartan safely and significantly slowed the rate of ΔeGFR decline (-2.34 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year) compared to amlodipine (-3.76 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year) and placebo (-3.52 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year). This rate of decline was slower with longer duration of irbesartan treatment and only partly explained by observed reductions in BP and proteinuria.

### Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^112fTEBd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances

Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide

In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was < 1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide.

Coadministration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide with potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

5.6 Hepatic Impairment

Hydrochlorothiazide

Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.

Future Directions

We propose that if normokalemia with serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L can be achieved with diet and drug modifications, treatment with optimal and maximal RAASi dosing should be continued. Compelling modeling data from Evans and colleagues demonstrate that the treatment of hyperkalemia that allows for continued RAASi use leads to longer life expectancy, delayed progression to end‐stage renal disease, quality‐adjusted life year gains, and cost savings in CKD populations. 11

The available data do not yet provide conclusive evidence of the potential impact on maintaining normokalemia with potassium binders to allow for RAASi use. We need further clinical studies of patients with CHF and advanced CKD taking chronic RAASi in order to evaluate the safety and tolerability with long‐term use of potassium binders for the maintenance of normokalemia.

### Changes in creatinine and potassium levels in chronic kidney disease with RAASIs… [^11148pHJ]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Increases in creatinine level of at least 30%, hyperkalemia, and therapy discontinuation were not associated with ED visits or hospitalizations, which was consistent with results from competing risk analyses. The indicators were initial creatinine level change, sustained creatinine level change, potassium level disturbance, prescription type, and therapy continuation. To better isolate medication effect, only individuals with normal baseline potassium levels were included in analyses of associations between serum potassium level changes. The diuretic group also had poorer baseline kidney function and higher potassium levels. Data were complete for all baseline variables except race and potassium level.

For full comparisons of included and excluded participants by drug class, see eTable 2 in the Supplement. Among individuals with normal baseline potassium level, hyperkalemia occurred in 251 of 2354 and hypokalemia in 64 of 2354 on the first follow-up laboratory measurement. Increases in creatinine level of at least 30%, hyperkalemia, and therapy medication discontinuation were not associated with ED visits or hospitalizations, which was consistent with results from competing risk analyses. Individuals receiving new diuretic prescriptions were included to contextualize these changes, given the prevalence of diuretic use in the outpatient setting in individuals with CKD and frequency of electrolyte disturbances requiring close laboratory monitoring.

Care was taken to minimize comparisons between RAASI and diuretic prescriptions, given the risk of confounding by indication.

Do not use in combination with ACEI or direct renin inhibitor. There is an increased risk of hyperkalemia in CKD. There is a risk of acute renal failure in patients with severe bilateral renal artery stenosis. Do not use if patient has history of angioedema with ARBs. Patients with a history of angioedema with an ACE inhibitor can receive an ARB beginning 6 weeks after ACE inhibitor is discontinued. Avoid use in pregnancy.

Hyperkalaemia

In the UK, NICE guidance suggests measuring serum potassium and eGFR before starting RAAS blockade and repeating the measurements 1–2 weeks after starting RAAS blockade and after each dose increase. NICE further says not to offer these agents if the person's pre-treatment serum potassium is > 5 mmol/L. NICE guidance also suggests that these agents should be stopped if the serum potassium concentration increases to 6 mmol/L or more, and other drugs known to promote hyperkalaemia have been discontinued. However, recent NICE technology appraisals recommend the use of potassium binders, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, in outpatient care for people with persistent hyperkalaemia (≥ 6 mmol/L) and CKD stages 3b to 5 (non-dialysis), who are not taking an optimum dose of RAAS inhibitor because of hyperkalaemia.

A drop in eGFR or an increase in serum creatinine

Given the basic pathophysiological mechanism of RAAS blockade, these agents cause a reduction in eGFR and urinary albumin excretion through efferent and afferent glomerular arteriolar dilatation, with a resultant fall in intra-glomerular blood pressure. A reversible reduction of eGFR of up to 30% can be expected. Greater reductions may indicate underlying renal artery stenosis.

NICE guidance states that if there is a decrease in eGFR of > 25% or an increase in serum creatinine of > 30% with RAAS blockade, renal function tests need to be repeated within 1–2 weeks. If the eGFR drops by 25% or more, or there is a change in serum creatinine by 30% or more, NICE guidance suggests conducting further investigations to identify a cause of renal deterioration, such as sepsis, volume depletion, other acute illneses such as heart failure and myocardial infarction, or non-steroidal inhibitor / potassium-sparing diuretic use. If no other cause for the deterioration in renal function is found, it is recommended to stop the RAAS blockade or reduce the dose to a previously tolerated lower dose, and add an alternative antihypertensive medication if required.

Consideration should also be taken where someone's baseline eGFR is already below 30, especially in those with congestive cardiac failure, where there may be a broader benefit terms of left ventricular function.

Pregnancy

Given the potentially teratogenic nature of RAAS blockade drugs, the KDIGO guidelines suggest that the use of these drugs in women of childbearing age should be balanced with the risk of pregnancy.

Management of hypertension in diabetes and chronic kidney disease — recommended follow-up intervals specify that after initiation or changes in antihypertensive therapy, reassess in < 4 wk when systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) is ≥ 140 or < 120, when GFR (mL/min/1.73 m^2) is < 60, and for serum potassium (mEq/L) if on ACE inhibitor or ARB > 4.5 or if on a diuretic ≤ 4.5; otherwise reassess at 4–12 wk for systolic blood pressure 120–139, for GFR ≥ 60, for potassium if on ACE inhibitor or ARB ≤ 4.5, or if on a diuretic > 4.5. After blood pressure is at goal and drug doses are stable, monitor at 1–6 mo for GFR < 60, GFR decline (mL/min/1.73 m^2/y) ≥ 4, or when risk factors for faster CKD progression or acute GFR decline are Yes, and at 6–12 mo when GFR is ≥ 60, GFR decline is < 4, and risk factors are No.

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^114ZQiCr]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

4 POTASSIUM MANAGEMENT AND POTASSIUM CONCENTRATIONS IN FIDELIO‐DKD and FIGARO‐DKD

In the FIDELIO‐DKD and the FIGARO‐DKD trials, hyperkalemia was reported using thresholds of > 5.5 mmol/L for mild hyperkalemia and > 6.0 to < 6.5 mmol/L for moderate hyperkalemia, in accordance with the latest KDIGO guidance based on the protocol. The earliest time point after which serum potassium was measured in both trials was 1 month after treatment initiation. The second scheduled assessment of serum potassium was at the fourth month after treatment initiation and at 4‐month intervals thereafter. The frequency of potassium monitoring in both trials was consistent with that recommended in the KDIGO guidelines for patients with CKD (3–4 times per year for patients with UACR > 300 mg/g and eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and 2–3 times per year for patients with UACR 30–300 mg/g and eGFR 15–59 ml/min per 1.73 m 2). In both trials, the risk of hyperkalemia from finerenone (14.0%) versus placebo (6.9%) was more than doubled. This occurred despite the fact that potassium‐increasing drugs other than ACE inhibitors and ARBs were prohibited and subjects with baseline potassium concentrations > 4.8 mmol/L were excluded from the trials.

Finerenone had a predictable impact on serum potassium concentrations in both trials with a maximum difference in mean serum potassium between groups of 0.23 mmol/L in FIDELIO‐DKD and 0.16 mmol/L in FIGARO‐DKD. Given the higher mean eGFR in the FIGARO‐DKD trial compared with the FIDELIO‐DKD trial (68 vs. 44 ml/min/1.73 m 2), the incidence of hyperkalemia with finerenone treatment was lower in the former (10.8% vs. 18.3%), despite the longer median follow‐up (3.4 vs. 2.6 years). Of note, a post‐hoc analysis of the FIDELIO‐DKD data showed that independent risk factors for mild hyperkalemia were higher serum potassium, lower eGFR, increased urine albumin/creatinine ratio, younger age, female sex, ß‐blocker use, and finerenone assignment. Diuretic or SGLT2 inhibitor use reduced risk.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) — usual dose ranges and key precautions are as follows: Azilsartan 40–80 mg daily (40 mg with diuretic); Candesartan 8–32 mg daily; Eprosartan 400–800 mg daily (daily or divided bid); Irbesartan 75–300 mg daily; Losartan 25–100 mg/day (daily or divided bid); Olmesartan 20–40 mg daily; Telmisartan 20–80 mg daily; Valsartan 80–320 mg daily. Avoid in women who are planning to become pregnant or who are pregnant; when pregnancy is contemplated or detected, discontinue as soon as possible. Avoid concomitant use of ACEI with an ARB or direct renin inhibitor due to increased risk of hypotension, syncope, increased K+, and changes in kidney function. In general, the lower doses should be considered in patients receiving diuretics. Monitor K+ and kidney function; use caution if combined with K+ sparing diuretic, or K+ supplement. Consider interruption or discontinuation in patients who develop clinically significant decline in kidney function after initiation of therapy, until further work-up, as indicated.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hyperkalemia: Patients with decreased renal function, diabetes, proteinuria or patients who are taking ARBs, NSAIDs or moderate CYP3A inhibitors are at increased risk. Monitor serum potassium levels and adjust dose as needed. (5.1)

5.1 Hyperkalemia

The risk of hyperkalemia is higher in patients with impaired renal function, proteinuria, diabetes and those concomitantly treated with ARBs, NSAIDs and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Minimize the risk of hyperkalemia with proper patient selection and monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.2), and Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor patients for the development of hyperkalemia until the effect of eplerenone is established. Patients who develop hyperkalemia (5.5–5.9 mEq/L) may continue eplerenone therapy with proper dose adjustment. Dose reduction decreases potassium levels. Patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors that cannot be avoided should have their dose of eplerenone reduced [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114wAyzd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The 2023 ESH Guidelines highlight also the main therapeutic challenges with ACEi or ARB treatment. As the vasodilating effect of ACEis or ARBs on the efferent arteriole reduces intraglomerular pressure, eGFR drops commonly by an average of 10%–15% in the first weeks of treatment with these agents (eGFR dip). A similar hemodynamic effect can be seen with large BP reductions offered by any antihypertensive agent. Thus, repeated monitoring of eGFR and blood electrolytes within 4–8 weeks (depending on baseline kidney function) is important when treatment is initiated. Clinicians should not be alarmed by this early GFR drop, but if the decline in GFR continues or is more severe (> 30%), the RAS blocker should be stopped, and the patient should be investigated for the presence of renovascular disease. Use of RAS blockers in CKD patients further increases the risk of hyperkalemia. Incident hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality and is the most frequent reason for dose reduction or discontinuation of ACEis and ARBs in CKD patients. However, reducing the dose or discontinuing RAS blockers has been associated with increased risk of CV events in large observational studies and should be avoided. Novel potassium binders (patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) were shown to effectively normalize elevated serum potassium and chronically maintain normal levels in CKD patients treated with ACEis, ARBs or spironolactone, with good tolerability. Thus, these agents can be used to maintain serum potassium < 5.5 mmol/L in individuals with CKD (CoR II; LoE B).

### Irbesartan [^1148Md8Y]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hypotension: Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration. (5.2)
Monitor renal function and serum potassium. (5.3)

5.1 Fetal Toxicity

Irbesartan can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.2 Hypotension in Volume or Salt-Depleted Patients

In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume or salt-depleted patients (e.g. those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur after initialization of treatment with irbesartan. Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of irbesartan or use a lower starting dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.3 Impaired Renal Function

Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure or death on irbesartan. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on irbesartan [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

### Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^1156Tgxf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

Irbesartan

In patients who are elderly, volume depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Therefore, monitor renal function and blood pressure periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, including a selective COX-2 inhibitor can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.

7.2 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS.

In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors.

Do not coadminister aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min).

7.3 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Coadministration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

7.4 Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin)

Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide.

7.5 Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins

Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and the resin such that irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4 to 6 hours after the administration of the resin.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.

Hypertension

AVAPRO has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more.

In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported in at least 1% of patients treated with AVAPRO (n = 1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n = 641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs 1%), and fatigue (4% vs 3%).

Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo.

Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients

Hyperkalemia: In the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) (proteinuria ≥ 900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0–3.0 mg/dL), the percent of patients with potassium > 6 mEq/L was 18.6% in the AVAPRO group versus 6.0% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the AVAPRO group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group.

In IDNT, the adverse reactions were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms which occurred more frequently in the AVAPRO versus placebo group: dizziness (10.2% vs 6.0%), orthostatic dizziness (5.4% vs 2.7%) and orthostatic hypotension (5.4% vs 3.2%).

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide.

The following have been very rarely reported with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide monotherapies: urticaria, jaundice, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, and impaired renal function including renal failure.

The following have been reported with irbesartan monotherapy: tinnitus, hyperkalemia, angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue), anaphylactic reaction including anaphylactic shock, increased CPK, anemia, and hypoglycemia in diabetic patients.

The following have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy: acute angle-closure glaucoma, acute myopia, and choroidal effusion.

Non-melanoma Skin Cancer

Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In a study conducted in the Sentinel System, increased risk was predominantly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in white patients taking large cumulative doses. The increased risk for SCC in the overall population was approximately 1 additional case per 16,000 patients per year, and for white patients taking a cumulative dose of ≥ 50,000 mg the risk increase was approximately 1 additional SCC case for every 6,700 patients per year.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116xsjtZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances in hypertension — assessment of electrolytes is important for evaluating causes of hypertension and monitoring adverse effects with treatment. A basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension to evaluate for secondary hypertension and should be checked 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of specific antihypertensive medication classes, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). Common laboratory disturbances relate to changes in potassium, sodium, or creatinine; hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide-type and loop diuretics, whereas hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium-sparing diuretics especially when used in combination or in the setting of chronic kidney disease. ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to several trials demonstrating an increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Hyponatremia may be caused by diuretics, in particular thiazide-type diuretics. Strategies to mitigate electrolyte disturbances include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combination use of medications with complementary effects on electrolytes (eg, ACEi plus thiazide-type or loop diuretic, which may normalize potassium levels). Treatment of hyperkalemia can also be managed with initiation of potassium-lowering binders (including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), noting the importance of taking them (primarily patiromer) mid-day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life-threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.
