## Question

Which antibodies are associated with hypothyroidism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibodies are associated with hypothyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the underlying etiologies of hypothyroidism and how often they are autoimmune. Then, I should identify the principal thyroid autoantibodies and their strength of association with autoimmune hypothyroidism. Next, I will review predictive data linking these antibodies to progression to overt hypothyroidism. After that, I need to consider nuances such as TSH receptor–blocking antibodies that can also cause hypothyroidism and clarify their role versus the more typical stimulating antibodies. Finally, I should check for less common or research-only antibodies and flag assay-interfering antibodies that do not cause disease but can confound interpretation, before summarizing practical testing recommendations and limitations [^113Titvo] [^117NG4Uu].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Hold on, I should verify that in iodine-replete regions, autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's) is indeed the leading cause of primary hypothyroidism, which would make thyroid-specific autoantibodies central to this question. Yes, contemporary reviews and epidemiologic summaries consistently state that primary hypothyroidism most commonly results from autoimmune thyroiditis in such settings, anchoring antibodies as key markers of disease mechanism and diagnosis [^113Titvo] [^117NG4Uu].

> Next, I should identify the core antibodies implicated in autoimmune hypothyroidism. Let me think about which are most sensitive and clinically informative. Anti–thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) are the principal serologic hallmark, present in roughly 90–95% of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, whereas anti–thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) occur in about 60–70% and are less specific; TPOAb is therefore the primary test to support autoimmune hypothyroidism in practice, with TgAb as a secondary marker that can augment sensitivity but adds less specificity [^116xZmMN] [^114o2J7T] [^112TFeGE].

> Wait, let me verify prognostic data, because the question often implies not only association but risk of progression. I should double-check longitudinal evidence and guideline statements. In a 13‑year community cohort, both TPOAb and TgAb positivity independently predicted future hypothyroidism, with optimized cutoffs performing better than conventional reference limits, and guidelines emphasize measuring anti‑TPO in the evaluation of subclinical hypothyroidism because antibody positivity increases the likelihood of progression to overt disease over time; pooled analyses similarly link anti‑TPO positivity to higher annual progression rates from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism, reinforcing their prognostic value [^115E5Cxy] [^112kECDT] [^116khaDr] [^114zDFsD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about TSH receptor antibodies. My first instinct is to say "TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) are for Graves' disease, so they are not associated with hypothyroidism". Hmm, wait a minute — this is too simplistic. I should confirm the blocking subset. Indeed, while stimulating TRAb drive Graves' hyperthyroidism, TSH receptor–blocking antibodies can cause primary hypothyroidism, and there are documented autoimmune switches from stimulating to blocking dominance leading to hypothyroidism; so, TRAb are associated with hypothyroidism when the functional phenotype is blocking rather than stimulating, albeit less commonly than TPOAb/TgAb in Hashimoto's [^1153WgAb] [^115AvGEM].

> I will now examine less common and research-stage antibodies. Let me consider whether antibodies against other thyroidal proteins occur and if they matter clinically. Pendrin has been identified as an autoantigen recognized in autoimmune thyroid disease with higher frequency in Hashimoto's than in Graves', but assays are not standardized for routine care; likewise, detailed work on the TPO autoantigen and its immunodominant regions explains why TPOAb are ubiquitous in autoimmune hypothyroidism, though these mechanistic insights do not add routine diagnostic tests beyond TPOAb/TgAb at present [^113zrrNG] [^115GrMqe].

> But wait, what about antibodies that confuse the picture without causing hypothyroidism. I should confirm if anti‑T4 or anti‑T3 antibodies matter diagnostically. Yes, antithyroid hormone antibodies can spuriously alter thyroid function assays and generate discordant results, potentially obscuring the diagnosis; they are assay interferents rather than pathogenic drivers of hypothyroidism and should be suspected when lab patterns are inconsistent with the clinical picture [^1141qfQ5].

> Let me think about how to translate this into practical testing. I need to ensure I align with guideline-driven evaluation. For suspected autoimmune hypothyroidism, TSH and free T4 establish thyroid status, and anti‑TPO is the recommended antibody test to support Hashimoto's; TgAb can be considered as an adjunct but is less predictive and mainly relevant when adding sensitivity or when interpreting thyroglobulin in thyroid cancer follow‑up, while TRAb testing is not routine for hypothyroidism unless blocking activity is suspected clinically; importantly, antibody positivity, especially TPOAb, signals higher risk of progression when TSH is elevated but free T4 is normal, which guides follow‑up and shared decision-making around treatment thresholds [^113oU9wq] [^112kECDT] [^115E5Cxy] [^114zDFsD].

The key antibodies associated with hypothyroidism are **anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies** [^1153Xypb], present in ~90% of Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^116xZmMN] [^114o2J7T] and the most sensitive marker for autoimmune hypothyroidism. Anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) antibodies are found in ~60–70% of Hashimoto's [^116xZmMN] and are **less specific** [^1171SszC]. TSH receptor-blocking antibodies (TBAb) [^1153WgAb] are rare but can **cause hypothyroidism by blocking TSH signaling** [^115AvGEM]. Anti-TPO positivity predicts progression [^115E5Cxy] from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism [^114zDFsD] and is used in diagnosis and monitoring [^112kECDT].

## Thyroid autoantibodies

| **Antibody** | **Prevalence and clinical significance** | **Pathophysiological role** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) | Present in approximately 90% of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the most common cause of hypothyroidism [^114o2J7T] [^1153Xypb]; most sensitive and specific marker for autoimmune hypothyroidism [^116xZmMN] | Targets thyroid peroxidase, essential for thyroid hormone synthesis; indicates ongoing autoimmune destruction of thyroid tissue leading to hypothyroidism [^115GrMqe] | Routinely measured to confirm autoimmune hypothyroidism and to predict progression from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism [^114zDFsD] |
| Anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) | Present in approximately 60–70% of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^116xZmMN]; less specific and can be found in healthy individuals [^1171SszC] | Targets thyroglobulin, a precursor protein in thyroid hormone synthesis; indicates autoimmune thyroid inflammation and destruction | Measured alongside anti-TPO, particularly when anti-TPO is negative, to help confirm autoimmune hypothyroidism |
| TSH receptor-blocking antibodies (TBAb) | Less common than anti-TPO and anti-Tg; can cause hypothyroidism by blocking the TSH receptor [^1153WgAb] [^115AvGEM] | Binds to the TSH receptor and inhibits TSH signaling, reducing thyroid hormone production and causing hypothyroidism | Measured in specific scenarios (e.g. congenital hypothyroidism or hypothyroidism following hyperthyroidism) to confirm diagnosis and guide management [^115AvGEM] |

## Clinical implications of antibody positivity

Anti-TPO antibody positivity **increases the risk of progression** from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism [^114zDFsD], and longitudinal data show a higher likelihood of developing overt disease [^115E5Cxy]. In patients with positive thyroid antibodies, **regular monitoring of thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4)** and antibody levels is recommended to detect early progression and to initiate appropriate treatment.

## Summary of antibodies associated with hypothyroidism

| **Antibody** | **Prevalence in Hashimoto's thyroiditis** | **Clinical significance** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Anti-TPO | ~90% [^1153Xypb] | Highly specific marker for autoimmune hypothyroidism | Diagnosis and monitoring |
| Anti-Tg | ~60–70% [^116xZmMN] | Less specific marker for autoimmune hypothyroidism | Diagnosis (adjunctive) |
| TBAb | Rare [^1153WgAb] | Causes hypothyroidism by blocking TSH receptor | Specific clinical scenarios |

---

Anti-TPO, anti-Tg, and TBAb are the **primary antibodies** associated with hypothyroidism [^113Gct4P]. Anti-TPO antibodies are the **most sensitive and specific marker** for autoimmune hypothyroidism [^116xZmMN], while anti-Tg antibodies are less specific but still clinically useful [^1171SszC]. TBAb are less common but can cause hypothyroidism by blocking the TSH receptor [^1153WgAb]. The presence of these antibodies has significant clinical implications, including predicting progression from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism [^115E5Cxy] and guiding monitoring and management strategies [^113oU9wq].

### Thyrotropin and thyroid antibodies as predictors of hypothyroidism: A 13-year, longitudinal study of a community-based cohort using current immunoassay techniques [^115E5Cxy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Longitudinal studies of risk factors for hypothyroidism are required to inform debate regarding the TSH reference range. There are limited longitudinal data on the predictive value of thyroid antibodies measured by automated immunoassay, as opposed to semiquantitative methods.

- **Methods**: We measured TSH, free T(4), thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs), and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs) using the Immulite platform on sera from 1,184 participants in the 1981 and 1994 Busselton Health Surveys. Outcome measures at follow-up were hypothyroidism, defined as TSH greater than 4.0 mU/liter or on thyroxine treatment, and overt hypothyroidism, defined as TSH above 10.0 mU/liter or on thyroxine treatment. Receiver-operator characteristic analysis was used to determine optimal cutoffs for baseline TSH, TPOAbs, and TgAbs as predictors of hypothyroidism.

- **Results**: At 13-year follow-up, 110 subjects (84 women) had hypothyroidism, of whom 42 (38 women) had overt hypothyroidism. Optimal cutoffs for predicting hypothyroidism were baseline TSH above 2.5 mU/liter, TPOAbs above 29 kIU/liter, and TgAbs above 22 kIU/liter, compared with reference range upper limits of 4.0 mU/liter, 35 kIU/liter, and 55 kIU/liter, respectively. In women with positive thyroid antibodies (TPOAbs or TgAbs), the prevalence of hypothyroidism at follow-up (with 95% confidence intervals) was 12.0% (3.0–21.0%) when baseline TSH was 2.5 mU/liter or less, 55.2% (37.1–73.3%) for TSH between 2.5 and 4.0 mU/liter, and 85.7% (74.1–97.3%) for TSH above 4.0 mU/liter.

- **Conclusions**: The use of TSH cutoffs of 2.5 and 4.0 mU/liter was supported by the data, although the article appears to be abruptly truncated.

### Thyroid function, autoimmunity, thyroid volume, and metabolic profile in people with Hashimoto thyroiditis [^116xZmMN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

The thyroid gland is the most affected organ by autoimmune diseases. Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) represents the foremost prevalent endocrine disorder and the principal cause of hypothyroidism.

The diagnosis of HT requires an evaluation including clinical features, serological detection of antibodies against thyroid antigens, such as thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin, and characteristic findings on thyroid ultrasound. Anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOab) emerge as the best serologic hallmark for establishing an HT diagnosis due to their specificity and sensitivity. TPOab are detectable in nearly 95% of HT patients while rare in healthy controls, in contrast to anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (Tgab), antibodies against the most abundant protein on the thyroid gland, which are positive in approximately 60−70% of patients (less sensitive) and are also present in a higher number and proportion of healthy controls (less specific).

Hypothyroidism from Hashimoto's disease becomes more common with advancing age, with a predilection for women and individuals with concomitant autoimmune conditions. Clinical hypothyroidism is defined as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations surpassing the reference range alongside decreased free thyroxine (FT4) concentrations, while subclinical hypothyroidism delineates TSH concentrations above the reference range despite normal FT4 concentrations.

Thyroid glands affected by autoimmune diseases can show a hypoechogenic pattern. These structural changes usually precede autoantibodies detection and other laboratory alterations.

### Antithyrotropin receptor antibody: an update [^1153WgAb]. Thyroid (2001). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have reported the characteristics and significance concerning antithyrotropin receptor antibodies (TSHR-Abs), which cause Graves' disease and, in some cases, primary hypothyroidism. However, many unsolved questions concerning those antibodies remain. Here, recent developments in the study of TSHR-Abs are reviewed based on three aspects: mechanisms of TSHR-Ab production, antibody binding epitopes, and clinical TSHR-Ab assays.

- **Mechanisms of TSHR-Ab production**: Discussed from five points of view: aberrant expression of the major histocompatibility complex, dysregulation of T cells, molecular mimicry, bystander effect, and expansion of autoreactive B cells.

- **Antibody binding epitopes**: Unique TSHR-Abs have been reported that may explain the complicated pathophysiology of patients with TSHR-Ab diseases.

- **Clinical TSHR-Ab assays**: Recent efforts to improve TSHR-Ab measurements are introduced. Such efforts will contribute to clinical examinations and treatments for thyroid diseases as well as experimental methods of thyroidology.

### A genetic risk score for thyroid peroxidase antibodies associates with clinical thyroid disease in community-based populations [^1153Xypb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPOAbs) are detected in 90% of all patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis, the most common cause of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is associated with a range of adverse outcomes. Knowledge of its genetic underpinnings is limited. The purpose of this study was to identify novel genetic variants associated with TPOAb concentrations and positivity using genome-wide association data and to characterize their association with thyroid function and disease.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: We studied European ancestry participants of three independent prospective population-based studies: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (n = 7,524), Study of Health in Pomerania (n = 3,803), and Study of Health in Pomerania-TREND (n = 887).

- **Exposure**: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), individually and combined into a genetic risk score (GRS), were examined.

- **Main outcomes**: The main outcomes were TPOAb concentrations and positivity, thyroid hormone concentrations (TSH, free T4), and clinical thyroid diseases (subclinical and overt hypothyroidism and goiter).

- **Results**: Significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (P < 5 × 10⁻⁸) mapped into four genomic regions not previously implicated for TPOAbs (RERE, extended HLA region) and into five previously described loci. A higher Genetic Risk Score (GRS) based on these nine SNPs showed strong and graded associations with higher TPOAb, TSH, and lower free T4 concentrations (P < .001). Compared with individuals in the lowest GRS quartile, those in the highest quartile had…

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^113pqc6f]. Endocrine Practice (2002). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency.

Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient.

Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician, as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### Autoimmune thyroid disorders in autoimmune Addison disease [^112TFeGE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

TPOAb predicts progression to overt hypothyroidism in patients with subclinical disease. Dalin and colleagues found the presence of TPOAbs in 57% of all AAD patients. We found an unexpectedly large proportion of patients with hypothyroidism without TPOAbs (32%), indicating misdiagnosis. According to the existing literature, high serum TPOAb concentrations are present in 90% of patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis. TPOAb levels decline over time in most patients, but rarely become negative.

- **Hypothyroidism diagnosis**:
	- Furthermore, half of the patients with hypothyroidism diagnosed after the onset of AAD had only mildly elevated TSH, and 25% of these lacked TPOAbs. AAD patients have higher TSH levels when glucocorticoids are withheld or intake is delayed. Taken together, these observations indicate that autoimmune hypothyroidism is overdiagnosed among AAD patients and that even a mild elevation of TSH triggers levothyroxine treatment.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^112MvNzt]. Thyroid (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for thyroid disease in pregnancy, specifically concerning the thyrotropin receptor antibody, the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend measuring TSH receptor antibody levels in patients treated with radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy for Graves' disease before pregnancy. This should be done using a sensitive assay initially during the first trimester thyroid function testing. If levels are elevated, testing should be repeated at 18–22 weeks of gestation.

### Identification of novel genetic loci associated with thyroid peroxidase antibodies and clinical thyroid disease [^114o2J7T]. PLoS Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), including Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease, is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, affecting 2–5% of the general population. Thyroid dysfunction has been associated with osteoporosis, depression, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, metabolic syndrome, and mortality. High serum antibodies against the enzyme thyroid peroxidase (TPO), located in the thyroid and playing a key role in thyroid hormone synthesis, are present in 90% of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This condition is the most frequent cause of hypothyroidism and goiter. Although TPO antibodies (TPOAbs) are a useful clinical marker for the detection of early AITD, whether these antibodies play a causative role in the pathogenesis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis remains controversial.

Interestingly, TPOAb-positive individuals also have an increased risk of developing autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease), which is caused by stimulating antibodies against the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor. Numerous studies have shown that Graves' hyperthyroidism and Hashimoto's thyroiditis exhibit co-inheritance. Furthermore, thyroid autoimmunity is the most common autoimmune disorder in women of childbearing age, and TPOAb-positive women have an increased risk of developing pregnancy complications such as miscarriage and pre-term delivery.

The prevalence of TPOAb-positivity in the general population ranges from 5–24%. However, it is currently unknown why these individuals develop TPOAbs, nor is it known why not all individuals with thyroid autoimmunity do.

### Cord blood metabolomics reveals gestational metabolic disorder associated with anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies positivity [^111ZXZbX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease is one of the common endocrine disorders affecting pregnant women, in which thyroid autoimmunity can alter the progress and the outcome of pregnancy. Women with euthyroid status but anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies positivity before pregnancy are prone to subclinical gestational hypothyroidism. However, the connections between anti-TPO antibodies positivity and gestational hypothyroidism remain largely unknown. The aim of the present study is to investigate the differences in fetal metabolic profile at birth according to maternal anti-TPO status.

- **Methods**: We performed 1H-NMR metabolomics on cord blood of a nested case-control cohort of 22 pregnant women with matched thyroid hormone levels and demographic data, including 11 women with euthyroid status but anti-thyroid antibodies positivity (into the anti-TPO antibodies positivity group) and 11 matched women as controls with euthyroid status and negative anti-thyroid antibodies (into the control group).

- **Results**: Distinct metabolic profiles were observed between the anti-TPO antibody positivity group and the nested control group, from which a total of 10 metabolites with between-group altered abundances were structurally identified. Five out of the 10 metabolites were up-regulated in the anti-TPO antibodies positivity group, including D-glucose, L-glutamine, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, myo-inositol, and creatinine. The other five metabolites were down-regulated in the anti-TPO antibodies positivity group, including L-leucine, L-lysine, L-glutamic acid, L-tyrosine, and L-phenylalanine.

### Thyroid antibodies and levothyroxine effects in subclinical hypothyroidism: A pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials [^114zDFsD]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Autoimmunity is a common etiology of subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo), characterized clinically by high levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO). Anti-TPO induces cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and its presence is associated with the development of thyroid dysfunction. Adults with SHypo and positive anti-TPO are more prone to progress to overt hypothyroidism in studies with long-term follow-up of up to 20 years (4.3% per year for positive antibodies vs. 2.6% per year for negative antibodies).

For these patients, the indication for treatment remains controversial. Two guidelines suggest considering treatment in the presence of positive antibodies to prevent progression to overt hypothyroidism, irrespective of TSH levels, as do some international experts. However, another guideline does not mention antibody status as an indication for treatment. Despite these controversial recommendations, physicians often use anti-TPO testing to decide whether to initiate treatment. In a survey of American Thyroid Association members and primary care providers, approximately 10%–20% more physicians would initiate therapy in SHypo if antibodies were positive than if antibodies were negative.

Little data on the frequency of anti-TPO measurements at the population level exists. However, a population-based study of 5,552 outpatients found a relatively high proportion of 3% per year of participants with at least one anti-TPO antibody test. Data are very limited on the impact of positive antibodies, as no large randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that antibody status influences the effectiveness of levothyroxine on clinical outcomes in adults with SHypo.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2013 [^116bhrZQ]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

- **Hypothyroidism**: Consider screening children with type 1 diabetes for thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies soon after diagnosis (E). Measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations soon after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, after metabolic control has been established, is reasonable. If normal, consider rechecking every 1–2 years, especially if the patient develops symptoms of thyroid dysfunction, thyromegaly, or an abnormal growth rate (E).

	- Autoimmune thyroid disease is the most common autoimmune disorder associated with diabetes, occurring in 17–30% of patients with type 1 diabetes. About one-quarter of type 1 diabetic children have thyroid autoantibodies at the time of diagnosis of their diabetes, and the presence of thyroid autoantibodies is predictive of thyroid dysfunction, generally hypothyroidism, but less commonly hyperthyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with increased risk of symptomatic hypoglycemia and with reduced linear growth. Hyperthyroidism alters glucose metabolism, potentially resulting in deterioration of metabolic control.

- **Self-management**: No matter how sound the medical regimen, it can only be as good as the ability of the family and/or individual to implement it. Family involvement in diabetes remains an important component of optimal diabetes management throughout childhood and adolescence. Health care providers who care for children and adolescents, therefore, must be capable of evaluating the educational, behavioral, emotional, and psychosocial factors that impact implementation.

### Is annual surveillance of all treated hypothyroid patients necessary [^111bXEZT]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Annual surveillance with thyroid function testing is widely recommended for the long-term follow-up of treated hypothyroid patients. This recommendation is based largely on consensus opinion, with limited evidence to support the frequency of monitoring. The majority of patients in our hospital-based thyroid register are on an 18-month follow-up schedule.

- **Methods**: We carried out a retrospective analysis to determine if there is evidence supporting more frequent testing. A logistic regression model was used to assess whether any baseline characteristics could predict an abnormal test.

- **Results**: We identified 2,125 patients with a minimum of 10 years follow-up (89% female, 65% with autoimmune hypothyroidism, and a mean age at registration of 51 years). The patients formed two groups: 1,182 (56%) were allocated to 18-month follow-up, while the rest received annual surveillance. The groups were well matched at baseline. Overall, during follow-up, the 12-month group had more abnormal tests requiring dose adjustment. However, logistic regression analysis showed that people aged less than 60 years, individuals taking less than 150 μg thyroxine per day, and those on 18-month follow-up had fewer abnormal tests.

- **Conclusion**: Eighteen-month surveillance may be adequate for the long-term follow-up of hypothyroid patients younger than 60 years, on a stable thyroxine dose of 100–150 μg/day, where robust follow-up mechanisms are in place. Implementing this strategy has the potential for cost savings.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^115xALj1]. Thyroid (2017). High credibility.

Regarding Hashimoto's thyroiditis, particularly among pregnant patients, the 2017 ATA guidelines recommend considering the initiation of levothyroxine (at a starting dose of 25–50 mcg/day) in euthyroid pregnant patients with positive anti-TPO antibodies and a history of pregnancy loss.

### Risk of new-onset type 1 diabetes in individuals with celiac disease and thyroid disease-an observational study [^114Zpb5R]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Given the increased risk of developing T1D, screening for islet autoantibodies in those with celiac disease, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism could be beneficial for diagnosing T1D in presymptomatic stages. These stages include stage 1 (presence of autoantibodies and normal blood glucose levels), stage 2 (presence of autoantibodies and dysglycemia), or stage 3a (asymptomatic hyperglycemia).

Early detection of autoimmune diseases, which can have severe clinical presentations such as T1D, typically with diabetic ketoacidosis, and Addison's disease, can help individuals avoid these traumatic experiences. Diagnosis of T1D in presymptomatic stages allows for metabolic monitoring to track disease progression and reduce the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis and associated complications. Early diagnosis also enables the opportunity to receive disease-modifying therapy to preserve beta-cell function and participate in prevention trials that are underway in T1D.

Professional society guidelines on the management of autoimmune diseases, aside from primary adrenal insufficiency, lack guidance on T1D screening in individuals with existing autoimmune diseases and in those with family members with autoimmune diseases. Additionally, despite the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines mentioning that individuals with a family or personal history of other related autoimmune diseases are at increased risk of developing T1D compared to the general population, the most recent guidelines provide no recommendation to screen these individuals for presymptomatic T1D.

### Association of thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies with thyroid function in pregnancy: An individual participant data meta-analysis [^111Uorua]. Thyroid (2022). Low credibility.

Thyroid autoimmunity is common in pregnant women and associated with thyroid dysfunction and adverse obstetric outcomes. Most studies focus on thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) assessed by a negative-positive dichotomy and rarely take into account thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs). This study aimed at determining the association of TPOAbs and TgAbs, respectively, and interdependently, with maternal thyroid function.

- **Methods**: This was a meta-analysis of individual participant cross-sectional data from 20 cohorts in the Consortium on Thyroid and Pregnancy. Women with multiple pregnancies, pregnancy by assisted reproductive technology, a history of thyroid disease, or use of thyroid-interfering medication were excluded. Associations of (log2) TPOAbs and TgAbs (with/without mutual adjustment) with cohort-specific z-scores of (log2) thyrotropin (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), total triiodothyronine (TT3), free thyroxine (fT4), total thyroxine (TT4), or triiodothyronine:thyroxine (T3:T4) ratio were evaluated in a linear mixed model.

- **Results**: In total, 51,138 women participated (51,094 had TPOAb-data and 27,874 had TgAb-data). Isolated TPOAb positivity was present in 4.1% [95% confidence interval, CI: 3.0 to 5.2], isolated TgAb positivity in 4.8% [CI: 2.9 to 6.6], and positivity for both antibodies in 4.7% [CI: 3.1 to 6.3]. Compared with antibody-negative women, TSH was higher in women with isolated TPOAb positivity (z-score increment 0.40, CI: 0.16 to 0.64) and TgAb positivity (0.21, CI: 0.10 to 0.32), but highest in those positive for both antibodies (0.54, CI: 0.

### A population study of the association between thyroid autoantibodies in serum and abnormalities in thyroid function and structure [^113xnYcS]. Clinical Endocrinology (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with autoimmune overt hypothyroidism may present with goitrous Hashimoto's disease or autoimmune atrophic thyroiditis. Little is known about the prevalence of subclinical autoimmune hypothyroidism. The aims of this study were to evaluate the association between thyroid autoantibodies in serum and abnormalities in thyroid function and structure, and to study the thyroid volume in subjects with subclinical autoimmune hypothyroidism.

- **Design**: A population study including 4649 randomly selected subjects.

- **Measurements**: Blood tests were used to analyze for thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (TPO-Ab), thyroglobulin autoantibodies (Tg-Ab), TSH, fT3, and fT4.

- **Results**: Thyroid volume was categorized as small (14.9 ml) in 34.9% of participants. Thyroid nodules were found in 29.7%. Serum TSH was low (3.6) in 4.3%. The prevalence rate of subclinical goitrous Hashimoto's disease was 0.62% and of subclinical autoimmune atrophic thyroiditis 0.24%. There was a strong association between large volume and autoantibodies, but only in subjects with elevated TSH (P < 0.001). An association between thyroid nodules and TPO-Ab in univariate analyses (P < 0.001) was due to confounding by sex and age (multivariate model, P = 0.23).

### Clinical and genetic characteristics of adult nonautoimmune hypothyroidism: A single-institution study [^116YK28v]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Nonautoimmune hypothyroidism is characterized by hypothyroidism with negative thyroid autoantibodies, yet limited knowledge exists regarding its clinical and genetic characteristics. The aim was to characterize these clinical and genetic features in nonautoimmune hypothyroidism.

This retrospective study included 1,470 treatment-naive adult hypothyroid patients (serum TSH > 10 mU/L) born before 1979 and followed up at Ito Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. Of these, 220 patients were diagnosed with idiopathic nonautoimmune hypothyroidism based on thyroid autoantibody measurements. Sequencing of 13 genes associated with nonautoimmune hypothyroidism was performed on 101 of the 220 patients. Clinical characteristics, including thyroid function and morphology, were systematically evaluated.

The proportion of idiopathic nonautoimmune hypothyroidism among the 1,470 patients with treatment-naive non-transient hypothyroidism was 15.0%. Idiopathic nonautoimmune hypothyroidism patients had lower serum TSH (17.0 vs. 28.3 mU/L; P < 0.001) and higher serum fT4 (11.5 vs. 8.9 pmol/L; P < 0.001), and the thyroid volume was smaller (13.4 vs. 24.9 g; P < 0.001) compared to autoimmune hypothyroidism patients. Genetic analysis revealed that 5.0% of the analyzed idiopathic nonautoimmune hypothyroidism patients had a Mendelian disorder, with PAX8 being the most commonly affected gene. An additional 19% of the analyzed patients carried monoallelic variants in hypothyroidism-associated genes, such as DUOX2, DUOXA2, SLC26A4, TG, TPO, and TSHR, which cause autosomal recessive genetic defects.

### Autoimmunity in thyroid disease [^113Gct4P]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2002). Low credibility.

Autoimmune thyroid diseases, including Graves' disease and autoimmune hypothyroidism, represent two ends of a disease spectrum characterized by an immune response against the thyroid gland. In Graves' disease, antibodies target the thyrotropin receptor (TSH-R), leading to glandular overactivity. Conversely, autoimmune hypothyroidism involves cell-mediated and humoral injury, resulting in destruction of thyroid tissue and thyroid hormone deficiency.

The mechanisms underpinning these diseases are not fully understood. However, it is likely that both conditions develop in genetically susceptible individuals exposed to a permissive environment. Although several environmental factors have been suggested, no direct evidence supports clear causality. Susceptibility loci within immune response genes have been identified, yet a significant component of the genetic predisposition remains unknown. This review focuses on studies aimed at identifying genes that confer susceptibility to the autoimmune disease process within the thyroid gland.

### Hypothyroidism in context: Where we've been and where we're going [^113Titvo]. Advances in Therapy (2019). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypothyroidism:

- **Definition**: Hypothyroidism is a chronic endocrine disease associated with the deficiency of thyroxine and T3 thyroid hormones.

- **Pathophysiology**: Hypothyroidism most frequently results from the thyroid gland's failure to produce thyroid hormones (99%). Other causes include underproduction of TSH by the pituitary gland and deficiency of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism in the U.S. is estimated at 300 per 100,000 population and 4,300 per 100,000 population, respectively. Hypothyroidism is 2–8 times more prevalent in women than men, and its prevalence increases with age.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include weight gain, fatigue, proximal weakness, decreased concentration, depression, diffuse muscle pain, menstrual irregularities, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, and sensory neuropathy. A severe form of hypothyroidism — myxedema coma — presents with altered mental status, hypothermia, hyponatremia, and bradycardia. The disease decreases productivity and quality of life (QoL).

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Hypothyroidism is not associated with an increase in mortality. Treatment is well-tolerated and results in improved QoL in most patients. However, untreated hypothyroidism leads to disease progression and ultimately, coma and death.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for thyroid disease in pregnancy, specifically concerning thyrotropin receptor antibodies, the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend remeasuring the TSH receptor antibody in late pregnancy (weeks 30–34) in patients with elevated TSH receptor antibody levels at 18–22 weeks of gestation. This is to guide decisions regarding neonatal monitoring. Patients with an intact thyroid who no longer require antithyroid drug therapy should not be tested.

### Epidemiology and prevention of clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism [^117NG4Uu]. Thyroid (2002). Low credibility.

Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide. In iodine-replete areas, causes include congenital factors, chronic autoimmune disease such as atrophic autoimmune thyroiditis or goitrous autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), or iatrogenic factors related to goitrogens, drugs, or destructive treatment for thyrotoxicosis. Screening for congenital hypothyroidism is available, and its use can prevent mental retardation.

The prevalence of spontaneous hypothyroidism is between 1% and 2%, more commonly found in older women, and is 10 times more frequent in women than in men. A significant proportion of individuals have asymptomatic chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. It is estimated that 8% of women (10% of those over 55 years of age) and 3% of men have subclinical hypothyroidism. Approximately one third of patients with newly diagnosed overt hypothyroidism have previously received destructive therapy for hyperthyroidism, necessitating indefinite surveillance.

There is little that can be done to prevent the occurrence of spontaneous autoimmune hypothyroidism; however, early identification can mitigate progression to overt disease. There is ongoing controversy regarding whether screening for autoimmune thyroid disease in healthy adults is beneficial, given that many tested will show signs of mild thyroid failure. Nevertheless, case finding in women going through menopause or those visiting a primary care physician with nonspecific symptoms appears warranted.

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: A specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^111UNv7k]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

In the study, we systematically analyzed the role of common genetic variants in the complex relationships between thyroid function, autoimmunity, and three common psychiatric disorders. We found strong genetic correlations between autoimmune hypothyroidism, MDD, and ANXs. Despite higher SNP-heritability estimates for thyroid function (TSH and fT4), there were no significant genetic correlations between TSH and fT4 and any of these psychiatric disorders. This may suggest that the genetically determined relationship between hypothyroidism and mood/ANXs is not mediated through THs directly but through pathways that underpin disease pathogenesis, such as (general) autoimmunity. This was further supported by our regional genetic correlation analyses, in which the top locus was the MHC region, which plays a central role in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune disorders, including autoimmune hypothyroidism.

It has been known for a long time that inflammatory pathways play a central role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hypothyroidism. However, in the last decade, various studies have shown that inflammatory pathways also play a key role in the pathogenesis of many psychiatric disorders. Notably, studies on inflammatory biomarkers have been unable to detect markers that are specific to any particular psychiatric disorder, thereby suggesting genetic variation in autoimmunity to be a more general underlying phenomenon. Various biological treatment regimes, including pharmacotherapy and noninvasive brain stimulation with electroconvulsive therapy, indeed led to a reduction.

### Are thyroid peroxidase antibodies associated with cardiovascular disease risk in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism [^115kXVBF]. Clinical Endocrinology (2005). Low credibility.

Conflicting evidence has been reported about whether subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is associated with hyperlipidemia or cardiovascular disease. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) are more common in persons with SCH. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the presence of TPOAb in people with SCH is associated with markers of cardiovascular disease.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional study using multivariate regression.

- **Patients**: Adults over age 40 who, in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III, met the criteria for SCH (n = 188).

- **Measurements**: Participants were stratified into TPOAb-negative (n = 82) and TPOAb-positive (n = 106) groups. Markers of cardiovascular disease risk were compared between the TPOAb-negative and TPOAb-positive groups. Multivariate regression models were performed to adjust for potential confounders.

- **Results**: In bivariate analyses, individuals with and without TPOAb had similar levels of triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and C-reactive protein. Homocysteine levels were higher in the patients without antibodies (P = 0.01). After adjusting for age, gender, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and use of a lipid-lowering medication, however, no statistically significant relationships were found between the presence of TPOAb and any of the cardiovascular risk markers.

- **Conclusions**: The presence of thyroid peroxidase antibodies does not appear to correlate with cardiovascular disease risk in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. This study does not support the hypothesis that TPOAb contribute to cardiovascular risk in these patients.

### Autoimmune thyroid diseases: Etiology, pathogenesis, and dermatologic manifestations [^113odmNk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), including Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and idiopathic hypothyroidism (atrophic Hashimoto's thyroiditis), is of vital concern to the dermatologist. This article reviews the cutaneous manifestations of Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Recognition of dermatologic manifestations of AITD may alert practitioners to investigate these disorders.

The immune response involved in the pathogenesis of AITD is detailed. Understanding of the role of genetic and environmental factors, antigens, and apoptosis is elaborated. The future holds exciting insights into the etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of AITD.

### Clinical significance of thyroid autoantibodies in differential diagnosis and predicting the course of programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitor-induced thyroid dysfunction [^116FqPs7]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Thyroid immune-related thyrotoxicosis is one of the most common adverse effects in patients treated with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors. We investigated the significance of serum levels of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs), anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs), and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TRAbs) in the identification of anti-PD-1-induced thyroid thyrotoxicosis.

- **Methods**: We divided 161 patients with thyroid dysfunction who received PD-1 inhibitors at our hospital between January 2022 and June 2024 into three groups: primary hypothyroidism group, primary hyperthyroidism group, and destructive thyroiditis group. The characteristics of the three groups were determined, and the positivity rates of serum TgAbs, TPOAbs, and TRAbs were assessed. An additional 42 patients diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis were selected as the control group for PD-1 inhibition-induced destructive thyroiditis. Age, sex, and time of transition from thyrotoxicosis to hypothyroidism in the two groups were compared.

- **Results**: In the primary hypothyroidism group, only one case was TPOAbs-positive (1/1%). In the destructive thyroiditis group, the positivity rate for TPOAbs or TgAbs was 92.9%, and TPOAbs and TgAbs were negative in the primary hyperthyroidism group. TRAbs were undetectable in all three groups. There were statistically significant differences in age, sex, and time from thyrotoxicosis to hypothyroidism in the PD-1 induced destructive thyroiditis and Hashimoto's thyroiditis groups.

### The neurological disorder associated with thyroid autoimmunity [^1125V2nU]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The neurological disorder associated with thyroid autoimmunity is an elusive disease that neurologists have learned to recognize in the last few years. The diagnosis is made after excluding more common diseases when neuropsychiatric symptoms develop in a patient with high serum concentrations of anti-thyroid antibodies. The clinical presentations of the disease, along with the many controversial issues surrounding the diagnosis, the pathogenesis, the role of thyroid autoantibodies, and the choice of therapy, are reviewed and discussed in the light of the medical literature in English.

### Diagnostic confusion attributable to spurious elevation of both total thyroid hormone and thyroid hormone uptake measurements in the setting of autoantibodies: Case report and review of related literature [^1141qfQ5]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

To review the effect of thyroid autoantibodies on thyroid function assays and to present a case in which thyroid autoantibodies resulted in spurious assay readings for both total thyroid hormone levels and thyroid hormone uptake measurements, we present a detailed case, including serial laboratory data, and review the relevant literature.

A 61-year-old man with a history of autoimmune disease presented for evaluation of abnormal results of thyroid function tests. The patient had been treated for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine and was noted to have an elevated total thyroxine (T4) level in the setting of a low total triiodothyronine (T3) value and a mildly elevated thyrotropin concentration. He had been referred for evaluation of a presumed deiodinase deficiency that impaired conversion of T4 to T3. During treatment with levothyroxine, these test results were confirmed, and the patient was also found to have an elevated T4 uptake. These findings were initially thought to be due to an excess of transthyretin; however, more extensive testing revealed that the patient had an autoantibody to T4 that interfered with the assays for both T4 and T4 uptake.

Autoantibodies to both T3 and T4 have been described. Such antibodies are not uncommon in patients with thyroid disease. On rare occasions, these antibodies may cause spurious assay readings and obscure the diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which both the total T4 level and the T4 uptake were elevated because of the presence of autoantibodies.

### Cord blood metabolomics reveals gestational metabolic disorder associated with anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies positivity [^1152A1U8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). High credibility.

Thyroid disease is one of the common endocrine disorders affecting pregnant women, where thyroid autoimmunity can alter the progress and outcome of pregnancy. Women with euthyroid status but anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies positivity before pregnancy are prone to subclinical gestational hypothyroidism. However, the connections between anti-TPO antibodies positivity and gestational hypothyroidism remain largely unknown. The aim of the present study is to investigate the differences in fetal metabolic profiles at birth according to maternal anti-TPO status.

- **Methods**: We performed 1H-NMR metabolomics on cord blood of a nested case-control cohort of 22 pregnant women. These women had matched thyroid hormone levels and demographic data, including 11 women with euthyroid status but anti-thyroid antibodies positivity (anti-TPO antibodies positivity group) and 11 matched women as controls with euthyroid status and negative anti-thyroid antibodies (control group).

- **Results**: Distinct metabolic profiles were observed between the anti-TPO antibody positivity group and the control group, with a total of 10 metabolites showing altered abundances between groups. Five out of the ten metabolites were up-regulated in the anti-TPO antibodies positivity group, including D-Glucose, L-Glutamine, 3-Hydroxybutyric acid, Myo-Inositol, and Creatinine. The other five metabolites were down-regulated in the anti-TPO antibodies positivity group, including L-Leucine, L-Lysine, L-Glutamic acid, L-Tyrosine, and L-Phenylalanine.

### Selenium supplementation significantly reduces thyroid autoantibody levels in patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112rcnW7]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Selenium supplementation may decrease circulating thyroid autoantibodies in patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT), but the available trials are heterogeneous. This study expands and critically reappraises the knowledge on this topic.

- **Methods**: A literature search identified 3,366 records. Controlled trials in adults (≥ 18 years of age) with AIT, comparing selenium with or without levothyroxine (LT4) versus placebo and/or LT4, were eligible. Assessed outcomes were serum thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin (TgAb) autoantibody levels and immunomodulatory effects. After screening and full-text assessment, 16 controlled trials were included in the systematic review. Random-effects meta-analyses in weighted mean difference (WMD) were performed for 3, 6, and 12 months of supplementation in two different populations: one receiving LT4 therapy and one newly diagnosed and LT4-untreated. Heterogeneity was estimated using I², and quality of evidence was assessed per outcome, using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines.

- **Results**: In LT4-treated populations, the selenium group had significantly lower TPOAb levels after three months (seven studies: WMD = -271 [confidence interval (CI) -366 to -175]; p < 0.0001; I² = 45.4%), which was consistent at six months (three studies) and 12 months (one study). TgAb decreased at 12 months but not at three or six months. In LT4-untreated populations, the selenium group showed a decrease in TPOAb levels after three months (three studies: WMD = -512 [CI -626 to -398]; p < 0).

### Association of thyroid antibodies status on the outcomes of pregnant women with hypothyroidism (maternal hypothyroidism on pregnancy outcomes, MHPO-4) [^112iYudY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Pregnancy is a state of changing metabolic and hormonal physiology. Several changes commonly occur in thyroid functions during pregnancy. Although autoimmunity in pregnancy is supposed to be less frequent than in the non-pregnant state because of immune suppression, thyroid antibodies are relatively common during pregnancy, even with normal thyroid functions, with a varying prevalence of 5 to 15%. Any failure to adapt to gestational physiological changes results in thyroid dysfunction, which poses a risk to maternal and fetal outcomes, although there are universal controversies. Studies have shown that thyroid antibodies can adversely affect pregnancy outcomes even in euthyroid women. These antibodies have also been suggested to have an independent association with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

The exact pathophysiology for these adverse effects is not known, but it has been speculated that the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies is part of a generalized autoimmune imbalance that may be responsible for increased complications. Women who are positive for thyroid antibodies before pregnancy may develop subclinical hypothyroidism, possibly due to latent thyroid dysfunction that becomes overt due to the increasing demands during pregnancy. Moreover, the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies is associated with infertility, and such women become pregnant at a delayed age, placing them in a generally high-risk category and increasing fetal loss. One study has suggested an increased risk of gestational diabetes in women with anti-thyroid antibodies compared to antibody-negative women.

### Association of thyroid antibodies status on the outcomes of pregnant women with hypothyroidism (maternal hypothyroidism on pregnancy outcomes, MHPO-4) [^112g58nj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Autoimmunity increases with age and is commonly evaluated in women of reproductive age. The prevalence of thyroid antibodies is frequent even in euthyroid pregnant women. We aim to compare the association of thyroid antibody status on the maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with hypothyroidism.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective study on 718 cases at the Aga Khan University Hospital. Information was collected on pregnant women diagnosed with hypothyroidism before conception or during the antenatal period. Laboratory data were recorded for thyroid peroxidase antibodies, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were noted from medical file records. Data analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0.

- **Results**: Overall, 146 out of 718 cases were included for final analysis. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies were positive in 66.4% of cases, and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies were positive in 52.1% of cases, whereas 43.8% of cases had both antibodies positive. Pre-gestational diabetes was significantly associated with thyroid autoimmunity. There was a 73% lesser chance of gestational hypertension for thyroid autoimmune groups. Gestational diabetes and maternal (chronic) hypertension were found to have an independent effect on postpartum hemorrhage. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy were independently associated with the risk of premature birth.

- **Conclusion**: Our study reports a 74.7% prevalence of positive thyroid antibodies in hypothyroid pregnant women.

### Autoimmune thyroid status in subclinical thyroid disorders in patients attending a tertiary care center in Nepal: a hospital-based cross-sectional study [^1136XAzm]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

The study examined the correlation between thyroid hormone profiles and thyroid autoantibodies.

- **Subclinical hyperthyroidism**: In these patients, a negative correlation was observed between TSH and TRAb. A significant positive correlation was noted between Anti-TPO and TGA (p < 0.001) as well as between Anti-TPO and TRAb (p = 0.017).

- **Subclinical hypothyroidism**: A positive correlation was found between Anti-TPO and TGA (p < 0.001), while a negative correlation was observed between TGA and TRAb (p = 0.016).

These findings are illustrated in Tables 6 and 7.

### Graves' disease: Introduction, epidemiology, endogenous and environmental pathogenic factors [^1147j5KE]. Annales d'endocrinologie (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Graves' disease:

- **Definition**: GD is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the production of antibodies against TSH receptors.

- **Pathophysiology**: GD is caused by autoimmunity rendered by complex interactions between genetic (75–80%) and environmental factors (20–25%).

- **Epidemiology**: The annual incidence of GD is estimated at 20–30 cases per 100,000 persons; lifetime risk for women and men is approximately 3% and 0.5%, respectively.

- **Disease course**: The overproduction of thyroid hormone is caused by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins via thyrotropin receptor activation, which results in hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the gland. In addition, the production of cytokines by infiltrating immune cells results in inflammation and altered thyroid cell behavior. The orbital infiltration of immune cells, activation of thyrotropin-insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor complex, signaling of orbital fibroblasts, and adipogenesis results in orbital tissue expansion, proptosis, and optic nerve compression. Diffuse goiter, ophthalmopathy, dermopathy, alteration in mental status, and cardiac complications may ensue.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Anti-thyroid drug therapy is associated with 40–50% remission after 12–18 months of treatment.

### Obesity is associated with subclinical hypothyroidism in the presence of thyroid autoantibodies: a cross-sectional study [^115YpFSQ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism is linked to subtle proatherogenic abnormalities from childhood. Both obesity and subclinical hypothyroidism adversely impact human metabolism. Identifying the connection between obesity and subclinical hypothyroidism is crucial for controlling risk factors and improving prognosis. This study found a higher proportion of subclinical hypothyroidism in obese individuals compared to non-obese subjects with positive thyroid autoantibodies. Notably, obesity was significantly associated with subclinical hypothyroidism only when thyroid autoantibodies were present. Additionally, Tg-Ab was more commonly observed in obese subjects, indicating a significant association between obesity and Tg-Ab.

These findings align with the Tehran Thyroid Study, which reported a higher prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in obese versus normal-weight subjects. Similarly, a Danish survey found higher prevalence rates of subclinical hypothyroidism in overweight/obese individuals compared to lean subjects. Conversely, an Indian study found no significant difference in subclinical hypothyroidism prevalence between overweight and lean PCOS patients. This discrepancy may partly be due to variations in BMI definitions of obesity and differing TSH thresholds in defining subclinical hypothyroidism. Interestingly, our study observed a higher prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in obese individuals only when thyroid autoantibodies were present. Furthermore, a significant association between obesity and subclinical hypothyroidism was confirmed.

### Autoimmune switch from hyperthyroidism to hypothyroidism in Graves' disease [^115AvGEM]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 21-year-old young woman who was initially diagnosed with hyperthyroidism secondary to Graves' disease and spontaneously switched to hypothyroidism within a year. While most autoimmune hypothyroidism cases are due to Hashimoto's disease, in her case, we suspect that her hypothyroidism results from a switch in antibody dominance from thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor-stimulating antibody (TS Ab) to TSH receptor-blocking antibody (TB Ab). Switching from dominant TS Ab activity to dominant TB Ab activity is a rare phenomenon. Optimal management of this condition is not known. Loss of follow-up and medication non-adherence have further complicated medical management in this young woman of reproductive age.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^116BQ3o2]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency.

- **Therapeutic options**: For patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice).
- **Clinical hypothyroidism treatment**: The standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Turner syndrome, specifically in the context of monitoring for autoimmune disorders, the ESE/PES 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining screening for hypothyroidism by measuring TSH every 1–2 years. This should start at 2 years of age and continue through adulthood, and should also occur with new symptoms. Testing for anti-thyroid antibodies is advisable if the TSH levels are elevated.

### Thyroid peroxidase as an autoantigen [^115GrMqe]. Thyroid (2007). Low credibility.

Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) evokes high-affinity, IgG-class autoantibodies [TPO autoantibodies (TPOAbs)] and TPO-specific T cells that are markers of thyroid infiltration or implicated in thyroid destruction, respectively. A diverse repertoire of human monoclonal TPOAbs, unparalleled in other autoimmune diseases, provides invaluable probes for investigating antibody epitopes. Human TPOAbs recognize an immunodominant region comprising overlapping A and B domains on conformationally intact TPO. Amino acids recognized by TPOAbs are located in the regions with homology to myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the complement control protein (CCP) but not in the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like region.

T cells recognize epitopes in the MPO-like region but not in the CCP- or EGF-like regions in humans. Monoclonal human TPOAbs modulate the processing of TPO protein to provide peptides for some T cells. A human T cell clone expressed transgenically in mice induces lymphocytic infiltration and hypothyroidism. This T cell's epitope is only generated by thyrocyte processing of endogenous TPO. Further, intact TPO expressed in vivo is also required for the induction of TPOAbs in mice that resemble human autoantibodies. Overall, some TPO-specific T cells and the majority of autoantibodies in humans develop in response to TPO presented by thyroid cells, rather than to TPO released by damaged thyrocytes.

### Diseases associated with thyroid autoimmunity: Explanations for the expanding spectrum [^113QuGwz]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Anyone who has been in an endocrine clinic will appreciate that associations exist between autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and other autoimmune disorders. However, the full extent of these associations is still not fully appreciated, and new associations are being uncovered which may shed new light on the pathogenic basis for these connections, and the underlying reasons for them are only now becoming understood.

This review is based on the British Thyroid Association Pitt-Rivers Lecture 2010. The first section provides an update on studies which have detailed the strength of various autoimmune disease associations. The second section discusses the environmental and genetic factors which underlie these associations, and the final section describes some recently identified, unexpected AITD associations. Unravelling these associations further will illuminate the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and offers the prospect of new therapeutic approaches.

### Smoking cessation is followed by a sharp but transient rise in the incidence of overt autoimmune hypothyroidism - a population-based, case-control study [^113M8oAT]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Smoking is associated with a low prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies. Conversely, smoking withdrawal enhances thyroid autoantibody levels and may be a risk factor for developing hypothyroidism. This study aimed to assess the association between smoking habits, particularly smoking cessation, and the development of autoimmune hypothyroidism.

- **Design**: Population-based, case-control study.

- **Participants**: Cases (n = 140) newly diagnosed with primary autoimmune overt hypothyroidism were identified prospectively by monitoring 2,027,208 person-years of thyroid function tests in two well-defined geographical areas. Age-, sex-, and region-matched euthyroid controls (n = 560) were simultaneously included from the same population.

- **Measurements**: Participants provided details on smoking habits, including smoking withdrawal and other lifestyle factors. Smoking habits were verified by measuring urinary cotinine, a nicotine metabolite.

- **Results**: Incident hypothyroidism was very common in people who had recently stopped smoking: OR vs. never smokers (95% CI); quit smoking less than 2 years, 3.5 (1.9–6.7); quit smoking more than 10 years, 0.76 (0.38–1.51). Results were consistent regardless of sex and age. Within two years after smoking cessation, the percentage of hypothyroid cases attributable to smoking cessation was 85%. Smoking was not associated with an altered risk of developing overt hypothyroidism [OR, 0.92 (0.57–1.48)].

- **Conclusions**: The study concluded that smoking cessation is associated with a sharp but transient increase in the incidence of overt autoimmune hypothyroidism.

### Effect of COVID-19 vaccines on thyroid function and autoimmunity and effect of thyroid autoimmunity on antibody response [^116CaBr9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

There are concerns regarding the potential for COVID-19 vaccination to trigger thyroid autoimmunity and cause thyroid dysfunction. Additionally, data on how preexisting thyroid autoimmunity impacts the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination is limited.

- **Objectives**: We evaluated the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on thyroid function and antibodies and assessed the influence of preexisting thyroid autoimmunity on neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses.

- **Methods**: Adults without a history of COVID-19 or thyroid disorders who received the COVID-19 vaccination from June to August 2021 were recruited. All participants received two doses of vaccines. Measurements of thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), free 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (fT3), antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO), and antithyroglobulin (anti-Tg) antibodies were taken at baseline and 8 weeks post-vaccination. NAbs against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain were measured.

- **Results**: A total of 215 individuals were included (129 [60%] BNT162b2; 86 [40%] CoronaVac recipients) with a mean age of 49.6 years and 37.2% men. At baseline, 12.1% were anti-TPO/Tg positive. Post-vaccination, TSH levels did not change (P = 0.225), but fT4 levels slightly increased (from 12.0 ± 1.1 to 12.2 ± 1.2 pmol/L [from 0.93 ± 0.09 to 0.95 ± 0.09 ng/dL], p < 0.001) while fT3 levels slightly decreased (from 4.1 ± 0.4 to 4.0 ± 0.4 pmol/L [from 2.67 ± 0.26 to 2.60 ± 0.26 pg/mL], p < 0.001). Only 3 patients (1.4%) exhibited abnormal thyroid function post-vaccination, none clinically overt. Anti-TPO and anti-Tg titers increased modestly after vaccination (p < 0.001), yet there were no statistically significant changes in anti-TPO/Tg positivity.

### Disease associations with autoimmune thyroid disease [^116LRWeg]. Thyroid (2002). Low credibility.

Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) is common and frequently co-occurs with other diseases. Although many putative disease associations have been suggested for AITD, the validity of these associations is not clear in all cases. Defining disease associations correctly is important, as this may offer a means to rationally screen for true associations, shed light on shared pathophysiologic mechanisms, and be important if the associated disease impacts patient management. This review has examined the evidence base for a large number of the suggested associations.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: Cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^113CAmza]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, particularly concerning anti-TPO antibodies, the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering the measurement of anti-TPO antibodies. This should occur either at 20–26 weeks of gestation or during the first trimester and be repeated at 20–26 weeks of gestation if initially elevated. These recommendations apply in pregnant patients with hypothyroidism who have a history of Graves disease and were treated with radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy before pregnancy.

### Thyroglobulin antibodies and risk of readmission at one year in subjects with bipolar disorder [^114PXYZi]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

Thyroid autoimmunity has been proposed as an endophenotype for bipolar disorder (BD), although its relationship with clinical outcomes remains unclear. We aimed to determine whether thyroid autoimmune status — thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPO-Abs) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TG-Abs) — in BD is associated with a greater risk for readmission at one year. We studied 77 inpatients with BD admitted for an index manic or mixed episode. Serum thyroid antibodies (TPO-Abs and TG-Abs) were determined at admission.

We compared the readmission risk at one year based on the patients' thyroid autoimmunity profile using survival analyses. Cox regression was used to control covariates. TG-Abs+ but not TPO-Abs+ was associated with a lower risk of relapse. The Kaplan-Meier mean estimated survival times were 341.6 days (CI 95%: 316.4–366.8) for the TG-Abs+ group and 261.9 days (CI 95%: 221.8–302.0) for the TG-Abs- group. Cox proportional hazards regression indicated that subjects with TG-Abs+ were 3.7 (1/OR = 1/0.27) times less likely to be admitted during the follow-up period than those with TG-Abs-. Our study suggests that an autoimmune biomarker in patients with BD (i.e. the presence of TG-Abs) is associated with a lower risk of psychiatric readmission after an index hospitalization for a manic or mixed episode.

### Is annual surveillance of all treated hypothyroid patients necessary [^115t2BvC]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Annual surveillance, with thyroid function testing, is widely recommended for the long-term follow-up of treated hypothyroid patients. This recommendation is based largely on consensus opinion, and there is limited evidence to support the frequency of monitoring. The majority of patients in our hospital-based thyroid register are on an 18-month follow-up schedule.

- **Methods**: We carried out a retrospective analysis to determine if there is evidence to support more frequent testing. We employed a logistic regression model to assess whether any baseline characteristics could predict an abnormal test.

- **Results**: Our study identified 2,125 patients with a minimum of 10 years of follow-up (89% female, 65% with autoimmune hypothyroidism, and a mean age at registration of 51 years). There were two groups: 1,182 (56%) allocated to an 18-month follow-up and the remainder on annual surveillance. The groups were well matched at baseline. Overall, during follow-up, the 12-month group had more abnormal tests requiring dose adjustment. However, logistic regression analysis indicated that individuals aged less than 60 years, those taking less than 150 μg of thyroxine per day, and those on 18-month follow-up had fewer abnormal tests.

- **Conclusion**: An 18-month surveillance may be adequate for the long-term follow-up of hypothyroid patients under 60 years of age who are on a stable thyroxine dose of 100–150 μg/day, given there are robust follow-up mechanisms in place. Implementing this strategy has potential for cost savings.

### Why measure thyroglobulin autoantibodies rather than thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies [^1171SszC]. Thyroid (2004). Low credibility.

Autoantibodies to thyroglobulin (TgAb) and thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) are of immunoglobulin G (IgG) class and have high affinities for their respective autoantigens. Both autoantibodies are markers of thyroid autoimmunity and can be measured by a variety of assays. From a clinical perspective, TgAb are less prevalent than TPOAb and are less useful than TPOAb for predicting thyroid dysfunction. Moreover, TgAb interfere with thyroglobulin (Tg) measurements used to monitor metastases in thyroid cancer. However, increasing evidence suggests that these TgAb provide a surrogate for Tg.

In terms of disease pathogenesis, Tg has been suggested to play a role in Graves' ophthalmopathy. Pending further studies, TgAb epitopes could distinguish between individuals who are euthyroid or have clinical disease. An intriguing reason for measuring and characterizing TgAb is the renewed interest these autoantibodies have sparked in their autoantigen. It is conceivable that Tg polymorphisms, combined with the explosive mix of iodine, TPO, and H₂O₂ necessary for thyroid hormone synthesis, inadvertently provide the trigger for the autoimmune thyroid response.

### Rapid progression from subclinical to symptomatic overt hypothyroidism [^113V7hWD]. Endocrine Practice (2005). Low credibility.

To report a case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis with rapid progression from subclinical to overt symptomatic hypothyroidism, and to discuss the potential precipitating factors and implications on clinical decisions about monitoring and treatment of early thyroid failure.

- **Objective**: We describe a patient with long-standing subclinical hypothyroidism who progressed to severe overt hypothyroidism over a 2-month period, without an identifiable precipitating factor. All medical care was provided at a single institution, and all relevant medical records were reviewed.

- **Results**: For at least 2 years, an 84-year-old man exhibited a pattern of subclinical hypothyroidism, including normal levels of serum free thyroxine, serum thyrotropin concentrations ranging from 4.4 to 9.6 microIU/mL, and elevated levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. During a 2-month period, symptoms of cold intolerance, a 4.5-kg weight gain, and fatigue developed; the patient was found to have low free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine concentrations and a serum thyrotropin concentration of 80.9 microIU/mL. The patient did not use any medication previously identified as a trigger for the development of hypothyroidism, had no exposure to iodine or contrast administration, and reported no infection that might explain the rapid progression of hypothyroidism.

- **Conclusion**: Most patients with subclinical hypothyroidism progress to overt hypothyroidism at a slow rate. Elderly patients with high antithyroid antibody titers may have a higher than previously recognized risk of rapid progression to overt hypothyroidism.

### Loqtorzi [^115PT8nB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Loqtorzi can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue Loqtorzi depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

- **Loqtorzi in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine**:
	- Thyroiditis occurred in 2.1% (3/146) of patients receiving Loqtorzi in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine, including Grade 2 (1.4%). Three patients required thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Thyroiditis resolved in one of the three patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 1.4% (2/146) of patients receiving Loqtorzi in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine. Hyperthyroidism resolved in these two patients. Hypothyroidism occurred in 30% (44/146) of patients receiving Loqtorzi in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine, including Grade 2 (24%) and Grade 1 (6%). Eighty percent of the 44 patients required thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Loqtorzi was withheld in 2.1% (3/146) of the patients. Of the three patients in whom Loqtorzi was withheld, two patients reinitiated Loqtorzi.

- **Loqtorzi as a single-agent**:
	- Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (5/851) of patients receiving Loqtorzi, including Grade 2 (0.1%). Two of these five patients received systemic corticosteroids, and two required thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Thyroiditis resolved in two of the five patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 7% (55/851) of patients receiving Loqtorzi.

### Antithyroid peroxidase antibodies in patients with high normal range thyroid stimulating hormone [^117Vamuy]. Family Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is linked to heart disease and decreased quality of life. Since screening guidelines for the general population are controversial, and physicians use clinical judgment in deciding to order thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), high-normal levels of TSH pose a dilemma. This study's objective was to compare rates of positive anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (antiTPO) tests in persons with high-normal versus low-normal TSH levels.

- **Methods**: Physicians at a publicly funded family medicine outpatient clinic used a standard clinical set of criteria to identify patients in need of TSH testing. Patients with non-thyroid diseases or conditions that affect TSH were excluded. A total of 143 patients over 18 years of age presented with symptoms necessitating TSH testing and had levels that fell between 0.36 and 5.49 IU/ml. They were allocated into two groups: 100 patients with TSH levels between 0.36–2.49 IU/ml (low-normal TSH) and 43 patients with TSH levels between 2.5–5.49 IU/ml (high-normal TSH), and they all had measurements of antiTPO levels. Primary outcomes were rates of antiTPO and demographics comparisons between the two groups.

- **Results**: The prevalence of the antiTPO antibody in the high-normal group was 18.6% versus 3% in the low-normal range TSH. The antiTPO prevalence was higher in females than in males and had a racial predominance in Hispanics compared to African Americans; however, these differences were not statistically significant.

- **Conclusions**: AntiTPO measurement may be appropriate for patients with high-normal TSH to help guide clinical decision-making.

### Autoimmune thyroid status in subclinical thyroid disorders in patients attending a tertiary care center in Nepal: A hospital-based cross-sectional study [^115feMao]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Among the study population, 75% (n = 45) showed positive thyroid autoantibodies (any of the three antibodies), with 13.3% (n = 8) having only one antibody positive, 50% (n = 30) having two antibodies positive, and 11.7% (n = 7) having all three antibodies positive. The positive thyroid antibody titre was higher in females compared to males; however, the difference was statistically insignificant. Most females with positive thyroid autoantibodies were young adults (25–44 years), within the reproductive age group.

There was a statistically significant relationship between subclinical thyroid status and the positive rates of thyroid autoantibodies. A high positivity rate of thyroid autoantibody was observed in subclinical hypothyroid status; however, all three thyroid autoantibodies positive were seen exclusively in subclinical hyperthyroid status. Both anti-TPO and thyroglobulin antibody positive titres were relatively higher in subclinical hyperthyroid state, while TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) was observed exclusively in the subclinical hyperthyroid state as shown in Table 3.

- **Thyroid antibody positivity rate in different clinical status**:

*p-value < 0.001 is considered statistically significant.*

The prevalence of anti-TPO and anti-thyroglobulin positive rates in subclinical hypothyroidism were 58.3% and 66.7%, respectively. Anti-TPO and anti-thyroglobulin were mostly positive in individuals with TSH greater than 10 µIU/ml.

### Pendrin is a novel autoantigen recognized by patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases [^113zrrNG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Pendrin is an apical protein of thyroid follicular cells, responsible for the efflux of iodide into the follicular lumen via an iodide-chloride transport mechanism. It is unknown whether pendrin is recognized by autoantibodies. Our objective was to examine the prevalence of pendrin antibodies in autoimmune thyroid diseases and compare with that of thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase, TSH receptor, and sodium iodide symporter antibodies.

In a prevalent case-control study, we analyzed the sera of 140 autoimmune thyroid disease cases (100 with Graves' disease and 40 with Hashimoto's thyroiditis) and 80 controls (50 healthy subjects, 10 patients with papillary thyroid cancer, 10 with systemic lupus erythematosus, and 10 with rheumatoid arthritis). Pendrin antibodies were measured by immunoblotting using extracts of COS-7 cells transfected with pendrin and a rabbit polyclonal pendrin antibody.

Pendrin antibodies were found in 81% of the cases and 9% of controls (odds ratio = 44; P < 0.0001). Among cases, pendrin antibodies were more frequent and of higher titers in Hashimoto's thyroiditis than in Graves' disease. Pendrin antibodies correlated significantly with thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase, and sodium iodide symporter antibodies but not with TSH receptor antibodies. Pendrin antibodies were equally effective as thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase antibodies in the diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid diseases, especially Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

The study identifies pendrin as a novel autoantigen recognized by patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases.

### Thyroxine replacement for subfertile women with euthyroid autoimmune thyroid disease or subclinical hypothyroidism [^112qaTTH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease is the second most common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. Subclinical hypothyroidism is diagnosed by an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration with a normal concentration of free thyroxine hormone. Autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) is diagnosed by the presence of thyroid autoantibodies, regardless of thyroid hormone levels. Thyroxine may be a useful treatment for subfertile women with these two specific types of thyroid disease for improving pregnancy outcomes during assisted reproduction.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and harms of levothyroxine replacement in subfertile women with subclinical hypothyroidism or with normal thyroid function and thyroid autoimmunity (euthyroid autoimmune thyroid disease, or euthyroid ATD) undergoing assisted reproduction.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and two trials registers, together with reference checking and contact with study authors and experts in the field, to identify studies. We searched for all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing thyroxine with no treatment or placebo, without language restrictions, from inception to 8 April 2019, and in consultation with the Cochrane CGF Information Specialist.

- **Selection criteria**: We included women undergoing assisted reproduction treatment, meaning both in vitro fertilisation and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, with a history of subfertility and with subclinical hypothyroidism.
