## Question

what might labs look like for person with anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what laboratory findings might look like in a patient with combined anemia of chronic disease (ACD) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the opposing pathophysiology and how it shapes iron indices. Then, I should verify ferritin thresholds in the context of inflammation and define the "grey zone". Next, I will examine transferrin saturation and iron studies, followed by red cell indices for discordance. After that, I should review inflammation-resistant markers such as soluble transferrin receptor and reticulocyte hemoglobin content. I will then confirm the inflammatory component with acute phase reactants and hepcidin physiology, synthesize the mixed pattern, and finally translate this into pragmatic treatment and monitoring decisions with thresholds and response criteria [^115wbRKn] [^1162718v].

> Let me first confirm the competing mechanisms because misreading the physiology leads to misinterpretation of the labs. In IDA, there is absolute iron depletion with impaired hemoglobinization and increased iron avidity, whereas in ACD, inflammatory IL-6–hepcidin signaling sequesters iron in macrophages and hepatocytes, limiting availability despite adequate or increased stores, producing low serum iron with normal or low transferrin and normal or high ferritin [^111sFJG3] [^116ir8de].

> Hold on, I should verify the ferritin interpretation under inflammation, because that is the pivot. In the absence of inflammation, ferritin < 15 µg/L is highly specific for absent iron stores and many practices use < 30 µg/L to capture more IDA, but in active inflammatory disease, thresholds shift upward and ferritin between 30 and 100 µg/L often represents combined IDA + ACD, whereas ferritin > 100 µg/L with low TSAT supports ACD predominance as per ECCO guidance for IBD-related anemia [^1157g8j4] [^115wbRKn] [^1162718v]. Let me double-check diagnostic performance too; large EHR–bone marrow correlation data confirm ferritin's superiority over other single markers, with very low ferritin having excellent specificity and the need for higher interpretive thresholds in inflammatory states, which aligns with clinical practice when CRP is elevated [^117T6jBq].

> Next, I should review transferrin saturation because it is essential but not discriminatory on its own. TSAT is typically low (< 20%) in both IDA and ACD; low iron and elevated TIBC drive very low TSAT in pure IDA, whereas low iron with suppressed transferrin keeps TSAT low in ACD, so a TSAT < 20% confirms iron-restricted erythropoiesis but does not by itself separate absolute from functional deficiency; when ferritin is > 100 µg/L with TSAT < 20% in the context of inflammation, ACD is favored by ECCO [^1162718v]. I should also confirm that when ferritin appears "falsely normal" under inflammation, adding TSAT can unmask iron deficiency, which is exactly why BSG recommends using TSAT when a false-normal ferritin is suspected [^116cC5xS] [^114N2wZa].

> I will now examine the red cell indices for discordant patterns that betray a mixed process. Let me think about MCV, MCH, and RDW specifically. The IDA component pushes microcytosis and hypochromia, but up to 40% of even "pure" IDA can be normocytic, especially in inflammatory comorbidity or concurrent therapies, so a normal MCV does not exclude iron deficiency; MCH tends to be a more reliable marker of iron-restricted erythropoiesis than MCV under chronic disease conditions, and RDW elevation supports a dynamic ID component superimposed on ACD [^116Ln8KB] [^114JCsrn]. I should confirm that chronic disease blunts the sensitivity of microcytosis and hypochromia and that interpretation must be contextualized with iron studies and inflammation markers, per BSG guidance [^116Ln8KB].

> Now, I need to assess markers that are relatively robust to inflammation to uncover the IDA component. Initially, I might say soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is "not elevated by inflammation", but wait, let me verify that nuance; although sTfR rises in absolute iron deficiency and can help in equivocal cases, some data indicate sTfR may increase with heightened erythropoietic drive and certain inflammatory states, so I should be cautious and use it with context and preferably as sTfR/log ferritin index where values > 2 strongly suggest absolute deficiency despite inflammation, acknowledging variability across assays and populations [^116Ln8KB] [^115WFgXM]. I should double-check reticulocyte hemoglobin content too; CHr or Ret-He < 29 pg predicts functional iron deficiency in inflammatory and ESA-treated settings and < 25 pg supports classical absolute iron deficiency, often preceding MCV changes, which is particularly valuable when ferritin is confounded by inflammation [^112s7Cr6]. Let me also consider the percentage of hypochromic red cells, which, when increased, indicates iron-deficient erythropoiesis and is included in extended anemia workups for chronic inflammatory states despite ferritin ambiguity [^112qcPhA].

> Next, I should confirm the inflammatory milieu because it changes the thresholds and the pretest probabilities. Elevated CRP and ESR corroborate inflammation, and mechanistically elevated hepcidin levels in ACD explain the low serum iron with preserved or increased stores; in combined disease, hepcidin is often elevated but may be lower than expected if absolute deficiency is significant, reinforcing the need to integrate both iron studies and inflammation markers in tandem [^115gs2r8] [^116ir8de].

> I will now synthesize the expected combined pattern to avoid premature closure. The typical profile for concomitant ACD + IDA is anemia of moderate severity with ferritin in the 30–100 µg/L "grey zone" under active inflammation, low serum iron, TSAT < 20%, transferrin that is normal or low rather than high, and red cell indices showing microcytosis and/or hypochromia with elevated RDW if the IDA component is substantial, while inflammation-resistant markers such as elevated sTfR, an sTfR/log ferritin index > 2, low reticulocyte hemoglobin, or increased hypochromic red cells help unmask the absolute deficiency when ferritin is misleadingly "normal" [^115wbRKn] [^116Ln8KB] [^112s7Cr6].

> But wait, what if ferritin is > 100 µg/L and TSAT is still < 20% in a clearly inflamed patient; does that exclude iron deficiency entirely? Hold on, let me reconsider; ECCO indicates that pattern is typical for ACD, yet some patients harbor concurrent true deficiency masked by inflammation, so in symptomatic anemia or if erythropoiesis is iron-restricted by reticulocyte indices, a therapeutic trial of IV iron or further confirmatory testing can be justified to clarify the functional versus absolute component without over-relying on ferritin alone [^1162718v] [^112s7Cr6] [^115bHVQo].

> I should now translate this into treatment logic linked to the labs. If ferritin is < 30 µg/L, treat as IDA with iron repletion because specificity for absent stores is very high, while recognizing the need to address the bleeding or malabsorption source; in inflammatory bowel disease or other high-hepcidin states with impaired absorption, IV iron is favored over oral due to reduced enteral uptake, faster correction, and better efficacy in active disease [^1157g8j4] [^111M5RPV]. If ferritin is 30–100 µg/L with elevated CRP and TSAT < 20%, combined deficiency is most likely and IV iron is generally recommended to overcome hepcidin-mediated blockade; if ferritin is > 100 µg/L with TSAT < 20% and anemia persists, prioritize control of inflammation and consider IV iron for functional deficiency after excluding overload risk and integrating reticulocyte indices to predict response [^115wbRKn] [^1162718v] [^112s7Cr6]. I should confirm that a hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within about 2 weeks of iron therapy is highly suggestive of an iron deficiency component even when baseline studies were equivocal, which is a practical diagnostic-therapeutic test in mixed anemia [^115bHVQo].

> Let me also ensure safety and escalation considerations are clear. RBC transfusion should be reserved for severe symptomatic anemia or very low hemoglobin with risk factors, with ECCO suggesting transfusion around Hb < 7 g/dL in selected cases followed by IV iron to replenish deficit, while broader oncology and general guidelines favor restrictive transfusion thresholds and prioritize iron repletion where feasible to avoid transfusion-related risks [^1146Czyr] [^113phhGj]. I should double-check for comorbid conditions such as CKD where ferritin ceilings and TSAT targets guide parenteral iron use and where functional iron deficiency is common under ESA therapy, making reticulocyte hemoglobin and percent hypochromic cells particularly actionable for predicting IV iron responsiveness [^116RmEyQ] [^112s7Cr6].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal monitoring and etiologic workup are not overlooked. For IBD, routine anemia surveillance with CBC, ferritin, TSAT, and CRP at intervals tied to disease activity is recommended, and after successful IV iron repletion, re-treatment is advised if ferritin drops below 100 µg/L or hemoglobin drifts back toward 12–13 g/dL thresholds by sex, as recurrence often tracks subclinical disease even when symptoms seem quiescent; in non-IBD IDA, establish and treat the source of iron loss with guideline-directed GI evaluation where appropriate rather than treating numbers alone [^114Acp5z] [^114k8Tww] [^113dWhbk]. I should double-check that when ferritin appears discordant with the clinical picture, adding TSAT, reticulocyte hemoglobin, and sTfR can prevent misclassification, and a measured therapeutic trial with objective Hb response can safely adjudicate borderline cases without delay [^116cC5xS] [^112s7Cr6] [^115bHVQo].

In combined anemia of chronic disease (ACD) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA), laboratory studies show **low hemoglobin** with **low MCV/MCH** and **high RDW** due to iron deficiency [^116Ln8KB], while inflammation elevates ferritin and suppresses transferrin, masking true iron status [^112ekgeq] [^116ir8de]. Ferritin is typically **30–100 ng/mL** [^115wbRKn], **TSAT < 20%** [^1162718v], and serum iron is low [^111sFJG3]; **CRP** and **ESR** are elevated [^115gs2r8], and the soluble transferrin receptor is often elevated, aiding distinction from pure ACD [^116Ln8KB] [^112ekgeq]. This mixed pattern reflects both absolute iron deficiency and inflammatory sequestration [^112ekgeq] [^1157g8j4]; careful interpretation is required, and **IV iron** is often used when inflammation limits absorption [^111M5RPV] [^112sB6Gi].

---

## Hemoglobin and hematocrit

Hemoglobin (Hb) is low [^111sFJG3], typically **8–11 g/dL**, reflecting the severity of the combined anemia [^112ekgeq], and **hematocrit (Hct)** is proportionally reduced, consistent with the degree of anemia.

---

## Red blood cell indices

- **Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)**: Low-normal or mildly microcytic (75–85 fL) [^116Ln8KB] from iron deficiency [^111sFJG3], with ACD blunting microcytosis [^112ekgeq].

- **Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH)**: Low-normal or mildly reduced, reflecting hypochromia from iron deficiency [^116Ln8KB].

- **Red cell distribution width (RDW)**: Elevated (> 14.5%) [^115TJZBu] due to anisocytosis from iron deficiency.

## Iron studies

| **Parameter** | **Iron deficiency anemia** | **Anemia of chronic disease** | **Combined ACD + IDA** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Serum ferritin | Low (< 30 ng/mL) | Normal or high (≥ 100 ng/mL) | Intermediate (30–100 ng/mL) |
| Serum iron | Low | Low | Low |
| Transferrin saturation (TSAT) | Low (< 20%) | Low-normal (15–20%) | Low (< 20%) |
| Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) | High | Low-normal | Normal or mildly elevated |
| Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) | Elevated | Normal | Elevated |

- **Serum ferritin**: Intermediate (30–100 ng/mL) [^115wbRKn] from low stores plus inflammation [^1157g8j4].

- **Serum iron**: Low [^111sFJG3] due to reduced stores and inflammatory sequestration [^116ir8de].

- **Transferrin saturation (TSAT)**: Low (< 20%) [^1162718v] from limited availability.

- **Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)**: Normal or mildly elevated, balancing increased transferrin (IDA) and decreased transferrin (ACD) [^112ekgeq].

- **Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR)**: Elevated, reflecting true iron deficiency and helping distinguish from pure ACD [^116Ln8KB].

---

## Inflammatory markers

C-reactive protein (**CRP**) [^112ekgeq] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (**ESR**) are elevated, indicating chronic inflammation [^114Acp5z].

---

## Reticulocyte count

The **reticulocyte count** is low or inappropriately normal [^116116vp], reflecting an inadequate marrow response due to iron restriction and inflammation.

---

## Summary of laboratory findings

| **Laboratory parameter** | **Expected findings in combined ACD + IDA** |
|-|-|
| Hemoglobin and hematocrit | Low |
| MCV | Low-normal or mildly microcytic (75–85 fL) |
| MCH | Low-normal or mildly reduced |
| RDW | Elevated (> 14.5%) |
| Serum ferritin | Intermediate (30–100 ng/mL) |
| Serum iron | Low |
| TSAT | Low (< 20%) |
| TIBC | Normal or mildly elevated |
| sTfR | Elevated |
| CRP and ESR | Elevated |
| Reticulocyte count | Low or inappropriately normal |

---

## Clinical implications

A diagnostic challenge arises because inflammation elevates ferritin, masking iron deficiency [^1157g8j4]; an intermediate ferritin (30–100 ng/mL) [^115wbRKn] with low TSAT [^1162718v] and high sTfR [^116Ln8KB] supports combined ACD/IDA [^111sFJG3]. Treatment considerations include addressing the underlying inflammatory disease and providing iron repletion [^1177mVnZ]; **IV iron** is often preferred when inflammation limits absorption [^111M5RPV].

---

In combined ACD/IDA, laboratory studies show anemia with low-normal or mildly microcytic indices [^111sFJG3]; **intermediate ferritin** [^115wbRKn], **low TSAT** [^1162718v], elevated inflammatory markers [^114Acp5z], and elevated sTfR [^116Ln8KB], reflecting both iron deficiency and inflammatory sequestration [^116ir8de].

### Diagnosis and management of anaemia of chronic disease: Current status [^112ekgeq]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Anaemia of chronic disease is the second most common form of anaemia worldwide and is observed in various inflammatory, infective, and malignant diseases. Functional iron deficiency is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the anaemia, and the polypeptide hepcidin plays a key role. Diagnosis may be challenging, but new automated red cell indices, algorithms for detecting functional iron deficiency, and assays for hepcidin levels are being developed. Management of the causative disease process will usually lead to improved haemoglobin levels. However, when this is not feasible, erythropoietic-stimulating agents are often used, despite concerns about potential adverse effects, particularly thromboembolism. There is increasing evidence that supplemental iron administered parenterally can safely address the functional iron deficiency. Inhibitors of hepcidin and various inflammatory modulators show promise for the future.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^111sFJG3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from an inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis and is defined as hemoglobin two standard deviations below normal with evidence of low body iron stores.

- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (inflammatory bowel disease, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetics (iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (chronic kidney disease).

- **Epidemiology**: In the United States, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5% to 18.0%, while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.

- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased quality of life, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. IDA is also associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically in patients with IBD (diagnosis), ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend diagnosing anemia of chronic disease in the presence of serum ferritin levels greater than 100 mcg/L and transferrin saturation below 20% in patients with biochemical or clinical evidence of inflammation.

Automated cell counters provide measurements of the changes in red cells that accompany iron deficiency, including reduced mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) — hypochromia; and reduced mean cell volume (MCV) — microcytosis. MCH is probably a more reliable marker of iron deficiency as it is less dependent on storage and the counting machine used, and a reduction is seen in both absolute and functional iron deficiency (FID). MCH may also be more sensitive for iron deficiency than MCV. Both microcytosis and hypochromia lose sensitivity for iron deficiency in the presence of chronic disease, thalassaemia, or vitamin B12/folate deficiency.

The specificity of MCV and MCH for iron deficiency is limited, as microcytosis and hypochromia also occur in many hemoglobinopathies (such as thalassaemia, when the MCV is typically reduced out of proportion to the level of anaemia), in sideroblastic anaemia, and in some cases of anaemia of chronic disease. To prevent unnecessary gastrointestinal investigation, hemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended in those with microcytosis and normal iron studies, particularly if there is an appropriate ethnic background.

Serum markers of iron deficiency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron, raised total iron-binding capacity, raised red cell zinc protoporphyrin, increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), low reticulocyte hemoglobin (Retic-Hb), and raised percentage hypochromic red cells. Serum ferritin (SF) is the most specific test for iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation. An SF level of < 15 µg/L is indicative of absent iron stores.

### Individualized treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in adults [^1159a5aK]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common disorders affecting humans, and iron-deficiency anemia continues to represent a major public health problem worldwide. It is especially common among women of childbearing age because of pregnancy and menstrual blood loss. Additional patient groups include those with other sources of blood loss, malnutrition, or gut malabsorption. Iron-deficiency anemia remains prevalent despite the widespread ability to diagnose the disease and the availability of medicinal iron preparations. Therefore, new approaches are needed to effectively manage these patient populations.

In this review, the diagnosis and treatment of iron-deficiency anemia are discussed with emphasis placed on consideration of patient-specific features. It is proposed that all patients participate in their own care by helping their physician to identify a tolerable daily iron dose, formulation, and schedule. Dosing cycles are recommended for iron replacement based on the tolerated daily dose and the total iron deficit. Each cycle consists of 5000 mg of oral elemental iron ingested over at least 1 month, with appropriate follow-up. This approach should assist physicians and their patients with the implementation of individualized treatment strategies for patients with iron-deficiency anemia.

### Best but not perfect: Indirect measure of low iron stores [^115WFgXM]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Making the correct diagnosis of iron deficiency is critical for patient care. However, the use of indirect markers obtained through routine phlebotomy presents a challenge. Low serum iron, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, and MCV are characteristic of iron deficiency but can also result from inflammation. Additionally, hemoglobin and MCV may be low due to genetic causes and, in the case of hemoglobin, to diurnal variation rather than iron deficiency. Transferrin concentrations tend to increase with iron deficiency and decrease with inflammation, whereas transferrin receptor levels rise with both iron deficiency and inflammation.

Serum ferritin is an attractive marker because a very low level (< 10 μg/L) is diagnostic of iron deficiency, as documented by absent stainable iron in a bone marrow aspirate. However, serum ferritin can be normal or even elevated when iron deficiency is documented by absent bone marrow stainable iron. A recent Cochrane review of 512 adults presenting for medical care at various institutions found that a serum ferritin < 30 μg/L had 98% specificity and 79% sensitivity for diagnosing iron deficiency, as documented by absent bone marrow iron.

Lahtiharju et al. make a remarkable contribution by evaluating the relationship of indirect measures of iron status to bone marrow iron stain in 6610 patients and providing evidence that ferritin is the most reliable single biomarker for predicting reduced iron stores. This finding is consistent with studies dated decades ago that established ferritin as a key standalone indicator of iron status.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend establishing the cause of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in these patients. It is crucial to determine whether IDA is due to inadequate intake, poor absorption, or iron loss, typically resulting from gastrointestinal bleeding. Active inflammation should be treated to enhance iron absorption or to mitigate iron depletion (Best Practice Advice).

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: International expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^113ByMeE]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic conditions cannot be viewed in isolation, and there will be circumstances where individuals may have further increased susceptibility to iron deficiency. To optimize outcomes for these patients, risks need to be pre-empted wherever possible. Three important populations to consider among your patients are women (particularly those who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant and those who suffer from heavy menstrual bleeding [HMB]), the elderly, and those undergoing surgery.

Women of reproductive age are one of the most at-risk population groups for iron deficiency anemia. Between 4 and 52% of women of reproductive age are reported to suffer from HMB, with a wide range reflecting disparities between study populations and how HMB is defined. Notably, a recent European study demonstrated that 63% of the participating HMB patients were suffering from iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency in combination with HMB can have debilitating consequences on the QoL and wellbeing of the sufferer. Thus, many of these women enter pregnancy with low iron stores and are often already anemic. Approximately 42% of pregnant women worldwide have anemia, with iron deficiency anemia being the primary cause, and this may have a serious detrimental effect on the outcome for both mother and child. In pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia is associated with increased maternal morbidity and mortality, possibly due to the inability to withstand adverse conditions.

### Iron deficiency anemia in chronic liver disease: Etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^115Lkd1H]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease is accompanied by multiple hematological abnormalities. Iron deficiency anemia is a frequent complication of advanced liver disease. The etiology is multifactorial, mostly due to chronic hemorrhage into the gastrointestinal tract. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is very challenging, as simple laboratory methods, including serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation (Tsat), and mean corpuscular volume, are affected by the liver disease itself or the cause of the disease, resulting in difficulty in the interpretation of the results. Several new parameters, such as red blood cell ferritin, serum transferrin receptor test and index, and hepcidin, have been studied for their utility in indicating true iron deficiency in combination with chronic liver disease. Once iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed, it should be treated with oral or parenteral iron as well as portal pressure reducing drugs. Blood transfusion is reserved for symptomatic anemia despite iron supplementation.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered:

1. Anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts.
2. Anemia with increased reticulocyte counts.
3. Life-long history of chronic anemia.
4. Anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes.

- **Pathophysiologic bases**: The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): Is too little iron making your patient sick [^112Vtput]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia worldwide. However, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia, and these may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more challenging because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure.

Here, I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation. This approach aids in choosing between oral and parenteral administration and making personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### Iron deficiency: New insights into diagnosis and treatment [^112sB6Gi]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common conditions worldwide, especially affecting children and young women. In developing countries, iron deficiency is often caused by poor iron intake and/or parasitic infections, whereas vegetarian dietary choices, poor iron absorption, and chronic blood loss are common causes in high-income countries. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents can result in functional iron deficiency for erythropoiesis even when stores are iron-replete.

Diagnosis of iron deficiency is straightforward, except when it occurs in the context of inflammatory disorders. Oral iron salts correct absolute iron deficiency in most patients because low hepcidin levels facilitate iron absorption. Unfortunately, frequent side effects limit the efficacy of oral iron. Intravenous iron is increasingly utilized; currently available preparations allow rapid normalization of total body iron even with a single infusion and are effective in functional iron deficiency and in iron deficiency associated with inflammatory disorders. The evidence is accumulating that these preparations are safe and effective; however, long-term safety issues of high doses of iron need to be further explored.

### Guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of functional iron deficiency [^116RmEyQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically in evaluating functional iron deficiency, the BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend measuring serum ferritin levels. This is crucial in the assessment and management of all forms of iron-restricted erythropoiesis, including functional iron deficiency. Values should be reviewed, especially those exceeding 1,200 mcg/L, to evaluate the potential for iron overload.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^115jn7J4]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Guideline 2.4 - Treatment of anaemia with iron therapy**: We recommend that serum ferritin should not exceed 800 microgram/L in patients treated with iron, and to achieve this, iron management should be reviewed when the ferritin is > 500 microgram/L (1B).

- **Rationale**:
	- Iron overload is defined as increased total body iron content with the possible risk of organ dysfunction.
	- There is no clinically available method that accurately determines total body iron content.
	- An elevated serum ferritin does not always correlate with elevations in liver iron content.
	- Magnetic resonance imaging provides a reliable assessment of tissue iron content in HD patients regularly treated with parenteral iron. However, the clinical relevance of increased liver iron remains unclear.
	- Elevated serum ferritin, together with elevated serum transferrin saturation, remains the most clinically accurate parameter of iron overload in CKD patients.
	- Discontinuation of adequate maintenance IV iron when an individual's ferritin is > 500 microgram/L produces a population mean that straddles the 500 microgram/L ceiling. Ongoing iron therapy in patients with ferritin > 500 microgram/L results in a higher median ferritin outcome.
	- Interpretation of iron status results and deciding on the need for further iron therapy should include a concomitant assessment of changes in Hb level and ESA dose over time. For example, a dropping ferritin along with decreasing Hb levels signifies blood loss, e.g. on HD or bowel-related anaemia, indicating that iron therapy is warranted. Further investigation may be required.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^111Y5frp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

A complete blood cell (CBC) count for the diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocyte count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count, and leukocyte count.

- **Diagnostic steps**: To differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to assess the MCV and MCH to identify whether the anemia is macrocytic, normocytic, or microcytic. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help identify the various causes of anemia.

In clinical practice, it must be considered that multiple causes of anemia can co-exist in one patient. For example, coexisting iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD) can manifest as microcytic or normocytic anemia. In cases of drug-induced anemia, such as treatment with azathioprine, lab tests can reveal microcytic or even macrocytic anemia. Thus, the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC values are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia but are typically normal in ACD.

The RDW indicates the variation in erythrocyte size and is commonly increased in IDA, while it remains within the normal range in thalassemia.

### Data-driven physiologic thresholds for iron deficiency associated with hematologic decline [^111vFXg5]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency contributes to approximately 50% of anemia prevalence worldwide, but reference intervals for iron status tests are not optimized for anemia diagnosis. To address this limitation, we identified the serum ferritin (SF) thresholds associated with hematologic decline in iron-deficient patients and the SF thresholds from which an SF increase was associated with hematologic improvement.

Paired red blood cell and SF measurements were analyzed from two adult cohorts at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), from 2008 to 2011 (N = 48,409), and 2016 to 2018 (N = 10,042). Inter-patient measurements in the first cohort were used to define optimal SF thresholds based on the physiologic relationship between SF and red cell measurements. Intra-patient measurements (1–26 weeks apart) in the second cohort were used to identify SF thresholds from which an SF increase was associated with an increase in red cell measurements.

- **Variation by demographic factors**: The identified optimal SF thresholds varied with age, sex, and red cell measure. Thresholds associated with an approximately 5% decline in red cell index were typically in the range of 10–25 ng/mL. Thresholds for younger women (18–45 years) were about 5 ng/mL lower than for older women (60–95 years) and about 10 ng/mL lower than for men. Thresholds from which a subsequent increase in SF was associated with a concomitant increase in red cell measure showed similar patterns: younger women had lower thresholds (∼15 ng/mL) than older women (∼25 ng/mL) or men (∼35 ng/mL).

These results suggest that diagnostic accuracy may be improved by setting different SF thresholds for younger women, older women, and men.

### Anemia and iron deficiency in heart failure: Mechanisms and therapeutic approaches [^116RGBgv]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Anemia and iron deficiency are common in patients with heart failure (HF) and are associated with worse symptoms and adverse outcomes in this population. Although the two can occur together, anemia in HF is often not caused by iron deficiency, and iron deficiency can be present without causing anemia. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents have been investigated extensively in the past few years and might be of benefit in patients with HF and anemia. However, concerns have arisen regarding the safety of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in patients with chronic kidney disease, and thus the results of a large mortality trial are eagerly awaited to provide information on safety in patients with HF.

Iron supplementation or replacement is a much older treatment option for patients with HF and anemia, but questions about the safety of intravenous iron and absorption problems with oral formulations have prevented its widespread use at the time of writing. In the past few years, however, new data on the importance of iron deficiency in HF have become available, and a number of studies with intravenous iron have shown promising results. Therefore, this treatment approach is likely to become an attractive option for patients with HF and iron deficiency, both with and without anemia.

### Ferritin outperforms other biomarkers in predicting bone marrow iron stores in patients with hematologic disorders [^117T6jBq]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Although iron-deficiency anemia is common, interpreting iron laboratory test results can be challenging in patients with comorbidities. We aimed to study the accuracy of common iron biomarkers compared with bone marrow iron staining in a large retrospective data set of patients with hematologic disorders.

We collected results from 6610 patients (median age, 66 years) of iron staining along with their ferritin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, transferrin, hemoglobin, and mean red blood cell volume results from Helsinki University Hospital electronic health records. In receiver operating characteristics analysis, ferritin had the highest area under the curve (AUC) with 88% (95% confidence interval, 86–90) for females and 89% (95% CI, 87–91) for males in predicting reduced bone marrow iron.

Using a ferritin cutoff of 30 μg/L resulted in high specificity rates of 97% in females and 99% in males. However, sensitivity rates were only 54% and 35%, respectively. Other studied biomarkers had inferior AUCs. Multivariate logistic regression models did not significantly perform better in prediction than ferritin alone.

With 50% preprobability for reduced iron stores, a ferritin of 30 μg/L (females) and 51 μg/L (males) had a 95% positive predictive value for reduced iron stores. A 95% negative predictive value was achieved at 1750 μg/L (females) and 4967 μg/L (males). In our large population study, ferritin was the best single biomarker for iron deficiency in secondary care. Adding other blood tests in a multivariate model did not improve performance.

### The definition of anemia: What is the lower limit of normal of the blood hemoglobin concentration [^111ULGRj]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of anemia is an important aspect of the practice of hematology. The first step is to decide whether the patient is, in fact, anemic. Unless earlier blood counts are available, and they often are not, the physician must make their decision based on the population distribution of hemoglobin values. How likely is it that the patient's hemoglobin value lies below the normal distribution; that is, "the lower limit"?

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease - a practical approach [^114JCsrn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined by the WHO as a decline in blood hemoglobin to a concentration of < 12 g/dL (120 g/L) in women and < 13 g/dL (130 g/L) in men, parameters which are equally applicable to patients with IBD. When anemia is assessed on the basis of hemoglobin levels, the influence of a range of other factors must, however, be taken into account: pregnancy, altitude, cigarette smoking, and possibly ethnicity. The WHO has therefore additionally issued respective international minimum levels for hemoglobin and hematocrit.

- **Standard parameters of iron deficiency**: Low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and low mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) are generally reliable. However, iron deficiency as the cause of anemia cannot be ruled out on the grounds of a normal MCV, since up to 40% of "pure" IDA cases are normocytic (e.g. in IBD patients treated with azathioprine or 6-MP). Conversely, low MCV does not necessarily indicate iron deficiency, as the presence of anemia of chronic disease (ACD) can cause it to be normal or low. A substantially more accurate IDA diagnosis can be attained by the additional determination of iron metabolism parameters.

- **Components of iron metabolism monitored using routine laboratory methods**:
	- **Iron stores**: Serum ferritin
	- **Iron transport**: Transferrin saturation
	- **Iron utilization**: Erythropoiesis, i.e. proportion of hypochromic erythrocytes or reticulocytes

Serum iron concentrations are governed by a circadian rhythm and can be…

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^1149wkcb]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

- **Definitions**: We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (e.g. transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong). A good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

- **Anaemia**: The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age, and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO-defined lower limits. There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines are typically consulted for further direction.

### Evaluation and management of anemia in the elderly [^11426WUb]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia is now recognized as a risk factor for a number of adverse outcomes in the elderly, including hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. What constitutes appropriate evaluation and management for an elderly patient with anemia, and when to initiate a referral to a hematologist, are significant issues. Attempts to identify suggested hemoglobin levels for blood transfusion therapy have been confounded for elderly patients with their co-morbidities. Since no specific recommended hemoglobin threshold has stood the test of time, prudent transfusion practices to maintain hemoglobin thresholds of 9–10 g/dL in the elderly are indicated, unless or until evidence emerges to indicate otherwise.

### Iron deficiency anemia: Evaluation and management [^114ZYX35]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children should be screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### Molecular pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease [^116ir8de]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Most patients suffering from chronic infections, chronic inflammatory diseases, and some malignancies develop a mild to moderate anemia designated as anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation. Patients with this anemia typically exhibit low serum iron, low to normal transferrin, and high to normal serum ferritin concentrations. The anemia is caused by increased inflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin-6 (IL-6), which induces the production of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin by hepatocytes. Hepcidin blocks the release of iron from macrophages, hepatocytes, and enterocytes, leading to the characteristic hypoferremia associated with this anemia and causing iron deprivation of the developing erythrocytes.

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of anemia [^11693D6F]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common condition diagnosed through laboratory assessment and is characterized by abnormally low hemoglobin concentration or decreased red blood cells. Several classification systems exist to evaluate anemia. Laboratory markers provide crucial information for diagnosis.

Acute anemia presents with symptoms relating to acute blood loss, while chronic anemia may manifest as worsening fatigue, dyspnea, lightheadedness, or chest pain. Specific treatments depend on the underlying etiology of the anemia. Iron supplementation is a treatment option for patients with microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency. In severe cases, hyperbaric oxygen therapy may serve as an alternative rescue therapy. Most patients with chronic anemia can be discharged with follow-up if they are hemodynamically stable.

### Case studies: iron [^111tENc1]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Iron biomarkers were developed to define the size of iron stores and the adequacy of the iron supply required to meet functional needs. Approximately 80% of the iron delivered to tissues through the circulating plasma pool will be incorporated into hemoglobin. Consequently, with the exception of serum ferritin, iron biomarkers are measures of iron sufficiency for erythrocyte production. They have proven to be very valuable in the determination of the cause of anemia in clinical settings when additional information about factors affecting the patient's health is available.

However, all biomarkers are affected by factors other than iron status, which limits their utility in determining the prevalence of iron deficiency in some populations, particularly those living in developing countries. Furthermore, the relationships between iron status and functional outcomes, such as neonatal and infant mortality; motor, cognitive, and emotional development in infants; and severe morbidity from malaria in young children, are inadequately characterized.

There is a need to identify and standardize biomarkers with the highest predictive value for specific functional outcomes in each setting. The most appropriate biomarkers may vary with the setting and be influenced by age, sex, gestational stage of pregnancy, and environmental factors such as repeated or chronic infections. There is also an urgent need for improved technology to permit the use of specific biomarkers in field studies in resource-poor regions.

### Iron deficiency anemia in chronic liver disease: Etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^115tiofG]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease is accompanied by multiple hematological abnormalities. Iron deficiency anemia is a frequent complication of advanced liver disease. The etiology is multifactorial and mostly due to chronic hemorrhage into the gastrointestinal tract. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is very challenging, as simple laboratory methods, including serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation (Tsat), and mean corpuscular volume, are affected by the liver disease itself or the cause of the disease, resulting in difficulty in the interpretation of the results. Several new parameters, such as red blood cell ferritin, serum transferrin receptor test and index, and hepcidin, have been studied for their utility in indicating true iron deficiency in combination with chronic liver disease. Once iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed, it should be treated with oral or parenteral iron, as well as portal pressure-reducing drugs. Blood transfusion is reserved for symptomatic anemia despite iron supplementation.

### Management of iron deficiency [^1177mVnZ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) affects billions of people worldwide and remains the leading cause of anemia, with significant negative impacts on health. Our approach to ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) involves three steps (I3): (1) identification of ID/IDA, (2) investigation of and management of the underlying etiology of ID, and (3) iron repletion.

Iron repletion options include oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations. Oral iron remains a therapeutic option for the treatment of ID in stable patients. However, there are many populations for whom IV iron is more effective. Therefore, IV iron should be considered when there are no contraindications, when a poor response to oral iron is anticipated, when rapid hematologic responses are desired, and/or when there is availability of and accessibility to the product.

Judicious use of red cell blood transfusion is recommended and should be considered only for severe, symptomatic IDA with hemodynamic instability. Identification and management of ID and IDA is a central pillar in patient blood management.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: A review of diagnosis, investigation and management [^113qL1qP]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is the most common form of anaemia worldwide. In men and postmenopausal women, the most common cause of IDA is blood loss from lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, making it a frequent cause for referral to gastroenterologists. Causes of IDA relate either to blood loss or iron malabsorption. After confirmation with laboratory tests, gastrointestinal evaluation is almost always indicated to exclude gastrointestinal malignancy.

Specific patient groups, such as premenopausal women, patients with low-normal ferritin, and iron-deficient patients without anaemia, may require an individualized approach. A small proportion of patients have recurrent or persistent IDA despite negative standard endoscopies. These patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding usually require evaluation of the small bowel with capsule endoscopy or double balloon enteroscopy.

Treatment should involve prompt iron replacement and diagnostic steps directed towards correcting the underlying cause of IDA. Oral iron replacement is cheap and effective, but parenteral (intravenous) therapy may be required due to intolerance, noncompliance, or treatment failure with oral therapy.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^115TJZBu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia is a condition that can be associated with several symptoms and contributing factors. These include anemia secondary to blood loss, frequent blood donations, and cravings for non-nutritive substances such as ice, dirt, or starch. Individuals may experience a sore and red tongue, hypochromic anemia, fatigue, loss of appetite, an increase in serum soluble transferrin receptors, and a decrease in mean corpuscular volume (MCV).

The condition is more prevalent among infants, females, and pregnant individuals. Common symptoms include weakness, an increased platelet count, lightheadedness, elevated red cell distribution width (RDW), dizziness, tachycardia, cold and pale skin, and dyspnea. Children and individuals experiencing heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding are also affected. Additional signs include headache, brittle nails, sideroblastic anemia, lack of dietary iron, inability to absorb iron, chest pain, koilonychia, asthenia, and a decreased reticulocyte count.

Vegetarianism, which can lead to a lack of iron in the diet, is another contributing factor. It is essential to address these symptoms and underlying causes effectively to manage iron-deficiency anemia.

### Normocytic anemia [^113hDmon]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem often discovered during routine laboratory tests. Its prevalence increases with age, reaching 44 percent in men older than 85 years. Normocytic anemia is the most frequently encountered type of anemia. Anemia of chronic disease, the most common normocytic anemia, is found in 6 percent of adult patients hospitalized by family physicians. The goals of evaluation and management are to make an accurate and efficient diagnosis, avoid unnecessary testing, correct underlying treatable causes, and ameliorate symptoms when necessary.

The evaluation begins with a thorough history and careful physical examination. Basic diagnostic studies include the red blood cell distribution width, corrected reticulocyte index, and peripheral blood smear. Further testing is guided by the results of these studies. Treatment should be directed at correcting the underlying cause of the anemia. A recent advance in treatment is the use of recombinant human erythropoietin.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^115bHVQo]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

- **Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements**: Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). IDA can be caused by a range of gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies, including cancer. Therefore, GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

- **Definitions**: We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that iron deficiency be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (e.g. transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^117XW2Lx]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

The development of anaemia from iron deficiency goes through an initial phase where body iron stores are depleted, resulting in hypoferritinaemia, but the Hb concentration is still within the normal range, known as non-anaemic iron deficiency (NAID). For example, in a study of young women with menorrhagia, over half had reduced iron stores, but only 25% were actually anaemic.

The overall prevalence of significant underlying gastrointestinal (GI) pathology, and particularly GI malignancy, is low in NAID. In the absence of other indicators, GI investigation generally is not warranted in premenopausal women since the cause is likely to be menstrual blood loss and/or recent pregnancy (see the special situations section). The threshold for investigation of NAID should, however, be low in men, postmenopausal women, and those with GI symptoms or a family history of GI pathology.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: International expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^116WBw1N]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Based on our literature review, it is evident that iron deficiency is not fully recognized as a disorder distinct from iron deficiency anemia, or as one that may have its own clinical consequences. Indeed, the terms "iron deficiency" and "iron deficiency anemia" are often used interchangeably. Where iron deficiency is discussed, it is frequently perceived as the most common nutritional disorder worldwide, but not as a medical condition in and of itself.

It is clear that the heterogeneity in how iron deficiency is defined is a knowledge gap that is compounding physicians' lack of confidence in recognizing and diagnosing this condition. The lack of a standard simple definition for iron deficiency hinders its uncoupling from iron deficiency anemia and its acceptance as a standalone medical condition with distinct clinical implications.

- **Expert recommendation**: We propose the following wording as an overarching definition of iron deficiency: Iron deficiency is a health-related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia.

- **Clinical impact of iron deficiency**: Iron deficiency may contribute to several symptoms that can manifest even in the absence of progression to anemia. Although there are symptoms that are likely to be caused by iron deficiency (e.g. pagophagia, and RLS), many symptoms are nonspecific, such as fatigue and exhaustion. This means that physicians and patients do not always recognize that iron deficiency is present.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: International expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^114G1cVV]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions reveals lack of consensus in international guidelines for CHF, CKD, and IBD regarding the diagnosis of iron deficiency independent of anemia. Some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition; however, whether this is due to a lack of awareness or an intentional omission is unclear. Iron deficiency can be diagnosed with blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). Nonetheless, guidelines differ on test cut-off values for these parameters.

Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation, and some guidelines recommend assessing chronic inflammation with markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Yet, there is little consensus on when these should be measured — for all patients or only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L−1 or if patients are symptomatic? No standard CRP cut-off values are provided, although a CRP level of 5 mg L−1 is common; this threshold is not widely recognized in most guidelines.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: International expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^116TrxnK]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Managing patients with chronic diseases, particularly those with complex inflammatory disorders, can be challenging. In these patients, a considered multidisciplinary approach needs to be adopted to maintain quality of life (QoL) and improve outcomes. One condition that is frequently associated with chronic disease, but often overlooked, is iron deficiency.

Iron deficiency is estimated to affect 37–61% of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), 24–85% of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and 13–90% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Iron is essential to every cell, and while its fundamental role in oxygen transport through erythropoiesis is well recognized, it is equally critical for energy production and efficient functioning of all of the body's organs. In patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, its impact can be particularly severe and may exacerbate the underlying disease state, leading to accelerated clinical deterioration.

Anemia is the ultimate consequence of iron deficiency in many patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. However, the medical field should recognize iron deficiency as a clinical condition distinct from anemia. Recognition is improving owing to our better understanding of the pathophysiological role of iron deficiency (independent of chronic anemia) in symptomatology and clinical outcomes. This is further supported by recent clinical observations of an association between the alleviation of morbidity or mortality and the treatment of iron deficiency.

Iron deficiency is a major worldwide health problem. Recent evidence indicates that anemia is only the last manifestation of the syndrome and that symptoms can occur before anemia is apparent. Although advances in understanding the physiology of iron deficiency have been made, gaps remain in our understanding. While oral iron supplements continue to be the mainstay treatment, there are some indications for intravenous administration that have developed. This review highlights the epidemiology, physiology, clinical presentation, and treatment options of iron deficiency.

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^116DbepM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC, particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history, and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants aged six to 12 months. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning.

Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or an unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended, beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

### Iron deficiency anemia in chronic liver disease: Etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^111D8Eeg]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The valuable role of ferritin was also demonstrated many years ago by Lipschitz et al, who analyzed serum ferritin levels compared with the iron stores in bone marrow in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) and showed that the mean ferritin level for absent bone marrow iron was 61 μg/L, while increased iron storage was indicated by a ferritin level above 1631 μg/L. Likewise, Nelson et al. demonstrated a significant relationship between serum ferritin and bone marrow iron stores in patients with liver disease and other chronic conditions.

In a systematic analysis, Guyatt et al. found that measurement of serum ferritin was particularly helpful, even in a population with CLD or inflammation, but the test in these patients needs a different interpretation. In their overview of 55 studies, the investigators found that a ferritin level of ≤ 15 μg/L could be considered a highly specific indicator of iron deficiency (ID), while a value ≥ 100 μg/L ruled out ID. The intermediate values needed further interpretation. They also demonstrated that the traditional cutoff point of 12–20 μg/L is not optimal, as the likelihood of ID drops after the level of 40 μg/L for the general population and 70 μg/L for patients with cirrhosis or an inflammatory condition.

Similar results were also demonstrated by a cross-sectional study of 72 patients with CLD and anemia, who underwent bone marrow aspiration for the demonstration of ID. The study proved that serum ferritin remains a very useful tool for the diagnosis of iron-restricted anemia, even in patients with liver cirrhosis. The cutoff level in that study, however, was lower than anticipated.

### Implementing reticulocyte hemoglobin into current hematology algorithms [^112rkjre]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

This systematic review investigates the capabilities of reticulocyte hemoglobin in screening for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia, both with and without comorbidities.

- **Methods**: Participant background and laboratory characteristics were extracted from 14 unique studies conducted between 2015 and 2022. Hemoglobin, reticulocyte hemoglobin, and mean cell volume (MCV) values were utilized in a meta-analysis for identifying iron-deficiency anemia without secondary conditions. Mean laboratory values for each patient population were calculated and used to determine sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. The ferritin and reticulocyte hemoglobin ranges were derived from these mean values.

- **Results**: The meta-analysis demonstrates that hemoglobin and MCV values do not significantly differ between studies, unlike reticulocyte hemoglobin values. The reticulocyte hemoglobin range is smaller than ferritin for the controls, iron deficiency, and iron-deficiency anemia. Reticulocyte hemoglobin values less than 26 pg can distinguish iron-deficiency anemia, while values from 26 to 31.5 pg can distinguish iron deficiency, with an AUC of 0.889. The sensitivity and specificity are 92.3% and 100% for iron-deficiency anemia, 100% and 81.5% for iron deficiency, and 94.4% and 71.4% for both conditions, respectively, with a reference range of < 31.5 pg.

- **Conclusions**: Reticulocyte hemoglobin is potentially a quick screening test for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia in the 21st century [^112oTzg6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the single most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide, accounting for anemia in 5% of American women and 2% of American men. The goal of this review article is to assist practitioners in understanding the physiology of iron metabolism and to aid in accurately diagnosing iron deficiency anemia. The first line of therapy for patients with iron deficiency anemia is oral iron supplementation; it is cheap, safe, and effective at correcting iron deficiency anemia. However, it is not tolerated by some patients, and in a subset of patients, it is insufficient.

Patients in whom the gastrointestinal blood loss exceeds the intestinal ability to absorb iron (e.g. intestinal angiodysplasia) may develop iron deficiency anemia refractory to oral iron supplementation. This population of patients proves to be the most challenging to manage. Historically, these patients have required numerous and frequent blood transfusions and suffer end-organ damage resultant from their refractory anemia. Intravenous iron supplementation fell out of favor secondary to the presence of infrequent but serious side effects. Newer and safer intravenous iron preparations are now available and are likely currently underutilized. This article discusses the possible use of intravenous iron supplementation in the management of patients with severe iron deficiency anemia and those who have failed oral iron supplementation.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: International expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^1128644A]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Expert recommendation**: There is little focus in the guidelines on how iron deficiency, in the absence of anemia, should be diagnosed in relation to the underlying chronic disease. Thus, it is of little surprise that physicians may not prioritize iron deficiency treatment. We wish to propose, based on the literature available, the following consensus laboratory test cut-off values in patients with CHF, CKD, or IBD: Serum ferritin < 100 µg L−1 or TSAT < 20%. If serum ferritin is between 100 and 300 µg L−1, a TSAT test will be required to confirm iron deficiency.

- **Diagnostic workup proposals**: Furthermore, we also propose the following algorithms for the diagnostic workup of iron deficiency in patients with CHF, CKD, and IBD. In all conditions, initial workup should incorporate assessment of serum ferritin and TSAT, as well as Hb levels, in order to distinguish between those with normal hematological parameters, those with some form of iron deficiency (iron deficiency: normal Hb and low iron; or iron deficiency anemia: low Hb and low iron), and those with some other form of anemia (where iron levels are normal but Hb is low). In CKD, we must also consider whether the patient is receiving dialysis. Finally, in IBD, we must further consider whether the underlying condition is in remission or active.

For IBD, we therefore also recommend measuring CRP levels or stool markers such as calprotectin or lactoferrin at the time of iron markers and hematological workup, in order to appropriately manage iron deficiency in relation to these results. We recommend a CRP threshold of 5 mg.

### Iron deficiency anemia: diagnosis and management [^116BQgD7]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) remains a universally problematic condition worldwide. The primary focus of this review is to critique articles published over the past 18 months that describe strategies for the diagnosis and management of this prevalent condition.

The medical community continues to lack consensus on the optimal approach for diagnosing and managing IDA. Diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of biomarkers, such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations and others, and cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA involves supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations have expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since the introduction of low versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include the design of an algorithm that incorporates multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics. This will provide direction in managing IDA and distinguish it from anemia of chronic disease.

### Serum or plasma ferritin concentration as an index of iron deficiency and overload [^1157g8j4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Reference standard indices of iron deficiency and iron overload are generally invasive, expensive, and can be unpleasant or occasionally risky. Ferritin is an iron storage protein, and its concentration in the plasma or serum reflects iron stores; low ferritin indicates iron deficiency, while elevated ferritin reflects the risk of iron overload. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase protein, and its levels are elevated in inflammation and infection. The use of ferritin as a diagnostic test of iron deficiency and overload is a common clinical practice.

- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin concentrations (serum or plasma) for detecting iron deficiency and risk of iron overload in primary and secondary iron-loading syndromes.
