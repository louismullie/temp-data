## Question

What are the current guidelines for the management of aortic stenosis in elderly patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the current guidelines for managing aortic stenosis in elderly patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "elderly" in guideline context and the overarching principles that drive decisions. Then, I should verify the diagnostic thresholds and severity stratification. Next, I will examine indications for intervention in symptomatic versus asymptomatic disease. After that, I need to compare SAVR versus TAVI by age and risk, including valve choice and durability. I will then consider special scenarios like low-gradient AS, noncardiac surgery, and frailty. Finally, I should review medical management, surveillance, and shared decision-making, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with contemporary evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the definition of "elderly" and the core principles. In contemporary guidelines, "elderly" is operationalized around age thresholds of 65, 75–80, and > 80 years, with decisions anchored to life expectancy, surgical risk, anatomy, and patient preferences rather than age alone, emphasizing shared decision-making and multidisciplinary Heart Valve Team evaluation [^112Q6wbX] [^111LbRhi] [^113vsYN7].

> I need to check the diagnostic framework and severity cutoffs. Severe aortic stenosis is defined by aortic jet velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s, mean pressure gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg, or valve area ≤ 1.0 cm², with echocardiography as first-line and CT or catheterization reserved for discordant cases or pre-procedural planning; very severe disease (velocity ≥ 5.0 m/s or mean gradient ≥ 60 mm Hg) carries faster progression and higher event risk, which can influence timing discussions in select patients [^114XwPD1] [^116BzRKN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about intervention in everyone with severe disease. I should confirm that symptomatic severe AS is a Class I indication for aortic valve replacement regardless of age, with symptoms including exertional dyspnea, angina, syncope or presyncope, or heart failure, and that exercise testing can unmask symptoms or abnormal hemodynamics that upgrade risk and support earlier intervention in otherwise "asymptomatic" patients [^1151D4JR] [^114HbnBW] [^111vLhsH].

> Next, I should review asymptomatic severe AS. Wait, let me verify the triggers for intervention beyond symptoms: reduced LVEF (< 50% per ACC/AHA, < 55% per ESC/EACTS), abnormal exercise test (hypotension, symptoms, or limited exercise capacity), very severe stenosis, rapid progression, or markedly elevated BNP are recognized indications or considerations for early AVR in carefully selected patients, balancing procedural risk and life expectancy [^115ZeyBu] [^1153JGUq] [^114HbnBW].

> I will now examine the SAVR versus TAVI choice by age and risk. For patients < 65 years or with life expectancy > 20 years, SAVR is generally preferred due to durability; for 65–80 years, either SAVR or transfemoral TAVI is reasonable after shared decision-making; for > 80 years or those with life expectancy < 10 years, transfemoral TAVI is favored when anatomy is suitable, given lower invasiveness and faster recovery, though anatomy and access must be verified with CT [^112Q6wbX] [^111LbRhi] [^1169Mty8].

> Let me consider valve selection and durability. I should confirm that in patients ≥ 65 years, bioprosthetic valves are preferred, whereas mechanical valves may be considered in younger patients without contraindications to anticoagulation; importantly, long-term TAVI durability beyond 5–6 years remains under active study, which is why younger patients with long expected survival are steered toward SAVR when feasible [^114EZHGd] [^116oyXcc] [^117BZZ78].

> But wait, what if the patient has low-gradient severe AS or discordant measures. I need to ensure we distinguish true severe from pseudo-severe or mixed entities using dobutamine echocardiography, CT calcium scoring, and careful hemodynamic assessment; in reduced EF low-flow, low-gradient AS with contractile reserve, AVR improves outcomes, whereas normal-flow low-gradient "severe" AS remains debated and often behaves more like moderate disease, requiring individualized decisions and, in some cases, invasive hemodynamics [^112oqzym] [^116ohj4y].

> Next, I should review noncardiac surgery considerations. For symptomatic severe AS facing intermediate- or high-risk elective noncardiac surgery, preoperative AVR is recommended to mitigate perioperative risk; in asymptomatic severe AS facing high-risk noncardiac surgery, Heart Team discussion of preemptive AVR is reasonable, balancing urgency and risk, and this is particularly relevant in older adults with limited physiologic reserve [^115aGQsd] [^116LFGuE] [^115PMh6t].

> I need to ensure we address frailty and comorbidity. Frailty, cognitive impairment, and multi-organ dysfunction independently predict poor outcomes and may shift the balance toward TAVI or even palliative care when intervention is unlikely to improve survival or quality of life; objective frailty tools and geriatric assessment should inform decisions, and futility thresholds should be discussed transparently with patients and families [^114rEi17] [^1158aeCh] [^115w5S8e].

> Let me verify medical management and surveillance. There is no disease-modifying medical therapy for calcific AS; treat hypertension per standard thresholds, start statins for atherosclerotic risk but not to slow AS progression, and monitor asymptomatic severe AS with echocardiography every 6–12 months, moderate AS every 1–2 years, and mild AS every 3–5 years, with earlier reassessment if symptoms or new LV dysfunction emerge [^113tBnbV] [^113RszgK] [^113DcFzu] [^112ibFtQ].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of the Heart Valve Team and shared decision-making. Contemporary guidelines mandate multidisciplinary evaluation for severe valvular disease, explicit risk calculation using validated tools, and structured discussions of benefits, risks, durability, and patient values; this is especially critical in older adults where trade-offs between invasiveness, recovery, and longevity are nuanced [^113vsYN7] [^111wCjAr] [^114rnc3g].

> Let me reconsider emerging evidence that might lower intervention thresholds. Randomized data suggest early TAVI in selected asymptomatic severe AS may reduce death, stroke, or unplanned hospitalization compared with watchful waiting, and meta-analyses of RCTs support early AVR in high-risk asymptomatic patients; however, these findings should be integrated cautiously with guideline criteria and individualized risk assessment until practice-wide adoption is clearer [^114sw7QB] [^111KTNfS] [^112JRHLx].

> In summary, I should double-check that my synthesis aligns with guidelines: in elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis, prioritize prompt AVR for symptomatic disease; in asymptomatic patients, intervene for LV dysfunction, abnormal exercise testing, very severe stenosis, rapid progression, or markedly elevated BNP; choose SAVR for < 65 years or > 20-year life expectancy, either SAVR or TAVI for 65–80 years via shared decision-making, and favor transfemoral TAVI for > 80 years or < 10-year life expectancy when anatomy allows; anchor all decisions in Heart Team review, frailty assessment, and patient preferences, and maintain vigilant surveillance when intervention is deferred [^112Q6wbX] [^111LbRhi] [^114HbnBW].

Current guidelines for aortic stenosis in the elderly emphasize **shared decision-making** and **individualized care** based on age, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^114rnc3g]. For patients ≥ 80 years or those with high surgical risk, **TAVI is preferred** over SAVR when anatomy is suitable, given lower invasiveness and faster recovery [^111LbRhi] [^113Z92Kt]. For patients 65–79 years, either SAVR or TAVI is reasonable, with TAVI favored for higher surgical risk or patient preference [^117BZZ78] [^1139CMMq]. In asymptomatic severe AS, intervention is indicated for LVEF < 50%, rapid progression, or abnormal exercise testing; otherwise, close surveillance is recommended [^115ZeyBu] [^111ogZN8]. Medical therapy focuses on symptom control and comorbidity management, as no medication slows AS progression [^113DcFzu] [^1141ARES].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Echocardiography**: Gold standard for diagnosis, severity grading, and monitoring progression [^114U8syd] [^114XwPD1].
- **Exercise testing**: Useful in asymptomatic patients to unmask symptoms or hemodynamic compromise [^111ogZN8] [^111vLhsH].
- **Multidisciplinary heart team**: Essential for complex cases, including high-risk patients or those with multiple comorbidities [^113vsYN7] [^113hUsRf].

---

## Indications for intervention

Intervention is indicated for **symptomatic severe AS** (exertional dyspnea, angina, syncope, or heart failure) [^1151D4JR]. In asymptomatic severe AS, intervention is indicated when any of the following are present: LVEF < 50%, rapid progression (≥ 0.3 m/s/year), very severe AS (peak velocity ≥ 5.0 m/s), or an abnormal exercise test (symptoms or ≥ 10 mmHg drop in systolic BP) [^115ZeyBu] [^1153JGUq] [^116BzRKN].

---

## Choice of intervention: TAVI vs. SAVR

| **Patient group** | **Preferred intervention** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| ≥ 80 years or high surgical risk | TAVI | - Less invasive <br/> - Lower procedural risk <br/> - Faster recovery [^111LbRhi] [^113Z92Kt] |
| 65–79 years, low to intermediate risk | Either SAVR or TAVI | - Shared decision-making <br/> - Consider anatomy, comorbidities, and patient preference [^117BZZ78] [^1139CMMq] |
| < 65 years or life expectancy > 20 years | SAVR | - Greater durability <br/> - Lower reintervention risk [^113qMx9U] [^114KXrhK] |

---

## Medical management

- **Hypertension**: Treat per standard guidelines, starting low and titrating carefully [^113tBnbV] [^112R9Ehg].
- **Statins**: Use for atherosclerotic risk reduction, not to slow AS progression [^113RszgK] [^113DcFzu].
- **Heart failure**: Optimize guideline-directed medical therapy, recognizing limitations in severe AS [^114ewqWJ].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Asymptomatic patients should undergo **echocardiography every 6–12 months** for severe AS, annually for moderate AS, and every 2–3 years for mild AS [^111QetAu] [^117Tk4TF]. Patients should be educated to promptly report new or worsening symptoms [^111QetAu].

---

## Special considerations

- **Frailty and comorbidities**: Comprehensive geriatric assessment is essential to guide intervention choice and timing [^115w5S8e].
- **Noncardiac surgery**: Symptomatic severe AS should undergo valve intervention before elective intermediate/high-risk noncardiac surgery when feasible [^115aGQsd] [^115PMh6t].
- **End-of-life care**: Palliative care discussion is recommended for patients with limited life expectancy or prohibitive surgical risk [^1178QYWy] [^1158aeCh].

---

Current guidelines prioritize **individualized, multidisciplinary care** for elderly patients with aortic stenosis, balancing symptom burden, disease severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences to optimize outcomes.

### ESC / EACTS vs. ACC / AHA guidelines for the management of severe aortic stenosis [^114sUF8v]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a serious and complex condition, for which optimal management continues to evolve rapidly. An understanding of current clinical practice guidelines is critical to effective patient care and shared decision-making. This state of the art review of the 2021 European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Guidelines and 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines compares their recommendations for AS based on the evidence to date. The European and American guidelines were generally congruent with the exception of three key distinctions. First, the European guidelines recommend intervening at a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, compared with 60% over serial imaging by the American guidelines for asymptomatic patients. Second, the European guidelines recommend a threshold of ≥ 65 years for surgical bioprosthesis, whereas the American guidelines employ multiple age categories, providing latitude for patient factors and preferences. Third, the guidelines endorse different age cut-offs for transcatheter vs. surgical aortic valve replacement, despite limited evidence. This review also discusses trends indicating a decreasing proportion of mechanical valve replacements. Finally, the review identifies gaps in the literature for areas including transcatheter aortic valve implantation in asymptomatic patients, the appropriateness of Ross procedures, concomitant coronary revascularization with aortic valve replacement, and bicuspid AS. To summarize, this state of the art review compares the latest European and American guidelines on the management of AS to highlight three areas of divergence: timing of intervention, valve selection, and surgical vs. transcatheter aortic valve replacement criteria.

### Lifetime management of aortic stenosis: transcatheter versus surgical treatment for young and low-risk patients [^115hmAKL]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is now indicated across all risk categories of patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and has been proposed as first line option for the majority of patients > 74 years old. However, median age of patients enrolled in the transcatheter aortic valve replacement low-risk trials is 74 years and transcatheter aortic valve replacement has never been systematically investigated in young low risk patients. Although the long-term data in surgical aortic valve replacement in young patients (age < 75) are well known, such data remain lacking in transcatheter aortic valve replacement. In the absence of clear guideline recommendations in patients with challenging anatomies (eg, hostile calcium, bicuspid), it is important to know the potential advantages and disadvantages of each treatment and to consider how they might integrate with each other in the lifetime management of such patients. In this review, we discuss current outstanding issues on the management of severe aortic stenosis from a lifetime management perspective, particularly in terms of initial intervention and future reinterventions.

Importance

Aortic stenosis is the most common form of valvular heart disease. Progression of aortic stenosis is very slow and highly variable. Decisions about when to perform valve surgery are made by subjective assessment of patient symptoms and objective measures of the valve and ventricular function by transthoracic echocardiography.

Objective

To review current concepts regarding the development, progression, and assessment of aortic stenosis; the appropriate monitoring intervals for transthoracic echocardiography; and the indications for valve procedures.

Evidence Review

Guidelines and literature search.

Findings

Angina, exertional syncope, and heart failure are key symptoms indicating a need for intervention. The frequency of valvular monitoring by transthoracic echocardiography is guided by the disease severity. Despite evidence of severe disease, valve procedures can safely be deferred if patients experience no symptoms and have normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis may subconsciously curtail their activities to avoid symptoms. Apparently, asymptomatic patients can undergo a carefully monitored exercise stress test to confirm both their asymptomatic status and hemodynamic response to exercise. Bioprosthetic valves are a good replacement alternative for older patients who are good surgical candidates and who have no need for warfarin therapy. For patients who are at high or very high risk of cardiac surgery, transcutaneous aortic valve implantation is an increasing available and preferred over medical management.

Conclusions and Relevance

Asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis require frequent monitoring of their subjective symptoms combined with objective measurement of aortic valve gradient and ventricular function by transthoracic echocardiography. Although conventional surgical replacement remains the mainstay of therapy for aortic stenosis, transcutaneous aortic valve implantation options are evolving.

### Management of elderly patients with aortic valve disease [^113mMPxG]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Increased life expectancy has resulted in a growing population of elderly people, among whom aortic stenosis is increasingly prevalent. For the majority of patients, the treatment of aortic stenosis is surgical, and every symptomatic patient should be considered for aortic valve replacement. Although operative mortality seems to be declining over time, a substantial number of patients do not undergo surgery because of excessive risk, advanced age, or treatment preference of either the patient or the physician. The challenge in the near future will be the enhancement of tools for proper clinical decision-making, so that patients can be stratified to appropriate treatment alternatives. Reports on the treatment of aortic valve stenosis should, therefore, include all patients presenting with the disease and not only those who receive surgery.

### Moderate aortic stenosis: culprit or bystander? [^115mzAND]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Contemporary management

The 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease and the 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease both recommend consideration for valvular replacement for moderate AS in patients who are already undergoing open heart surgery (class IIa, level of evidence C for both guidelines). The major rationale for this recommendation is the elevated perioperative risk and potential for damage to bypass grafts (if present) during repeat sternotomy should the moderate AS progress and require operative intervention in the future. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend screening patients with moderate AS with echocardiography every 1–2 years to assess for progression versus the ESC/EACTS guidelines which recommend yearly screening. Currently, guidelines do not recommend stratification of individuals at risk of rapid progression.

Aortic stenosis — when to intervene?

When assessing a patient with aortic valve stenosis, some essential questions have to be asked and answered. How severe is the aortic stenosis? Does the patient have symptoms? Are the symptoms related to valvular disease? What are the patient's life expectancy and expected quality of life? Do the expected benefits of intervention outweigh its risks? Are local resources optimal for the planned intervention? What is the patient's preference?

Echocardiography is the key diagnostic tool. It confirms the presence of aortic valve stenosis; assesses the degree of valve calcification, left ventricular (LV)function and wall thickness and detects the presence of other associated valve disease or aortic pathology. Doppler echocardiography is the preferred technique for assessing the severity of the aortic valve stenosis.

In accordance with the 2012 ESC/EACTS guidelines, early therapy is strongly recommended in all symptomatic patients with severe high-gradient aortic stenosis (mean gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg or peak velocity ≥ 4 m/s; class I, level of evidence (LoE) B). For this patient group, there is virtually no lower ejection fraction limit for intervention. The only exceptions are patients with severe comorbidities indicating a survival of < 1 year and patients in whom severe comorbidities or their general condition at an advanced age make it unlikely that the intervention will improve quality of life or survival (class III, LoE C).

### Clinical outcomes according to aortic stenosis management: insights from real-world practice [^115qybBU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent valvular heart disease in Western countries, affecting ≈5% of individuals aged > 65 year old. Untreated, symptomatic severe AS is associated with poor short‐term prognosis, significant rates of health care resource usage including frequent hospitalizations for heart failure (HF), and impaired quality of life. To date, aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the only effective therapy that has been proven to improve survival. Therefore, current guidelines strongly recommend to refer symptomatic patients with severe AS for AVR, whether surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter (TAVR), depending on surgical risk and/or patient age.

Despite these recommendations, previous studies consistently reported an underuse of AVR in a significant proportion of symptomatic patients with severe AS. Additionally, the question of more timely interventions in severe but also moderate AS emerges to reduce its burden, particularly at a time of low AVR‐related death even for those who were previously deemed to be inoperable. Importantly, most of the studies exploring the current management of patients with AS and its association with outcomes are restricted to severe AS, tertiary centers, report only limited follow‐up or may be biased by the cost or the availability of the selected therapy. Finally, the latest American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines suggest different age thresholds (65 and 80) for choosing between SAVR or TAVR and highlight for the first time the importance of shared decision making with the patient. In this context, there are few data on patients who did not have an AVR (because they refused or in whom AVR was considered futile) despite a strong indication.

Given the growing interest in intervention in AS patients, a deeper understanding of the population risk profile and clinical course of the disease through contemporary and unbiased management may serve as a benchmark for future clinical studies. Based on a population of outpatients across the overall spectrum of AS (mild, moderate and severe AS), this study aimed to explore the mode of intervention, in the overall cohort and according to the age of the patients proposed by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, as well as the association between the initial therapeutic decision and long‐term outcomes, including patients in whom AVR was considered futile or patients who refused AVR.

### Lifetime management for aortic stenosis: strategy and decision-making in the current era [^114AbNJq]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis, the most common valvular disease in the Western world, has traditionally been treated with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) but is increasingly treated by transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Whereas patients older than 65 years are preferably treated with bioprosthetic tissue valves, there is considerable uncertainty in the choice between TAVR and SAVR. We present various considerations for optimizing the lifelong management of patients receiving bioprosthetic valves (SAVR or TAVR). To maximize life expectancy and to minimize cumulative lifetime risk, we suggest decision-making individualized for patient anatomy and overall (current and future) risk.

### Moderate aortic stenosis: culprit or bystander? [^1132yPc9]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-rheumatic aortic stenosis (AS) is among the most common valvular pathologies affecting older adults in developed countries, with rates expected to increase with the ageing of the population. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is currently advocated for those with severe symptomatic AS based on substantial morbidity and mortality without intervention. By contrast, imaging surveillance is currently recommended for patients with moderate AS.

The decision to recommend non-operative treatment in moderate AS has historically been based on (1) observation of a low overall risk for sudden cardiac death with moderate rather than severe AS and (2) high procedural risk associated with AVR. Advances in surgical and catheter-based approaches to aortic valve intervention have led to improved procedural outcomes, with contemporary procedural mortality for low-risk patients with AS as low as 0.4% after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and 0.9% after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests a worse prognosis associated with moderate AS than previously appreciated. These developments bring into question whether the current risk/benefit paradigm has shifted in favour of earlier intervention for AS.

In this review, we summarise the contemporary understanding of moderate AS, including the epidemiology, current surveillance and management guidelines, clinical outcomes, and future areas of investigation.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114KXrhK]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2020 aortic valve intervention — adults < 65 years: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has demonstrated excellent durability, and earlier randomized trials of SAVR versus transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) enrolled older adults with a mean age in the mid-80s, while more recent lower-risk trials had a mean age in the mid-70s with very few patients < 65 years of age, so the evidence base cannot be extrapolated to these patients. Based on the published evidence, the guideline states that the most prudent course is to recommend SAVR for adults < 65 years of age unless life expectancy is limited by comorbid cardiac or noncardiac conditions, and there are no data for the use of TAVI in patients < 65 years of age; the final choice is made through shared decision-making that accounts for the patient's values and preferences.

### In asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis, is earlier intervention better? [^114sw7QB]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Kenny Lin, MD, MPH Posted on November 25, 2024 Affecting three in 100 adults older than 65 years, aortic stenosis is classified as mild, moderate, and severe based on echocardiographic measurements. The onset of symptoms — dyspnea, volume overload, angina, syncope — is associated with a poor prognosis and is the usual indication for aortic valve replacement. Although valve replacement traditionally required open surgery, transcatheter aortic valve implantation has become increasingly common. A current. JAMA review article quotes a 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline as recommending surgical aortic valve replacement for patients younger than 65 years, TAVI for patients 80 years or older, and either procedure in patients 65 to 79 years, depending on operative risk and comorbidities.

A recent editorial in the Journal of the American Heart Association discussed a "paradigm shift" in management of severe aortic stenosis: 69% of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who underwent aortic valve replacement from 2012–2019 had TAVI, with the percentage undergoing SAVR falling from 75% in 2012 to just 10% in 2019. In addition, the overall volume of procedures tripled during this period, suggesting either a dramatic increase in disease severity or more likely, a lower threshold for intervention. Whether aortic valve replacement in older adults without symptoms of severe aortic stenosis is more beneficial than waiting for symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction to develop is a topic of ongoing research. Two randomized trials published last month shed some light on this question. In a multicenter trial in the United States and Canada, 901 patients older than 65 years with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis were randomized to early TAVI or guideline-recommended clinical surveillance. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, stroke, or unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization. After a median follow-up of 3. 8 years, patients assigned to early TAVI had lower mortality, fewer strokes, and fewer unplanned hospitalizations. Of the clinical surveillance group, 87% eventually underwent aortic valve replacement. A second trial in the United Kingdom and Australia studied 224 patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis and a cardiac MRI showing myocardial fibrosis, which predicts left ventricular decompensation and a poor long-term outcome. Participants were randomized to early aortic valve replacement or conservative management.

Although the primary outcome, a composite of all-cause death and unplanned hospitalization related to aortic stenosis, occurred less frequently in the intervention group than in the control group, this difference was not statistically significant. An accompanying editorial observed that this trial, which fell short of its target enrollment of 356 patients, was underpowered to detect a difference in the outcome. Further, because of scheduling difficulties, 14% of participants in the intervention group had not received valve replacement at 12 months after enrollment. Finally, based on older guidelines that limited TAVI to patients at high operative risk, 75% of the intervention group had SAVR rather than TAVI.

### Aortic stenosis and noncardiac surgery in the era of transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^112meqDg]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common form of valvular heart disease in the elderly. As this patient population continues to increase, anesthesiologists more often will encounter these patients in the perioperative setting for noncardiac surgical procedures. Cardiac risk during noncardiac surgery in the patient with AS appears to have decreased significantly compared with previous reports that shaped current practice guidelines for perioperative management. In addition, these guidelines preceded the publication of current data supporting the continually expanding role for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the treatment of AS. In this review, the authors highlight the most recent evidence suggesting that an update of these guidelines is warranted. In addition, the accumulating evidence supporting the role for transcatheter aortic valve replacement to treat AS since the publication of guidelines is reviewed.

### Decision-making approach to the treatment of young and low-risk patients with aortic stenosis [^111zY3Tn]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

Over a decade of randomized controlled trial data demonstrate excellent outcomes with transcatheter aortic valve replacement or surgical aortic valve replacement for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis regardless of surgical risk. The 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend both options for low-risk AS patients aged 65 to 80 years. However, the fastest growing population of patients receiving transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the United States is < 65 years old, with little data to support the practice. The American College of Cardiology's Cardiac Surgery Team Section Leadership and Interventional Cardiology Councils, a multidisciplinary collaboration of cardiologists and cardiac surgeons, sought to summarize the relevant data into a decision-making tool for heart valve teams. A literature review was completed, and guidelines, randomized controlled trials, and large observational studies were summarized into a pragmatic decision-making approach to treating young and low-risk patients with AS.

### Natural history, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic strategies for patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis [^1141xRPp]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most common valvular diseases encountered in clinical practice. Current guidelines recommend aortic valve replacement (AVR) when the aortic valve is severely stenotic and the patient is symptomatic; however, a substantial proportion of patients with severe AS are asymptomatic at the time of first diagnosis. Although specific morphological valve features, exercise testing, stress imaging, and biomarkers can help to identify patients with asymptomatic severe AS who may benefit from early AVR, the optimal management of these patients remains uncertain and controversial. The current report presents a comprehensive review of the natural history and the diagnostic evaluation of asymptomatic patients with severe AS, and is followed by a meta-analysis from reported studies comparing an early AVR strategy to active surveillance, with an emphasis on the level of evidence substantiating the current guideline recommendations. Finally, perspectives on directions for future investigation are discussed.

### Imaging and impact of myocardial fibrosis in aortic stenosis [^1141ARES]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis is one of the most common valvular diseases in the Western world, with an estimated prevalence as high as 12.4% in the elderly. Aortic stenosis is characterized not only by progressive valve obstruction, but also by the left ventricular remodeling response. Narrowing of the valve causes pressure overload of the left ventricle and triggers a hypertrophic response that maintains myocardial performance for many years, if not decades. However, with time, this process decompensates as patients transition from hypertrophy to heart failure, a change that is heralded clinically by the development of symptoms and adverse events, leading to consideration of aortic valve replacement (AVR).

Aortic stenosis progresses inexorably. Although the early stages are asymptomatic and associated with a good prognosis, advanced disease is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite much research, to date there are no proven medical therapies that slow disease progression. The only definitive treatment for severe aortic stenosis remains AVR, either by surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) approaches. The uptake of TAVR has grown exponentially, as interventions that were initially offered only to elderly, inoperable patients are now being performed in younger, lower-risk patients with excellent results. Decisions about if, when, and how to intervene have therefore become increasingly complex, requiring careful assessment of individual patients within a multidisciplinary heart team.

Current guidelines recommend intervention in patients with severe aortic stenosis and evidence of left ventricular decompensation. Most commonly this is in the form of development of typical symptoms, but other markers include a reduction in ejection fraction < 50%, an abnormal exercise tolerance test, or a rise in brain natriuretic peptide levels. Unfortunately, symptoms are often difficult to identify in the elderly comorbid patients encountered in clinical practice, and many of the other changes appear only late in the course of the disease after irreversible myocardial damage has become established. European Society of Cardiology guidelines provide a Class 1 recommendation, Level of Evidence: B, for intervention in the most common scenario — symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis. However, intervention in asymptomatic patients with a reduction in ejection fraction < 50% or an abnormal exercise test is only Level of Evidence: C (i.e. expert opinion). The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines are largely in alignment. This highlights the need for more robust data to better risk-stratify patients and optimize management strategies before the onset of symptoms and heart failure.

### Timing of intervention in aortic stenosis: a review of current and future strategies [^115AzeRM]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Current guideline-recommended treatment strategies and their limitations

Broadly speaking, contemporary clinical guidelines recommend aortic valve intervention when stenosis severity is deemed severe and there is evidence of left ventricular decompensation, using either direct objective or surrogate symptomatic measures (figure 1 and table 1). Haemodynamic severity is best assessed using echocardiography but can be challenging when measures of severity are discordant or low-flow states exist. New recommendations for confirming AS severity are given in the 2017 ESC/EACTS guideline update. Detailed discussion of low-flow states is beyond the scope of this article but can be found elsewhere.

### Management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112JRHLx]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aortic stenosis is the valvular heart lesion with the highest clinical impact and mortality worldwide, accounting for half of valve-related deaths. For patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, European and American guidelines indicate that aortic valve replacement is advised as a class IB and class IA recommendation, respectively. However, more ambiguity exists in the management of patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis, where intervention is not recommended unless signs of adverse prognosis are present. These indicators include rapid progression of the valve stenosis, severe valve calcification, valve parameters reflecting the 'very severe' end of the spectrum of the disease, or signs of left ventricular impairment by echocardiographic data or blood biomarkers, although strong evidence for these is lacking.

However, many would argue that by the time the left ventricular myocardium shows direct or indirect signs of impairment, it is already too late, with irreversible damage establishedand the 'therapeutic window' for intervention missed. Additionally, studies have shown that most patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis exhibit symptoms in the first 2 years following the diagnosis. Many deaths however occur in the period of 'watchful waiting'. These observations have caused much controversy among clinicians and highlight the need for improved risk stratification models and better individualised management strategies according to each patient's risk.

The optimal timing of aortic valve intervention in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis is yet to be ascertained. Undoubtedly, after the results of the Aortic Valve ReplAcemenT versus Conservative Treatment in Asymptomatic SeveRe Aortic Stenosis (AVATAR) trial, many would argue whether the time for a change in clinical practice is fast-approaching. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and observational studies comparing early intervention versus conservative management of patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis to synthesise and evaluate the current evidence.

Future directions

Randomised control trials are ongoing to determine whether patients with moderate AS benefit from earlier valvular intervention than the current guideline-recommended approach. The TAVR UNLOAD (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement to UNload the Left Ventricle in Patients with ADvanced Heart Failure; National Clinical Trial [NCT]: 02661451) trial will randomize 300 patients with moderate AS and LVEF < 50% to TAVR versus optimal HF therapy to determine whether patients who undergo TAVR have lower rates of all-cause death and HF hospitalizations. The PROGRESS (Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Trial to Assess the Management of Moderate Aortic Stenosis by Clinical Surveillance or Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement; NCT: 04889872) trial will randomize 750 adults aged 65 and older with moderate AS to TAVR or clinical surveillance and will study whether a composite outcome of death, stroke or unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization is different between the two groups. The results of these upcoming trials will help inform whether AVR could have a role in select patients with moderate AS.

Integrated benefit–risk and decision-making pathways — guided actions for aortic valve replacement (AVR) selection are organized as: No current indication for AVR lists periodic monitoring of aortic stenosis (AS) severity and symptoms and re-evaluation when AS is severe or symptoms occur. When AVR is indicated but surgical AVR (SAVR) is preferred over TAVR, the document states 'SAVR recommended in lower-risk patients', notes valve durability considerations in younger patients, and that a concurrent surgical procedure may be needed. For a TAVR candidate with expected benefit > risk, actions include discussion with patient and family and proceeding with TAVR imaging evaluation and procedure. For severe symptomatic AS but benefit < risk (futility), thresholds include life expectancy < 1 year and chance of survival with benefit at 2 years < 25%, with actions including discussion with patient and family, palliative care inputs, and palliative balloon aortic valvuloplasty in selected patients.

Role of Age inManagement

Age is an important determinant in AS management, and its influence on interventional decision making has already been observed in several studies. The 2020 American guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease suggested 65 and 80 years as thresholds for choosing between SAVR and TAVR. AS management in the present cohort matched relatively well with the guidelines with mostly SAVR performed when aged < 65 years, mostly TAVR performed when aged > 80 years, and a more balanced management (half SAVR/half TAVR) when aged 65 to 80 years. Additionally, our data also demonstrate that older patients with AS are less likely to undergo AVR regardless of AS severity at inclusion, and less than half of patients with severe AS aged > 80 years underwent AVR during the follow‐up. It should be emphasized that at a time of low procedural mortality rates, with a wide majority of TAVR performed with transfemoral access, a decision not to intervene should not be solely based on age. Given that TAVR has been shown to be safe and effective in patients at high or prohibitive risk, clinicians should be encouraged to screen a broader range of patients for intervention.

Finally, it is important to emphasize that age should not be the sole factor in deciding on an intervention. According to the latest American guidelines, the choice of treatment should be based on life expectancy. For patients aged < 65 years, SAVR should be considered if their life expectancy exceeds 20 years, while for patients aged > 80 years, TAVR should be considered if their life expectancy is < 10 years. Although predicting remaining years of life can be challenging, US actuarial life expectancy tables can provide useful estimates.

ACC/AHA 2020 aortic valve intervention — adults 65–80 years: Both SAVR and TAVI are effective approaches to aortic valve replacement (AVR) in adults 65 to 80 years of age, and the guideline makes the same recommendations for symptomatic patients with confirmed severe aortic stenosis (AS) regardless of flow rate. In this age group, TAVI has a slightly lower mortality risk and is associated with a shorter hospital length of stay, more rapid return to normal activities, lower risk of transient or permanent atrial fibrillation (AF), less bleeding, and less pain than SAVR, whereas SAVR is associated with a lower risk of paravalvular leak, less need for valve reintervention, and less need for a permanent pacemaker. Individualized factors must be considered when choosing between procedures, and durability of transcatheter valves beyond 5 to 6 years is not yet known.

### Clinical practice guideline for transcatheter versus surgical valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis in Latin America [^112LryEW]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

In elderly (75 years or older) patients living in Latin America with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis candidates for transfemoral approach, the panel suggests the use of transcatheter aortic valve implant (TAVI) over surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). This is a conditional recommendation, based on moderate certainty in the evidence (⨁⨁⨁Ο). This recommendation does not apply to patients in which there is a standard of care, like TAVI for patients at very high risk for cardiac surgery or inoperable patients, or SAVR for non-elderly patients (eg, under 65 years old) at low risk for cardiac surgery. The suggested age threshold of 75 years old is based on judgement of limited available literature and should be used as a guide rather than a determinant threshold. The conditional nature of this recommendation means that the majority of patients in this situation would want a transfemoral TAVI over SAVR, but some may prefer SAVR. For clinicians, this means that they must be familiar with the evidence supporting this recommendation and help each patient to arrive at a management decision integrating a multidisciplinary team discussion (Heart Team), patient's values and preferences through shared decision-making, and available resources. Policymakers will require substantial debate and the involvement of various stakeholders to implement this recommendation.

### Impact of selected comorbidities on the presentation and management of aortic stenosis [^115171AM]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent native valve disease worldwide, affecting approximately 3.4% of elderly individuals in Europe and the USA. Patients with severe AS who do not undergo timely aortic valve replacement (AVR) face an extremely poor prognosis; this is particularly true following symptom onset, at which point average survival is just 2–3 years. Consequently, rapid, effective management is paramount.

Current European guidelines recommend that AVR be performed in patients with AS that are symptomatic, experience symptoms/hypotension during exercise testing, and/or that have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50%. However, despite the ever-growing availability of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) as a minimally invasive alternative to surgical AVR (SAVR), studies suggest that up to 40% of patients with severe AS still do not receive either of these life-saving interventions. The reason for this appears to be multifactorial, though a high comorbidity burden has been suggested as a key driver. Furthermore, certain comorbidities may have clinical presentations resembling those of AS. To the best of our knowledge, no formal investigations into such effects have been carried out to date.

The aim of this analysis therefore was to assess the impact of comorbidities on disease presentation and management decisions in patients with severe AS.

Shared decision-making and Heart Valve Team — the management of patients with severe AS considered for TAVR is 'best achieved by a multidisciplinary, collaborative Heart Valve Team' including cardiologists with expertise in valvular heart disease, structural interventional cardiologists, imaging specialists, cardiovascular surgeons, cardiovascular anesthesiologists, and cardiovascular nursing professionals. Patient management 'relies on a shared decision-making approach' integrating patient preferences and values; specific tasks are to review the patient's condition and valve severity, determine which interventions are indicated, technically feasible, and reasonable, and discuss benefits and risks with the patient and family. The Heart Valve Team 'should emphasize that the purpose of valvular intervention is to improve symptoms and/or prolong survival, while minimizing adverse outcomes associated with the intervention'. Initial assessment includes evaluation of AS symptoms, disease severity and comorbidities, and 'Echocardiographic measures of AS severity should be reviewed, disease severity confirmed, and additional imaging performed as indicated'.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) preprocedural imaging — initial assessment and staging of aortic stenosis severity is best performed by guideline-based transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and multimodality imaging is needed for preprocedural planning. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is a core element of the standard imaging pathway for the preprocedural planning of TAVR. In patients being evaluated for TAVR, MDCT systems with at least 64 detectors and a spatial resolution of 0.5 mm to 0.6 mm are recommended. Typical protocols involve 2 main components: an electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated acquisition of the aortic annulus and aortic root, followed by a full chest, abdomen, and pelvic acquisition of the arterial vasculature, which does not typically require ECG gating. Because a standard bolus of 80 to 120 mL of low-osmolar iodinated contrast is necessary, the benefits and risks of iodinated contrast need to be carefully weighed, particularly in elderly patients, and in patients in whom iodinated contrast is absolutely contraindicated, alternative imaging includes magnetic resonance imaging for vascular access and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for valve sizing.

Careful individual evaluation

The choice of the intervention mode — SAVR or TAVR — for patients at increased surgical risk should take into account the cardiac and extracardiac characteristics of the patient as well as some important anatomical and technical aspects. Figure 2 provides aspects that should be considered for this individual decision. Importantly, current guidelines favour the use of transfemoral TAVR over surgery in elderly patients at increased surgical risk. In the two large studies on intermediate risk, the mean ages were 82 and 80 years and mean STS scores were 5.8% and 4.5%. Hence, the study results are valid for comparable patient groups.

Frailty

Besides specific organ comorbidities, there is growing interest in the assessment of frailty, an overall marker of impairment of functional, cognitive and nutritional status. Frailty is associated with increased morbidity and mortality after surgery or TAVR. The assessment of frailty should not rely on a subjective approach, but rather on a combination of different objective estimates. Several tools are available for assessing frailty.

Challenging subgroups

There are a number of challenging subgroups with aortic valve disease that need special attention when considering TAVR. Data remain sparse for some specific patient cohorts excluded from key RCTs: low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis; patients with significant coronary artery or concomitant valve disease; aortic stenosis with severe left ventricular outflow tract calcification or previous valve surgery. Moreover, although recent registry data have shown good outcomes for TAVR treatment of bicuspid valves, unique anatomic challenges remain related to differences in annular size, patterns of leaflet calcification and orifice shape when compared with tri-leaflet valves. Different device types may also have different results in these complex patient subgroups.

Younger patients

Data on TAVR are still very limited for patients below 75 years of age and for surgical low-risk patients, in whom SAVR remains the reference method. It has to be emphasised that younger patients differ with regard to anatomy (more bicuspid valves), which affects the results of TAVR (bicuspid valves were also in general excluded in clinical trials), and that long-term durability data for TAVR prosthetic valves are still lacking.

### Early aortic valve replacement of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111KTNfS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the one of the most common forms of valvular heart disease, affecting > 3% of adults in developed countries. Between one‐third and one‐half of patients with severe AS are asymptomatic at diagnosis. Previous perspective only supports the relationship between AS symptom onset and sharply decreased survival in untreated disease. However, more recent data have emerged to demonstrate that asymptomatic severe AS may lead to the progression to both symptoms and adverse outcomes if left untreated.

According to the 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline for managing valvular heart disease, aortic valve intervention is generally recommended for patients with severe AS presenting with symptoms or signs of ventricular decompensation. For asymptomatic AS, guidelines based on expert opinion and nonrandomized data recommend watchful waiting, with aortic valve intervention deferred until symptom onset or a left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%. Nevertheless, the appropriate timing of intervention for these patients remains controversial, and any decision requires careful assessment.

Several meta‐analyses have demonstrated the benefits of early intervention in patients with asymptomatic severe AS. However, the majority of included studies were observational or enrolled small numbers of relatively young and low‐risk patients. The primary aim of this study is to comprehensively review the available evidence from prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the optimal management strategy for patients with asymptomatic severe AS.

Exercise testing in severe aortic stenosis (AS) — provoked symptoms and risk stratification: Exercise testing may clarify symptom status; when symptoms are provoked, the patient is considered symptomatic and meets a COR 1 recommendation for AVR. Among patients without overt symptoms who show either a fall of ≥ 10 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure from baseline to peak exercise or a significant decrease in exercise tolerance, the rate of symptom onset within 1 to 2 years is high (about 60% to 80%); decisions about elective AVR in these patients include surgical risk, patient preferences, and clinical factors such as age and comorbid conditions.

### Aortic stenosis: diagnosis and treatment [^111QetAu]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis affects 3% of persons older than 65 years. Although survival in asymptomatic patients is comparable to that in age- and sex-matched control patients, it decreases rapidly after symptoms appear. During the asymptomatic latent period, left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial augmentation of preload compensate for the increase in afterload caused by aortic stenosis. As the disease worsens, these compensatory mechanisms become inadequate, leading to symptoms of heart failure, angina, or syncope. Aortic valve replacement is recommended for most symptomatic patients with evidence of significant aortic stenosis on echocardiography. Watchful waiting is recommended for most asymptomatic patients. However, select patients may also benefit from aortic valve replacement before the onset of symptoms. Surgical valve replacement is the standard of care for patients at low to moderate surgical risk. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement may be considered in patients at high or prohibitive surgical risk. Patients should be educated about the importance of promptly reporting symptoms to their physicians. In asymptomatic patients, serial Doppler echocardiography is recommended every six to 12 months for severe aortic stenosis, every one to two years for moderate disease, and every three to five years for mild disease. Cardiology referral is recommended for all patients with symptomatic moderate and severe aortic stenosis, those with severe aortic stenosis without apparent symptoms, and those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Medical management of concurrent hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease will lead to optimal outcomes.

### Management of patients with severe aortic stenosis in the TAVI-era: how recent recommendations are translated into clinical practice [^114FYaNr]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Approximately 3.4% of adults aged > 75 years suffer from aortic stenosis (AS). Guideline indications for aortic valve replacement (AVR) distinguish between patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic severe AS. The present analysis aims to assess contemporary practice in the treatment of severe AS across Europe and identify characteristics associated with treatment decisions, namely denial of AVR in symptomatic patients and assignment of asymptomatic patients to AVR.

Methods

Participants of the prospective, multinational IMPULSE database of patients with severe AS were grouped according to AS symptoms, and stratified into subgroups based on assignment to/denial of AVR.

Results

Of 1608 symptomatic patients, 23.8% did not undergo AVR and underwent medical treatment. Denial was independently associated with multiple factors, including severe frailty (p = 0.024); mitral (p = 0.002) or tricuspid (p = 0.004) regurgitation grade III/IV, and the presence of renal impairment (p = 0.017). Of 392 asymptomatic patients, 86.5% had no prespecified indication for AVR. Regardless, 36.3% were assigned to valve replacement. Those with an indexed aortic valve area (AVA; p = 0.045) or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; p < 0.001) below the study median; or with a left ventricular end systolic diameter above the study median (p = 0.007) were more likely to be assigned to AVR.

Conclusions

There may be considerable discrepancies between guideline-based recommendations and clinical practice decision-making in the treatment of AS. It appears that guidelines may not fully capture the complete clinical spectrum of patients with AS. Thus, there is a need to find ways to increase their acceptance and the rate of adoption.

### Aortic stenosis [^115Epmo6]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

In developed countries, aortic stenosis is the most prevalent of all valvular heart diseases. A manifestation of ageing, the disorder is becoming more frequent as the average age of the population increases. Symptomatic severe disease is universally fatal if left untreated yet is consistent with a typical lifespan when mechanical relief of the stenosis is provided in a timely fashion. Management of mild disease, severe asymptomatic disease, and far advanced disease, and the effect of new percutaneous treatments, provide both controversy and exciting promise to care of patients with aortic stenosis. We discuss these issues in this Review.

### Management strategies and future challenges for aortic valve disease [^115qBjv9]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

The management of aortic valve disease has been improved by accurate diagnosis and assessment of severity by echocardiography and advanced imaging techniques, efforts to elicit symptoms or objective markers of disease severity and progression, and consideration of optimum timing of aortic valve replacement, even in elderly patients. Prevalence of calcific aortic stenosis is growing in ageing populations. Conventional surgery remains the most appropriate option for most patients who require aortic valve replacement, but the transcatheter approach is established for high-risk patients or poor candidates for surgery. The rapid growth of transcatheter aortic valve replacement has been fuelled by improved technology, evidence-based clinical research, and setting up of multidisciplinary heart teams. Aortic regurgitation can be difficult to diagnose and quantify. Left ventricular dysfunction often precedes symptoms, needing active surveillance by echocardiography to determine the optimum time for aortic valve replacement. Development of transcatheter approaches for aortic regurgitation is challenging, owing to the absence of valvular calcification and distortion of aortic root anatomy in many patients.

### Treating aortic stenosis in young Patients [^114TvjDg]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, despite consensus guidelines, TAVR is already being utilized in patients < 65 years of age. Nationally, we are experiencing a steady annual increase in TAVR volumes in patients < 65 years of age. Longer term, prospective randomized data are needed to understand the safety and efficacy of TAVR compared to SAVR in these patients. Additionally, trial follow-up should ideally be extended to understand the best type of subsequent aortic replacement after bioprosthetic valve failure. Understanding the longevity and durability of each of these permutations such as TAVR versus SAVR, TAVR in SAVR, TAVR in TAVR, or surgical excision of TAVR with bioprosthetic replacement would become a powerful tool in counseling patients to better inform strategy for initial treatment of aortic stenosis in young patients.

### Management of aortic stenosis and chronic heart failure: a clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association (HFA) and the European association of percutaneous cardiovascular interventions (EAPCI) of the ESC [^114ewqWJ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is common and can cause heart failure (HF) or contribute to the progression of pre-existing HF. The management of patients with concomitant AS and HF poses specific clinical challenges. Optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy for HF may be difficult in patients with AS, especially in case of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the evidence-based treatment of choice for patients with severe AS and HF. However, advanced cardiac damage, concomitant conditions that can cause HF in addition to AS, as well as some procedure-related factors, may contribute to persistence or worsening of HF after AVR. A multidisciplinary management involving an HF specialist is crucial in this setting and should include a dedicated pre-procedural HF and AS assessment, as well as a careful post-procedural follow-up, including monitoring of HF status. The aim of this clinical consensus statement is to summarize current knowledge on AS and HF, with a focus on pre-procedural and post-procedural management of patients with HF undergoing AVR.

Aortic stenosis (AS) — age-based selection of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) versus transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) when a bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR) is appropriate: For symptomatic and asymptomatic severe AS with any indication for AVR who are < 65 years or have life expectancy > 20 years, SAVR is recommended (1 A). For symptomatic severe AS at 65 to 80 years without an anatomic contraindication to transfemoral TAVI, either SAVR or transfemoral TAVI is recommended after shared decision-making (1 A). For symptomatic severe AS who are > 80 years or younger patients with life expectancy < 10 years and no anatomic contraindication to transfemoral TAVI, transfemoral TAVI is recommended in preference to SAVR (1 A).

### Management of asymptomatic severe Aortic stenosis: evolving concepts in timing of valve replacement [^115vTPHi]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

New insights into the pathophysiology and natural history of patients with aortic stenosis, coupled with advances in diagnostic imaging and the dramatic evolution of transcatheter aortic valve replacement, are fueling intense interest in the management of asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis. An intervention that is less invasive than surgery could conceivably justify pre-emptive transcatheter aortic valve replacement in subsets of patients, rather than waiting for the emergence of early symptoms to trigger valve intervention. Clinical experience has shown that symptoms can be challenging to ascertain in many sedentary, deconditioned, and/or elderly patients. Evolving data based on imaging and biomarker evidence of adverse ventricular remodeling, hypertrophy, inflammation, or fibrosis may radically transform existing clinical decision paradigms. Clinical trials currently enrolling asymptomatic patients have the potential to change practice patterns and lower the threshold for intervention.

### Evaluation and management of aortic stenosis for the emergency clinician: an evidence-based review of the literature [^115uX9Jj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aortic stenosis is a common condition among older adults that can be associated with dangerous outcomes, due to both the disease itself and its influence on other conditions.

Objective

This review provides an evidence-based summary of the current emergency department (ED) evaluation and management of aortic stenosis.

Discussion

Aortic stenosis refers to significant narrowing of the aortic valve and can be caused by calcific disease, congenital causes, or rheumatic valvular disease. Symptoms of advanced disease include angina, dyspnea, and syncope. Patients with these symptoms have a much higher mortality rate than asymptomatic patients. Initial evaluation should include an electrocardiogram, complete blood count, basic metabolic profile, coagulation studies, troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, type and screen, and a chest radiograph. Transthoracic echocardiogram is the test of choice, but point-of-care ultrasound has been found to have good accuracy when a formal echocardiogram is not feasible. Initial management should begin with restoring preload and ensuring a normal heart rate, as both bradycardia and tachycardia can lead to clinical decompensation. For patients with high blood pressure and heart failure symptoms, nitrate agents may be reasonable, but hypotension should be avoided. Dobutamine can increase inotropy. For hypotensive patients, vasopressors should be used at the lowest effective dose. The treatment of choice is valve replacement, but extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and percutaneous balloon dilatation of the aortic valve have been described as temporizing measures.

Conclusion

Aortic stenosis is an important condition that can lead to dangerous outcomes and requires prompt recognition and disease-specific management in the ED.

### Management of patients with severe aortic stenosis in the TAVI-era: how recent recommendations are translated into clinical practice [^113CSX1m]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The present results illustrate that almost one-quarter of patients with symptomatic severe AS with guideline indications for AVR did not undergo valve replacement, despite the poor prognosis associated with a lack of intervention. In contrast, over one-third of asymptomatic patients were assigned to AVR, with very few specific characteristics associated with this choice. We conclude that there may be a considerable discrepancy between guideline-based recommendations and clinical practice decision-making in the treatment of AS. It appears as if guidelines may not fully capture the clinical spectrum of AS presentation and the individual patient need for an intervention or that unrequired AVRs may be being performed.

### Exercise testing in asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis [^111Ny4W1]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

The management and the clinical decision making in asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis are challenging. An "aggressive" management, including early aortic valve replacement, is debated in these patients. However, the optimal timing for surgery remains controversial due to the lack of prospective data on the determinants of aortic stenosis progression, multicenter studies on risk stratification, and randomized studies on patient management. Exercise stress testing with or without imaging is strictly contraindicated in symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis. Exercise stress test is now recommended by current guidelines in asymptomatic patients and may provide incremental prognostic value. Indeed, the development of symptoms during exercise or an abnormal blood pressure response are associated with poor outcome and should be considered as an indication for surgery, as suggested by the most recently updated European Society of Cardiology 2012 guidelines. Exercise stress echocardiography may also improve the risk stratification and identify asymptomatic patients at higher risk of a cardiac event. When the test is combined with imaging, echocardiography during exercise should be recommended rather than post-exercise echocardiography. During exercise, an increase > 18 to 20 mm Hg in mean pressure gradient, absence of improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (i.e., absence of contractile reserve), and/or a systolic pulmonary arterial pressure > 60 mm Hg (i.e., exercise pulmonary hypertension) are suggestive signs of advanced stages of the disease and impaired prognosis. Hence, exercise stress test may identify resting asymptomatic patients who develop exercise abnormalities and in whom surgery is recommended according to current guidelines. Exercise stress echocardiography may further unmask a subset of asymptomatic patients (i.e., without exercise stress test abnormalities) who are at high risk of reduced cardiac event free survival. In these patients, early surgery could be beneficial, whereas regular follow-up seems more appropriate in patients without echocardiographic abnormalities during exercise.

### Normal-flow low-gradient aortic Stenosis: comparing the U.S. and European guidelines [^116ohj4y]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with normal-flow low-gradient (NFLG) severe aortic stenosis present both diagnostic and management challenges, with debate about the whether this represents true severe stenosis and the need for valve replacement. Studies exploring the natural history without intervention have shown similar outcomes of patients with NFLG severe aortic stenosis to those with moderate aortic stenosis and better outcomes after valve replacement than those with low-flow low-gradient severe aortic stenosis. Most studies (all observational) have shown that aortic valve replacement was associated with a survival benefit vs surveillance. Based on available data, the European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery guidelines and European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging/American Society of Echocardiography suggest that these patients are more likely to have moderate aortic stenosis. This clinical entity is not mentioned in the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines. Here we review the definition of NFLG severe aortic stenosis, potential diagnostic algorithms and points of error, the data supporting different management strategies, and the differing guidelines and outline the unanswered questions in the diagnosis and management of these challenging patients.

Aortic stenosis — anatomic constraints, surgical risk, and bridge strategies: For patients with an indication for AVR in whom a bioprosthesis is preferred but anatomy is not suitable for transfemoral TAVI, SAVR is recommended (1 A). For symptomatic severe AS of any age with high or prohibitive surgical risk, TAVI is recommended if predicted post-TAVI survival is > 12 months with acceptable quality of life (1 A). For symptomatic severe AS with predicted post-TAVI or post-SAVR survival < 12 months or minimal expected quality-of-life improvement, palliative care is recommended after shared decision-making (1 C-EO). In critically ill severe AS, percutaneous aortic balloon dilation may be considered as a bridge to SAVR or TAVI (2b C-EO).

### Misconceptions and facts about aortic stenosis [^112muQtx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease leading to intervention, and it is typically a disease of the elderly. Recent clinical advances have expanded the role of transcatheter aortic valve intervention in patients with severe aortic stenosis, making aortic valve intervention feasible and effective even in patients at intermediate, high, and prohibitive surgical risk. With the rapid advances in treatment, proper diagnosis becomes crucial for a wide range of patients with aortic stenosis: from "concordant" high-gradient aortic stenosis to "discordant" low-gradient aortic stenosis. The latter group commonly presents a clinical challenge requiring thoughtful and comprehensive evaluation to determine eligibility for aortic valve intervention. Providers at all levels should be familiar with basic diagnostic caveats and misconceptions when evaluating patients with possible aortic stenosis.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent degenerative valvular heart disease in Western countries and its prevalence increases in parallel with the ageing process of the population. Heart failure (HF), defined by the presence of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, may be present in up to a quarter of patients with severe AS, posing diagnostic and management challenges. The present article reviews the prevalence of HF in severe AS patients, discusses the diagnostic challenges and the advances in multimodality imaging to identify the patients that may benefit from surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and summarizes the current evidence on management for this group of patients.

### Moderate aortic valve stenosis is associated with increased mortality rate and lifetime loss: systematic review and meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event data of 409 680 patients [^112HFeBA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a prevalent valvular heart disease, imposing a substantial burden on global public health. AS frequently coexists with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Three decades ago, it was recognized that the pivotal aspect in managing patients with AS lies in the timely decision to refer for intervention.

Contemporary guidelines currently advocate for aortic valve replacement (AVR) in those with severe symptomatic AS and, by extension, in those who are asymptomatic but experience reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 55% by European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery guidelines, class of recommendation IIa; and LVEF < 50% by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, class of recommendation I). The latter is owed to the adverse impact of elevated afterload on the already diseased left ventricle. On the contrary, in those with moderate AS, both guidelines advocate for a "watchful waiting approach" with frequent surveillance echocardiograms (yearly by European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery guidelines, and every 1–2 years by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines) to detect any disease progression. The rationale behind the contrasting recommendations concerning the timing of intervention in AS remains a matter of discussion. Recent large‐scale observational studies found the prognosis of patients with moderate AS may be more unfavorable than previously thought, particularly when concurrent systolic dysfunction is present. Moderate AS has been associated with an ≈2‐fold increased risk of all‐cause death, which increases to ≈3‐fold among those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Consequently, specific factors such as systolic dysfunction or coronary artery disease contribute to adverse outcomes, while the mortality risk solely attributable to isolated moderate AS remains incompletely characterized.

### Comprehensive update on the new indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the latest 2017 European guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease [^1165dFwB]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Since the 2012 ESC/EACTS guidelines on the management of valvular heart disease, a large amount of new data have accumulated, in particular in the field of TAVR. Indications for TAVR have expanded as there is new evidence for lower-risk populations. This required an update of the recommendations in the new 2017 guidelines. Broadly speaking, patients at higher risk for surgery should receive TAVR — especially if they can be treated by transfemoral approach — and those at low risk — in particular younger patients — should undergo SAVR. The choice of SAVR or TAVR should not simply be based on a risk score or age. The Heart Team must weigh the risks and benefits of both procedures, particularly in the intermediate risk situation. Discussion should include age, comorbidities, anatomy and outcomes of the centre for surgery and transcatheter intervention.

### Patient-and process-related contributors to the underuse of aortic valve replacement and subsequent mortality in ambulatory patients with severe aortic stenosis [^116DJhMH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Calcific aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common cause of valvular heart disease in the Western world and is the most frequent indication for aortic valve replacement (AVR). Current clinical practice guidelines recommend deferring AVR until symptom onset or overt left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Left untreated, 50% of patients with severe AS die within 1 to 2 years of symptom onset. Although potentially lifesaving, past studies have estimated that up to a third of patients with an indication for AVR do not undergo treatment; ultimately, these patients have a higher rate of hospitalization, are intensive users of health care resources, and cost the US Medicare program an estimated ≈$1.3 billion per year, all despite their limited long‐term survival.

Until recently, data on AVR use in patients with severe AS were primarily driven by surgical AVR (SAVR), because this was the sole treatment option for AS. With the advent of transcatheter AVR (TAVR), patients normally ineligible for SAVR because of high mortality risk, advanced age, or comorbid conditions can be eligible for a less‐invasive treatment option for AS with lower procedural morbidity and mortality. Because of this, TAVR was anticipated to improve adherence to guideline‐based use of AVR in patients with symptomatic severe AS. Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that a substantial number of patients with symptomatic severe AS still do not undergo AVR.

The evaluation and management of patients with severe AS has become increasingly complex and heavily relies on provider referral upon detection of AS. The presence of discordant imaging measures of AS severity has been previously documented and is estimated to occur in up to 40% of patients with AS. Moreover, the rapid evolution of TAVR devices and procedural techniques mandates an intimate knowledge of the field to inform the difficult risk–benefit analysis that surrounds treatment decisions. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology practice guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease recommend that providers refer patients with severe valvular heart disease to a multidisciplinary heart valve team for further evaluation when intervention is being considered. However, recent data suggest that medically managed patients with an indication for AVR are not consistently referred to a multidisciplinary heart valve team or valve specialist for evaluation. Thus, factors beyond a patient's biology and more inherent to the patient referral process may affect AVR usage rates and, in turn, postprocedural outcomes in patients with severe AS.

Aortic stenosis — supportive evidence for intervention and natural history: In symptomatic patients with severe high-gradient AS (Stage D1), ample evidence demonstrates the beneficial effects of AVR on survival, symptoms, and LV systolic function, and surgical series demonstrate improved symptoms and exercise tolerance after AVR. In asymptomatic patients with severe AS and normal LV systolic function, survival is similar to age-matched controls, with a low risk of sudden death (< 1% per year) when prospectively followed and when symptoms are promptly reported; however, in patients with a low LVEF and severe AS, survival is better after AVR than with medical therapy, and LV function improves after AVR when depressed LVEF is due to excessive afterload.

### Short-term outcomes after surgical aortic valve replacement in elderly patients-results of a comparative cohort study [^1146phCy]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of aortic stenosis (AS) increases with age and is estimated to be around 10–13% in people over the age of 80 years. This is expected to increase further as the population continues to age. Elderly patients with AS pose a therapeutic challenge as they often have complex comorbidity, frailty and rehabilitation issues. Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) can offer a considerable improvement in survival and quality of life but comes with significant potential risks, particularly in this elderly population. The introduction of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), a less invasive procedure with comparable results to SAVR, has called into question the role of SAVR in elderly patients.

In the UK, TAVI is recommended for patients who are unsuitable for surgery due to high operative risk. This practice is based on current guidelines, usually without consideration of the frailty status of the patient. Indeed, the most recent American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines make a Class 1 A recommendation for transfemoral TAVI in preference to SAVR for patients above the age of 80 years who have severe, symptomatic AS and suitable anatomy.

The aim of this study was to compare 30-day and 1-year survival after SAVR for patients aged 70–79 years versus those aged 80 years and over, as well as to identify the risk factors which impact outcomes after SAVR in this elderly population.

Aortic stenosis — Table 14 provides "A Simplified Framework With Examples of Factors Favoring SAVR, TAVI, or Palliation Instead of Aortic Valve Intervention", outlining examples by column. Factors favoring surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) include concurrent conditions and procedure limits such as "Aortic dilatation‡ Severe primary MR Severe CAD requiring bypass grafting Septal hypertrophy requiring myectomy AF" and "Valve anatomy, annular size, or low coronary ostial height precludes TAVI Vascular access does not allow transfemoral TAVI", with frailty status "Not frail or few frailty measures". Factors favoring transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) include anatomic or prior-treatment considerations such as "Severe calcification of the ascending aorta ("porcelain" aorta)" and "Previous cardiac surgery with at-risk coronary grafts Previous chest irradiation", with frailty "Frailty likely to improve after TAVI". Factors favoring palliation include systemic burden and frailty such as "Moderate to severe involvement of ≥ 2 other organ systems", "Severe frailty unlikely to improve after TAVI", and the risk/benefit threshold "Prohibitive SAVR risk (> 15%) or post-TAVI life expectancy < 1 y". Additional context notes durability evidence: "Long-term (> 20 y) data on outcomes with surgical bioprosthetic valves are available; robust data on transcatheter bioprosthetic valves extend only to 5 y, leading to uncertainty about longer-term outcomes". The table also flags that "‡Dilation of the aortic sinuses or ascending aorta may require concurrent surgical replacement, particularly in younger patients with a BAV".

### Comprehensive update on the new indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the latest 2017 European guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease [^112oqzym]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

The management of patients with low-gradient aortic stenosis is more challenging. In patients with low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis and reduced ejection fraction in whom the depressed ejection fraction is predominantly caused by excessive afterload, LV function usually improves after aortic valve replacement. Intervention is indicated in symptomatic patients with severe low-flow, low-gradient (< 40 mm Hg) aortic stenosis with reduced ejection fraction, and evidence of flow (contractile) reserve excluding pseudosevere aortic stenosis (class I, LoE C). Decision making about intervention should take into account the degree of valve calcification, the extent of coronary artery disease and the feasibility of concomitant or staged revascularisation, as well as the patient's comorbidities. The ability to identify patients with severe aortic stenosis in this subgroup by CT calcium scoring and the availability of TAVR have lowered the threshold to intervene. The new 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines now also state that intervention 'should' — and not only 'may' (2012) — be considered in symptomatic patients with low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis and reduced ejection fraction without flow (contractile) reserve, particularly in those patients in whom CT calcium scoring confirms severe aortic stenosis (class IIa, LoE C).

Patients with low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis and preserved ejection fraction are the most difficult subgroup to decide on intervention or not. Data on their natural history and outcome after surgical or catheter intervention are scarce and remain controversial. In such cases, intervention should only be performed when symptoms are present and if comprehensive evaluation suggests significant valve obstruction. The strongest indication for intervention remains symptoms (either spontaneous or on exercise testing).

Management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis remains controversial. The currently available studies do not provide convincing data to support the general recommendation of early SAVR — the decision to operate on asymptomatic patients requires careful weighing of the risks and benefits. In physically active patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis, exercise testing is recommended for unmasking symptoms and for risk stratification.

As mentioned in the ESC/EACTS guidelines, SAVR is indicated in asymptomatic patients with an impaired LV function < 50% not due to other causes and/or an abnormal exercise test showing symptoms on exercise related to aortic stenosis (class I, LoE C). Moreover, SAVR is indicated in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or surgery on the ascending aorta or another valve (class I, LoE C).

Aortic stenosis — exercise testing guidance states: In asymptomatic patients with severe AS (Stage C1), exercise testing is reasonable to assess physiological changes with exercise and to confirm the absence of symptoms. In symptomatic patients with severe AS (Stage D1, aortic jet velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s or mean pressure gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg), exercise testing should not be performed because of the risk of severe hemodynamic compromise.

Aortic stenosis — Routine follow-up of asymptomatic disease and progression rates: When severe AS is present (aortic velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s), the rate of progression to symptoms is high, with an event-free survival rate of only 30% to 50% at 2 years. With moderate AS (aortic velocity 3.0–3.9 m/s), the average annual rate of progression is an increase in velocity of 0.3 m/s, increase in mean pressure gradient of 7 mm Hg, and decrease in valve area of 0.1 cm2. In patients with aortic sclerosis, defined as focal areas of valve calcification and leaflet thickening with an aortic velocity < 2.0 m/s, progression to severe AS occurs in about 10% of patients within 5 years.

Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) versus transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) selection in severe aortic stenosis (AS) when a bioprosthetic AVR is appropriate is specified as follows: For symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with severe AS and any indication for AVR who are < 65 years of age or have a life expectancy > 20 years, SAVR is recommended. For symptomatic patients with severe AS who are 65 to 80 years of age and have no anatomic contraindication to transfemoral TAVI, either SAVR or transfemoral TAVI is recommended after shared decision-making about the balance between expected patient longevity and valve durability. For symptomatic patients with severe AS who are > 80 years of age or for younger patients with a life expectancy < 10 years and no anatomic contraindication to transfemoral TAVI, transfemoral TAVI is recommended in preference to SAVR. In asymptomatic patients with severe AS and an LVEF < 50% who are ≥ 80 years of age and have no anatomic contraindication to transfemoral TAVI, the decision between TAVI and SAVR should follow the same recommendations as for symptomatic patients in Recommendations 1, 2, and 3 above. For asymptomatic patients with severe AS and an abnormal exercise test, very severe AS, rapid progression, or an elevated BNP, SAVR is recommended in preference to TAVI. For symptomatic patients of any age with severe AS and a high or prohibitive surgical risk, TAVI is recommended if predicted post-TAVI survival is ≥ 12 months with an acceptable quality of life. For symptomatic patients with severe AS for whom predicted post-TAVI or post-SAVR survival is < 12 months or for whom minimal improvement in quality of life is expected, palliative care is recommended after shared decision-making, including discussion of patient preferences and values. In critically ill patients with severe AS, percutaneous aortic balloon dilation may be considered as a bridge to SAVR or TAVI.

### Moderate aortic stenosis and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: can imaging guide Us to therapy? [^113wB8fV]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical management of patients with only moderate aortic stenosis (AS) but symptoms of heart failure with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) is challenging. Current guidelines recommend clinical surveillance with multimodality imaging; aortic valve replacement (AVR) is deferred until the stenosis becomes severe. Given the known benefits of afterload reduction in management of patients with HFrEF, it has been hypothesized that AVR may be beneficial in patients with only moderate AS who present with HFrEF. In this article, we first review the current approach for management of patients with moderate AS and HFrEF based on close clinical and imaging surveillance with AVR delayed until AS is severe. We then discuss the case for transcatheter AVR (TAVR) earlier in the disease course, when AS is moderate, based on stress echocardiographic data. We conclude with a detailed summary of the TAVR UNLOAD (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement to UNload the Left Ventricle in Patients With ADvanced Heart Failure) trial, in which patients with moderate AS and HFrEF are randomized to guideline-directed heart failure therapy alone versus guideline-directed heart failure therapy plus TAVR.

ACC/AHA 2020 aortic stenosis with reduced ejection fraction: An LVEF < 50% in a patient with severe AS is a COR 1 indication for AVR, so the choice of TAVI versus SAVR in these patients is based on the same considerations as in patients with symptoms.

### Management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis [^1154amLC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) benefit from aortic valve replacement (AVR). Management of severe AS in the absence of symptoms is, however, controversial and often challenging. Unselected premature AVR carries the risks of cardiac surgery; delayed AVR due to unrecognized symptoms can result in a dismal outcome. Echocardiography is the standard tool to evaluate and follow patients with AS. Nevertheless, most of the current echocardiographic parameters have limitations in predicting symptom onset and clinical outcome. The same applies to clinical parameters, exercise stress testing, and other imaging modalities used in AS evaluation and serial follow-up. Predictors of outcome could, however, help to identify asymptomatic patients who would benefit from expedited AVR with the goal to reduce mortality. This review will discuss the most relevant clinical studies and guidelines on management of asymptomatic severe AS, with an emphasis on providing concise information for identifying patients at high risk.

Major cardiovascular comorbidity — coronary angiography is indicated in all patients because coronary artery disease is common in patients undergoing TAVR (40% to 75%); concurrent coronary revascularization may be needed, particularly if multivessel or left main coronary disease is present, although it is unclear if 30-day mortality is influenced by revascularization status; until more definitive randomized data are available, the Heart Valve Team should decide whether to revascularize before TAVR on a case-by-case basis; in a post hoc analysis of the PARTNER 2A trial, revascularization with PCI or coronary artery bypass graft in addition to TAVR did not increase the risk of death or disabling stroke at 2-year follow-up compared with TAVR or SAVR alone; other conditions that might increase procedural risk or limit benefit include LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, severe mitral regurgitation or mitral stenosis, and severe pulmonary hypertension, and low flow — defined as stroke volume index less than 35 mL/m2 — may also be associated with poor outcomes post-TAVR regardless of EF.
