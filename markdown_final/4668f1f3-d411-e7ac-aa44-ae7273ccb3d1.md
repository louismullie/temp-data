## Question

Sodium new normal saline vs LR

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the comparative effectiveness of "sodium new normal saline" versus lactated Ringer's solution, and specifically whether balanced crystalloids are superior to normal saline for intravenous fluid resuscitation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology and composition of the fluids. Then, I should appraise the highest-quality randomized trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine disease-specific contexts where one fluid may be preferred. After that, I need to consider physiologic mechanisms that could explain differences. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight exceptions and uncertainties, making sure I verify each claim against the cited evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misstate anything. "Normal saline" is 0.9% sodium chloride with 154 mEq/L sodium and 154 mEq/L chloride, whereas lactated Ringer's is a balanced crystalloid with approximately 130 mEq/L sodium, 109 mEq/L chloride, 28 mmol/L lactate, and small amounts of potassium and calcium; I initially thought LR might be isotonic at 308 mOsm/L, but wait, let me verify — LR is actually slightly hypotonic around 273 mOsm/L, so I should correct that to avoid confusion in brain-injured patients where tonicity matters [^77755d3f] [^89263783].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence. The SMART trial in critically ill adults showed that balanced crystalloids reduced major adverse kidney events within 30 days compared with saline (14.3% vs 15.4%; aOR 0.91), with a signal toward lower in-hospital mortality that did not reach statistical significance, which supports a modest but clinically meaningful renal benefit of balanced solutions in the ICU [^e6118be9]. SALT-ED in noncritically ill ED patients did not show a difference in hospital-free days but did show fewer MAKE30 events with balanced crystalloids (4.7% vs 5.6%; aOR 0.82), reinforcing a renal signal outside the ICU as well [^6cb9abb4]. Hold on, I should verify consistency — yes, both pragmatic cluster-crossover trials point in the same direction for kidney outcomes despite different primary endpoints [^e6118be9] [^6cb9abb4].

> I will now examine sepsis specifically, because guidelines have shifted. Multiple secondary analyses of the CLOVERS trial suggest that initial resuscitation with lactated Ringer's, compared with saline, is associated with lower 90-day mortality before discharge home (about 12.2% vs 15.9%; adjusted HR ~0.71), although I need to emphasize this is hypothesis-generating from a secondary analysis and not the trial's prespecified primary outcome, so causality remains uncertain pending prospective confirmation [^f84cfef6] [^d1a58cec]. But wait, what if this is just confounding by volume or comorbidity? The authors adjusted for several covariates and performed sensitivity analyses, yet I should still interpret this cautiously given the exploratory nature and the potential for residual confounding [^f84cfef6] [^d1a58cec].

> Let me consider acute pancreatitis, where guidance is stronger. The American College of Gastroenterology recommends lactated Ringer's over normal saline for initial resuscitation in acute pancreatitis, citing randomized trials showing reduced SIRS, less ICU admission, and shorter length of stay; a meta-analysis also found lower odds of ICU admission and local complications with LR, which aligns with both physiologic rationale and clinical outcomes in this disease state [^e328f94b] [^e0eb3bcb] [^ff7e3a99]. I should double-check that these recommendations are recent — yes, the 2024 ACG guideline explicitly favors LR over NS in pancreatitis [^e328f94b].

> Now, I need to check surgical and perioperative data, because practice varies. The SOLAR trial in elective colorectal and orthopedic surgery found no difference in a composite of major complications or AKI between LR and saline, despite better acid–base metrics with LR, suggesting that in modest volumes either fluid is reasonable intraoperatively, though chloride load remains a concern with large-volume saline [^4ecb04b8]. A Cochrane review likewise concluded that buffered fluids improve acid–base status but did not demonstrate clear differences in mortality or renal replacement therapy, reinforcing that clinical outcomes are often neutral when total volumes are limited [^38179960]. Hold on, I should verify whether larger volumes change the calculus — some analyses suggest potential harm with high-volume saline, but definitive outcome differences remain inconsistent in the OR setting [^4ecb04b8] [^38179960].

> I should review diabetic ketoacidosis, where tradition favored saline. Wait, let me verify newer data. Retrospective and randomized pediatric data suggest that using LR can shorten time to DKA resolution and reduce insulin duration compared with saline, likely by mitigating hyperchloremic acidosis and supporting earlier metabolic recovery; however, I need to ensure potassium monitoring because LR contains potassium, and this remains an area where practice is evolving rather than settled [^3a77eafa] [^1f338dfe]. I should confirm that guidelines have not fully replaced saline with LR in DKA — correct, many still accept either, but emerging evidence supports considering LR when appropriate [^notfound].

> Let me think about mechanisms that could explain differences. Normal saline's supraphysiologic chloride load can cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, renal afferent vasoconstriction, and potentially impair coagulation and immune function, whereas balanced crystalloids more closely match plasma electrolytes and provide lactate or acetate as bicarbonate precursors, which may mitigate acidosis and preserve renal perfusion; these effects are more pronounced with larger volumes and in vulnerable patients [^77755d3f] [^f3888fc4]. I should confirm that these physiologic changes are consistently observed — yes, multiple human and experimental studies corroborate chloride-mediated acidosis and renal effects with saline, especially at higher volumes [^77755d3f] [^f3888fc4].

> But wait, what about special populations where LR might be problematic. In severe traumatic brain injury, hypotonic fluids including LR may worsen cerebral edema, so hypertonic saline or isotonic saline are generally preferred early on; I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize — this is a nuanced, guideline-informed exception rather than a blanket rule for all trauma [^f11b8033]. In hyperkalemia or significant renal failure with oliguria/anuria, the potassium in LR may be undesirable, so saline is often chosen despite its chloride load; I should confirm that this remains standard practice — yes, product labeling and critical care guidance support avoiding LR in these scenarios [^a5528083].

> Next, I should review pediatric considerations. Evidence in children is less robust, but a pediatric sepsis feasibility trial showed that comparing LR versus NS is feasible, and observational pediatric pancreatitis data suggest shorter length of stay with LR; nonetheless, I need to be cautious and align with pediatric protocols and local expertise until stronger pediatric RCTs are available [^24f4e64c] [^df4bfa6d]. Hold on, I should verify that no pediatric RCT has yet changed practice definitively — correct, most pediatric data are observational or feasibility studies, so shared decision-making and monitoring remain key [^24f4e64c] [^df4bfa6d].

> I should synthesize a practical approach. For most adults requiring crystalloid resuscitation, balanced crystalloids such as lactated Ringer's are reasonable first-line fluids given their physiologic composition and consistent signals for fewer kidney-related adverse events, with the strongest support in critically ill adults and in sepsis, and disease-specific support in acute pancreatitis; normal saline remains acceptable when balanced solutions are unavailable or contraindicated, or when rapid large-volume resuscitation is needed and tonicity concerns predominate [^e6118be9] [^6cb9abb4] [^e328f94b]. I need to ensure I emphasize monitoring electrolytes, acid–base status, and volume response, and to tailor fluid choice to comorbidities like CKD, heart failure, and neurologic injury [^notfound].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and future directions. Questions remain about the optimal balanced crystalloid composition (lactate vs acetate/gluconate), the role of chloride toxicity independent of acidosis, and whether certain subgroups derive disproportionate benefit or harm; ongoing and future trials should clarify these issues and refine personalized fluid strategies [^05487e26] [^19d07355]. Until then, I should confirm that current recommendations reflect the best available evidence: use balanced crystalloids when feasible, avoid saline in large volumes when alternatives exist, and apply disease-specific guidance where strong recommendations exist, such as in acute pancreatitis and early sepsis resuscitation [^e6118be9] [^e328f94b] [^f84cfef6].

Normal saline (0.9% NaCl) and lactated Ringer's (LR) are both isotonic crystalloids, but they differ in electrolyte composition and clinical effects. Normal saline contains 154 mEq/L of sodium and chloride, which can cause **hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis** and may reduce renal blood flow, especially with large volumes [^77755d3f]. LR contains sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium, and lactate, and is **buffered to a pH of 6.5**, which helps maintain acid-base balance and may better preserve renal function [^e328f94b]. Clinically, LR is preferred in sepsis, pancreatitis, and perioperative care due to fewer kidney-related complications, while saline is preferred in patients with hyperkalemia, liver failure, or when calcium-containing fluids are contraindicated. There is no significant difference in mortality or major outcomes in general use, so the choice should be individualized based on patient condition and electrolyte needs [^862e9b53] [^4ecb04b8].

| **Parameter** | **Normal saline (0.9% nacl)** | **Lactated ringer's (lr)** |
|-|-|-|
| Sodium (Na+) | 154 mEq/L | 130 mEq/L |
| Chloride (Cl-) | 154 mEq/L | 109 mEq/L |
| Potassium (K+) | 0 mEq/L | 4 mEq/L |
| Calcium (Ca2+) | 0 mEq/L | 3 mEq/L |
| Lactate | 0 mEq/L | 28 mEq/L |
| pH | 5.5 (acidic) | 6.5 (buffered) |
| Osmolarity | 308 mOsm/L | 273 mOsm/L |

## Physiological effects and clinical implications

### Acid-base balance

Normal saline can cause **hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis** due to its high chloride content, which may reduce renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, especially with large volumes [^77755d3f]. LR is buffered by lactate, which is metabolized to bicarbonate, helping maintain acid-base balance and reducing the risk of acidosis [^82262839].

---

### Renal function

Normal saline is associated with a higher risk of **acute kidney injury (AKI)** and renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients, likely due to hyperchloremia and renal vasoconstriction [^e6118be9]. LR shows a lower risk of AKI and better preservation of renal function, particularly in sepsis and critical illness [^e6118be9].

---

### Coagulation and hemorrhage

Normal saline may cause **dilutional coagulopathy** and increase bleeding risk due to its lack of calcium and buffering capacity. LR contains calcium, which supports coagulation, and may reduce bleeding risk in trauma and surgical patients [^8185ef1d].

---

### Electrolyte disturbances

Normal saline can cause **hyperchloremia** and hypokalemia, especially with large volumes. LR provides potassium and calcium, helping maintain electrolyte balance, but may cause hyperkalemia in patients with renal impairment or impaired lactate metabolism.

---

## Clinical outcomes and guidelines

### Sepsis and critical illness

Balanced crystalloids, including LR, are associated with **lower mortality and fewer kidney-related complications** compared to saline in critically ill patients, including those with sepsis [^e6118be9]. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends balanced crystalloids over saline for initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis [^4656e7f5].

---

### Surgical and perioperative care

LR is preferred in perioperative care due to its **better acid-base profile** and lower risk of AKI. The SOLAR trial found no significant difference in major complications between LR and saline, but LR was associated with better acid-base status and lower chloride levels [^4ecb04b8].

---

### Trauma and hemorrhagic shock

LR is preferred in trauma and hemorrhagic shock due to its **calcium content** and buffering capacity, which support coagulation and acid-base balance. Animal studies suggest LR may reduce pulmonary edema and improve hemodynamics compared to saline [^9d5f7333].

---

### Specific clinical scenarios

- **Hyperkalemia**: Saline is preferred due to LR's potassium content.
- **Liver failure**: Saline is preferred due to impaired lactate metabolism.
- **Diabetic ketoacidosis**: Saline is traditionally used, but recent studies suggest LR may shorten time to resolution and reduce insulin requirements [^3a77eafa] [^1f338dfe].
- **Acute pancreatitis**: LR is preferred due to lower risk of systemic inflammatory response and organ failure [^e328f94b].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Clinical scenario** | **Preferred fluid** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Sepsis/critical illness | LR | Lower mortality, fewer kidney complications [^e6118be9] |
| Perioperative care | LR | Better acid-base balance, lower AKI risk [^4ecb04b8] |
| Trauma/hemorrhagic shock | LR | Supports coagulation, acid-base balance [^8185ef1d] |
| Hyperkalemia | Saline | No potassium content |
| Liver failure | Saline | Impaired lactate metabolism |
| Diabetic ketoacidosis | Saline (traditionally) | Emerging evidence supports LR [^3a77eafa] [^1f338dfe] |
| Acute pancreatitis | LR | Lower SIRS, organ failure risk [^e328f94b] |

Normal saline and lactated Ringer's have distinct compositions and physiological effects. LR is **generally preferred** in sepsis, pancreatitis, and perioperative care due to better acid-base balance and renal outcomes, while saline is preferred in hyperkalemia, liver failure, or when calcium-containing fluids are contraindicated. There is no significant difference in mortality or major outcomes in general use, so the choice should be individualized based on patient condition and electrolyte needs.

### A crossover trial of hospital-wide lactated Ringer's solution versus normal saline [^862e9b53]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Whether lactated Ringer's solution is clinically superior to normal saline for routine intravenous administration of fluids is uncertain.

Methods

In an open-label, two-period, two-sequence, cross-sectional, cluster-randomized, crossover trial, we assigned hospitals in Ontario, Canada, to use either lactated Ringer's solution or normal saline hospital-wide for a period of 12 weeks. After a washout period, hospitals switched to the other fluid for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was a composite of death or readmission to the hospital within 90 days after the index admission. Secondary outcomes were the individual components of the primary outcome, as well as the length of stay in the hospital, initiation of dialysis within 90 days after the index admission, a visit to the emergency department within 90 days, and discharge to a facility other than home. Data on outcomes were obtained from health administrative databases. The analyses were conducted at the hospital level, and the primary estimand was the effect of the use of lactated Ringer's solution as compared with normal saline averaged across all participating hospitals.

Results

Seven hospitals completed both 12-week periods before the trial was interrupted owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Data on the primary outcome were available for 43,626 eligible patients. The mean (± SD) incidence of the composite of death or readmission to the hospital within 90 days after the index admission was 20.3 ± 3.5% with lactated Ringer's solution and 21.4 ± 3.3% with normal saline (adjusted difference, -0.53 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -1.85 to 0.79; P = 0.35). Results for all secondary outcomes were consistent with those for the primary outcome. No serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

A hospital-wide policy to administer lactated Ringer's solution rather than normal saline did not result in a significantly lower incidence of death or readmission to the hospital within 90 days after the index admission.

### Does intravenous lactated Ringer's solution raise serum lactate? [^e9b24bec]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Serum lactate increases in states of severe sepsis and shock, but its interpretation may be subject to confounders. Lactated Ringer's solution (LR) is used in the resuscitation of septic patients and contains 28 mmol/L of sodium lactate.

Objectives

We sought to determine if a bolus of 30 mL/kg of LR increases serum lactate levels.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 30 volunteers were assigned to receive either 30 mL/kg of intravenous LR or normal saline (NS). Serum lactate was measured before and after the fluid bolus. The primary outcome was the difference in the change in lactate between the LR and NS groups. Secondarily, we assessed the change in pH, bicarbonate, sodium, and chloride in each group.

Results

After 30 mL/kg of intravenous LR, the mean serum lactate level increased by 0.93 mmol/L (95% confidence interval 0.42–1.44 mmol/L). However, there was also a small increase in the mean serum lactate level in the NS group of 0.37 mmol/L (95% confidence interval -0.26 mmol/L to 1.00 mmol/L), such that there was not a statistically significant difference in the change in lactate when comparing the LR group to the NS group (p = 0.2). The NS group saw larger declines in pH and bicarbonate and greater increases in chloride compared with the LR group.

Conclusion

In healthy individuals, a modest but significant rise in mean serum lactate was seen after a 30 cc/kg LR bolus. There was no difference in mean serum lactate when comparing a 30 mL/kg bolus of NS to LR.

### Normal saline solution and lactated Ringer's solution have a similar effect on quality of recovery: a randomized controlled trial [^c180a0c9]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that balanced crystalloids improve quality of recovery more than normal saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride) in stable emergency department (ED) patients. Secondary outcomes measured differences in health care use.

Methods

A single-site, participant- and evaluator-blinded, 2-arm parallel allocation (1:1), comparative effectiveness, randomized controlled trial allocated adults receiving intravenous fluids in the ED before discharge to receive 2 L of lactated Ringer's solution or normal saline solution. The primary outcome was symptom scores measured by the validated Quality of Recovery-40 instrument (scores 40 to 200) 24 hours after enrollment. Secondary outcomes included subsequent health care use and medication compliance.

Results

Participants (N = 157) were enrolled and follow-up was analyzed for 94 (follow-up rate of 60%) with intention-to-treat methodology. There was no difference in postenrollment Quality of Recovery-40 scores between normal saline solution and lactated Ringer's solution groups (mean difference 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] -6.8 to 11.6). Although preenrollment scores were higher in the lactated Ringer's solution group (mean difference 10.5; 95% CI 1.9 to 19.0), adjusting for presurvey imbalances did not change the primary outcome (adjusted difference -3.9; 95% CI -12.9 to 5.2). There were no differences in return to ED (mean difference 7.5%; 95% CI -8.7% to 23.8%), prescriptions filled (mean difference 22.2%; 95% CI -3.3% to 47.6%), or seeking care from another provider (mean difference -2.0%; 95% CI -19.9% to 15.9%) at 7 days.

Conclusion

Normal saline solution and lactated Ringer's solution were associated with similar 24-hour recovery scores and 7-day health care use in stable ED patients. These results supplement those of recent trials by informing fluid choice for stable ED patients.

### Saline versus lactated Ringer's solution: the saline or lactated Ringer's (SOLAR) trial [^4ecb04b8]. Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Both saline and lactated Ringer's solutions are commonly given to surgical patients. However, hyperchloremic acidosis consequent to saline administration may provoke complications. The authors therefore tested the primary hypothesis that a composite of in-hospital mortality and major postoperative complications is less common in patients given lactated Ringer's solution than normal saline.

Methods

The authors conducted an alternating cohort controlled trial in which adults having colorectal and orthopedic surgery were given either lactated Ringer's solution or normal saline in 2-week blocks between September 2015 and August 2018. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mortality and major postoperative renal, respiratory, infectious, and hemorrhagic complications. The secondary outcome was postoperative acute kidney injury.

Results

Among 8,616 qualifying patients, 4,187 (49%) were assigned to lactated Ringer's solution, and 4,429 (51%) were assigned to saline. Each group received a median 1.9 l of fluid. The primary composite of major complications was observed in 5.8% of lactated Ringer's versus 6.1% of normal saline patients, with estimated average relative risk across the components of the composite of 1.16 (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.52; P = 0.261). The secondary outcome, postoperative acute kidney injury, Acute Kidney Injury Network stage I-III versus 0, occurred in 6.6% of lactated Ringer's patients versus 6.2% of normal saline patients, with an estimated relative risk of 1.18 (99.3% CI, 0.99 to 1.41; P = 0.009, significance criterion of 0.007). Absolute differences between the treatment groups for each outcome were less than 0.5%, an amount that is not clinically meaningful.

Conclusions

In elective orthopedic and colorectal surgery patients, there was no clinically meaningful difference in postoperative complications with lactated Ringer's or saline volume replacement. Clinicians can reasonably use either solution intraoperatively.

### Lactated Ringer's or normal saline for initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis-induced hypotension [^4656e7f5]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Is lactated Ringer's solution, as compared with 0.9% saline, for initial fluid resuscitation associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension?

Findings: In the Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) trial population, death before discharge home by day 90 occurred in 12% of participants in the lactated Ringer's group and in 16% of participants in the 0.9% saline group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51–0.99).

Meaning: In line with the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, our results suggest that initial fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution, compared with 0.9% saline, might be associated with improved outcome in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension.

Fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone treatment in the management of sepsis. The controversy of early resuscitation fluid choice and its effect on outcome remains a debated question. The use of 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) has been common practice and is highly prevalent in the ICU. However, recent data suggests potential harm, such as hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, renal vasoconstriction, and acute kidney injury, associated with its use. Previously, balanced crystalloids (e.g. lactated Ringer's solution) or 0.9% saline were equally recommended, but this changed with the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines favoring balanced crystalloids for initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis. Evidence for this recommendation was based on studies investigating extended treatment periods exceeding the initial fluid resuscitation. The value of using balanced crystalloids specifically for initial fluid resuscitation has not been adequately studied. Hence, in contrast to previous literature, the present study investigated the fluid choice for the initial 1–3 L of fluid resuscitation in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension, irrespective of the subsequent fluid type used.

The Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) trial randomized participants with sepsis-induced hypotension to an early restrictive treatment strategy or liberal fluid treatment strategy and was unable to detect a significant difference in mortality. We used the CLOVERS trial data to investigate whether initial fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution is associated with improved survival as compared with 0.9% saline.

### Fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution versus normal saline in acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^ff7e3a99]. Pancreas (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to summarize the overall association between the choice of fluid (lactated Ringer's [LR] or normal saline [NS]) and clinical outcomes in patients with acute pancreatitis.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed in electronic databases to identify eligible randomized controlled trials. Meta-analyses with the random-effects and IVhet models were used to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) for outcomes of interest with the administration of LR relative to NS, at 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

There was a significant reduction in the odds of intensive care unit admission and development of local complications, respectively, with the administration of LR among hospitalized patients with acute pancreatitis relative to administration of NS (pooled ORs, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.13–0.81] and 0.43 [95% CI, 0.21–0.89], respectively).

Conclusions

Our findings are able to assist clinicians in the navigation of the proper choice of fluid in patients with acute pancreatitis.

### Lactated Ringer's or normal saline for initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis-induced hypotension [^f84cfef6]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The study CLOVERS (secondary analysis) was published by Georg Gelbenegger and colleagues in 2025 in the journal Crit Care Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock. In the CLOVERS (secondary analysis) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of initial fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension? In the CLOVERS (secondary analysis) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the CLOVERS (secondary analysis) study, the population was: 1312 patients (617 female, 695 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with a suspected or confirmed infection and hypotension caused by sepsis. The key exclusion criteria were pre-randomization fluid administration < 95% lactated Ringer's solution or 0.9% saline; receipt of combination fluids. In the CLOVERS (secondary analysis) study, the interventions were: n = 622 lactated Ringer's solution (lactated Ringer's solution as initial fluid resuscitation) n = 690 normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride as initial fluid resuscitation). In the CLOVERS (secondary analysis) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the rate of death before home discharge by day 90 (12.2% vs. 15.9%; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.99). In the CLOVERS (secondary analysis) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in mean hospital-free days by 28 days (16.6 days vs. 15.4 days; MD 1.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 2.8) No significant difference in mean organ support-free days at 28 days (24.2 days vs. 23.5 days; MD 0.6, 95% CI -0.4 to 1.5) No significant difference in mean ventilator-free days at 28 days (23.7 days vs. 22.7 days; MD 0.9, 95% CI -0.2 to 2). In the CLOVERS (secondary analysis) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in AKI within 7 days. In the CLOVERS (secondary analysis) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with a suspected or confirmed infection and hypotension caused by sepsis, lactated Ringer's solution was superior to normal saline with respect to the rate of death before home discharge by day 90.

### Normosol-R vs lactated Ringer's in the critically ill: a randomized trial [^02261129]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Balanced crystalloid solutions may improve clinical outcomes compared with saline for some critically ill adults, but it is unclear whether differences in composition between balanced crystalloid solutions affect outcomes.

Research Question

Does the choice of balanced crystalloid solutions (Normosol-R vs lactated Ringers) impact acid-base status, organ function, or outcomes for critically ill adults?

Study Design and Methods

This pragmatic, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial at an academic medical center in the United States compared the use of Normosol-R vs lactated Ringers among critically ill adults. The primary outcome was the plasma bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) concentration between enrollment and 7 days. Secondary outcomes included receipt of kidney replacement therapy and death by day 30.

Results

Between June 1, 2018, and January 31, 2019, 2,084 patients were enrolled. The median age was 59 years, 1,006 patients (48.3%) were female, and the median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 5 (interquartile range, 3–8). HCO 3 - concentration between enrollment and 7 days did not differ between the Normosol-R and lactated Ringers groups (mean difference, -0.12 mmol/dL; 95% CI, -0.61 to 0.36; P = 0.61). A total of 58 patients (6.0%) in the Normosol-R group and 47 patients (5.0%) in the lactated Ringers group received new kidney replacement therapy (absolute risk difference, 1.0%; 95% CI, -1.2% to 3.1%). Death by day 30 occurred in 172 patients (16.3%) in the Normosol-R group and 164 patients (16.0%) in the lactated Ringers group (absolute risk difference, 0.3%; 95% CI, -2.9% to 3.6%).

Interpretation

Among critically ill adults, the use of Normosol-R for IV fluid therapy did not affect plasma HCO 3 - concentrations or clinical outcomes compared with lactated Ringers.

### Resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock with normal saline vs. lactated ringer' s: effects on oxygenation, extravascular lung water and haemodynamics [^8185ef1d]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Key messages

- When resuscitating haemorrhagic shock prior to the arrival of blood products significantly more NS is required to maintain goal blood pressure than LR.

- LR has more favourable effects on EVLWI formation, pH, coagulation and haemodynamics than does NS.

- Further investigation is warranted to attempt to explain these fluid-specific differences.

### Resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock with normal saline versus lactated ringer' s: effects on oxygenation, extravascular lung water, and hemodynamics [^a1b754a8]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Which type of fluid to use in the resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock, within and between crystalloids or colloids, is still a matter of debate. In this context, with respect to organ dysfunction, early detection of lung injury is widely considered of particular clinical importance. For these purposes, the transpulmonary thermodilution technique that enables one to assess extravascular lung water as a marker of pulmonary edema is applied in the clinical setting. In this issue of Critical Care, Phillips and colleagues describe that early resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock in pigs with two different crystalloid solutions - normal saline or Ringer's lactate - had little impact on oxygenation when the resuscitation volume was < 250 ml/kg. Ringer's lactate had more favorable effects than normal saline, however, on extravascular lung water, pH, and blood pressure but not on oxygenation. Although several pathophysiological aspects remain unanswered, these data are interesting in so far as they indicate that clinically applied amounts of crystalloids per se do not negatively influence pulmonary function, while with larger amounts the type of fluid has different effects on the extent of fluid extravasation in the lungs.

### Resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock with normal saline vs. lactated ringer' s: effects on oxygenation, extravascular lung water and haemodynamics [^ad57637d]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary oedema has been reported to be a common consequence of haemorrhagic shock and resuscitation (HSR). The early phase of resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock frequently involves the administration of crystalloid solutions prior to the arrival of blood products to attain a goal blood pressure. Lactated Ringer's solutions (LR) and normal saline (NS) remain common resuscitation fluids. Remarkably, little data exist examining the differences in these crystalloid fluids during the early resuscitation phase as a determinant of the amount of extravascular lung water (measured in terms of the extravascular lung water index (EVLWI)) formed and the impact on oxygenation. Differences in volumes required to maintain goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) could impact both oedema formation and oxygenation but, again, remarkably little data exist examining differences in the haemodynamic response to these fluids in early HSR.

The EVLWI at any time represents a dynamic balance between factors that cause fluid to accumulate in the lungs and those that carry it out of the lungs. An increase in fluid leaving the vascular space and remaining in the pulmonary parenchyma following HSR can result from: endothelial injury with increased pulmonary capillary permeability; alveolar epithelial injury and decreased alveolar fluid clearance; dilutional decreases in serum oncotic pressure; increased pulmonary capillary pressure; coagulation abnormalities with increased extravasation of fluid; and increased inflammation. But both lymphatic and vascular removal of EVLWI can increase by as much as 300% after haemorrhagic shock, acting to limit net EVLWI formation. Little is known about the effects of the volume and type of crystalloid administered during the early resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock on these opposing factors and their impact on the formation of clinically significant amounts of EVLWI and the impact on oxygenation.

These experiments were designed to measure the EVLWI, the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) and parameters of haemodynamics during early resuscitation from haemorrhagic shock with LR or NS and determine if there are differences on the development of oedema, the impact on oxygenation and the haemodynamic response to fluid administration because of fluid type.

### Resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock with normal saline vs. lactated ringer' s: effects on oxygenation, extravascular lung water and haemodynamics [^bb6a1e04]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study suggests that early resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock with NS or LR prior to the arrival of blood products is safe in terms of the immediate impact on oxygenation when resuscitation volume is limited to less than 250 ml/kg. Resuscitation with LR has more favourable effects on EVLWI formation, pH, coagulation and haemodynamics but not on oxygenation. Further work is needed to understand the cause of these fluid-specific differences.

### Lactated Ringer's or normal saline for initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis-induced hypotension [^3cf786d0]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Participants

Of the 1563 participants included in the CLOVERS trial, 622 (39.8%) received lactated Ringer's solution and 690 (44.1%) received 0.9% saline for the initial fluid bolus (Fig. S1). Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups (Table S2). Patients receiving lactated Ringer's solution were slightly younger (median, 58 [IQR, 47–68] vs. 62 [52–71]) than patients receiving 0.9% saline. Comorbidities were similar between the two groups, with the exception of chronic kidney disease, which was more prevalent in the 0.9% saline group. No significant differences were observed for the SOFA score at randomization (3 [1–5] vs. 3 [1–5]), amount of fluid for initial pre-randomization bolus (mean ±, 1922 ± 601 vs. 1966 ± 621 mL), vasopressor use at randomization (17.2% vs. 17.7%), and serum lactate levels (2.2 mmol/L [1.4–3.4 mmol/L] vs. 2.2 mmol/L [1.5–3.4 mmol/L]). Fluid volumes and balance by treatment group are shown in Table S3.

### Volume of intraoperative normal saline versus lactated Ringer's solution on acute kidney injury: a secondary analysis of the SOLAR trial [^1ddc46b0]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is common after non-cardiac surgery. Normal saline and lactated Ringer's solution are both used for volume replacement during surgery. Normal saline decreases renal blood flow and causes hyperchloremic acidosis whereas lactated Ringer's does not. The incidence of AKI is similar with modest volumes of each fluid. But it remains unclear whether larger volumes of normal saline provoke AKI.

Objective

Evaluate whether intraoperative crystalloid volume modifies the relationship between the AKI risk and treatment group.

Design

Secondary analysis of a single-center multiple cross-over cluster trial.

Setting

Intraoperative care.

Patients

We enrolled 8616 adults who had colorectal or orthopedic surgery at a large academic institution.

Interventions

Clusters of patients were alternately assigned to intraoperative normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution.

Measurements

The primary outcome was the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) as a function of intraoperative crystalloid volume (0–1, 1–2, 3–4, or 4+ liters) and the type of crystalloid. Our secondary outcome was the change in postoperative serum chloride concentration during the first 24 h.

Main Results

The risk of AKI did not differ significantly in patients given 0–1, 1–2, or 3–4 L saline or lactated Ringers solutions. In contrast, patients given 2–3 or > 4 L of lactated Ringer's solution had a higher risk of AKI than those given saline. Patients assigned to normal saline had progressively greater plasma chloride concentrations than those given lactated Ringer's across all volume categories.

Conclusions

While saline administration clearly causes volume-dependent hyperchloremia, we found no evidence to support the theory that large volumes of saline provoke AKI. Therefore, either fluid seems reasonable for intraoperative use.

### Lactated Ringer's or normal saline for initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis-induced hypotension [^f9afc812]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess whether initial fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution compared with 0.9% saline is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension.

Design

Secondary analysis of the randomized controlled Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) trial.

Setting

ICUs and emergency departments in 60 U.S. centers from March 2018 to January 2022.

Patients

Participants from the CLOVERS trial. Adult patients with a suspected or confirmed infection and hypotension caused by sepsis.

Interventions

Participants received 1-3L of crystalloid fluid for initial fluid resuscitation before randomization. In this analysis, participants were categorized into a lactated Ringer's group and a 0.9% saline group based on the fluid type predominantly used for the initial fluid resuscitation (i.e., ≥ 95% of pre-randomization fluid).

Measurements and Main Results

Of 1563 participants with sepsis-induced hypotension included in the CLOVERS trial, 622 (39.8%) received lactated Ringer's solution and 690 (44.1%) received 0.9% saline as solution for the initial fluid bolus. Death before discharge home by day 90 occurred in 76 of 622 participants (12.2%) in the lactated Ringer's group and in 110 of 690 participants (15.9%) in the 0.9% saline group, resulting in an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.51–0.99; p = 0.043). Patients receiving lactated Ringer's solution had more hospital-free days at 28 days than those receiving 0.9% saline (16.6 ± 10.8 vs. 15.4 ± 11.4, respectively; adjusted mean difference, 1.6 d [95% CI, 0.4–2.8 d; p = 0.009]). Treatment with 0.9% saline was associated with higher levels of serum chloride and decreased levels of serum bicarbonate.

Conclusions

Initial fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution, compared with 0.9% saline, might be associated with improved survival in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension.

### Resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock with normal saline vs. lactated ringer' s: effects on oxygenation, extravascular lung water and haemodynamics [^9d5f7333]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary oedema and impairment of oxygenation are reported as common consequences of haemorrhagic shock and resuscitation (HSR). Surprisingly, there is little information in the literature examining differences in crystalloid type during the early phase of HSR regarding the development of pulmonary oedema, the impact on oxygenation and the haemodynamic response. These experiments were designed to determine if differences exist because of crystalloid fluid type in the development of oedema, the impact on oxygenation and the haemodynamic response to fluid administration in early HSR.

Methods

Twenty anaesthetised swine underwent a grade V liver injury and bled without resuscitation for 30 minutes. The animals were randomised to receive, in a blinded fashion, either normal saline (NS; n = 10) or lactated Ringer's solution (LR; n = 10). They were then resuscitated with study fluid to, and maintained at, the preinjury mean arterial pressure (MAP) for 90 minutes.

Results

Extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) began to increase immediately with resuscitation with both fluid types, increasing earlier and to a greater degree with NS. A 1 ml/kg increase in EVLWI from baseline occurred after administartion of (mean ± standard error of the mean) 68.6 ± 5.2 ml/kg of normal saline and 81.3 ± 8.7 ml/kg of LR (P = 0.027). After 150 ml/kg of fluid, EVLWI increased from 9.5 ± 0.3 ml/kg to 11.4 ± 0.3 ml/kg NS and from 9.3 ± 0.2 ml/kg to 10.8 ± 0.3 ml/kg LR (P = 0.035). Despite this, oxygenation was not significantly impacted (Delta partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) ≤ 100) until approximately 250 ml/kg of either fluid had been administered. Animals resuscitated with NS were more acidaemic (with lower lactates), pH 7.17 ± 0.03 NS vs. 7.41 ± 0.02 LR (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

This study suggests that early resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock with NS or LR has little impact on oxygenation when resuscitation volume is less than 250 ml/kg. LR has more favourable effects than NS on EVLWI, pH and blood pressure but not on oxygenation.

### Are lactated Ringer's solution and normal saline solution equal with regard to coagulation? [^efeae9fb]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Crystalloids represent an attractive strategy to alleviate intravascular volume deficits. Crystalloid hemodilution was associated with hypercoagulability in in vitro and in vivo studies. The influence of different crystalloids on coagulation in the surgical patient is not well studied. In a prospective, randomized study in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, we used either lactated Ringer's solution (RL) (n = 21) or 0.9% saline solution (SS) (n = 21) exclusively for intravascular volume replacement over 48 h to maintain central venous pressure between 8 and 12 mm Hg. Activated thrombelastography (TEG) using different activators (intrinsic TEG, extrinsic TEG, heparinase TEG, aprotinin TEG) was used to measure coagulation time, clot formation time, and maximum clot firmness. Measurements were performed after induction of anesthesia (T0), immediately after surgery (T1), 5 h after surgery (T2), and on the morning of the first (T3) and second (T4) postoperative days. RL 18,750 ± 1890 mL and 17,990 ± 1790 mL of SS were infused during the study period. Acidosis was seen only in the SS-treated group. Blood loss was not different between the groups. Fibrinogen and antithrombin III decreased similarly at T1 and T2 in both groups, most likely because of hemodilution. Differences in TEG data from normal baseline were seen only immediately after surgery and 5 h thereafter, indicating mild hypercoagulability in the intrinsic TEG (RL, from 147 ± 130 s to 130 ± 11 s; SS, from 146 ± 12 s to 131 ± 12 s). There were no differences in coagulation between RL- and SS-treated patients. We conclude that in major abdominal surgery intravascular volume replacement with crystalloids resulted in only moderate and abbreviated changes in coagulation. No differences in activated TEG and blood loss were seen between an RL- and an SS-based intravascular volume replacement regimen.

Implications

In 42 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, either lactated Ringer's solution or 0.9% saline solution were exclusively used for volume therapy for 48 h. Activated thrombelastography revealed some mild hypercoagulability after surgery. No differences in coagulation were seen between the two intravascular volume replacement strategies.

PATIENTS:

Participants from the CLOVERS trial. Adult patients with a suspected or confirmed infection and hypotension caused by sepsis.

INTERVENTIONS:

Participants received 1–3 L of crystalloid fluid for initial fluid resuscitation before randomization.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^e328f94b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis fluid choice — lactated Ringer solution has advantages over normal saline. Normal saline is more acidic with a pH of 5.5 and is associated with a nonanion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and renal injury when large volumes are given, and in 3 well-designed prospective randomized trials lactated Ringer solution has been shown to be more beneficial than normal saline. Patients receiving lactated Ringer solution were less likely to develop SIRS and were less likely to be admitted to the critical care unit and had a shorter hospitalization compared with normal saline, although in patients in the emergency department for a long period and inadequately treated with early aggressive hydration, the benefit may not exist and may be harmful when transferred to the floor or ICU.

### Isotonic crystalloid solutions: a structured review of the literature [^f3888fc4]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Several different crystalloid solutions are available for i.v. fluid administration but there is little information about their specific advantages and disadvantages.

Methods

We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL up until May 17, 2012, selecting all prospective human studies that directly compared any near-isotonic crystalloids and reported any outcome.

Results

From the 5060 articles retrieved in the search, only 28 met the selection criteria. There was considerable heterogeneity among the studies. Several articles reported an increased incidence of hyperchloraemic acidosis with the use of normal saline, and others an increase in blood lactate levels when large amounts of Ringer's lactate solutions were infused. From the limited data available, normal saline administration appears to be associated with increased blood loss and greater red blood cell transfusion volumes in high-risk populations compared to Ringer's lactate. Possible effects of the different solutions on renal function, inflammatory response, temperature, hepatic function, glucose metabolism, and splanchnic perfusion are also reported. The haemodynamic profiles of all the solutions were similar.

Conclusions

Different solutions have different effects on acid-base status, electrolyte levels, coagulation, renal, and hepatic function. Whether these differences have clinical consequences remains unclear.

### Lactated Ringer's or normal saline for initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis-induced hypotension [^3f65dea3]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

The primary endpoint was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model. No violation of the proportional hazard assumptions was found. The primary analysis was based on a multiple Cox regression model adjusted for the covariates sex, age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, vasopressor use, acute respiratory distress syndrome, assigned treatment protocol (early restrictive vs. liberal fluid group), mean arterial blood pressure, amount of lactated Ringer's solution and 0.9% saline used in the 24 hours after randomization, and a propensity score for each patient's probability of receiving lactated Ringer's solution rather than 0.9% saline. Additional information on the statistical adjustment and the propensity scores are provided in Item S1. We performed a sensitivity analysis by sequentially omitting each covariate from the adjusted model and by adding chronic kidney disease as independent covariate.

Secondary endpoints included the number of exposure-free days up to day 28 for several outcomes. Group comparisons were performed using mean differences in exposure-free days adjusted for the same covariates as the Cox regression model.

Due to the exploratory nature of this analysis, CIs were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.

### Lactated Ringer's or normal saline for initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis-induced hypotension [^780b14d2]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

While this study investigated the difference in 90-day mortality, the relatively early timing of separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves may support the causal relationship of type of fluid used for early fluid resuscitation and survival. As potential mechanistic intermediates, higher levels of chloride and an initial drop in bicarbonate could suggest metabolic acidosis associated with 0.9% saline. As fluid resuscitation for sepsis-induced hypotension often begins in a prehospital setting, the choice of fluid type by emergency physicians and paramedics might be of significance. In clinical practice, the choice of the appropriate crystalloid fluid may ultimately depend on individual electrolyte disorders.

Our study has limitations. Because this is a secondary analysis, our findings carry a risk for false positives (type I error). Although the analysis was adjusted for several covariates, residual confounding cannot be excluded. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease was significantly higher in the 0.9% saline group compared with the lactated Ringer's group. However, the primary analysis was adjusted for the Charlson Comorbidity Index, which included chronic kidney disease. In our sensitivity analysis, omitting sex, the Charlson Comorbidity Index, the Glasgow Coma Scale, blood pressure and the amount of lactated Ringer's solution and 0.9% saline after randomization, and adding chronic kidney disease as an independent covariate (outside of the Charlson Comorbidity Index) yielded similar estimates but did not reach statistical significance. Considering our results were not robust to several variations in the model, our study is mainly hypothesis generating.

In conclusion, our results suggest that initial fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution, compared with 0.9% saline, might be associated with improved survival in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension. This is in line with the suggestions of current SSC guidelines and supports the use of lactated Ringer's solution for initial fluid resuscitation.

### A randomized, double-blind comparison of lactated Ringer's solution and 0.9% NaCl during renal transplantation [^ed3a09b0]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

Normal saline (NS; 0.9% NaCl) is administered during kidney transplantation to avoid the risk of hyperkalemia associated with potassium-containing fluids. Recent evidence suggests that NS may be associated with adverse effects that are not seen with balanced-salt fluids, e.g., lactated Ringer's solution (LR). We hypothesized that NS is detrimental to renal function in kidney transplant recipients. Adults undergoing kidney transplantation were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial of NS versus LR for intraoperative IV fluid therapy. The primary outcome measure was creatinine concentration on postoperative Day 3. The study was terminated for safety reasons after interim analysis of data from 51 patients. Forty-eight patients underwent living donor kidney transplants, and three patients underwent cadaveric donor transplants. Twenty-six patients received NS, and 25 patients received LR. There was no difference between groups in the primary outcome measure. Five (19%) patients in the NS group versus zero (0%) patients in the LR group had potassium concentrations > 6 mEq/L and were treated for hyperkalemia (P = 0.05). Eight (31%) patients in the NS group versus zero (0%) patients in the LR group were treated for metabolic acidosis (P = 0.004). NS did not adversely affect renal function. LR was associated with less hyperkalemia and acidosis compared with NS. LR may be a safe choice for IV fluid therapy in patients undergoing kidney transplantation.

Outcomes

Death before discharge home by day 90 occurred in 76 of 622 participants (12.2%) in the lactated Ringer's group and in 110 of 690 participants (15.9%) in the 0.9% saline group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51–0.99; p = 0.043; Fig. 1).

Further, the adjusted HR did not remain statistically significant after adding chronic kidney disease as independent covariate (0.73 [95% CI, 0.52–1.01]) (Table S4).

### Resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock with normal saline vs. lactated ringer' s: effects on oxygenation, extravascular lung water and haemodynamics [^6a4e2d80]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Total blood loss was greater in the NS group than the LR group (34.3 ± 2.9 ml/kg vs. 23.7 ± 2.1 ml/kg; p = 0.009). It is known that HSR with NS attenuates the hypercoagulable response seen with haemorrhage as compared with LR. Increased bleeding during resuscitation due to a dilutional coagulopathy and an attenuation of the post-haemorrhage hypercoagable response was felt to account for the differences seen. With haemorrhage-related endothelial injury, attenuation of the hypercoagable response could also result in greater extravasation of fluid and thus explain in part the greater EVLWI seen in the NS group.

Previous studies examining the effects of NS vs. LR on EVLWI, oxygenation and the haemodynamic response have been conducted in controlled haemorrhage models. Many re-infused shed blood with the resuscitation fluid. Our study used a more clinically relevant model by adding tissue injury to uncontrolled haemorrhage and initiating early resuscitation with crystalloids alone and resuscitating to a goal blood pressure. Although this complicated the analysis of the effect of fluid type independent of volume, we felt by doing so our results could be more reliably extrapolated to the human clinical scenario. Further work is needed to examine late effects of crystalloid type and volume on EVLWI, oxygenation and haemodynamics in a living model of HSR.

Our study did have limitations. By study end the animals had received extremely large resuscitation volumes that exceeded those typically seen in human scenarios. We believe this reflects the severity of the model as well as the choice to resuscitate to the baseline MAP. This resulted in resuscitation beyond normal perfusion as evidenced by supranormal urine outputs especially in the NS group. Despite this fact, differences between the fluids manifested very early, prior to exceeding resuscitation volumes typically used clinically. We have also previously shown that differences in pH and coagulation between LR and NS occur very early after initiation of fluid resuscitation. This indicates that fluid type and not only differences in fluid volume produced the observed differences in EVLWI and blood loss. We chose to not use vasoactive medications in this study, despite the large resuscitation volume, because they are currently rarely used in the early resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock.

### Normosol-R vs lactated Ringer's in the critically ill: a randomized trial [^54009064]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Among critically ill adults in this randomized trial, the choice of balanced crystalloid solution for IV fluid therapy did not result in differences in plasma HCO 3 − concentration, organ function, or clinical outcomes. These findings have implications for clinical care because (1) previous trials suggest that using balanced crystalloids rather than saline may improve outcomes for critically ill adults, (2) balanced crystalloid solutions like Normosol-R and lactated Ringers represent the 2 types of balanced crystalloid widely available and administered in current clinical care, and (3) to our knowledge, no previous large trials have compared solutions like Normosol-R and solutions like lactated Ringers among critically ill adults.

Previous randomized trials examining the effect of balanced crystalloid composition have ranged in size from 14 to 204 participants and have primarily examined fluid therapy in the operating room during surgery. Together, these studies suggest that use of solutions like Normosol-R resulted in lower plasma chloride concentrations and higher base excess compared with lactated Ringers solution. The effect of balanced crystalloid composition on pH and HCO 3 − concentration were inconsistent between trials. Among the 2,084 critically ill adults in our trial, plasma concentrations of sodium, chloride, and HCO 3 − were similar between the Normosol-R and lactated Ringers groups. The results of our trial may have differed from previous trials in the operating room through differences in the patient populations (eg, electrolyte derangements of critical illness vs elective surgery), in the time periods over which fluid therapy was infused, or in the co-interventions received (eg, receipt of IV fluid from medication therapy in the ICU).

### Lactated ringer vs normal saline solution during sickle cell vaso-occlusive episodes [^2e41f453]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Sickle cell disease (SCD), a clinically heterogenous genetic hemoglobinopathy, is characterized by painful vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) that can require hospitalization. Patients admitted with VOEs are often initially resuscitated with normal saline (NS) to improve concurrent hypovolemia, despite preclinical evidence that NS may promote erythrocyte sickling. The comparative effectiveness of alternative volume-expanding fluids (eg, lactated Ringer [LR]) for resuscitation during VOEs is unclear.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of LR to NS fluid resuscitation in patients with SCD and VOEs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter cohort study and target trial emulation included inpatient adults with SCD VOEs who received either LR or NS on hospital day 1. The Premier PINC AI database (2016–2022), a multicenter clinical database including approximately 25% of US hospitalizations was used. The analysis took place between October 6, 2023, and June 20, 2024.

Exposure

Receipt of LR (intervention) or NS (control) on hospital day 1.

Main Outcome and Measures

The primary outcome was hospital-free days (HFDs) by day 30. Targeted maximum likelihood estimation was used to calculate marginal effect estimates. Heterogeneity of treatment effect was explored in subgroups.

Results

A total of 55 574 patient encounters where LR (n = 3495) or NS (n = 52 079) was administered on hospital day 1 were included; the median (IQR) age was 30 (25–37) years. Patients who received LR had more HFDs compared with those who received NS (marginal mean difference, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1–0.6 days). Patients who received LR also had shorter hospital lengths of stay (marginal mean difference, -0.4; 95% CI, -0.7 to -0.1 days) and lower risk of 30-day readmission (marginal risk difference, -5.8%; 95% CI, -9.8% to -1.8%). Differences in HFDs between LR and NS were heterogenous based on fluid volume received: among patients who received less than 2 L, there was no difference in LR vs NS; among those who received 2 or more L, LR was superior to NS.

Conclusion and Relevance

This cohort study found that, compared with NS, LR had a small but significant improvement in HFDs and secondary outcomes including 30-day readmission. These results suggest that, among patients with VOEs in whom clinicians plan to give volume resuscitation fluids on hospital admission, LR should be preferred over NS.

### Acetate Ringer's solution versus normal saline solution in sepsis: a randomized, controlled trial [^696c0e97]. Shock (2024). Medium credibility.

The study Ringer's Acetate vs. Normal Saline in Sepsis was published by Jing Zhang and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Shock. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock. In the Ringer's Acetate vs. Normal Saline in Sepsis study, the trial question was: what is the role of Ringer's acetate solution in patients with sepsis? In the Ringer's Acetate vs. Normal Saline in Sepsis study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the Ringer's Acetate vs. Normal Saline in Sepsis study, the population was: 116 patients (39 female, 77 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients diagnosed with sepsis. The key exclusion criteria were only one kidney or a history of kidney transplantation; AKI due to pre-renal causes; primary renal disease; post-renal obstruction; HUS; TTP. In the Ringer's Acetate vs. Normal Saline in Sepsis study, the interventions were: n = 73 Ringer's acetate solution (acetated Ringer's solution for resuscitation fluid) n = 43 normal saline solution (0.9% saline for resuscitation fluid). In the Ringer's Acetate vs. Normal Saline in Sepsis study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the rate of major adverse kidney events within 28 days (23.6% vs. 27.3%; OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.9). In the Ringer's Acetate vs. Normal Saline in Sepsis study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the rate of new AKI in 5 days (58.3% vs. 56.8%; OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.5 to 2.3) No significant difference in death at day 30 (26.1% vs. 35%; HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.5) No significant difference in death at day 90 (33.8% vs. 37.5%; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.9). In the Ringer's Acetate vs. Normal Saline in Sepsis study, the conclusion was: in adult patients diagnosed with sepsis, Ringer's acetate solution was not superior to normal saline solution with respect to the rate of major adverse kidney events within 28 days.

### Use of lactated Ringer's solution compared with normal saline is associated with shorter length of stay in pediatric acute pancreatitis [^df4bfa6d]. Pancreas (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to evaluate lactated ringers (LR) versus normal saline (NS) in pediatric acute pancreatitis (AP).

Methods

This retrospective study used Pediatric Health Information System database of primary AP patients, 2013 to 2017.

Results

The study included 1581 first time AP patients with exclusive use of a single fluid (111 LR, 1470 NS) for the first 48 hours. The LR cohort had a significantly shorter length of stay (P < 0.001) compared with NS. A multivariable logistic regression analysis suggests use of NS in the first 48 hours (after controlling for total parenteral nutrition, operation, and infection during the admission) had a significantly increased likelihood of requiring a hospitalization for 4 days or more compared with the LR group (odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.95–5.62). The overall cost was significantly less in the LR group. There was no statistical difference observed in risk factors for AP, intensive care transfer, organ dysfunction, or mortality.

Conclusions

This represents the first large data set analysis of LR versus NS in pediatric AP. The use of LR was associated with a shorter length of stay and reduced cost compared with NS. Future randomized trials will help determine the ideal fluid choice for pediatric AP.

### Normosol-R vs lactated Ringer's in the critically ill: a randomized trial [^42c1b4ae]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Our trial did not detect the differences in HCO 3 − concentration or acid-base balance that we hypothesized would occur based on the total amount of buffer contained in Normosol-R (50 mM) compared with lactated Ringers (28 mM). Several potential explanations for this exist. First, the gluconate in Normosol-R may be excreted unchanged in the urine rather than being metabolized to an effective buffer. If so, then the concentration of effective buffers in Normosol-R (27 mM acetate) and lactated Ringers (28 mM lactate) are sufficiently similar that the effect on patients' plasma acid-base balance would not be expected to differ between the solutions. Second, the differing pathways by which acetate and lactate undergo metabolism may affect to what degree they alkalinize patients' plasma. Third, the hyperchloremic acidosis after saline infusion has been attributed to the high concentration of chloride in saline (154 mM) compared with human plasma (98–108 mM). Because the difference in chloride concentration between Normosol-R (98 mM) and lactated Ringers (109 mM) is much smaller than the difference between balanced crystalloids and saline, any effect of chloride administration on acid-base balance might differ less between the 2 balanced crystalloid solutions than between balanced crystalloid solutions and saline.

### Normal saline versus lactated Ringer's solution for intraoperative fluid management in patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair: an outcome study [^16a26093]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2001). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Metabolic acidosis and changes in serum osmolarity are consequences of 0.9% normal saline (NS) solution administration. We sought to determine if these physiologic changes influence patient outcome. Patients undergoing aortic reconstructive surgery were enrolled and were randomly assigned to receive lactated Ringer's (LR) solution (n = 33) or NS (n = 33) in a double-blinded fashion. Anesthetic and fluid management were standardized. Multiple measures of outcome were monitored. The NS patients developed a hyperchloremic acidosis and received more bicarbonate therapy (30 ± 62 mL in the NS group versus 4 ± 16 mL in the LR group; mean ± SD), which was given if the base deficit was greater than -5 mEq/L. The NS patients also received a larger volume of platelet transfusion (478 ± 302 mL in the NS group versus 223 ± 24 mL in the LR group; mean ± SD). When all blood products were summed, the NS group received significantly more blood products (P = 0.02). There were no differences in duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, and incidence of complications. When NS was used as the primary intraoperative solution, significantly more acidosis was seen on completion of surgery. This acidosis resulted in no apparent change in outcome but required larger amounts of bicarbonate to achieve predetermined measurements of base deficit and was associated with the use of larger amounts of blood products. These changes should be considered when choosing fluids for surgical procedures involving extensive blood loss and requiring extensive fluid administration.

Implications

Predominant use of 0.9% saline solution in major surgery has little impact on outcome as assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, and postoperative complications, but it does appear to be associated with increased perioperative blood loss.

### Lactated Ringer's or normal saline for initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis-induced hypotension [^bdf22117]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Design

This secondary analysis of the CLOVERS trial investigated whether initial fluid resuscitation with balanced crystalloid fluids (lactated Ringer's solution) compared with 0.9% saline was associated with improved outcomes in sepsis-induced hypotension. The design and results of the original CLOVERS trial have been published previously. Because the two treatment strategies (early restrictive and liberal fluid management) yielded similar outcomes, patients were pooled irrespective of their group assignment for this secondary analysis. Data for this secondary analysis were obtained from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center. Review by an institutional review board (Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Vienna) was not required because this project did not fall under the board's guidelines as human subjects research.

Participants

In the CLOVERS trial, participants were randomly assigned to either a restrictive fluid strategy (prioritizing vasopressors and lower IV fluid volumes) or a liberal fluid strategy (prioritizing higher volumes of IV fluids before vasopressor use) for a 24-hour period. Randomization occurred within 4 hours after a patient met the criteria for sepsis-induced hypotension refractory to initial fluid resuscitation (pre-randomization) with 1–3 L of IV fluid, including prehospital administration of fluid by emergency medical services. In the present analysis, we investigated whether initial fluid resuscitation (corresponding to fluids administered before randomization) with lactated Ringer's solution as compared with 0.9% saline was associated with improved clinical outcomes. Patients were divided into the lactated Ringer's group or the 0.9% saline group. Patients were included in this analysis if the administered pre-randomization fluid was greater than or equal to 95% lactated Ringer's solution or 0.9% saline. Patients receiving a combination of fluids were excluded.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was death from any cause before discharge home by day 90. Secondary outcomes included 28-day measures of the number of days free from ventilator use, days free from vasopressor use, days out of the ICU, and days out of the hospital. We also assessed the occurrence rate of acute kidney injury, defined as a short-term increase in serum creatinine by greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/dL or an greater than or equal to 1.5-fold increase in creatinine levels (Table S1). An explorative comparison of the change in serum biomarkers (chloride, bicarbonate, lactate, and creatinine) within the first 72 hours of randomization was performed.

### Resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock with normal saline vs. lactated ringer' s: effects on oxygenation, extravascular lung water and haemodynamics [^3db82aa1]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this swine model of traumatic haemorrhagic shock, resuscitation with NS as compared with LR resulted in greater EVLWI formation at similar amounts of resuscitation volume. In addition, the blood pressure response to fluid was considerably lower in the NS group (NS 56.9 ± 1.6 mmHg vs. LR 64.0 ± 2.0 mmHg; p = 0.01) despite requiring more total fluid over the entire study period (NS 330.8 ± 38.1 ml/kg vs. LR 148.4 ± 20.2 ml/kg; p = 0.009) in an attempt to maintain goal MAP. The lower blood pressure with NS administration was due to a greater systemic vasodilatation as compared with LR. Surprisingly neither fluid resulted in significant changes in oxygenation, as defined by a drop in baseline PaO 2 /FiO 2 of 100 or more (roughly corresponding to a drop in arterial oxygen saturation below 90% on room air), until approximately 250 mL of either fluid had been infused. This corresponds to 17.5 litres in a 70 kg human – well in excess of what would be normally administered during most human resuscitations prior to the arrival of blood products.

### The impact of pre-hospital administration of lactated Ringer's solution versus normal saline in patients with traumatic brain injury [^1b6d7a13]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

Lactated Ringer's (LR) and normal saline (NS) are both used for resuscitation of injured patients. NS has been associated with increased resuscitation volume, blood loss, acidosis, and coagulopathy compared with LR. We sought to determine if pre-hospital LR is associated with improved outcome compared with NS in patients with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI). We included patients receiving pre-hospital LR or NS from the PRospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) study. Patients with TBI (Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] head ≥ 3) and without TBI (AIS head ≤ 2) were compared. Cox proportional hazards models including Injury Severity Score (ISS), AIS head, AIS extremity, age, fluids, intubation status, and hospital site were generated for prediction of mortality. Linear regression models were generated for prediction of red blood cell (RBC) and crystalloid requirement, and admission biochemical/physiological parameters. Seven hundred ninety-one patients received either LR (n = 117) or NS (n = 674). Median ISS, AIS head, AIS extremity, and pre-hospital fluid volume were higher in TBI and non-TBI patients receiving LR compared with NS (p < 0.01). In patients with TBI (n = 308), LR was associated with higher adjusted mortality compared with NS (hazard rate [HR] = 1.78, confidence interval [CI] 1.04–3.04, p = 0.035). In patients without TBI (n = 483), no difference in mortality was demonstrated (HR = 1.49, CI 0.757–2.95, p = 0.247). Fluid type had no effect on admission biochemical or physiological parameters, 6-hour RBC, or crystalloid requirement in either group. LR was associated with increased mortality compared with NS in patients with TBI. These results underscore the need for a prospective randomized trial comparing pre-hospital LR with NS in patients with TBI.

### Comparison of bicarbonate Ringer's solution with lactated Ringer's solution among postoperative outcomes in patients with laparoscopic right hemihepatectomy: a single-centre randomised controlled trial [^fe8469f6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Normal saline has been used historically as an intraoperative fluid. however, its use has been linked with some complications. Hence, some alternatives were developed, particularly, crystalloid solutions. In this context, A retrospective study conducted in a Canadian tertiary hospital to compare the impact of normal saline, balanced crystalloids and combination of both to vascular surgery patients showed a better outcome of balanced crystalloids in terms of ventilator requirements and mortality. In contrast, a recent study reported an association of balanced crystalloid solution with a higher mortality rate in patients having out of hospital cardiac arrest, than the normal saline. However, the latter was found to be associated with complications in all the study population of cardiogenic shock patients. While comparing normal saline, Ringer's solution and Plasmalyte Salinero et al. argued that although Ringer's solution and Plasmalyte are better than normal saline, however, considering their higher potassium content, they should be administered carefully to the patients with hyperkalemia. Nonetheless, the literature they reviewed presented Plasmalyte as a better substituent to Ringer's solution owing to its near-to-plasma composition. Considering these contrasting observations, there was a need to understand the precise impact of BRS and LRS.

### Evaluation of a protocol change promoting lactated Ringer's over normal saline in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis [^3a77eafa]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend normal saline (NS) for fluid resuscitation in the management of patients presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). However, previous prospective studies have demonstrated improvement in patient-specific outcomes, including time to DKA resolution, when balanced crystalloid fluids are used.

Methods

We conducted a single institution, retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted with DKA before and after a protocol change within our institution, which shifted the default resuscitative and maintenance fluid in our DKA management protocol from NS to lactated Ringer's solution (LR). The primary outcome was time from DKA clinical presentation until DKA resolution. The secondary outcome was time to discontinuation of DKA protocol insulin drip.

Results

Of 246 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 119 were in the NS group (preprotocol change, where NS was the default resuscitative fluid) and 127 to the LR group (postprotocol change, where LR was the default resuscitative fluid). Time to DKA resolution was significantly decreased in the LR group (mean = 17.1 hours; standard deviation [SD] = 11.0) relative to the NS group (mean = 20.6 hours; SD = 12.2; P = 0.02). Duration of DKA protocol insulin drip was shorter in the LR group (mean = 16.0 hours; SD = 8.7) compared with the NS group (mean = 21.4 hours; SD = 12.5; P < .001).

Conclusions

In this retrospective cohort study, protocolized DKA intravenous fluid management with LR resulted in shorter time to resolution of DKA and reduced duration of DKA protocol insulin drip.

### Lactated Ringer's solution reduces systemic inflammation compared with saline in patients with acute pancreatitis [^ffda0a82]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Aggressive fluid resuscitation is recommended for initial management of acute pancreatitis. We performed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a goal-directed fluid resuscitation protocol on systemic inflammation in patients with acute pancreatitis. We then determined the impact of resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution, compared with normal saline.

Methods

We performed a randomized controlled trial of 40 patients with acute pancreatitis at 3 New England hospitals from May 2009-February 2010. Patients received goal-directed fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution, goal-directed fluid resuscitation with normal saline, standard fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution, or standard fluid resuscitation with normal saline. Systemic inflammation was measured on the basis of levels of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level after 24 hours.

Results

The volumes of fluid administered during a 24-hour period were similar among patients given goal-directed or standard fluid resuscitation (mean, 4300 vs 4600 mL, respectively; P = 0.87). Goal-directed resuscitation did not significantly reduce incidence of SIRS, compared with standard resuscitation (11.8% vs 13.0%, respectively; P = 0.85) or levels of CRP after 24 hours (87.1 vs 69.2 mg/dL, respectively; P = 0.75). By contrast, there was a significant reduction in SIRS after 24 hours among subjects resuscitated with lactated Ringer's solution, compared with normal saline (84% reduction vs 0%, respectively; P = 0.035); administration of lactated Ringer's solution also reduced levels of CRP, compared with normal saline (51.5 vs 104 mg/dL, respectively; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Patients with acute pancreatitis who were resuscitated with lactated Ringer's solution had reduced systemic inflammation compared with those who received saline.

### Resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock with normal saline vs. lactated ringer' s: effects on oxygenation, extravascular lung water and haemodynamics [^3954b4ec]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Figure 2b shows EVLWI and PaO 2 /FiO 2 plotted as a function of resuscitation fluid volume administered early in the study, limited to 250 ml/kg. This was performed to examine the effect of fluid type early in the resuscitation at similar volumes. Linear regression analysis revealed a larger increase in EVLWI in the NS group as compared with the LR group occurring early in the resuscitation. There was no significant difference in baseline EVLWI for the two groups. A 1 ml/kg increase in EVLWI from baseline occurred after 68.6 ± 5.2 ml/kg of NS and 81.3 ± 8.7 ml/kg of LR (p = 0.027). After 150 ml/kg of fluid EVLWI increased from 9.5 ± 0.3 ml/kg to 11.4 ± 0.3 ml/kg for NS and from 9.3 ± 0.2 mg/g to 10.8 ± 0.3 ml/kg for LR (p = 0.035). Significant changes in oxygenation, defined as a drop in baseline PaO 2 /FiO 2 to 100 or greater, did not occur over this range for either fluid type.

Figure 3a shows boxplots for the median values with confidence intervals for the average MAP, CO and SVR between the two groups during the resuscitation period at the time the difference in MAP between the two groups first became significant. There were no differences in baseline values immediately before resuscitation. The average MAP was lower in the NS group despite infusing nearly twice as much NS. CO was higher in the NS group (NS 5.2 ± 0.3 l/minute vs. LR 4.4 ± 0.2 l/minute, p = 0.016) and SVR was lower in the NS group (923 ± 51.4 dyne × sec/m 3 vs.1177.6 ± 34.6 dyne × sec/m 3; p < 0.001). As shown in Figure 3b, there were no differences between groups with respect to the GEDV or the SV, and the observed difference in CO was entirely due to differences in HR (NS 114.9 ± 6.5 beats/minute vs. LR 93.6 ± 3.6 beats/minute; p = 0.012).

### Resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock with normal saline vs. lactated ringer' s: effects on oxygenation, extravascular lung water and haemodynamics [^97e99ab1]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

We observed differences in EVLWI early in the resuscitation when similar volumes of the fluids had been given, more NS than LR. This supports the idea that a fluid specific effect, independent of volume, was present. To evaluate this we performed two separate regression analyses: Figure 2a examined the change in EVLWI as a function of fluid given over the entire study and Figure 2b examined the change in EVLWI at similar volumes of resuscitation fluid earlier in the resuscitation (< 250 ml/kg).

A second order polynomial was used as the best fit line for PaO 2 /FiO 2 vs. volume of resuscitation for two reasons. First, previous studies have shown a stepwise increase in the rate of EVLWI formation as a function of the interstitial matrix filling and then abruptly 'giving way' with a subsequent increased rate of fluid extravasation into the matrix and then alveoli. One could expect an initial improvement in PaO 2 /FiO 2 with improved CO early in the resuscitation, followed by a curvilinear decline as the matrix 'lets go' with a subsequent increase rate in fluid extravasation. Secondly a curvilinear line dramatically improved the regression coefficient (R 2); from 0.620 to 0.815 for NS, and from 0.15 to 0.60 for LR. We found significant differences in EVLWI formation at similar volumes of resuscitation, more NS than LR early in the resuscitation. The cause of the greater EVLWI accumulation in the NS group at similar resuscitation volumes as compared with the LR group is not known.

Figure 3
Haemodynamic data during resuscitation. Boxplots for the means of the values at the time the difference in mean arterial pressure (MAP) between the two groups first became significant. (a) Significant differences in MAP, cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). There were no differences in baseline values immediately prior to resuscitation between the groups. During the resuscitation stage MAP was lower in the normal saline (NS) group (NS 56.9 ± 1.6 mmHg vs. lactated Ringer's solution (LR) 64.0 ± 2.0 mmHg; p = 0.01) despite this group having higher COs (NS 5.2 ± 0.3 l/minute vs. LR 4.4 ± 0.2 l/minute; p = 0.016). This was due to a significant difference in SVR (NS 923 ± 51.4 dyne × sec/m 3 vs. 1177.6 ± 34.6 dyne × sec/m 3; p < 0.001). (b) There were no differences in the preload metric global end-diastolic volume (GEDV) or in stroke volume (SV). The differences in CO seen in (a) were due to a significant increased heart rate (HR) in the NS group (NS 114.9 ± 6.5 beats/minute vs. LR 93.6 ± 3.6 beats/minute; p = 0.012).

Figure 4 shows that the PVPI (defined as EVLW/PBV) obtained when the difference in EVLWI between the two groups first became significant. The PVPI was greater in the NS group (NS 3.6 ± 0.25 vs. LR 2.9 ± 0.13; p = 0.014). A higher PVPI value with the same filling volume implies either greater extravasation of fluid into the lung or an impairment of fluid clearance or a combination of the two. There was no difference in PVPI immediately before resuscitation between the two groups.

### Lactated Ringer's solution versus normal saline in pediatric living-donor liver transplantation: a matched retrospective cohort study [^ceff6582]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In pediatric living-donor liver transplantation, lactated Ringer's solution and normal saline are commonly used for intraoperative fluid management, but the comparative clinical outcomes remain uncertain.

Aims

To compare the effect between lactated Ringer's solution and normal saline for intraoperative volume replacement on clinical outcomes among pediatric living-donor liver transplantation patients.

Methods

This single-center, retrospective trial study enrolled children who received either lactated Ringer's solution or normal saline during living-donor liver transplantation between January 2010 and August 2016. The groups with comparable clinical characteristics were balanced by propensity score matching. The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcomes included early allograft dysfunction, primary nonfunction, acute renal injury, and hospital-free days (days alive postdischarge within 30 days of liver transplantation).

Results

We included 333 pediatric patients who met the entry criteria for analysis. Propensity score matching identified 61 patients in each group. After matching, the lactated Ringer's solution group had a higher 90-day mortality rate than the normal saline group (11.5% vs. 0.0%). Early allograft dysfunction and primary nonfunction incidences were also more frequent in the lactated Ringer's solution group (19.7% and 11.5%, respectively) than in the normal saline group (3.3% and 0.0%, respectively). In the lactated Ringer's solution group, four (6.6%) recipients developed acute renal injury within 7 days postoperatively compared with three (4.9%) recipients in the normal saline group. Hospital-free days did not differ between groups (9 days [1–13] vs. 9 days [0–12]).

Conclusions

For intraoperative fluid management in pediatric living-donor liver transplantation patients, lactated Ringer's solution administration was associated with a higher 90-day mortality rate than normal saline. This finding has important implications for selecting crystalloid in pediatric living-donor liver transplantation. Further randomized clinical trials in larger cohort are necessary to confirm this finding.

### Choice of fluids in critically ill patients [^f11b8033]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Among crystalloid solutions, the respective roles of balanced solutions and saline remain controversial. Unsurprisingly, administration of lactated Ringer solution increases plasma lactate concentrations, whereas normal saline increases the base deficit. In patients with severe TBI, hypotonic solutions (including lactated Ringer) should be avoided as they exacerbate cerebral edema. Conversely, balanced solutions cause less hyperchloremic acidosis than saline in these patients. A RCT of adult trauma patients requiring blood transfusion, intubation, or operation within 60 min of arrival showed that pre-hospital resuscitation with Plasma-Lyte A yielded better acid-base status and less hyperchloremia 24-h after injury compared with saline. To summarise - the use of balanced solutions seems promising for trauma resuscitation but currently remains under investigation.

There is ongoing debate regarding intravascular volume expansion with hypertonic saline in trauma patients. Han et al. randomized 294 patients with hypovolemic shock after trauma to receive 3% hypertonic saline (n = 82), 7.5% hypertonic saline (n = 80), or lactated Ringer (n = 84). Although baseline population characteristics were similar in the three groups, patients receiving hypertonic solutions (3% or 7.5%) were given about half the amount of fluids than those given lactated Ringer within the first hour, a difference which disappeared within 24 h. Some side effects (e.g. arrhythmia, hypernatremia) were more commonly observed in patients receiving 7.5% hypertonic saline, whereas others (e.g. renal failure, coagulopathy, pulmonary edema) were more prevalent among patients receiving lactated Ringer. The authors concluded that among the solutions examined 3% hypertonic saline has the best safety and efficacy profile. With regards to colloids - the relative contribution of micro-circulatory abnormalities, endothelial dysfunction, local and systemic inflammatory processes and oxidative stress differs between hemorrhagic and septic shock. Decreased tissue perfusion is a major component of haemorrhagic shock whereas inflammatory processes are likely more predominant in septic shock. Hence the effects of HES may also differ. Evidence supporting the presence of a difference includes three meta-analysis showing that the use of HES was not associated with renal effects or clinically significant coagulopathy in the OR. Similarly, no study found deleterious effects of HES in early resuscitation of trauma patients. The European Medicine Agency decided that HES can still be used in surgical patients, and for management of hemorrhagic shock following an initial fluid challenge with crystalloids that has failed. However the clinician should be aware that colloids have not been associated with an improvement in survival in patients with trauma, burns or following surgery.

### Resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock with normal saline vs. lactated ringer' s: effects on oxygenation, extravascular lung water and haemodynamics [^29dbeef1]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Results

One animal in the NS group did not survive the two-hour study. All the animals in the LR group survived. Composite MAP of the two groups throughout the study are shown in Figure 1. The grade V liver injury caused rapid blood loss and a rapid drop in blood pressure. On reaching a nadir blood pressure, bleeding spontaneously stopped in all animals. This was followed by a period of spontaneous increase in blood pressure that was augmented after 30 minutes with active resuscitation using either NS or LR (randomised) to baseline MAP. Despite receiving a larger resuscitation volume in an attempt to maintain target blood pressure, the average MAP during the resuscitation phase was significantly lower in the NS group (NS 56.9 ± 1.6 mmHg vs. LR 64.0 ± 2.0 mmHg, p = 0.01). Although all the animals received large resuscitations, no animal in either group developed signs of abdominal compartment syndrome such as difficulty in maintaining adequate ventilation or decreased urine output.

Figure 1
Blood pressure curves for experimental groups. This graph is a composite of the mean arterial pressures of the two resuscitation groups. The liver injury is created at time zero. Fluid resuscitation was begun at 30 minutes into the experiment. There is no difference in mean arterial pressure (MAP) between the two groups until resuscitation. Despite being given significantly more fluid, mean arterial pressures of the animals five the normal saline (NS) was significantly lower than the lactated Ringer's solution (LR) group beginning 39 minutes into the resuscitation (NS 56.9 ± 1.6 mmHg vs. LR 64.0 ± 2.0 mmHg; ✱ p = 0.01)) and remaining so until close to study end.

Mean urine output and blood loss were greater in the NS group than in the LR group. Urine output was 44.1 ml/kg ± 8.1 in the NS group vs. 19.4 ml/kg ± 3.4 ml/kg in the LR group (p = 0.012), and total blood loss was 34.3 ± 2.9 ml/kg vs. 23.7 ± 2.1 ml/kg (p = 0.009). The NS group required almost twice as much fluid (NS 330.8 ± 38.1 ml/kg vs. LR 148.4 ± 20.2 ml/kg; p = 0.009) over the 90-minute resuscitation period in an attempt to maintain goal MAP. There was no difference in blood loss prior to fluid resuscitation.

### Resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock with normal saline vs. lactated ringer' s: effects on oxygenation, extravascular lung water and haemodynamics [^9992b902]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

EVLWI is defined as the extravascular fluid in the lung at any moment including the intracellular fluid of inflammatory, endothelial and epithelial cells in the extravascular space, as well as alveolar and interstitial fluid and intrapulmonary lymph. The amount of EVLWI represents a dynamic balance between factors that cause fluid to accumulate in the lungs and those that carry it out of the lungs.

HSR results in increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, increased neutrophil sequestration in the lung, increased generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and activation of coagulation. All of these factors can cause endothelial and epithelial cell dysfunction and increased EVLWI. However, our laboratory has previously shown in an identical swine model that there is no difference in the HSR-related increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory mRNA gene expression for IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and TNF-α or increased numbers of sequestered neutrophils in the lung between NS and LR resuscitated animals.

The NS group developed a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis whereas the LR group remained pH neutral. Several studies have shown potential lung protective effects of hypercapnic acidosis in acute lung injury. However, there is a paucity of clinical data evaluating the direct effects of either hypercapnia or acidosis on EVLWI formation and the acute lung injury following haemorrhagic shock. The protective effects of hypercapnic acidosis in acute lung injury may be a function of the acidosis, the hypercapnia or a combination of both and further work is required to gain a better understanding of these effects.

Dilutional decreases in serum oncotic pressure are likely to have contributed to the rise in EVLWI seen with both fluid types in this study. It is likely that the differences in the total EVLWI measured at study end were in large part due to dilutional effects from the greater volume of NS required. Twice the volume of NS was required to maintain target MAP. This has clinical relevance in regards to selecting fluid type, in that a greater volume of NS will need to be administered to maintain blood pressure goals and will result in greater EVLWI formation and acidosis.

### Dilutional acidosis: where do the protons come from? [^040bf532]. Intensive Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the mechanism of acidosis developing after saline infusion (dilutional acidosis or hyperchloremic acidosis).

Methods

We simulated normal extracellular fluid dilution by infusing distilled water, normal saline and lactated Ringer's solution. Simulations were performed either in a closed system or in a system open to alveolar gases using software based on the standard laws of mass action and mass conservation. In vitro experiments diluting human plasma were performed to validate the model.

Results

In our computerized model with constant pKs, diluting extracellular fluid modeled as a closed system with distilled water, normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution is not associated with any pH modification, since all its determinants (strong ion difference, CO(2) content and weak acid concentration) decrease at the same degree, maintaining their relative proportions unchanged. Experimental data confirmed the simulation results for normal saline and lactated Ringer's solution, whereas distilled water dilution caused pH to increase. This is due to the increase of carbonic pK induced by the dramatic decrease of ionic strength. Acidosis developed only when the system was open to gases due to the increased CO(2) content, both in its dissociated (bicarbonate) and undissociated form (dissolved CO(2)).

Conclusions

The increase in proton concentration observed after dilution of the extracellular system derives from the reaction of CO(2) hydration, which occurs only when the system is open to the gases. Both Stewart's approach and the traditional approach may account for these results.

### Arteriovenous differences in plasma dilution and the distribution kinetics of lactated Ringer's solution [^44a66ef5]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Conventional concept suggests that infused crystalloid fluid is first distributed in the plasma volume and then, since the capillary permeability for fluid is very high, almost instantly equilibrates with the extracellular fluid space. We challenge whether this view is consistent with findings based on volume kinetic analysis.

Methods

Fifteen volunteers received an IV infusion of 15 mL/kg of lactated Ringer's solution during 10 min. Simultaneous arterial and venous blood hemoglobin (Hgb) samples were obtained and Hgb concentrations measured. The arteriovenous (AV) difference in Hgb dilution in the forearm was determined and a volume kinetic model was fitted to the series of Hgb concentrations in arterial and venous blood.

Results

The AV difference in plasma dilution was only positive during the infusion and for 2.5 min thereafter, which represents the period of net flow of fluid from plasma to tissue. Kinetic analysis showed that volume expansion of the peripheral fluid space began to decrease 14 min (arterial blood) and 20 min (venous blood) after the infusion ended. Distribution of lactated Ringer's solution apparently occurs much faster in the forearm than in the body as a whole. Therefore, the AV difference in the arm does not accurately reflect the distribution of Ringer's solutions or whole-body changes in plasma volume.

Conclusions

The relatively slow whole-body distribution of lactated Ringer's solution, which boosts the plasma volume expansion during and for up to 30 min after an infusion, is probably governed by a joint effect of capillary permeability and differences in tissue perfusion between body regions.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^c4958ff3]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Management

What is the optimal crystalloid type, rate of administration, and urine output goals to prevent AKI in rhabdomyolysis?

Recommendation

Either lactated Ringer's solution or saline (0.9% or 0.45%) is an acceptable fluid for resuscitation in rhabdomyolysis. A starting rate of 400 mL/hour can be initiated, with goal-directed therapy of urine output of 1 mL/kg/hour to 3 mL/kg/hour, and up to 300 cc/hour.

Discussion

Although early-volume resuscitation in rhabdomyolysis is well accepted as a mainstay of promoting renal tubule flow, diluting nephrotoxins such as myoglobin, and supplying adequate renal perfusion to prevent AKI, the best type of crystalloid for this purpose remains controversial. The two most commonly cited fluids used for this resuscitation are lactated Ringer's solution and saline (0.9% or 0.45%). Saline is promoted due to its lack of potassium; in rhabdomyolysis, crush injury can lead to hyperkalemia and there is a theoretic concern for worsening this issue by using a potassium-containing fluid for resuscitation. Conversely, receiving large amounts of resuscitation with normal saline can lead to metabolic acidosis, which can be counterproductive if urine alkalinization is desired. The only randomized controlled trial comparing these crystalloid fluid types evaluated patients with doxylamine-induced rhabdomyolysis. Of note, in this study, urine pH was a targeted end goal, with a goal pH > 6.5. In patients who received lactated Ringer's solution, urine and serum pH were significantly higher after 12 hours of aggressive resuscitation with significantly less need for bicarbonate administration to achieve goal urine pH, and there was no difference between groups in serum potassium level. However, there was also no difference in median time to serum CK less than 200 IU/L, which arguably is the most clinically relevant outcome in the study. There have been no other randomized controlled trials comparing lactated Ringer's solution and normal saline or 0.45% saline and therefore no clear recommendation as to which fluid type is better. It does appear that use of either type of fluid is safe in the treatment of rhabdomyolysis, so although this area certainly requires further study, at this time the type of fluid used for management of rhabdomyolysis may be at the discretion of the treating physician.

### Impact of common crystalloid solutions on resuscitation markers following class I hemorrhage: a randomized control trial [^94b5bd94]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Resuscitation after hemorrhage with crystalloid solutions can lead to marked acidosis and iatrogenically worsen the lethal triad. The effect of differing solutions on base deficit and lactate has been sparsely prospectively studied in humans. We sought to quantify the effect of normal saline (NS) and lactated Ringer's (LR) resuscitation in voluntary blood donors as a model for Class I hemorrhage.

Methods

A prospective randomized control trial was conducted in conjunction with blood drives. Donors were randomized to receive no intravenous fluid (noIVF), 2-L NS, or 2-L LR after blood donation of 500 mL. Lactate and base deficit were measured before and after fluid administration using an iSTAT. The mean laboratory values were compared between groups first using a global test followed by pairwise testing between groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum and Kruskal-Wallis tests. The Bonferroni correction was used and a statistical significance of p < 0.0167 was set.

Results

A total of 157 patients completed the study. The mean (SD) age was 39.2 (12.7), and 65.0% were female. Patients in each group lost equivalent amounts of total blood volume, and a similar amount was replaced in the crystalloid group (p > 0.0167). Donors had comparable increases in lactate and base deficit after donation regardless of the group (p > 0.0167). After resuscitation with 2-L crystalloid, the lactate level increased higher in the LR group than in the noIVF or the NS group (1.36 mmol/L vs. 1.00 mmol/L vs. 1.54 mmol/L, p < 0.0001). In addition, the resuscitation base deficit increased in the NS group more than in the noIVF or LR group (-0.65 vs. -3.06 vs. -0.34, p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

This study is one of the first human studies to prospectively demonstrate quantifiable differences in base deficit and lactate by type of crystalloid resuscitation. LR resuscitation elevated lactate levels, and NS negatively affected the base deficit. These findings are critical to the interpretation of trauma patient resuscitation with crystalloid solutions.

Level Of Evidence

### Normosol-R vs lactated Ringer's in the critically ill: a randomized trial [^90cd2e7b]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Interpretation: Among critically ill adults, the use of Normosol-R for IV fluid therapy did not affect plasma HCO 3 − concentrations or clinical outcomes compared with lactated Ringers.

The IV administration of crystalloid solutions is common in the ICU. Randomized trials and meta-analyses have reported a high probability that using balanced crystalloid solutions reduces mortality for critically ill adults compared with saline. Although some prior research has considered all balanced crystalloid solutions as a single group, the balanced crystalloid solutions that are available and commonly used in current clinical care differ significantly in their composition in ways that may affect acid-base balance, organ function, and outcomes.

Two common types of balanced crystalloid solution include balanced multielectrolyte solutions buffered with acetate, gluconate, or both (eg, Normosol-R, Plasmalyte-A) and lactate-buffered solutions (eg, Hartmann's solutions, lactated Ringers). Normosol-R and Plasmalyte-A differ from lactated Ringers in their concentrations of sodium (140 vs 130 mM), chloride (98 vs 109 mM), lactate (0 vs 28 mM), acetate (27 vs 0 mM), and gluconate (23 vs 0 mM). The resulting difference between the fluids in the strong ion difference (50 vs 28 mM) has been hypothesized to affect the acid-base balance in patients receiving IV fluid therapy. Although hyperchloremia and nonanion gap metabolic acidosis have been proposed to mediate the relationship between IV fluid composition and kidney replacement therapy or death in critically ill adults, to our knowledge, whether the choice of balanced crystalloid solution affects acid-base status, organ function, or death for critically ill adults has never been evaluated in a randomized trial. This difference is important to clinicians, and 87% of respondents to a recent international survey of anesthesiologists and intensivists support a randomized trial evaluating acetate vs lactate buffered solutions.

To determine the effect of balanced crystalloid solution composition on plasma laboratory values, organ function, and clinical outcomes in critically ill adults, we conducted the Balanced Solutions and Plasma Electrolytes (BASE) trial. We hypothesized that use of Normosol-R would result in higher plasma bicarbonate (HCO 3 −) concentrations compared with use of lactated Ringers.

### Lactated Ringer's or normal saline for initial resuscitation in patients hospitalized with acute pancreatitis: a retrospective database analysis [^b5a51c9b]. Pancreas (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Fluid resuscitation is required in acute pancreatitis (AP) to prevent hypovolemia and organ hypoperfusion. Lactated Ringer's (LR) is a buffered crystalloid with possible advantages in AP versus normal saline (NS). We aim to assess outcomes in patients hospitalized with AP based on fluid used for resuscitation.

Methods

In this retrospective analysis, we identified hospital admissions to Veterans Affairs facilities for AP from 2011 to 2017 and grouped by initial resuscitation fluid: LR versus NS. Outcomes included major complications and mortality at 30 and 365 days. Multivariable models were used to adjust for confounding variables.

Results

A total of 20,049 admissions were included in the study, of which 10% received LR as initial fluid. After adjustment for all available confounders, resuscitation with LR was associated with lower 1-year mortality compared with NS (adjusted odds ratio, 0.61 [95% confidence interval, 0.50–0.76]). Major complication and early mortality were similar between groups.

Conclusions

In this study, we demonstrate an association between use of LR as initial resuscitation fluid and reduced 1-year mortality in a large retrospective sample of veterans hospitalized with AP. These results support the use of LR for resuscitation for most patients hospitalized with AP.

### Balanced crystalloids versus saline in noncritically ill adults [^4bd86ae9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study SALT-ED was published by Wesley H Self and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Maintenance fluid therapy and Acute kidney injury. In the SALT-ED study, the trial question was: what is the effect of balanced crystalloids in noncritically ill patients treated with intravenous fluids in the emergency department? In the SALT-ED study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the SALT-ED study, the population was: 13347 patients (6886 female, 6461 male). The inclusion criteria were noncritically ill patients who were treated with intravenous crystalloids in the emergency department and were subsequently hospitalized outside an ICU. The key exclusion criteria were receipt of < 500 mL of crystalloids in the emergency department, age < 18 years, discharge from emergency department. In the SALT-ED study, the interventions were: n = 6708 balanced crystalloids (infusion of lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A) n = 6639 normal saline (infusion of 0.9% saline). In the SALT-ED study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in hospital-free days (25 days vs. 25 days; OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.04). In the SALT-ED study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in the rate of major adverse kidney events within 30 days (4.7% vs. 5.6%; OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.95) No significant difference in stage 2 or higher AKI (8% vs. 8.6%; OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.03) No significant difference in death in the hospital (1.4% vs. 1.6%; OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.16). In the SALT-ED study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death, new RRT, final serum creatinine ≥ 200% of baseline. In the SALT-ED study, the conclusion was: in noncritically ill patients who were treated with intravenous crystalloids in the emergency department and were subsequently hospitalized outside an ICU, balanced crystalloids were not superior to normal saline with respect to a hospital-free days.

For ICU-based studies, the mean or median cumulative amount of fluid administered to patients ranged from 1 to 11.3 l. Most of the ICU-based studies had a low, 1–3 l study fluid exposure. Aforementioned studies contributed 98.7% (19,124/19370) of the ICU-patients in our meta-analysis. Mean or median volumes of more than 7 l were administered in two ICU-based studies, corresponding with 1.3% (246/19370) of included ICU patients in our meta-analysis. For ED-based studies, the mean or median cumulative amount of fluid administered to patients ranged from 1.07 to 10.3 l. A relatively low fluid exposure of 1–3 l was used in one study, corresponding with the majority of patients in our meta-analysis (98.8%; 13,347/13510). Mean or median volumes of 4 l or more were administered in 2 trials that contributed 0.8% (112/13510) of the included ED patients. 0.5% (65/13510) of the ED patients in our meta-analysis received mean or median volumes around 7 l or more. One ED-based study, contributing 0.4% (51/13510) of included ED patients did not report the mean or median cumulative amount of study fluid exposure. Please note that these cut-offs (i.e. 1–3, 4 or 7 l) were made to facilitate comparison with previous meta-analyses and have not yet been adjusted for design effect.

### 0.9% saline versus Ringer's lactate as initial fluid in children with diabetic ketoacidosis: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^1f338dfe]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

The study Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA was published by Ashish Agarwal and colleagues in 2025 in the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetic ketoacidosis and Diabetes mellitus type 1. In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the trial question was: what is the effect of Ringer's lactate in children with T1DM mellitus who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis? In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the population was: 67 patients (44 female, 23 male). The inclusion criteria were children aged 9 months to 12 years with T1DM who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis. The key exclusion criteria were symptomatic cerebral edema; pre-existing/established CKD; underlying liver disorders; inborn errors of metabolism and serum potassium > 5.5 mEq/L at admission. In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the interventions were: n = 33 Ringer's lactate (Ringer's lactate as initial fluid for resuscitation and replacement) n = 34 saline (0.9% saline as initial fluid for resuscitation and replacement). In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in time to resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis (12.9 hours vs. 16.8 hours; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.8). In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in rise in chloride level at 8 hours (4.4 mmol/L vs. 10.8 mmol/L; MD -6.4, 95% CI -10.7 to -2.1) Significant increase in rise in bicarbonate level at 12 hours (14.7 mmol/L vs. 12.9 mmol/L; MD 1.8, 95% CI 0.3 to 3.3) No significant difference in hypokalemia (45.5% vs. 61.8%; RR 0.74, 95% CI -0.34 to 1.82). In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the conclusion was: in children aged 9 months to 12 years with T1DM who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis, Ringer's lactate was superior to saline with respect to time to resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Intraoperative Fluid Management

Balanced versus Saline Crystalloid Solutions

Saline (0.9% sodium chloride; "normal saline") has historically been the most commonly used intravenous crystalloid for intraoperative resuscitation and maintenance fluid therapy; however, physiologically balanced crystalloids, like lactated Ringer's solution, more closely approximate the physiologic levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride found in plasma. Because normal saline has a superphysiologic concentration of chloride (154 mM, compared to 94 to 111 mM in plasma), hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is a known consequence of normal saline administration, but whether this is of any clinical consequence is unresolved.

A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies on the use of balanced versus normal saline in the perioperative period demonstrated (1) uncertain effect on postoperative mortality (low certainty), (2) uncertain effect on need for renal replacement therapy (low certainty), and (3) improved postoperative acid–base status (moderate certainty). Further studies are necessary in specific surgical populations. For example, the Saline versus Lactated Ringer's Solution: The Saline or Lactated Ringer's (SOLAR) trial of elective colorectal and orthopedic surgery patients found no difference in composite postoperative complications or AKI between patients receiving perioperative saline or lactated Ringer's solution. However, balanced crystalloid improved postoperative electrolyte (lower chloride and higher bicarbonate) and acid–base (higher pH) status; the clinical implications of these changes remains unresolved.

This builds upon evidence from the critically ill population, which showed a high probability that using balanced crystalloids reduces AKI compared to saline, although evidence from key randomized trials has been conflicting. Specifically, the Balanced Solutions in Intensive Care Study (BaSICS) did not show a difference in 90-day mortality among critically ill patients bolused with saline compared to balanced solutions. This contrasts with the earlier Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART), which showed balanced crystalloid use resulted in lower rate of death, new renal replacement, or persistent renal dysfunction. Among noncritically ill emergency department patients in the Saline against Lactated Ringer's or Plasma-Lyte in the Emergency Department (SALT-ED) trial, there was no difference in hospital-free days (primary outcome), but there was lower incidence of major adverse kidney events within 30 days (composite of death, new renal replacement therapy, and persistent renal dysfunction).

### Choice of fluid in acute illness: what should be given? An international consensus [^afe605d8]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Fluid management during critical illness is a dynamic process that may be conceptualized as occurring in four phases: rescue, optimization, stabilization, and de-escalation (mobilization). The selection and administration of resuscitation fluids is one component of this complex physiological sequence directed at restoring depleted intravascular volume. Presently, the selection of i.v. fluid is usually dictated more by local practice patterns than by evidence. The debate on fluid choice has primarily focused on evaluating outcome differences between 'crystalloids vs colloids'. More recently, however, there is interest in examining outcome differences based on the chloride content of crystalloid solutions. New insights into the conventional Starling model of microvascular fluid exchange may explain that the efficacy of colloids in restoring and maintaining depleted intravascular volume is only moderately better than crystalloids. A number of investigator-initiated, high-quality, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that modest improvements in short-term physiological endpoints with colloids have not translated into better patient-centred outcomes. In addition, there is substantial evidence that certain types of fluids may independently worsen patient-centred outcomes. These include hydroxyethyl starch and albumin solutions in selected patient populations. There is no evidence to support the use of other colloids. The use of balanced salt solutions in preference to 0.9% saline is supported by the absence of harm in large observational studies. However, there is no compelling randomized trial-based evidence demonstrating improved clinical outcomes with the use of balanced salt solutions compared with 0.9% saline at this time.

### The anion study: effect of different crystalloid solutions on acid base balance, physiology, and survival in a rodent model of acute isovolaemic haemodilution [^89263783]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Editor's key points

- Infusing large volumes of crystalloid solutions to replace fluid can be harmful.
- The composition of the 'ideal' fluid remains elusive.
- Solutions containing acetate, lactate, or chloride were given to rats subjected to removal of blood volume.
- Some differences in acid-base status were seen but outcomes were similar in all groups.
- Composition of resuscitation fluid may be less important than volume.

While many crystalloid solutions are commercially available, none have the tonicity and electrolyte content that exactly matches that found in normal plasma. Two litres of 0.9% saline (n-saline) may produce significant hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis. This may be associated with pathogenic effects such as a decrease in glomerular filtration, disruption of coagulation, and impaired immune function. Conversely, both Hartmann's and Ringer's lactate solutions are hypotonic, with a sodium content well below that of plasma, an osmolarity of 276 mOsm litre −1 and osmolality of 257 mOsm litre −1. This may be unsuitable in patients with intracranial pathology because of an increased risk of cerebral oedemaand can also contribute to hyponatraemia.

Various anion combinations — including lactate, acetate, bicarbonate, gluconate, and malate — have been developed in an attempt to produce satisfactory balanced salt solutions. Infusion of an appropriate solution should cause minimal adverse physiological impact, particularly in the setting of severe haemorrhage and resuscitation. The optimal choice of resuscitation fluid is still a matter of debate. The American College of Surgeons recommends the use of normal saline or Ringer's lactate for initial management of shock, whereas acetate administration is gaining in popularity, particularly in Europe. Though some animal models support the use of balanced solutions over saline, in the treatment of severe haemorrhagic shock, others have been equivocal. A common problem in the design of these studies is that the resuscitation solution volumes were fixed (×3 bled volume). Determination of intravascular volume in the context of haemodynamic instability can be difficult. Under-resuscitation results in hypoperfusion, whereas fluid overloading increases complications. Thus, fluid responsiveness should ideally be based on dynamic indices measured before and after a fluid bolus.

### Balanced crystalloids versus saline in critically ill adults [^8ea55b95]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study SMART-MED and SMART-SURG was published by Semler MW and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock, Traumatic brain injury and Critical illness. In the SMART-MED and SMART-SURG study, the trial question was: what is the effect of balanced crystalloids for intravenous fluid administration in critically ill adult patients? In the SMART-MED and SMART-SURG study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SMART-MED and SMART-SURG study, the population was: 15802 patients (6705 female, 9097 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill adult patients requiring intravenous fluid administration. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years old. In the SMART-MED and SMART-SURG study, the interventions were: n = 7942 balanced crystalloids (either lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A) n = 7860 normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride). In the SMART-MED and SMART-SURG study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the rate of major adverse kidney event within 30 days (14.3% vs. 15.4%; aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99). In the SMART-MED and SMART-SURG study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant increase in in-hospital death at 30 days (10.3% vs. 11.1%;) No significant difference in new RRT (2.5% vs. 2.9%; aOR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.02) No significant difference in persistent renal dysfunction (6.4% vs. 6.6%; aOR 0.96, 96% CI 0.84 to 1.1). In the SMART-MED and SMART-SURG study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in change in creatinine levels, death in the hospital before 60 days. In the SMART-MED and SMART-SURG study, the conclusion was: in critically ill adult patients requiring intravenous fluid administration, balanced crystalloids were superior to normal saline with respect to the rate of major adverse kidney event within 30 days.

### Evaluating the efficacy of different volume resuscitation strategies in acute pancreatitis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^cd98965a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

We were unable to assess the effect of the type of intervention fluid on the study outcomes due to lack of comparative studies. Half of the included studies recruited patients who had received any type of intravenous resuscitation, one fourth exclusively used Lactated Ringer's solution. Although two studies classified patients who had received saline (normal or D5) or Ringer's lactate solution, the, patient outcomes based on the type of fluid administered was not reported. The use of balanced crystalloids in fluid therapy in critically ill patients has been associated with lower mortality rates compared to normal saline.

Furthermore, over half of the included studies had attrition, reporting or other biases which may have contributed to high heterogeneity between studies for clinical outcomes, SIRS persistence, and organ failure persistence.

### Editorial commentary: epinephrine solution in arthroscopic irrigation fluid is marginally superior to intravenous tranexamic acid, but should we focus instead on using Ringer's lactate instead of normal saline for arthroscopic clarity? [^8e128030]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Utilizing a double blinded randomized technique, a matched cohort of shoulder arthroscopic surgeries is compared and evaluated for visual clarity of the surgical field. Epinephrine in a 0.9% saline irrigation solution is marginally superior to an intravenous infusion of tranexamic acid. It is unknown whether 0.9% saline is inferior to a solution of Ringer's lactate irrigation when evaluating loss of clarity due to intraoperative arthroscopic bleeding.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^05487e26]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Are there individual patient populations in which saline should be avoided entirely? Testing types of fluids in subgroups of patients to detect the likelihood of adverse effects would be useful.
2) Are there differences between buffered solutions? Is lactated Ringers superior to acetated/gluconated buffered solution or vice versa?
3) What are the implications of acetate and gluconate contained in some balanced solutions? In cardiac surgery patients, an acetate-based balanced solution had similar hemodynamic effects compared with lactated ringers. However, significant infusion of acetate may contribute to vasoplegia and myocardial dysfunction in patients with kidney dysfunction.
4) Recent data suggest that maintenance fluids and fluids used in diluting drugs may provide significant amount of chloride and have a major impact on fluid balance. Data suggest that selecting sodium/chloride poor maintenance fluids may improve fluid balance and chloride load in postoperative patients, but data in septic patients are still lacking. As such, should chloride containing solutions (including balanced solutions) be minimized or entirely avoided? Notably, this question is especially pertinent given recent instances of supply chain interruption, resulting in shortages of critical fluids and necessitating therapeutic substitutions at the individual patient level.
5) Are the beneficial renal outcomes associated with buffered solutions compared with saline due to the reduction in chloride content? In other words, is chloride toxic in itself, so that toxicity occurs even in absence of obvious hyperchloremia/acidosis (in which condition chloride-free solutions should be favored and saline-based dilution of drugs should be avoided whenever possible) or is it deviation of chloride/pH that generates the toxicity of high volumes of NaCl 0.9% (in which context closer monitoring of these variables may limit the toxicity)? Can lactated sodium solutions serve as a substitute for saline to minimize renal injury?
6) Is albumin superior to buffered crystalloid solutions? If used, when should albumin be administered? Ideally, this comparison of albumin with balanced crystalloid solutions would include subgroups of patients of particular interest (chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis).
7) Should albumin be initiated in an attempt to correct hypoalbuminemia or as a volume replacement fluid? Given the colloidal qualities of albumin, would albumin be of greater benefit in cases of severe shock, necessitating greater amounts of fluid resuscitation? Or should it be used to correct hypoalbuminemia? If there is a benefit to albumin administration as a fluid resuscitation therapy, where does it provide the greatest benefit in light of its cost?
8) What is the optimal concentration of the albumin solution (4–5% or 20%)? Studies of albumin have evaluated various concentrations of albumin. Contingent on its proposed mechanism of benefit in fluid resuscitation (correction of hypoalbuminemia vs intravascular fluid expansion), studies comparing the various albumin concentrations are necessary.
9) Should severity of sepsis play a role in determining which fluid to use for resuscitation? In the continuum of sepsis and septic shock, would patients specifically with more severe forms of shock benefit from a combination approach of crystalloids and colloids to fluid resuscitation?
10) Does resource setting play a role in determining the efficacy of which fluid is chosen? Studies outlined above were performed in resource-intensive environments. Considering data demonstrating that outcomes to fluid resuscitation are disparate between resource-intensive environments and resource-limited environments, it is possible that the type of fluid might also impact outcomes, understanding that fluid choices will likely be significantly more limited in resource \-constrained locations and in the face of unpredictable supply.

### Perioperative buffered versus non-buffered fluid administration for surgery in adults [^d8a4382f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative fluid therapy influences clinical outcomes following major surgery. Fluid preparations may be based on a simple non-buffered salt solution, such as normal saline, or may be modified with bicarbonate or bicarbonate precursor buffers, such as maleate, gluconate, lactate or acetate, to better reflect the human physiological state. These latter fluids have theoretical advantages over normal saline in preventing hyperchloraemic acidosis. A number of clinical studies have now compared fluid preparations with and without a buffer to achieve a balanced electrolyte solution for perioperative fluid resuscitation.

Objectives

To review the safety and efficacy of perioperative administration of buffered versus non-buffered fluids for plasma volume expansion or maintenance in adult patients undergoing surgery.

Search Methods

We electronically searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2011), EMBASE (1980 to May 2011), and CINAHL (1982 to May 2011). We handsearched conference abstracts and where possible, contacted leaders in the field.

Selection Criteria

We only included randomized trials of buffered versus non-buffered intravenous fluids for perioperative fluid resuscitation. The trials with other forms of comparisons such as crystalloids versus colloids and colloids versus different colloids were excluded. We also excluded trials using hypertonic fluids and dextrose-based fluids.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of clinical trials. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. We contacted the trial authors to provide additional information where appropriate. We presented pooled estimates of the dichotomous outcomes as odds ratios (OR) and on continuous outcomes as mean differences, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed data on Review Manager 5.1 using fixed-effect models, and when heterogeneity was high (I² > 40%) random-effect models were used.

Main Results

We identified 14 publications reporting 13 trials or comparisons with a total of 706 participants. For many of the outcomes reported, there was significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity. The primary outcome of mortality at any time was reported in only three studies with a total of 267 patients. The mortality rate was 2.9% for the buffered fluids group and 1.5% for the non-buffered fluids group but this difference was not statistically significant. The Peto OR was 1.85 (95% CI 0.37 to 9.33, P = 0.45, I(2) = 0%). Organ dysfunction was only presented for renal impairment. There was no difference in renal insufficiency leading to renal replacement therapy between the buffered and non-buffered groups (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.63, P = 0.32, I(2) = 0%). Markers of organ system failure as assessed by urine output, creatinine and its variables (for renal function), PaC0(2) (respiratory function) and postoperative nausea and vomiting (gastro-intestinal function) showed a statistically significant difference only in PaC0(2) levels. The mean difference was 1.18 with lower PaC0(2) levels in the non-buffered fluid group (95% CI 0.09 to 2.28, P = 0.03, I(2) = 0%) compared to the buffered fluid group. There was no difference in intraoperative blood loss nor the volumes of intraoperative red cell or fresh frozen plasma transfused between groups. There was an increase in platelet transfusion in the non-buffered group which was statistically significant after analysing the transformed data (log transformation because the data were highly skewed). A number of metabolic differences were noted. There was a difference in postoperative pH of 0.06 units, lower in the non-buffered fluid group (95% CI 0.04 to 0.08, P < 0.00001, I(2) = 74%). However, this difference was not maintained on postoperative day one. The non-buffered fluid group also had significantly greater base deficit, serum sodium and chloride levels. There was no difference demonstrated in length of hospital stay and no data were reported on cost or quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

The administration of buffered fluids to adult patients during surgery is equally safe and effective as the administration of non-buffered saline-based fluids. The use of buffered fluids is associated with less metabolic derangement, in particular hyperchloraemia and metabolic acidosis. Larger studies are needed to assess robust outcomes such as mortality.

### An in vitro study comparing the effects of hextend, hespan, normal saline, and lactated Ringer's solution on thrombelastography and the activated partial thromboplastin time [^6c2c161d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine if 6% HES 450/0.7 (hydroxyethyl starch 450/0.7) in normal saline (Hespan) and 6% HES 450/0.7 in lactated Ringer's solution (Hextend) have the same inhibition of the intrinsic coagulation pathway and platelet function. Multiple studies have suggested that 6% Hespan inhibits coagulation and increases chest tube drainage and transfusion requirements in cardiac surgical patients. There have been few studies of the effects of 6% Hextend, a relatively new plasma volume expander, on coagulation and the results thus far have been mixed.

Design

A prospective in vitro study.

Setting

A large academic medical center.

Participants

Blood was collected from 30 healthy volunteers. Interventions: The blood was fractionated and diluted by 30% with Hextend, Hespan, normal saline, and lactated Ringer's solutions, with a native sample for a control.

Measurements and Main Results

Primary outcome measures were thromboelastography and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). For each of the TEG parameters, there was no difference between samples diluted with Hextend compared with Hespan (p ≥ 0.112 in all cases). APTT did not differ significantly between samples diluted with Hextend compared with Hespan (p = 0.562).

Conclusions

This prospective in vitro study suggests that Hextend and Hespan, hydroxyethyl starch 450/0.7 in different base solutions, exhibit the same effect on platelet function as measured by the TEG.

### Lactate versus acetate buffered intravenous crystalloid solutions: a scoping review [^19d07355]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Buffered crystalloid solutions are increasingly recommended as first-line intravenous resuscitation fluids. However, guidelines do not distinguish between the different types of buffered solutions. The aim of this scoping review was to assess the evidence on the use of lactate- vs acetate-buffered crystalloid solutions and their potential benefits and harms.

Methods

We conducted this scoping review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews. We searched PubMed, Embase, Epistemonikos, and the Cochrane Library for studies assessing the effect of lactate- vs acetate-buffered crystalloid solutions on any outcome in adult hospitalised patients. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Results

We included a total of 29 studies, 25 of which were clinical trials and four were observational studies. Most studies were conducted in surgical settings and indications for use were poorly described. The most commonly administered solutions were Ringer's lactate vs Ringer's acetate or Plasma-Lyte™. Outcomes included acid/base and electrolyte status; haemodynamic variables; and markers of renal and liver function, metabolism, and coagulation. Only a few studies reported patient-centred outcomes. Overall, the data provided no firm evidence for benefit or harm of either solution, and the quantity and quality of evidence were low.

Conclusions

The quantity and quality of evidence on the use of different buffered crystalloid intravenous solutions were low, data were derived primarily from surgical settings, and patient-important outcomes were rarely reported; thus, the balance between benefits and harms between these solutions is largely unknown.

### Perioperative administration of buffered versus non-buffered crystalloid intravenous fluid to improve outcomes following adult surgical procedures [^38179960]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative fluid strategies influence clinical outcomes following major surgery. Many intravenous fluid preparations are based on simple solutions, such as normal saline, that feature an electrolyte composition that differs from that of physiological plasma. Buffered fluids have a theoretical advantage of containing a substrate that acts to maintain the body's acid-base status - typically a bicarbonate or a bicarbonate precursor such as maleate, gluconate, lactate, or acetate. Buffered fluids also provide additional electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium, and calcium, more closely matching the electrolyte balance of plasma. The putative benefits of buffered fluids have been compared with those of non-buffered fluids in the context of clinical studies conducted during the perioperative period. This review was published in 2012, and was updated in 2017.

Objectives

To review effects of perioperative intravenous administration of buffered versus non-buffered fluids for plasma volume expansion or maintenance, or both, on clinical outcomes in adults undergoing all types of surgery.

Search Methods

We electronically searched the Clinicaltrials.gov major trials registry, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1966 to June 2016), Embase (1980 to June 2016), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to June 2016). We handsearched conference abstracts and, when possible, contacted leaders in the field. We reran the search in May 2017. We added one potential new study of interest to the list of 'Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate this trial into formal review findings when we prepare the review update.

Selection Criteria

Only randomized controlled trials that compared buffered versus non-buffered intravenous fluids for surgical patients were eligible for inclusion. We excluded other forms of comparison such as crystalloids versus colloids and colloids versus different colloids.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened references for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We resolved disagreements by discussion and consensus, in collaboration with a third review author. We contacted trial authors to request additional information when appropriate. We presented pooled estimates for dichotomous outcomes as odds ratios (ORs) and for continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed data via Review Manager 5.3 using fixed-effect models, and when heterogeneity was high (I² > 40%), we used random-effects models.

Main Results

This review includes, in total, 19 publications of 18 randomized controlled trials with a total of 1096 participants. We incorporated five of those 19 studies (330 participants) after the June 2016 update. Outcome measures in the included studies were thematically similar, covering perioperative electrolyte status, renal function, and acid-base status; however, we found significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity among the included studies. We identified variable protocols for fluid administration and total volumes of fluid administered to patients intraoperatively. Trial authors variably reported outcome data at disparate time points and with heterogeneous patient groups. Consequently, many outcome measures are reported in small group sizes, reducing overall confidence in effect size, despite relatively low inherent bias in the included studies. Several studies reported orphan outcome measures. We did not include in the results of this review one large, ongoing study of saline versus Ringer's solution. We found insufficient evidence on effects of fluid therapies on mortality and postoperative organ dysfunction (defined as renal insufficiency leading to renal replacement therapy); confidence intervals were wide and included both clinically relevant benefit and harm: mortality (Peto OR 1.85, 95% CI 0.37 to 9.33; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 6 deaths, 276 participants; low-quality evidence); renal insufficiency (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.98; I² = 0%; 4 trials, 22 events, 276 participants; low-quality evidence). We noted several metabolic differences, including a difference in postoperative pH measured at end of surgery of 0.05 units - lower in the non-buffered fluid group (12 studies with a total of 720 participants; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.07; I² = 61%). However, this difference was not maintained on postoperative day one. We rated the quality of evidence for this outcome as moderate. We observed a higher postoperative serum chloride level immediately after operation, with use of non-buffered fluids reported in 10 studies with a total of 530 participants (MD 6.77 mmol/L, 95% CI 3.38 to 10.17), and this difference persisted until day one postoperatively (five studies with a total of 258 participants; MD 8.48 mmol/L, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.88). We rated the quality of evidence for this outcome as moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence is insufficient to show effects of perioperative administration of buffered versus non-buffered crystalloid fluids on mortality and organ system function in adult patients following surgery. Benefits of buffered fluid were measurable in biochemical terms, particularly a significant reduction in postoperative hyperchloraemia and metabolic acidosis. Small effect sizes for biochemical outcomes and lack of correlated clinical follow-up data mean that robust conclusions on major morbidity and mortality associated with buffered versus non-buffered perioperative fluid choices are still lacking. Larger studies are needed to assess these relevant clinical outcomes.

### Comparison of bicarbonate Ringer's solution with lactated Ringer's solution among postoperative outcomes in patients with laparoscopic right hemihepatectomy: a single-centre randomised controlled trial [^40ef88e5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Currently, LRS and normal saline are the most commonly used intra-operative crystalloid solutions. Yet, harmful effects of hyperchloric acidosis after normal saline infusion to liver donors have been reported. LRS contains 28 mmol L –1 of lactate with pH 6.5 and has been selected as the preferred perioperative extracellular fluid replacement. However, the metabolism of LAC to bicarbonate mainly depends on liver function. Therefore, the addition of exogenous LAC may increase its concentration when the liver function is impaired after hepatectomy. In contrast, BRS is a balanced crystalloid solution containing physiological concentrations of bicarbonate and electrolyte ions. Bicarbonate ions in BRS could be directly combined with surplus hydrogen ions in the body without liver metabolism, correcting metabolic acidosis without increasing the burden on the liver. Studies have shown that BRS could significantly correct acid-base imbalance compared with other crystalloid solutions.

The hypothesis tested in this study was based on a previous report where a lactate-free crystalloid solution showed better results than the LRS solution in LAC and BE during hepatectomy. In subsequent clinical trials, BRS improved LAC metabolism and maintained acid-base balance in individuals with extreme multiple traumas and traumatic shock and reduced the risk of related complications. While earlier, Satoh et al. used rabbit model and found that BRS was the most effective perioperative solution for the treatment of metabolic acidosis and plasma electrolyte balance in partially hepatectomised animals when compared with other crystalloid solutions. Recently, Wang et al. investigated the effectiveness of BRS in traumatised adult male New Zealand rabbits and found that the BRS could reduce the extent of elevated LAC concentrations and markedly correct the acid-base imbalance in hemorrhagic shocked rabbits. In our study, pH, BE and HCO 3 − levels decreased with an increase in concentration in group LRS at 2 h after the operation began, while no significant differences were observed in the BRS group. Moreover, in the LRS group, LAC remained elevated until the end of operation and 2 h post-operation, while in the BRS group it was at lower side. It indicates that the administration of BRS can correct intraoperative and postoperative metabolic acidosis in the patients encountering laparoscopic right hemihepatectomy.

### Effects of plasma-lyte A, lactated ringer' s, and normal saline on acid-base status and intestine injury in the initial treatment of hemorrhagic shock [^fd38c5e6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Several kinds of crystalloid solutions have been used in the treatment of hemorrhagic shock (HS). Clinicians are faced with how to select the resuscitation fluids. The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of 3 crystalloid solutions, such as normal saline (NS), lactated Ringer's (LR), and Plasma-lyte A (PA), on acid-base status and intestine injury in rats subjected to HS.

Methods

Thirty Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups. The sham group had no blood withdrawal. The other groups were subjected to severe HS and then injected with NS, LR, or PA. All treatments were followed with an infusion of red blood cell suspension. The mean arterial pressure was monitored throughout the experiment. The arterial blood gas, malonaldehyde, and myeloperoxidase levels in the small intestine were assayed 120 minutes after resuscitation.

Results

Plasma-lyte A treatment could restore the pH, base excess (BE), HCO 3 -, Pao 2, and Paco 2. Comparing with sham group, NS failed to correct the decreased pH, BE, and HCO 3 - (P < .05), whereas LR treatment showed the decreased BE and HCO 3 - (P < .05) and increased Pao 2 (P < .05). There were no significant differences in malonaldehyde among the 4 groups (P > .05). Both PA and LR were more effective than NS in decreasing the myeloperoxidase level in the small intestine (P < .01).

Conclusions

Although the 3 crystalloid solutions play different roles, PA is better at correcting the acid-base balance and improving intestine injury during HS than NS and LR.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^d6cac3a6]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury — Class 3 evidence regarding mannitol and hypertonic saline is outlined, noting that of the three Class 3 studies maintained from the 3rd Edition, one compared hypertonic saline (2% to 3%) to normal saline (0.9%), one compared hypertonic saline to lactated ringers, and one compared mannitol to barbiturates, and because these are single, Class 3 studies, they were not used to support a recommendation. The additional studies from the 3rd Edition supporting Level III recommendations were descriptive, non-comparative studies that provided a basic understanding of mechanisms and effects of mannitol but did not provide definitive evidence about comparative effectiveness or different regimens of administration, and as these studies were not comparative, they were not included in this edition.

### Balanced crystalloids versus saline in the intensive care unit. the SALT randomized trial [^e1340aab]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

Saline is the intravenous fluid most commonly administered to critically ill adults, but it may be associated with acute kidney injury and death. Whether use of balanced crystalloids rather than saline affects patient outcomes remains unknown.

Objectives

To pilot a cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial using software tools within the electronic health record to compare saline to balanced crystalloids.

Methods

This was a cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial among 974 adults admitted to a tertiary medical intensive care unit from February 3, 2015 to May 31, 2015. The intravenous crystalloid used in the unit alternated monthly between saline (0.9% sodium chloride) and balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A). Enrollment, fluid delivery, and data collection were performed using software tools within the electronic health record. The primary outcome was the difference between study groups in the proportion of isotonic crystalloid administered that was saline. The secondary outcome was major adverse kidney events within 30 days (MAKE30), a composite of death, dialysis, or persistent renal dysfunction.

Measurements and Main Results

Patients assigned to saline (n = 454) and balanced crystalloids (n = 520) were similar at baseline and received similar volumes of crystalloid by 30 days (median [interquartile range]: 1,424 mL [500–3,377] vs. 1,617 mL [500–3,628]; P = 0.40). Saline made up a larger proportion of the isotonic crystalloid given in the saline group than in the balanced crystalloid group (91% vs. 21%; P < 0.001). MAKE30 did not differ between groups (24.7% vs. 24.6%; P = 0.98).

Conclusions

An electronic health record-embedded, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial comparing saline with balanced crystalloids can produce well-balanced study groups and separation in crystalloid receipt. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 02345486).

### Choice of fluids in critically ill patients [^77755d3f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Types of fluids

The following section discusses the characteristics of most existing fluid solutions. The chemical composition of many of the solutions currently on the market is presented in Table 1.

Table 1
The chemical composition of commonly used intravenous fluid solutions

a Strong Ion Difference

Crystalloids

Given the current controversy surrounding administration of colloids, crystalloids have prudently been selected as the first choice for fluid resuscitation. Unbalanced crystalloid solutions (i.e. saline solutions) typically contain high concentrations of sodium-chloride and have a pH that is lower than 6.0. In this sense, the term "normal" saline is a misnomer. The characteristics of saline solutions depend on their salt concentration (0.9, 0.45, 3% etc.). Balanced crystalloid solutions (e.g. Ringer's lactate, Plasma-Lyte, Isofundine) are buffered by anions other than chloride. The chloride concentrations of balanced solutions therefore more closely approximate plasma but their osmolality is lower and they contain alternative anions in non-physiological concentrations. Lactate-buffered fluids are the least costly in this fluid category.

Crystalloids, chloride concentrations and renal failure

The concentration of chloride in 0.9% saline solution exceeds that of plasma (154 mEq/L). Experimental studies have shown that high renal tubular chloride concentrations induce renal afferent vasoconstriction with a resultant decrease in renal blood flow and GFR. No similar effect has been observed with relation to elevated sodium concentrations. Moreover, canine models demonstrate that when accompanied by hypovolemia, the reduction in renal blood flow doubles compared to euvolemia. In humans, administration of isotonic saline has been shown to cause hyperchloremic acidosis in both non critically ill and critically ill patients. In healthy human volunteers, administration of intravenous 0.9% saline has also been shown to decrease renal blood flow velocity and renal cortical tissue perfusion when compared to a balanced solution (e.g. plasma-lyte 148).

Summary statements:
Animal and human studies demonstrate that high renal tubular chloride concentrations induce renal afferent vasoconstriction with a resultant decrease in renal blood flow.
Given that the availability and cost of saline and balanced crystalloids are not significantly different, saline should probably no longer be used for intravascular volume expansion.

### Kinetics of isotonic and hypertonic plasma volume expanders [^a19c3907]. Anesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Major differences in plasma volume expansion between infusion fluids are fairly well known, but there is a lack of methods that express their dynamic properties. Therefore, a closer description enabled by kinetic modeling is presented.

Methods

Ten healthy male volunteers received, on different occasions, a constant-rate intravenous infusion over 30 min consisting of 25 ml/kg of 0.9% saline, lactated Ringer's solution, acetated Ringer's solution, 5 ml/kg of 7.5% saline, or 3 ml/kg of 7.5% saline in 6% dextran. One-, two-, and three-volume kinetic models were fitted to the dilution of the total venous hemoglobin concentration over 240 min. Osmotic fluid shifts were considered when hypertonic fluid was infused.

Results

All fluids induced plasma dilution, which decreased exponentially after the infusions. The ratio of the area under the dilution-time curve and the infused fluid volume showed the following average plasma-dilution dose-effect (efficiency), using 0.9% saline as the reference (= 1): lactated Ringer's solution, 0.88; acetated Ringer's solution, 0.91; hypertonic saline, 3.97; and hypertonic saline in dextran, 7.22 ("area approach"). Another comparison, based on kinetic analysis and simulation, showed that the strength of the respective fluids to dilute the plasma by 20% within 30 min was 0.94, 0.97, 4.44, and 6.15 ("target dilution approach"). Between-subject variability was approximately half as high for the latter approach.

Conclusions

The relative efficiency of crystalloid infusion fluids differs depending on whether the entire dilution-time profile or only the maximum dilution is compared. Kinetic analysis and simulation is a useful tool for the study of such differences.

### Terminology used to describe volume expanding resuscitation fluid [^e88cc254]. Resuscitation (2006). Low credibility.

Many published reports state that the type of resuscitation fluid to be used for volume expansion should be "isotonic crystalloid" or "isotonic fluid". Generally, this terminology refers to normal saline (NS) and lactated Ringer's (LR) solution. This terminology is suboptimal technically since not all "isotonic" crystalloids are sufficient volume expanders. A total of 48 reference books from the areas of general pediatrics, pediatric emergency medicine, emergency medicine, pediatric critical care, pediatric surgery, general surgery, internal medicine, family medicine, adult critical care, obstetrics and gynecology, endocrinology, and life support course manuals were reviewed. The description of fluids for hypovolemic shock, trauma, and diabetic ketoacidosis resuscitation was accurate in 46% of the time.

### Balanced crystalloids versus saline in noncritically ill adults [^6cb9abb4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Comparative clinical effects of balanced crystalloids and saline are uncertain, particularly in noncritically ill patients cared for outside an intensive care unit (ICU).

Methods

We conducted a single-center, pragmatic, multiple-crossover trial comparing balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A) with saline among adults who were treated with intravenous crystalloids in the emergency department and were subsequently hospitalized outside an ICU. The type of crystalloid that was administered in the emergency department was assigned to each patient on the basis of calendar month, with the entire emergency department crossing over between balanced crystalloids and saline monthly during the 16-month trial. The primary outcome was hospital-free days (days alive after discharge before day 28). Secondary outcomes included major adverse kidney events within 30 days - a composite of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (defined as an elevation of the creatinine level to ≥ 200% of baseline) - all censored at hospital discharge or 30 days, whichever occurred first.

Results

A total of 13,347 patients were enrolled, with a median crystalloid volume administered in the emergency department of 1079 mL and 88.3% of the patients exclusively receiving the assigned crystalloid. The number of hospital-free days did not differ between the balanced-crystalloids and saline groups (median, 25 days in each group; adjusted odds ratio with balanced crystalloids, 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92 to 1.04; P = 0.41). Balanced crystalloids resulted in a lower incidence of major adverse kidney events within 30 days than saline (4.7% vs. 5.6%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.95; P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Among noncritically ill adults treated with intravenous fluids in the emergency department, there was no difference in hospital-free days between treatment with balanced crystalloids and treatment with saline.

### The ten pitfalls of lactate clearance in sepsis [^4a706c4e]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactate concentration in resuscitation fluids

Intravenous administration of lactated Ringer's solution does not seem to increase circulating lactate concentrations in hemodynamically stable adults, nor worsen metabolic acidosis during an infusion of 1 L in 60 min. Only when infusing large volumes (180 mL/kg/h) do lactate levels rise significantly. On the contrary, the buffering effect of Ringer's solution, with a more physiologic strong anion difference, might have a positive effect on blood pH.

### Comparison of bicarbonate Ringer's solution with lactated Ringer's solution among postoperative outcomes in patients with laparoscopic right hemihepatectomy: a single-centre randomised controlled trial [^efbad80f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Therefore, the primary goal of the current study was to investigate LAC concentration in the patients' groups receiving either LRS or BRS during and after surgery. Previously, in mice model, bicarbonate ringer's solution appeared as more effective during resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock and could protect various organs as compared to normal saline. Bicarbonate in BRS is similar to the body's buffering system and can provide an alkalinizing effect when used as a resuscitating agent. It can address the problem the body faces during metabolic acidosis. The other electrolytes including sodium ion, potassium ion, calcium ion, magnesium ion and chloride ion also mimic the natural chemistry of body fluids.

The data of this first prospective randomised study found that LRS could slightly increase lactic acid concentration from 2 h intraoperative to the day after the operation and accordingly worsen postoperative outcomes in laparoscopic right hemihepatectomy. The reasons for the elevated lactic acid concentration in laparoscopic right hemihepatectomy can be attributed to the fact that the liver is the main site of LAC metabolism that can clear 70% of LAC by converting it into glycogen. Therefore, most patients experience transient hepatic insufficiency during major hepatectomy which may lead to hyperlactatemia. Moreover, special surgical and anaesthetic techniques employed in hepatectomy, such as long periods of carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum, the length of the operation, liver parenchyma injury, hepatic portal occlusion techniques, infusing lactate-containing solution and blood loss may also cause hyperlactatemia condition. Also, the intraoperative release of adrenaline and amylin which has been found to stimulate LAC production. Therefore, patients receiving right hemihepatectomy treatment suffer with insufficient lactate metabolism and increased lactate production, which lead to increased postoperative lactate levels.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^88631e76]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Overall, hyperchloremic acidosis was associated with mortality similar to that of the non-acidotic group (29% versus 26%; p = NS). This is perhaps a reassuring finding because many cases of hyperchloremic acidosis are iatrogenic – due to the administration of saline-based intravenous fluids – and can mostly be avoided by resuscitating with a more balanced solution such as lactated Ringer's. However, our methods do not permit us to disentangle the potentially adverse effects of saline-induced acidosis from the potential advantages of fluid administration. Indeed, given that our cohort was that of suspected lactic acidosis, fluid administration might have reversed shock in some patients at the expense of hyperchloremic acidosis. In this way, saline resuscitation might also have converted some patients with hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidosis into hyperchloremia. Against this hypothesis are numerous observations that lactic acidosis in ICU patients usually does not reflect hypoperfusion. However, we did not exclude patients whose worst ABG was drawn before ICU admission (though only patients admitted to the ICU were included) and thus our cohort may have included some patients with shock and lactic acidosis and other patients with saline-induced acidosis after resuscitation. Our database does not permit us to test this hypothesis directly and furthermore our sample size, although relatively large, is still insufficient to exclude a clinically significant effect of hyperchloremia on mortality. It is important to keep in mind that chloride is a strong anion and, with regards to plasma, the addition of normal saline increases the value from baseline of chloride more than that of sodium. This change in the ratio of sodium to chloride is what is important. The increase in chloride relative to that of sodium decreases SID, resulting in a decrease in the alkalinity of blood. In this sense, chloride must always be interpreted with the sodium level because they both change with regard to the patient's volume status and the composition of intravenous fluids.

### Trial of normal saline versus Ringer's lactate in… [^5c561184]. ClinicalTrials (2012). Low credibility.

The difference in serum sodium change over 24 hours between patients receiving NS versus RL
- The difference in serum pH
- The difference serum chloride
- The differences in serum bicarbonate.
- The differences in serum pH, chloride, and bicarbonate
- The differences in serum inflammatory biomarker changes over 24 hours for the type of resuscitation fluid. Background: Trauma is a major cause of death in children and teenagers. When young patients have suffered major traumatic injuries, they require intravenous fluids to keep their blood vessels full and ensure blood flow to vital organs. Current fluid guidelines by International Trauma Committees recommend either Normal Saline or Ringer's Lactate as the fluid of choice for these patients.

Although these solutions share some similarities in their composition, there are also some significant differences in sodium, chloride and lactate concentrations. Despite these differences in fluid composition, there has never been a study comparing these two fluids in paediatric trauma patients to determine which is optimal. In this study, the investigators aim to determine the optimal fluid choice for trauma resuscitation of young patients. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that severely injured paediatric trauma patients resuscitated with NS will have optimal blood sodium levels compared to patients resuscitated with RL. Methods: The investigators will study 50 paediatric trauma patients that will be randomized so that half will randomly receive NS and half will receive RL as their only iv fluid for 24 hours.

After 24 hours, the investigators will compare in blood the sodium level, the amount of acid, and the concentrations of inflammation molecules in relation to those whom received NS versus RL. Expected Results and Significance: Maintaining optimal levels of these biochemical markers is imperative in reducing morbidity and mortality in severely injured paediatric patients. If significant differences are present, the investigators will be able to determine which fluid is preferred and expect these data to complement current trauma resuscitation guidelines. Detailed Description Background: ATLS recommends the use of either intravenous Normal Saline or Ringer's Lactate in trauma fluid resuscitation. There are currently no recommendations or any studies to suggest which of these two fluids are more appropriate for pediatric trauma patients and their ionic compositions do differ. As such, both solutions have potential benefits and potential complications.

There are three primary issues that relate to choice of solution.
- **Sodium concentration and risk of iatrogenic hyponatremia**: NS has higher sodium content relative to RL. Maintenance of a normal or slightly elevated sodium level in paediatric trauma patients is often imperative, given that the vast majority of these patients have significant traumatic brain injury. Hyponatremia can worsen cerebral edema and increase intracranial pressure. In a previous study conducted by us at Children's Hospital, LHSC we reported that paediatric trauma patients in our centre received NS. Despite NS used as the resuscitation fluid, pediatric trauma patients all showed a trend towards low-normal levels of sodium in their blood. Given the lower content of sodium in RL, we question whether NS is superior for maintenance of blood sodium.

### Pragmatic pediatric trial of balanced versus normal saline fluid in sepsis: the PRoMPT BOLUS randomized controlled trial pilot feasibility study [^24f4e64c]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Resuscitation with crystalloid fluid is a cornerstone of pediatric septic shock treatment. However, the optimal type of crystalloid fluid is unknown. We aimed to determine the feasibility of conducting a pragmatic randomized trial to compare balanced (lactated Ringer's [LR]) with 0.9% normal saline (NS) fluid resuscitation in children with suspected septic shock.

Methods

Open-label pragmatic randomized controlled trial at a single academic children's hospital from January to August 2018. Eligible patients were > 6 months to < 18 years old who were treated in the emergency department for suspected septic shock, operationalized as blood culture, parenteral antibiotics, and fluid resuscitation for abnormal perfusion. Screening, enrollment, and randomization were carried out by the clinical team as part of routine care. Patients were randomized to receive either LR or NS for up to 48 hours following randomization. Other than fluid type, all treatment decisions were at the clinical team's discretion. Feasibility outcomes included proportion of eligible patients enrolled, acceptability of enrollment via the U.S. federal exception from informed consent (EFIC) regulations, and adherence to randomized study fluid administration.

Results

Of 59 eligible patients, 50 (85%) were enrolled and randomized. Twenty-four were randomized to LR and 26 to NS. Only one (2%) of 44 patients enrolled using EFIC withdrew before study completion. Total median (interquartile range [IQR]) crystalloid fluid volume received during the intervention window was 107 (60 to 155) mL/kg and 98 (63 to 128) mL/kg in the LR and NS arms, respectively (p = 0.50). Patients randomized to LR received a median (IQR) of only 20% (13 to 32) of all study fluid as NS compared to 99% (64% to 100%) of study fluid as NS in the NS arm (absolute difference = 79%, 95% CI = 48% to 85%).

Conclusions

A pragmatic study design proved feasible to study comparative effectiveness of LR versus NS fluid resuscitation for pediatric septic shock.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^0adfb0bb]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury — hyperosmolar therapy comparative effectiveness evidence is limited to one Class 2 retrospective cohort study and two Class 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The Class 2 study was insufficient for a Level II recommendation and the low-quality trials were not sufficient to support a Level III recommendation; given that larger observational studies or an RCT have the potential to produce different results, no Level II or Level III recommendation is made at this time. Three Class 3 studies from the 3rd Edition compared hypertonic saline with normal saline, hypertonic saline with Lactated Ringers, and mannitol with barbiturates, and none provided sufficient evidence to support a recommendation.

### Balanced crystalloids versus saline in critically ill adults [^e6118be9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Both balanced crystalloids and saline are used for intravenous fluid administration in critically ill adults, but it is not known which results in better clinical outcomes.

Methods

In a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial conducted in five intensive care units at an academic center, we assigned 15,802 adults to receive saline (0.9% sodium chloride) or balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A) according to the randomization of the unit to which they were admitted. The primary outcome was a major adverse kidney event within 30 days - a composite of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (defined as an elevation of the creatinine level to ≥ 200% of baseline) - all censored at hospital discharge or 30 days, whichever occurred first.

Results

Among the 7942 patients in the balanced-crystalloids group, 1139 (14.3%) had a major adverse kidney event, as compared with 1211 of 7860 patients (15.4%) in the saline group (marginal odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84 to 0.99; conditional odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.99; P = 0.04). In-hospital mortality at 30 days was 10.3% in the balanced-crystalloids group and 11.1% in the saline group (P = 0.06). The incidence of new renal-replacement therapy was 2.5% and 2.9%, respectively (P = 0.08), and the incidence of persistent renal dysfunction was 6.4% and 6.6%, respectively (P = 0.60).

Conclusions

Among critically ill adults, the use of balanced crystalloids for intravenous fluid administration resulted in a lower rate of the composite outcome of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction than the use of saline.

### Normal saline versus Ringer's lactate for initial fluid… [^a5528083]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview This clinical trial aims to determine if the type of intravenous fluid used for initial resuscitation affects the short-term outcomes of adult patients with sepsis who are treated in the emergency department. The main questions it aims to answer are: Does using Ringer's lactate instead of 0. 9% sodium chloride reduce 24-hour mortality in patients with sepsis. Does the type of fluid influence other short-term outcomes, such as the need for vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, and length of hospital stay. Researchers will compare two groups of participants:

- The Ringer's lactate group
- The 0. 9% sodium chloride group. Participants will:

- Receive either Ringer's lactate or normal saline for initial fluid resuscitation as part of standard sepsis care.
- They will be observed for 24 hours to assess survival and other early outcomes.

This prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial aims to compare the effects of Ringer's lactate and 0. 9% sodium chloride solutions for initial fluid resuscitation in adult patients with sepsis who are treated in the emergency department. The study is conducted in accordance with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's 2021 guidelines, which emphasize the importance of early and adequate crystalloid resuscitation in sepsis management. Although both solutions are widely used in clinical practice, evidence regarding their comparative effects on short-term mortality and organ dysfunction is inconsistent. This study seeks to provide prospective, blinded data to clarify whether fluid type influences early outcomes in patients with sepsis. Participants who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1: 1 ratio using a computer-generated sequence prepared by an independent staff member.

To ensure blinding, study fluids will be provided in identical coded containers, and patients, treating clinicians, and investigators will remain unaware of the assigned fluid type throughout the study period. The assigned study fluid will be administered intravenously as an initial bolus according to clinical judgment. After completion of the initial bolus, all subsequent fluid therapy and additional treatments will follow standard institutional practice at the discretion of the treating physician. If clinical circumstances require breaking the study blind for patient safety reasons, the investigator will document the reason and unblind the allocation. There will be no delay in clinical management as a result of study participation. Other: Ringer's Lactate Other: Normal Saline
