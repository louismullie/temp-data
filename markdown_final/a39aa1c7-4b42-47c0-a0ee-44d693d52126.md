## Question

Are there any frustrations during systematu approach search?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the frustrations encountered during a systematic approach to searching the medical literature and how to mitigate them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core frustrations that repeatedly emerge across sources. Then, I should verify which of these are most impactful and why. Next, I will examine practical mitigation strategies, including where AI and expert input fit. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, grounded answer that acknowledges trade-offs and uncertainties [^notfound].

> Let me first confirm the major frustration categories. Across reviews and methodological papers, the recurring pain points are: 1) information overload and the exponential growth of literature, 2) search strategy design and execution, 3) screening and selection burden, 4) heterogeneity and data extraction challenges, 5) methodological rigor versus resource constraints, and 6) keeping reviews up to date; I should double-check that these align with PRISMA and contemporary guidance before proceeding [^113TuAFh] [^111ejSHD] [^1117KBNT].

> I will now examine information overload. The volume of biomedical literature is staggering, with PubMed exceeding 35 million records and growing, which makes it easy to miss relevant studies and hard to know when to stop; wait, let me verify the magnitude — yes, that figure is consistent with recent AI-assisted search work and is echoed in reviews noting the exponential growth that outpaces human processing capacity [^113TuAFh] [^1144vGRf].

> Next, I should review search strategy frustrations. Many clinicians lack formal training in database searching, and crafting sensitive, precise queries across multiple databases with MeSH, synonyms, and Boolean logic is nontrivial; hold on, I should verify whether peer review of strategies improves retrieval — PRISMA guidance and empirical work suggest it does, yet many reviews still underreport or omit full strategies, hampering replication and quality assessment [^111ejSHD] [^111rojgP] [^111iUGD6].

> Let me consider screening and selection. Large, noisy result sets impose a heavy manual burden; even with dual independent screening, the process is time-consuming and error-prone, and the lack of standardized, validated pediatric filters is a concrete example of a broader problem — wait, I should confirm that pediatric search filters exist and are underused; yes, validated filters exist but are inconsistently applied, contributing to missed pediatric studies [^113KgJYC] [^114un3mK].

> I need to check heterogeneity and data extraction issues. Variability in populations, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and reporting standards complicates synthesis; I initially thought "this precludes meta-analysis in most cases", but wait, that overstates it — heterogeneity often necessitates subgrouping, sensitivity analyses, or alternative synthesis methods rather than outright preclusion, though in some contexts (e.g., implementation science, ethics) heterogeneity is so profound that pooled estimates are not meaningful [^1136qJ7s] [^114bzxDn] [^115FJojG].

> Hold on, I should verify the rigor versus resources trade-off. PRISMA and Cochrane methods demand comprehensive searches, dual screening, risk-of-bias appraisal, and GRADE, yet time and staffing constraints push teams toward shortcuts; rapid review guidance acknowledges this tension and recommends investing upfront in planning and targeted sources to reduce downstream workload, but even with planning, living reviews and guideline updates remain resource intensive [^114Dg6aM] [^114un3mK] [^1117KBNT].

> Next, I should review currency and update challenges. Evidence evolves quickly; traditional static reviews risk obsolescence, and while living systematic reviews address this, they require sustained infrastructure and governance; I should confirm that even major guideline programs piloted living approaches and then scaled back due to cost — yes, ASH's experience illustrates both the value and the resource demands of living guidelines [^1117KBNT] [^112soeT6].

> Let me synthesize the most impactful frustrations. The triad of information overload, search strategy complexity, and screening burden consistently emerges as the highest-yield pain points; these upstream issues cascade into downstream problems with heterogeneity handling, reproducibility, and timeliness, so interventions that improve query design, retrieval precision, and screening efficiency are likely to have outsized impact on review quality and feasibility [^113TuAFh] [^111ejSHD] [^114un3mK].

> I should now examine mitigation strategies. Partnering with an information specialist improves sensitivity and precision; peer review of search strategies increases retrieval; validated filters and taxonomies reduce noise; and AI-assisted tools like TrialMind can augment query generation and recall, though they require human oversight to avoid hallucination and drift; wait, let me verify the human-in-the-loop point — recent AI perspectives emphasize verification, referencing, and expert oversight as essential safeguards [^111rojgP] [^113KgJYC] [^113TuAFh] [^112cqWp1].

> But wait, what about pragmatic compromises in complex fields? In areas with heterogeneous terminology (e.g., quality improvement, empirical bioethics), teams should document reflexivity, use multidisciplinary adjudication, and publish protocols and supplementary materials to expose methodological choices; I should confirm that expert consultation and snowballing can rescue missed studies — yes, these are recommended tactics when database indexing is inconsistent [^115c1aKh] [^112edSbH] [^1158ck2F].

> I need to ensure we address updating. Living approaches are ideal for rapidly evolving topics but require governance; a more feasible middle ground is annual monitoring with librarian-led refresh of searches for new RCTs and systematic reviews, as piloted by ASH; I should double-check that this balances timeliness with sustainability — ASH's experience supports this model for most guidelines [^1117KBNT] [^112soeT6].

> In summary, the dominant frustrations during systematic literature searching are the volume of evidence, the technical demands of building reproducible, comprehensive search strategies, and the labor-intensive screening that follows; these are amplified by heterogeneity, reporting variability, and the need to keep reviews current. Mitigation hinges on expert-librarian collaboration, peer-reviewed search strategies, validated filters, transparent documentation, and judicious use of AI augmentation with human oversight, recognizing that some compromises are inevitable and should be made explicit to preserve scientific integrity [^111rojgP] [^114un3mK] [^113TuAFh] [^112cqWp1].

Systematic approaches to literature search are often frustrated by **information overload** from the sheer volume of publications [^112EAzf7], **poorly defined search terms** that miss relevant studies, and **database limitations** such as incomplete indexing and lack of access [^111ejSHD]. Additional pain points include **time constraints** that force rushed or incomplete searches [^113kZBE2], **lack of standardized terminology** causing inconsistent indexing [^113DTpXw], and **limited reproducibility** due to inadequate documentation of search strategies [^111rojgP]. These issues can lead to **biased or incomplete evidence synthesis** and reduce confidence in conclusions [^115veAjn] [^112soeT6].

---

## Information overload and volume of literature

The **exponential growth** of medical literature creates a vast volume of publications, making it difficult to identify relevant studies efficiently [^1144vGRf]. This overload can lead to **missed relevant studies** because reviewers may overlook important papers, especially when searches are too broad or poorly targeted [^113TuAFh].

---

## Poorly defined search terms and strategies

- **Ambiguous terminology**: Inconsistent or ambiguous terminology across studies and databases can result in imprecise search queries, leading to irrelevant results or missed studies [^113DTpXw].

- **Lack of standardized terminology**: The absence of standardized indexing terms (e.g. MeSH) can complicate search strategy development and reduce retrieval effectiveness [^113j2qqY].

---

## Database limitations and access issues

- **Incomplete indexing**: Not all relevant studies are adequately indexed in databases, leading to incomplete retrieval [^113j2qqY].

- **Access restrictions**: Limited access to full-text articles or subscription-based databases can hinder comprehensive literature retrieval [^111iUGD6].

- **Database variability**: Differences in database coverage and indexing practices necessitate searching multiple databases, increasing complexity and workload [^114bjECu].

---

## Time constraints and resource limitations

Time constraints often force reviewers to **rush searches**, compromising thoroughness and accuracy [^114un3mK]. Limited access to experienced librarians or information specialists can also degrade search quality [^116VcLUk]. Additionally, **resource constraints** — including limited funding, personnel, and technological resources — can impede comprehensive searches [^111iUGD6].

---

## Lack of standardized terminology and indexing

Inconsistent indexing arises when studies are indexed differently across databases, complicating search strategy development and reducing retrieval effectiveness [^111iUGD6]. The **absence of universal standards** for terminology and indexing further exacerbates these difficulties.

---

## Limited reproducibility and transparency

Inadequate documentation of search strategies limits reproducibility and transparency, complicating replication or validation of reviews [^111rojgP]. Peer review of search strategies is often lacking, reducing the reliability and comprehensiveness of searches [^111rojgP].

---

## Impact on evidence synthesis and clinical decision-making

These frustrations can lead to **biased or incomplete evidence synthesis**, ultimately affecting clinical decision-making and patient care [^115veAjn]. They also erode confidence in findings, reducing trust in systematic reviews and their conclusions [^notfound].

---

## Potential solutions and strategies

- **Standardized terminology**: Developing and adopting standardized terminology and indexing practices can improve search precision and retrieval [^113KgJYC].

- **Advanced search tools**: Utilizing advanced search tools and techniques, such as Boolean operators, MeSH terms, and citation tracking, can enhance search effectiveness [^113j2qqY].

- **Collaboration with librarians**: Engaging experienced librarians or information specialists can improve search strategy development and execution [^116qohQ9].

- **Comprehensive documentation**: Thorough documentation of search strategies, including peer review, can enhance reproducibility and transparency [^111rojgP].

- **Living systematic reviews**: Implementing living systematic reviews can help keep evidence up-to-date and address the challenge of rapidly evolving literature [^112soeT6].

---

Systematic approaches to literature search face significant frustrations, including information overload, poorly defined search terms, database limitations, time constraints, lack of standardized terminology, and limited reproducibility. These challenges can **impact evidence synthesis and clinical decision-making**, but can be mitigated through standardized terminology, advanced search tools, collaboration with librarians, comprehensive documentation, and living systematic reviews.

### Knowledge management: how to keep up with the literature [^112EAzf7]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

With the increasing medical literature, staying current with medical information is becoming a major challenge for clinicians. To ensure best practice and treatment for patients, clinicians must access medical information, acquire new knowledge, and achieve information mastery in their field. Without a systematic approach to identify and critically appraise clinical research, they might become dependent on inappropriate or outdated information. In this review, we present a brief synopsis of the multitude of resources available to clinicians for knowledge management, our best-practice suggestions for selecting an evidence-based medicine resource, and a convenient overview and easily adaptable strategy to successfully identify relevant medical literature and evaluate its validity. For rapid retrieval, review, and synthesis of the medical literature, we recommend the systematic approach of retrieve, review, reject, and read. This strategy allows clinicians to more efficiently stay abreast of the medical literature and more effectively translate the best evidence from peer-reviewed publication to patient.

### Challenges in systematic reviews: synthesis of topics related to the delivery, organization, and financing of health care [^111Q274Y]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Some important health policy topics, such as those related to the delivery, organization, and financing of health care, present substantial challenges to established methods for evidence synthesis. For example, such reviews may ask: What is the effect of for-profit versus not-for-profit delivery of care on patient outcomes? Or, which strategies are the most effective for promoting preventive care? This paper describes innovative methods for synthesizing evidence related to the delivery, organization, and financing of health care. We found 13 systematic reviews on these topics that described novel methodologic approaches. Several of these syntheses used 3 approaches: conceptual frameworks to inform problem formulation, systematic searches that included nontraditional literature sources, and hybrid synthesis methods that included simulations to address key gaps in the literature. As the primary literature on these topics expands, so will opportunities to develop additional novel methods for performing high-quality comprehensive syntheses.

### Systematic and scoping reviews: a comparison and overview [^1144vGRf]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

In this article, we compare and contrast methods of reviewing, summarizing, and synthesizing the literature, including systematic reviews, scoping reviews, and narrative reviews. Review articles are essential to help investigators wade through the plethora of exponentially growing medical literature. In the era of evidence-based medicine, a systematic approach is required. A systematic review is a formalized method to address a specific clinical question by analyzing the breadth of published literature while minimizing bias. Systematic reviews are designed to answer narrow clinical questions in the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) format. Alternatively, scoping reviews use a similar systematic approach to a literature search in order to determine the breadth and depth of knowledge on a topic; to clarify definitions, concepts, and themes; or sometimes as a precursor to a systematic review or hypothesis generator to guide future research. However, scoping reviews are less constrained by a priori decisions about which interventions, controls, and outcomes may be of interest. Traditional narrative reviews still have a role in informing practice and guiding research, particularly when there is a paucity of high-quality evidence on a topic.

Medical systematic review

Clinical evidence can be synthesized through the review of medical literature, but this process is increasingly challenged by the rapid growth of published research. LLMs have been employed to synthesize evidence from multiple articles using text summarization techniques. However, this text summarization approach raises significant concerns about the quality of the outputs, including issues like a lack of specificity, fabricated references, and potential for misleading information. Moreover, conducting a systematic review involves more than just summarization; it encompasses multiple steps, as outlined in PRISMA. AI should be integrated into the established systematic review workflow with careful consideration of user experience optimization, such as offering verification, referencing, and human-in-the-loop. From a systems engineering perspective, the following elements should be incorporated (Fig. 3 d).

The primary objective is to generate trustworthy clinical evidence from medical literature, with sub-objectives focused on ensuring the comprehensiveness of collected studies and the accuracy of extracted results. To meet these objectives, strict formatting constraints should be established for outputs at each step. For example, synthesized evidence must be directly supported by the results of individual studies and should ideally be presented as a meta-analysis.

Generating effective search queries requires expertise in both medicine and library sciencess. The search query building process can be performed by an AI agent in an iterative search and refinement process. Once citations are identified, a refined screening process is necessary to ensure relevance to the research question. This involves evaluating the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome elements. Additionally, a risk-of-bias assessment should be conducted to filter out low-quality citations. Developing specialized prompts incorporating itemized scoring guidelines can further improve the accuracy and consistency of this screening process.

A robust data extraction process is critical for handling the original study content. A PDF extraction module, leveraging Optical Character Recognition techniques, can extract essential details, including tables and figures. To maintain transparency and enable verification, LLM-generated outputs should include references to the original content, allowing users to identify and correct any potential misinformation. Synthesizing evidence from clinical studies requires accurate extraction of key numerical results, such as evaluated endpoints, sample sizes, and treatment effects. This task is particularly challenging but can be supported by equipping LLMs with an external program interface that facilitates numerical reasoning during evidence extraction and synthesis.

### Searching the medical literature [^111ejSHD]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Medical literature searches have become more complex because of the increasing amount of published material and the multiple available databases indexing those publications. Although newly graduated physicians may have received some training in literature searching as part of a medical school curriculum, most clinicians have received no formal training in this skill. In today's world of evidence-based medicine, access to published data is crucial, and the importance of a systematic approach to searching cannot be overemphasized. A brief review of searching techniques can greatly increase productivity while using the MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica, Science Citation Index, and other databases. Similarly, knowing the options available for remote access to databases and electronic delivery of articles can expedite the task of accessing publications.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis methodology [^11457ni2]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are being increasingly used to summarize medical literature and identify areas in which research is needed. Systematic reviews limit bias with the use of a reproducible scientific process to search the literature and evaluate the quality of the individual studies. If possible the results are statistically combined into a meta-analysis in which the data are weighted and pooled to produce an estimate of effect. This article aims to provide the reader with a practical overview of systematic review and meta-analysis methodology, with a focus on the process of performing a review and the related issues at each step.

### How to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis: a guide for clinicians [^114XC468]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based practice relies on using research evidence to guide clinical decision-making. However, staying current with all published research can be challenging. Many clinicians use review articles that apply predefined methods to locate, identify, and summarize all available evidence on a topic to guide clinical decision-making. This paper discusses the role of review articles, including narrative, scoping, and systematic reviews, to synthesize existing evidence and generate new knowledge. It provides a step-by-step guide to conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis, covering key steps such as formulating a research question, selecting studies, evaluating evidence quality, and reporting results. This paper is intended as a resource for clinicians looking to learn how to conduct systematic reviews and advance evidence-based practice in the field.

### Do systematic reviews on pediatric topics need special methodological considerations? [^114cV7fw]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Systematic reviews are key tools to enable decision making by healthcare providers and policymakers. Despite the availability of the evidence based Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA-2009 and PRISMA-P 2015) statements that were developed to improve the transparency and quality of reporting of systematic reviews, uncertainty on how to deal with pediatric-specific methodological challenges of systematic reviews impairs decision-making in child health. In this paper, we identify methodological challenges specific to the design, conduct and reporting of pediatric systematic reviews, and propose a process to address these challenges.

Discussion

One fundamental decision at the outset of a systematic review is whether to focus on a pediatric population only, or to include both adult and pediatric populations. Both from the policy and patient care point of view, the appropriateness of interventions and comparators administered to pre-defined pediatric age subgroup is critical. Decisions need to be based on the biological plausibility of differences in treatment effects across the developmental trajectory in children. Synthesis of evidence from different trials is often impaired by the use of outcomes and measurement instruments that differ between trials and are neither relevant nor validated in the pediatric population. Other issues specific to pediatric systematic reviews include lack of pediatric-sensitive search strategies and inconsistent choices of pediatric age subgroups in meta-analyses. In addition to these methodological issues generic to all pediatric systematic reviews, special considerations are required for reviews of health care interventions' safety and efficacy in neonatology, global health, comparative effectiveness interventions and individual participant data meta-analyses. To date, there is no standard approach available to overcome this problem. We propose to develop a consensus-based checklist of essential items which researchers should consider when they are planning (PRISMA-PC-Protocol for Children) or reporting (PRISMA-C-reporting for Children) a pediatric systematic review. Available guidelines including PRISMA do not cover the complexity associated with the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews in the pediatric population; they require additional and modified standards for reporting items. Such guidance will facilitate the translation of knowledge from the literature to bedside care and policy, thereby enhancing delivery of care and improving child health outcomes.

### Systematic review of the literature: best practices [^117FEqGw]. Academic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Reviews of published scientific literature are a valuable resource that can underline best practices in medicine and clarify clinical controversies. Among the various types of reviews, the systematic review of the literature is ranked as the most rigorous since it is a high-level summary of existing evidence focused on answering a precise question. Systematic reviews employ a pre-defined protocol to identify relevant and trustworthy literature. Such reviews can accomplish several critical goals that are not easily achievable with typical empirical studies by allowing identification and discussion of best evidence, contradictory findings, and gaps in the literature. The Association of University Radiologists Radiology Research Alliance Systematic Review Task Force convened to explore the methodology and practical considerations involved in performing a systematic review. This article provides a detailed and practical guide for performing a systematic review and discusses its applications in radiology.

### Reproducibility of clinical research in critical care: a scoping review [^113Rk9dF]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In conjunction with these previous studies, our study highlights challenges associated with studying reproducibility. First, is the systematic and efficient identification of relevant articles within the vast landscape of published literature. To manage the breadth of the critical care literature, we restricted the primary search to the three general medical journals with the highest impact factors. This was done to reduce the number of early-phase RCTs that are inherently at higher risk for bias, are less relevant to discussions of reproducibility, are more likely published in lower-impact journals, and less likely to influence clinical practice. This restriction may have missed potentially relevant studies. However, articles included in our study are comparable to other reviews of important clinical critical care research. Restricting the primary search to high-profile literature may have overestimated the number of practices with a reproduction attempt. However, through identification of 158 clinical critical care practices, and reporting the estimate of reproduction attempts at the level of the practice rather than the individual original study, it is less likely that inclusion of potentially lower-profile literature within the primary search would considerably alter this estimate. The second challenge associated with examining reproducibility is determining what constitutes a reproduction attempt. There is no consensus definition of a reproduction attempt. Among previous similar studies, definitions are not consistent and are difficult to reliably operationalize. In comparison, our definition required greater similarity between original studies and reproduction attempts, with strict criteria pertaining to study design and sample size, and minor latitude given to study population, nature of the intervention and/or control, and primary outcome measure. It is possible that this relatively stricter definition excluded potential reproduction attempts and resulted in a lower estimate of the number of practices with a reproduction attempt. However, by employing a strict definition, our study endeavored to include reproduction attempts that were methodologically similar to the original study and reduced the likelihood that inconsistent results were due to differences in methodological quality. This identifies the third challenge associated with studying reproducibility, which is determining what constitutes a consistent reproduction attempt. Previous studies used conclusions reported by authors to determine whether the results of a reproduction attempt were consistent with the original study. We employed a more objective approach that classified the primary efficacy outcome and any pre-specified secondary safety outcome to derive our own assessment of the efficacy of each practice, and used this to determine whether original studies and reproduction attempts reported consistent effects. Accepting the limitations of this approach, it is congruent with that employed in previous reproducibility research, and resulted in a rate of reproducible research that compares favorably with much of the existing clinical literature.

### Developing, conducting, and publishing appropriate systematic review and meta-analysis articles [^1118Go5V]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The volume of medical literature is growing at a rate that renders decision-making difficult without specialized summary tools. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are important research instruments used to condense and clarify a broad scope of information into manageable summaries. When used effectively, these reports can pool cumulative data across primary studies, formulate clinical guidelines, and guide future research endeavors. However, errors in study design can result in ineffective or misleading analyses. This article presents the appropriate uses for systematic review and meta-analysis by introducing a framework for creating summary studies, and supplying specific examples of pitfalls in study design and execution.

### Trials and tribulations of systematic reviews and meta-analyses [^115veAjn]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews can help practitioners keep abreast of the medical literature by summarizing large bodies of evidence and helping to explain differences among studies on the same question. A systematic review involves the application of scientific strategies, in ways that limit bias, to the assembly, critical appraisal, and synthesis of all relevant studies that address a specific clinical question. A meta-analysis is a type of systematic review that uses statistical methods to combine and summarize the results of several primary studies. Because the review process itself (like any other type of research) is subject to bias, a useful review requires rigorous methods that are clearly reported. Used increasingly to inform medical decision making, plan future research agendas, and establish clinical policy, systematic reviews may strengthen the link between best research evidence and optimal health care. In this article, we discuss key steps in how to critically appraise and how to conduct a systematic review or meta-analysis.

### Opportunities and challenges in conducting systematic reviews to support the development of nutrient reference values: vitamin A as an example [^112vjKb2]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Nutrient reference values have significant public health and policy implications. Given the importance of defining reliable nutrient reference values, there is a need for an explicit, objective, and transparent process to set these values. The Tufts Medical Center Evidence-based Practice Center assembled a group of nutrition experts from academic institutions and federal government agencies, led participants in discussions, conducted exercises in formulating questions and evidence review criteria that would be amenable to systematic reviews of the scientific literature, performed a literature search on the questions to identify potentially relevant publications, and identified challenges and limitations of applying this method to support the development of nutrient reference values using vitamin A as an example. The workgroup concluded that the systematic review approach could be productively used to inform the development of reference values. Challenges identified in this exercise include prioritizing and defining research questions when the volume of literature is large, relying on intermediate (surrogate) outcomes when few or no studies directly linking nutrient intake with clinical outcomes are available, and determining reliable nutrient biomarkers. Ultimately, an objective, unbiased systematic review of a defined question could be useful, not only in helping to set nutrient reference values, but also for increasing the transparency of the decision making process.

### Systematic reviews and meta-analyses: when they are useful and when to be careful [^1136qJ7s]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are increasingly popular study designs in clinical research. A systematic review is a summary of the medical literature that uses explicit and reproducible methods for searching the literature and critical appraisal of individual studies; in contrast, a meta-analysis is a mathematical synthesis of the results of these individual studies. These study designs can be useful tools for summarizing the increasing amount of knowledge that is gained from scientific papers on a certain topic. In addition, combining individual studies in a meta-analysis increases statistical power, resulting in more precise effect estimates. Although the specific methodology of systematic reviews includes steps to minimize bias in all stages of the process, investigators should be aware of potential biases such as poor quality of included studies, heterogeneity between studies, and the presence of publication and outcome reporting bias. This paper explains how systematic reviews and meta-analyses should be performed and how to interpret and implement their results. In addition, we discuss when meta-analyses are useful and when they are not.

### Conducting and appraising systematic and scoping reviews [^112GorMG]. Hospital Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The process of gathering, appraising, and synthesizing evidence takes many forms across a variety of disciplines with the shared goal of informing both day-to-day practice and research efforts. Scoping reviews and systematic reviews are prevalent in pediatrics and, when adhering to methodological standards, have the potential to answer questions using existing evidence while minimizing bias. This article highlights the key similar characteristics (transparency, comprehensive search, minimal bias, team-based) and differences (purpose, approach, question, data collection) and includes interactive quizzes with recommendations both for researchers seeking to conduct reviews and for clinicians appraising and applying publications.

### Systematic reviews of empirical bioethics [^112edSbH]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Publications and discussions of survey research in empirical bioethics have steadily increased over the past two decades. However, findings often differ among studies with similar research questions. As a consequence, ethical reasoning that considers only parts of the existing literature and does not apply systematic reviews tends to be biased. To date, we lack a systematic review (SR) methodology that takes into account the specific conceptual and practical challenges of empirical bioethics.

Methods

The steps of systematically reviewing empirical findings in bioethics are presented and critically discussed. In particular, (a) the limitations of traditional SR methodologies in the field of empirical bioethics are critically discussed, and (b) conceptual and practical recommendations for SRs in empirical bioethics that are (c) based on the authors' review experiences in healthcare ethics are presented.

Results

A 7-step approach for SRs of empirical bioethics is proposed: (1) careful definition of review question; (2) selection of relevant databases; (3) application of ancillary search strategies; (4) development of search algorithms; (5) relevance assessment of the retrieved references; (6) quality assessment of included studies; and (7) data analysis and presentation. Conceptual and practical challenges arise because of various peculiarities in reviewing empirical bioethics literature and can lead to biased results if they are not taken into account.

Conclusions

If suitably adapted to the peculiarities of the field, SRs of empirical bioethics provide transparent information for ethical reasoning and decision-making that is less biased than single studies.

### Osteoarthritis year in review 2024: biomechanics [^113uvXwp]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to systematically review and summarize the literature of the past year on osteoarthritis (OA) and biomechanics, to highlight gaps and challenges, and to present some promising approaches and developments.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted using Pubmed and the Web of Science Core Collection. We included original articles and systematic reviews on OA and biomechanics in human subjects published between April 2023 and April 2024.

Results

Of the 155 studies that met the inclusion criteria, 9 were systematic reviews and 146 were original (mostly cross-sectional) studies that included a total of 6488 patients and 1921 controls with a mean age of 57.5 and 44.7 years, respectively. Promising advances have been made in medical imaging of affected soft tissue structures, the relationship between soft tissue properties and biomechanical changes in OA, new technologies to facilitate easier assessment of ambulatory biomechanics, and personalized physics-based models that also include complex chemical and mechanobiological mechanisms, all of which are relevant to gaining mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of OA.

Conclusions

There is still an unmet need for larger longitudinal data sets that combine clinical, radiological, and biomechanical outcomes to characterize the biomechanical fingerprint that underlies the trajectory of functional decline and biomechanical phenotypes of OA. In addition, criteria and guidelines for control groups, as well as methods and standards for model verification allowing for comparisons between studies are needed.

### What is the cost of palliative care in the UK? A systematic review [^1121PrML]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Little is known about the cost of a palliative care approach in the UK, and there is an absence of robust activity and unit cost data. The aim of this study was to review evidence on the costs of specialist and generalist palliative care in the UK, and to explore different approaches used for capturing activity and unit cost data.

Methods

A systematic review with narrative synthesis. Four electronic databases were searched for empirical literature on the costs of a palliative care approach in the UK, and a narrative method was used to synthesise the data.

Results

Ten papers met our inclusion criteria. The studies displayed significant variation in their estimates of the cost of palliative care, therefore it was not possible to present an accurate aggregate cost of palliative care in the UK. The majority of studies explored costs from a National Health Service perspective and only two studies included informal care costs. Approaches to estimating activity and costs varied. Particular challenges were noted with capturing activity and cost data for hospice and informal care.

Conclusion

The data are limited, and the heterogeneity is such that it is not possible to provide an aggregate cost of palliative care in the UK. It is notable that the costs of hospice care and informal care are often neglected in economic studies. Further work is needed to address methodological and practical challenges in order to gain a more complete understanding of the costs of palliative care.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of biologic and targeted synthetic therapies in sarcoidosis [^115FJojG]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis has several notable strengths. It was conducted using a comprehensive and systematic literature search, designed to capture all relevant studies across multiple databases and sources. The search strategy was developed and executed according to a prespecified protocol, ensuring transparency and reproducibility. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment followed standardised methods and predefined criteria to minimise bias. A key challenge was the considerable methodological heterogeneity across the included studies, particularly in relation to outcome measures, analytical approaches and reporting standards. This variability precluded conventional meta-analysis for many outcomes. To synthesise these diverse data, we applied vote counting based on the direction of effect, a method recommended when statistical pooling is not feasible. Although this approach does not generate pooled effect estimates, it offers a transparent summary of the consistency and direction of effects across studies, providing valuable insight into overall trends in the literature.

To remain trustworthy and relevant, clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) should be informed by recent systematic reviews of evidence and should reflect current clinicians' experiences and patients' values. In 2015, the American Society of Hematology (ASH) began developing CPGs using formal methods. In recent years, review and revision of the initial guidelines developed using these methods have become an ASH organizational priority. Two recent strategic approaches to monitor and revise ASH CPGs have now been piloted: (1) a living guideline approach and (2) an annual monitoring strategy.

The first approach, a living guideline approach, was used for the ASH Guidelines on use of anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19. Over several years during the pandemic, a research team continually and systematically searched for new evidence and then updated estimates of baseline risks of thrombosis and effects of anticoagulation. When prespecified criteria were met (ie, estimates met prespecified thresholds for change in direction or magnitude), the guideline panel revisited recommendations. This living guideline approach addressed an unprecedented clinical need for timely recommendations about COVID-19–related thrombosis, as well as the challenge of synthesizing a rapidly changing, voluminous, and difficult-to-interpret body of evidence. However, the living approach was resource intensive, requiring both extensive time commitments from volunteers and ASH staff at significant cost, and is unlikely to be warranted or feasible for most ASH guidelines.

The second strategy, informed by a review of approaches by other international guideline developersand piloted in 2021, enlists a small working group of experts and a librarian to review new evidence and decide when a revision is required (Figure 1). The librarian initially refreshes the original literature search, limited to new systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Literature searches are also conducted to find studies of relevant new interventions. The expert working group, composed of members of the original guideline panel, subsequently reviews the search results and advises the ASH Committee on Quality on whether the guidelines should be revised, retired, or continue to be monitored. For all guidelines, the monitoring process begins 2 years after the initial publication and is repeated annually until there is a decision to revise or retire. Revisions may be broad or focused and urgent or not. Retirement would be warranted when a guideline is no longer valid or clinically relevant.

### Searching the medical literature on the internet [^116Hj5Ti]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The volume of new information being added to the medical literature is expanding quickly. Hence, computer-assisted literature searches frequently are used to assist in patient care and clinical problem solving, including choosing the most appropriate diagnostic tests, properly diagnosing medical conditions, and developing and implementing suitable treatment plans. This article describes techniques for performing more efficient medical literature searches using the PubMed interface of MEDLINE.

### The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluate healthcare interventions: explanation and elaboration [^113edcwH]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

A highly structured abstract of a systematic review could include the following headings: Context (or Background); Objective (or Purpose); Data sources; Study selection (or Eligibility criteria); Study appraisal and Synthesis methods (or Data extraction and Data synthesis); Results; Limitations; and Conclusions (or Implications). Alternatively, a simpler structure could cover but collapse some of the above headings (such as label Study selection and Study appraisal as Review methods) or omit some headings such as Background and Limitations.

In the highly structured abstract mentioned above, authors use the Background heading to set the context for readers and explain the importance of the review question. Under the Objectives heading, they ideally use elements of PICOS (see box 2) to state the primary objective of the review. Under a Data sources heading, they summarise sources that were searched, any language or publication type restrictions, and the start and end dates of searches. Study selection statements then ideally describe who selected studies using what inclusion criteria. Data extraction methods statements describe appraisal methods during data abstraction and the methods used to integrate or summarise the data. The Data synthesis section is where the main results of the review are reported. If the review includes meta-analyses, authors should provide numerical results with confidence intervals for the most important outcomes. Ideally, they should specify the amount of evidence in these analyses (numbers of studies and numbers of participants). Under a Limitations heading, authors might describe the most important weaknesses of included studies as well as limitations of the review process. Then authors should provide clear and balanced Conclusions that are closely linked to the objective and findings of the review. Additionally, it would be helpful if authors included some information about funding for the review. Finally, although protocol registration for systematic reviews is still not common practice, if authors have registered their review or received a registration number, we recommend providing the registration information at the end of the abstract.

Taking all the above considerations into account, the intrinsic tension between the goal of completeness of the abstract and its keeping into the space limit often set by journal editors is recognised as a major challenge.

### Systematic reviews in rehabilitation for stroke: issues and approaches to addressing them [^1179EzPg]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe the problems encountered when undertaking systematic reviews of rehabilitation and to give advice to reviewers about ways of addressing these issues.

Background

Evidence-based practice has become established as a way of linking clinical practice with research evidence. The most robust evidence is usually considered to be that from randomized controlled trials, and from systematic reviews of these trials. However, most reviews have focused on drug and surgical interventions, and few reviews have been produced in the field of rehabilitation. This may be due to the unique difficulties that are posed by reviews in this area.

Experience Of Systematic Reviews In Aphasia

We describe the challenges that occurred when carrying out systematic reviews of speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke, and of ways to deliver rehabilitation services to people who have suffered a stroke. Issues arose at all stages of the reviews and included: using expertise; planning the review; defining the health care problem, patients, outcomes and interventions of interest; searching for, interpreting and synthesizing the results of the studies identified; and deriving implications from the review. Suggestions made to address these challenges include: developing a suitable team of reviewers; using inclusive and broad criteria for inclusion of trials to a review; developing appropriate search strategies; and using caution in arriving at conclusions. It is important to be explicit about decisions made during the review process concerning how to handle the challenges. Practical advice about carrying out reviews in the field of stroke rehabilitation is likely to be helpful to reviewers of other rehabilitative interventions. There are likely to be relatively few studies available for such reviews, and limitations in drawing specific practical conclusions. Such undertakings are, however, useful in setting the agenda for further research.

### The medicolegal challenges of facial plastic surgery: a systematic review [^111wenec]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Information Sources

A comprehensive literature search was conducted across the following 7 electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar); 2 registers (and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform [WHO ICTRP]); and 1 website: WorldCat. The date range for all searches was 2020 to 2024. Citation searching yielded an additional 12 records. Gray literature sources were also searched from platforms including ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (PQDT; Clarivate), Open Access Theses and Dissertations, and the King's College London Research Portal. Conference proceedings were searched through SCOPUS and Web of Science, whereas preprints were checked from SSRN and F1000 Preprints. Supplemental Tables 2 and 3 provide detailed information pertaining to the supplemental search strategies. The last update on searches occurred on March 31, 2025.

Search Strategy

A detailed literature search strategy was developed in conjunction with an experienced research librarian to guarantee the thorough inclusion of all relevant studies, regardless of language, study type, or publication status, encompassing published, unpublished, in-press, and ongoing research.

The Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) framework was applied to ensure a structured and systematic approach to formulate the research question and guide the literature search (Supplemental Table 4). Research question: in patients dissatisfied with facial plastic surgery outcomes (P), how do medicolegal evaluations (I) impact risk management in medical practice (O)?

PICO framework:

Population (P): individuals who underwent facial aesthetic surgical procedures.
Intervention (I): evaluation of postoperative complications and medicolegal disputes.
Comparison (C): not applicable.
Outcome (O): identification of causes of medicolegal challenges, common complications, and proposed solutions.

The following combinations of medical subject headings, entry terms, and key words were used in the electronic search: "human", "face", "face surgery", "facelift", "plastic surgery", "plastic surgery procedures", "cosmetic surgery", "aesthetic surgery", "aesthetics", "liability", "legal", "malpractice", "legislation", "forensic medicine", "medical errors", "compensation", and "redress" (Supplemental Table 5). Search strategy was adapted to each database presented in Supplemental Tables 2 and 3. The PRESS Checklist was used to assess the search tactics.

### Implementation of effective practices in health facilities: a systematic review of cluster randomised trials [^114bzxDn]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

In light of our findings, one of the main lessons learnt centred on the challenges of appropriately reporting and analysing the types of included studies. Implementation studies (of varying trial designs) are inconsistently reported on in the literature. This might be, in part, due to a lack of standard reporting guidelines, as well as due to variability and inconsistency in the use of the terms to describe implementation strategies. Poor reporting of the methodological process of implementation makes it difficult to assess at what point in the process certain factors were critical to success. Furthermore, various systematic reviews of implementation strategies show that these interventions have effectiveness some of the time in some settings, and not all of the time in all settings, and a clearer framework for the implementation process (and measuring its effect) would improve the robustness of the data generated and its applicability to other implementation studies. For example, the Medical Research Council (UK) provides researchers with a framework on developing and evaluating complex interventions, and one would argue that this framework should be used in combination with a standardised reporting process in implementation studies.

There exist many frameworks to consider when planning an implementation intervention. We have shown nine components of implementation that are consistent across cluster randomised trials and disciplines. While having a multifaceted intervention is not necessarily more effective than having a single component intervention, it is possible that some of all of these nine specific components could be integrated into the existing approaches of implementation frameworks, and this warrants further consideration.

Strengths and limitations

We undertook a broad search of trials covering all medical specialties. Whereas other reviews have embraced a more generic category of implementation strategies (such as multifaceted interventions), our synthesis unpacked these into their individual components.

There are limitations in the search findings given the varying inclusion of the trial design (cluster) in the title and abstract, as reported in the literature. Despite employing a full-text search strategy to overcome this, we might have missed relevant citations. We did not include other study designs, which might have been helpful in terms of identifying components of implementation. Moreover, the quality of implementation reporting was highly variable, limiting the analysis of the components and their combinations in detail. As our review was comprehensive in terms of the medical specialty, our analysis of the effects were limited to the primary outcomes reported by each study.

### A systematic review comparing surveillance recommendations for the detection of recurrence following surgery across 16 common cancer types [^1123NNUT]. BMJ Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Strengths and weaknesses

This is the first systematic review of follow-up guidelines for multiple cancer types, providing a comprehensive overview of this area of cancer care with the use of a rigorous search strategy (combining electronic databases, grey literature, consultation with subject experts and manual searching) to ensure good coverage. This approach was required as, while publications from some guideline bodies were included in electronic databases (ESMO routinely publish guidelines in the well-indexed Annals of Oncology), others were only identifiable via their own websites (such as NCCN guidelines). The decision to limit this review to English language guidelines has led to an over-representation of guidelines from English-speaking countries (including the UK, USA and Canada) and from international guideline bodies which publish in English (such as ESMO). It is our view that this approach was sufficient to provide an overview of this topic — but results should be interpreted taking this into consideration. This body of literature is constantly evolving, and it is challenging to provide an up-to-date overview of such a large set of guidelines; we acknowledge that updates to a small number of guidelines may have been published since we updated our search in 2023. Any updates are unlikely to affect the finding of this review and the overarching challenges facing this field.

The use of a text mining approach to identify statements about evidence for surveillance in this review provided a pragmatic option for systematically identifying relevant sentences across many lengthy documents. While data extraction focused on subsections of documents discussing follow-up, this allowed for the inclusion of text from throughout the guidelines. However, relevant statements may have been missed due to the formatting of the guideline documents or if they used language not captured by the search terms.

Researchers interested in exploring this topic further — for example, conducting more in-depth reviews of individual cancer types, investigating in more detail the specific schedules of follow-up recommended or carrying out more detailed assessments of the evidence provided in the guidelines — may find the full list of included guidelines (including date, guideline body, URL) and the detailed extraction summary table (including details of the population, surveillance modalities and risk stratification methods) provided in the supplementary materials (onlinesupplemental tables S1a S2) useful resources.

### The American Society of Addiction Medicine clinical practice guideline development methodology [^116QEZCJ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Systematic review — background and processes describes that a quality clinical practice guideline should be based on a systematic review of the literature, which helps ensure that all relevant evidence is identified, critiqued, and synthesized using methods that help reduce the likelihood of bias, and is typically conducted prior to initiating work on the CPG by a group separate from the CPG Writing Group. Systematic reviews use well-established methods to search, identify, appraise, and synthesize the literature examining prespecified key questions of interest; they can contain a qualitative synthesis of evidence, a quantitative synthesis of evidence, or a combination of both; a meta-analysis is the quantitative synthesis of evidence and is based on a systematic review, although not all systematic reviews include a meta-analysis; narrative reviews broadly summarize a topic but do not adhere to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria and search parameters nor use explicit criteria to evaluate quality. Broadly speaking, processes include define the question(s) of interest and methods, conduct literature search, identify studies and other sources of information for inclusion, data abstraction, critical appraisal, and synthesis of evidence.

### Making PubMed searching simple: learning to retrieve medical literature through interactive problem solving [^1145wdKS]. The Oncologist (2006). Low credibility.

Searching the literature has a direct, beneficial influence on patient care. The amount of medical scientific information has increased to a great extent, while the development of networking technologies has broadened access to online databases. Successful searches depend upon understanding technical librarianship concepts and the skills for mastering searching interfaces. From a problem-oriented approach, concepts like MEDLINE coverage, PubMed resources, Boolean logic, search strategies, and Web sources for full-text articles are introduced along seven online situations: locating a specific publication, answering a complex clinical question, finding information on a general subject, finding publications by a particular author, finding publications in a particular language, finding a specific publication type, and locating the full-text document. Oncologists should face the challenge of performing their own searches. Specific knowledge is mandatory to avoid frustrating, time-consuming work. The objective of this work is to present concepts, strategies, and skills required for medical literature retrieval, easing the incorporation of new and welcomed practices.

### A perspective for adapting generalist AI to specialized medical AI applications and their challenges [^113ZwdA6]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

System engineering: architecture development

Figure 2 illustrates the top-down system engineering process for adapting LLMs to medical AI applications. The process involves the following steps: (1) selecting the architecture to be developed (Fig. 2 a); (2) designing the agent-based system (Fig. 2 b) or the AI chain system (Fig. 2 c); and (3) developing and finetuning LLMs to integrate with these systems (Fig. 2 d).

Fig. 2
This playbook outlines the process of adapting large language models (LLMs) for medical AI using a systems engineering approach.

a Selecting the overall architecture of the system should be based on the properties and requirements of the task at hand. In some scenarios, the best performance can be achieved with a fusion of the AI chain and AI agents. b A non-exhaustive list of example agent modules to be built in an agent-based system. LLMs act in different roles when equipped with different modules and interact with human experts to dynamically conduct the target task. c When building AI chain systems, we can first define the pipeline that decomposes the task into small steps following an expert workflow or professional guidelines, and then develop the module responsible for each step. d Adaptation techniques can be applied to enhance LLM's performance for the AI agent or for the AI module. Adaptation methods need to be selected according to data availability and task requirements.

The first step is to choose the system architecture: AI Chainand AI Agent, depending on the nature of the tasks and requirements, as illustrated in Fig. 2 a. AI Chain follows a structured, fixed workflow, making it ideal for repetitive tasks, professional practices, and scenarios requiring strict adherence to guidelines or compliance. Example applications include systematic literature reviewsand patient-to-trial matching. In contrast, AI Agents are more suitable for flexible workflows and exploratory tasks that tolerate uncertainty, cost, and time variations. This approach excels in dynamic and creative tasks such as data science code generationand brainstorming research hypotheses. However, these two architectures are not mutually exclusive. A hybrid approach can be effective, where agents are embedded within structured workflows to handle steps requiring extensive reasoning or exploration. For instance, DeepResearchfollows a systematic workflow of literature search, information processing, and summarization. However, within each step, a reasoning agent iteratively refines searches and processes information until sufficient material is gathered for summarization.

### Identifying and resolving the frustrations of reviewing the improvement literature: the experiences of two improvement researchers [^115c1aKh]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Recommendations

After our reviews were published, we discussed the challenges we faced and how we resolved them during a series of reflective discussions by telephone and email. Through arbitration with a third author (WC), we were able to suggest what other authors could do to ease the process of literature-reviewing in complex fields. Our approach does not offer a definitive solution, but rather a starting point which should be critiqued and refined depending on the review question and aims. Our approach is based on our own reflections of using a systematic approach to reviewing literature in a complex field. There are many existing frameworks and resources (such as the PRISMA statement) to aid review authors, but by using the specific example of QI in healthcare we add to this literature, providing practical examples from our own experience. During our own work, in a field where there is much contention not just about what QI is, but where it fits in a landscape of other sciences, we made pragmatic choices to complete our reviews with finite time and resources. Therefore, we hope that our recommendations can be used as a starting point for authors in similar complex fields to strengthen the practice of systematic and literature reviews:

Maintain transparency and be as thorough as possible (using supplementary materials if required) to expose the challenges you faced to allow the reader to make judgements about the defensibility of your methodological choices.
Assemble a multiprofessional review team (our teams included clinicians, social scientists and engineers).
Ensure the review team can communicate in an open and honest way about uncertainties and compromises.
Conduct a literature scoping exercise to resolve ambiguities in defining the topic and key terms before starting the main review.
Apply a taxonomy or rule to aid classification of concepts.
Contact experts in related fields and authors of papers selected for full-text review to clarify whether a paper meets inclusion criteria if the literature review team cannot agree and ambiguity exists.
Maintain documentation of reflexivity and make this available to experts in your field.
Consider plurality as an approach when working with a multidisciplinary review team.

### Teaching end-of-life communication: priorities, challenges, scope-systematic review [^111cf6Qh]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2022). High credibility.

Background

Without a well-rounded syllabus to teach end-of-life (EOL) communication, medical providers find it challenging to enhance their patients' quality of life at the final stage of life.

Aim

The aim of this scoping review was to explore studies about the teaching of EOL communication and to detail how educators can approach the teaching of EOL communication.

Methods

A scoping review of both qualitative and quantitative studies was conducted according to the methodological framework of scoping review. The PsycINFO, PubMed, ERIC, CINAHL and EMBASE databases were searched for studies using the keywords 'teach', 'educat', 'end of life', 'terminal care', 'communication' and 'palliative care'. Sixteen studies were appraised, and none was rejected on the grounds of quality.

Results

The search strategy yielded 22278 entries and 16 studies were included. Two themes were identified from the priorities in teaching EOL communication: (1) challenges to teaching EOL communication and (2) methods of teaching EOL communication. To present a comprehensive overview of EOL communication teaching, we provide directions for priorities of topics and approaches when teaching EOL communication.

Conclusions

The review detailed the complexity of teaching EOL communication, which indicates the need for a well-rounded syllabus that includes skills such as non-verbal social cues, communication strategies and understanding EOL communication in various cultural contexts to facilitate a well-rounded EOL communication experience for students' future practice.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: current challenges facing research and therapeutic advances in airway remodeling [^11619LYa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society research statement on airway remodeling (AR) — scope, methods, findings, and conclusions are summarized as follows: Airway remodeling (AR) is a prominent feature of asthma and other obstructive lung diseases that is minimally affected by current treatments, and the goals are to discuss the scientific, technological, economic, and regulatory issues that deter progress of AR research and development of therapeutics targeting AR and to propose approaches and solutions to these specific problems; this Statement is not intended to provide clinical practice recommendations on any disease in which AR is observed and/or plays a role. An international multidisciplinary group from academia, industry, and the National Institutes of Health was invited to participate in one internet-based and one face-to-face meeting, and a literature search of PubMed was performed to support conclusions; the search was not a systematic review of the evidence. Multiple conceptual, logistical, economic, and regulatory deterrents that limit AR research and impede accelerated, intensive development of AR-focused therapeutics were identified, and complementary solutions that leverage expertise of academia and industry were proposed. The statement concludes that numerous intrinsic and economic factors have thwarted the ability to understand AR pathology and mechanisms and to address it clinically, and it identifies potential solutions while emphasizing educating the global research community as a critical first step in developing effective strategies for: (1) increasing the extent and impact of AR research and (2) developing, testing, and ultimately improving drugs targeting AR.

### Perspective on systematic medical literature reviews and meta-analyses [^112zLtpZ]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study sought to identify factors contributing to the inadequacies of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRMAs) published in the ophthalmology literature.

Design

Perspective.

Methods

Review and synthesis of selective literature, with interpretation and perspective.

Results

Although recommendations for the design, conduct, assessment of quality, and risk of bias of systematic reviews have been widely available, some recent publications illustrate a serious potential failing in this domain: inclusion of refuted science, lack of citation of post-publication correspondence and failure to use ≥ 1 alternative search strategy.

Conclusions

Examples of inadequacies of peer review in medical literature and perpetuation of erroneous science by unfiltered inclusion in subsequent systematic reviews have been identified, and the problem can be traced to authors, peer reviewers, and editors of journals. This perspective identifies and analyzes several possible causes of the problem and recommends some specific corrective actions to improve the quality and accuracy of such reviews.

### Interventions in the management of diabetes-related foot infections: a systematic review [^113JuyUE]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

The optimal approaches to managing diabetic foot infections remain a challenge for clinicians. Despite an exponential rise in publications investigating different treatment strategies, the various agents studied generally produce comparable results, and high-quality data are scarce. In this systematic review, we searched the medical literature using the PubMed and Embase databases for published studies on the treatment of diabetic foot infections from 30 June 2018 to 30 June 2022. We combined this search with our previous literature search of a systematic review performed in 2020, in which the infection committee of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot searched the literature until June 2018. We defined the context of the literature by formulating clinical questions of interest, then developing structured clinical questions (Patients-Intervention-Control-Outcomes) to address these. We only included data from controlled studies of an intervention to prevent or cure a diabetic foot infection. Two independent reviewers selected articles for inclusion and then assessed their relevant outcomes and methodological quality. Our literature search identified a total of 5,418 articles, of which we selected 32 for full-text review. Overall, the newly available studies we identified since 2018 do not significantly modify the body of the 2020 statements for the interventions in the management of diabetes-related foot infections. The recent data confirm that outcomes in patients treated with the different antibiotic regimens for both skin and soft tissue infection and osteomyelitis of the diabetes-related foot are broadly equivalent across studies, with a few exceptions (tigecycline not non-inferior to ertapenem [± vancomycin]). The newly available data suggest that antibiotic therapy following surgical debridement for moderate or severe infections could be reduced to 10 days and to 3 weeks for osteomyelitis following surgical debridement of bone. Similar outcomes were reported in studies comparing primarily surgical and predominantly antibiotic treatment strategies in selected patients with diabetic foot osteomyelitis. There is insufficient high-quality evidence to assess the effect of various recent adjunctive therapies, such as cold plasma for infected foot ulcers and bioactive glass for osteomyelitis. Our updated systematic review confirms a trend to a better quality of the most recent trials and the need for further well-designed trials to produce higher quality evidence to underpin our recommendations.

### How health systems approached respiratory viral pandemics over time: a systematic review [^113pnKNQ]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. The review protocol was published in PROSPERO with registration number CRD42020194318.

Search strategy

The electronic databases of Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane were searched to retrieve potential eligible articles, published from the inception until 17 April 2020. A search string for PubMed was developed consisting of Medical Subject Headings terms and keywords combined by using Boolean Operators. The search in PubMed was restricted to only humans. Keywords such as "Pandemics"; "Epidemics"; "SARS"; "MERS"; "COVID-19"; "Influenza Pandemic, 1918–1919"; "Strategies"; "Management"; "Surveillance" were used. The search string was adapted for use in the other electronic databases. The full search strategy for all databases can be found in online supplemental material 1.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

We included articles that discussed healthcare system strategies or healthcare provider interventions that have been used to manage respiratory viral epidemics or pandemics, with any study design (quantitative or qualitative) and that are published in English. We excluded systematic reviews, non-empirical studies, conference abstracts, editorials, commentaries, book reviews and abstracts not accompanied by a full text. Furthermore, animal and modelling studies were excluded. We aimed to collect and summarise information concerning health systems' approaches, from both a broad and holistic point of view, which addressed healthcare challenges during respiratory virus outbreaks. We also excluded studies discussing clinical therapeutics; clinical epidemiological data; vaccines; knowledge; behaviours and education on pandemics; economic studies; and restrictions concerning school closure, travel and transportation. The included articles were grouped into two main categories: (1) articles reporting approaches related to healthcare providers and (2) articles reporting approaches related to healthcare systems. For the purposes of this review, the term 'healthcare system strategies' refers to the strategy of any health system which provides leadership, management and direction to healthcare units through a set of policies and plans adopted by government, private sector and other groups in areas such as financing, human resources and public health. The term 'healthcare provider management' refers to any organisation or institution delivering healthcare services to the population.

### Using existing systematic reviews in complex systematic reviews [^111Dt9Hr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Systematic reviewers increasingly must decide whether and how to incorporate existing systematic reviews into complex systematic reviews that are commissioned to support clinical guideline development or for other health policy uses. To date, however, this issue has been largely unexamined. Reviewers seeking to incorporate existing reviews into new reviews face a set of important questions: Can this practice adhere to systematic review principles? Will it save time? When should it be avoided? Will it produce valid results and be acceptable to users? Drawing from their collective experience, the authors outline a series of steps that can help reviewers reach reasoned decisions about the incorporation of existing systematic reviews and enumerate potential hazards to consider in doing so. They highlight issues surrounding the main steps reviewers must undertake, including locating existing reviews; assessing their relevance to the new review; assessing the quality of relevant reviews; determining how to incorporate high-quality, relevant existing systematic reviews; and clearly reporting the methods used and the results from this process. Further specification of methods, including the development of reporting standards for this approach, is needed.

### An overview of how to search and write a medical literature review [^116VcLUk]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Without a literature review, there can be no research project. Literature reviews are necessary to learn what is known (and not known) about a topic of interest. In the respiratory care profession, the body of research is enormous, so a method to search the medical literature efficiently is needed. Selecting the correct databases, use of Boolean logic operators, and consultations with librarians are used to optimize searches. For a narrow and precise search, use PubMed, MEDLINE, Ovid, EBSCO, the Cochrane Library, or Google Scholar. Reference management tools assist with organizing the evidence found from the search. Analyzing the search results and writing the review provides an understanding of why the research question is important and its meaning. Spending time in reviewing published literature reviews can serve as a guide or model for understanding the components and style of a well-written literature review.

### Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines in interventional pain management, part I: introduction and general considerations [^116wktY4]. Pain Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines are part of modern interventional pain management. As in other specialties in the United States, evidence-based medicine appears to motivate the search for answers to numerous questions related to costs and quality of health care as well as access to care. Scientific, relevant evidence is essential in clinical care, policy-making, dispute resolution, and law. Consequently, evidence based practice brings together pertinent, trustworthy information by systematically acquiring, analyzing, and transferring research findings into clinical, management, and policy arenas. In the United States, researchers, clinicians, professional organizations, and government are looking for a sensible approach to health care with practical evidence-based medicine. All modes of evidence-based practice, either in the form of evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, or guidelines, evolve through a methodological, rational accumulation, analysis, and understanding of the evidentiary knowledge that can be applied in clinical settings. Historically, evidence-based medicine is traceable to the 1700s, even though it was not explicitly defined and advanced until the late 1970s and early 1980s. Evidence-based medicine was initially called "critical appraisal" to describe the application of basic rules of evidence as they evolve into application in daily practices. Evidence-based medicine is defined as a conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. Evidence-based practice is defined based on 4 basic and important contingencies, which include recognition of the patient's problem and construction of a structured clinical question, thorough search of medical literature to retrieve the best available evidence to answer the question, critical appraisal of all available evidence, and integration of the evidence with all aspects and contexts of the clinical circumstances. Systematic reviews provide the application of scientific strategies that limit bias by the systematic assembly, critical appraisal, and synthesis of all relevant studies on a specific topic. While systematic reviews are close to meta-analysis, they are vastly different from narrative reviews and health technology assessments. Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements that aim to help physicians and patients reach the best health care decisions. Appropriately developed guidelines incorporate validity, reliability, reproducibility, clinical applicability and flexibility, clarity, development through a multidisciplinary process, scheduled reviews, and documentation. Thus, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines represent statements developed to improve the quality of care, patient access, treatment outcomes, appropriateness of care, efficiency and effectiveness and achieve cost containment by improving the cost benefit ratio. Part 1 of this series in evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines in interventional pain management provides an introduction and general considerations of these 3 aspects in interventional pain management.

### Human resources for health: a framework synthesis to put health workers at the centre of healthcare [^115cQdS2]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Methods

We used a systematic review and framework synthesis approach to synthesise the evidence on human resources frameworks. The protocol for this systematic review was prospectively registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO — CRD42020216247)and the reporting of the review is compliant with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines.

Criteria for considering documents reporting frameworks

The eligibility criteria were developed following the SPIDER approach, as follows:

Sample: LMIC, based on the World Bank classification. We excluded studies intended for, carried out or applied to only high-income countries.

Phenomena of Interest: human resources for health management frameworks applied, for example, to human resources for health challenges or for improving health workers performance.

Design: all research and conceptual study design types were considered, except opinions, editorials or studies without an explicit research methodology.

Evaluation: frameworks that were used in addressing the human resources for health challenges, drawing out concepts or lessons learnt, findings and perceptions relating to human resources for health management frameworks in tackling health worker challenges.

Research type: qualitative studies, mixed-methods studies and any other study producing data related to the review question.

Although we had originally proposed in our protocol to exclude articles not entirely written in English at the level of full text screening, we eventually considered every identified article at this stage.

Information sources and search

We searched five relevant databases across the health, health systems and global health literature (Medline, Embase, CAB Global Health (covers grey literature), CINAHL (EBSCO) and WHO global Index Medicus (for grey literature). Based on this strategy, one of the authors (ONON) conducted snowballing searches over the selected articles' references to identify additional references.

Search strategy

The strategy involved search terms extracted from the research question for keywords such as 'health workforce', 'organisational policy', 'frameworks', 'low income countries' and 'lower middle-income countries' in the title and abstract. The keywords were adapted and applied to each database. The search strategy, including the full search strings used for all the different databases, is detailed in the supporting documents (online supplemental material 1). Additionally, citation searches were carried out on key references to identify additional relevant articles, while we also tried to identify additional articles by contacting experts. No date restriction was applied to the electronic databases searches.

### Wasted research when systematic reviews fail to provide a complete and up-to-date evidence synthesis: the example of lung cancer [^112soeT6]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Fig. 5
A new approach to synthesize evidence: live cumulative network meta-analysis. Starting from an initial NMA, a research community would regularly (e.g. every 3 months), search for, screen, and select trials with new results and, if any, extract data, assess the risk of bias, and update the NMA. NMA: network meta-analysis

We acknowledge that developing such methodology is challenging. In Table 2, we present some key challenges and potential solutions. The rigorous methodology of systematic reviews (exhaustive search of trials, minimizing subjectivity by independent duplicate assessments, assessing risk of bias within trials) is inherently demanding of resources and time, especially for a systematic review incorporating network meta-analysis. Moreover, keeping a systematic review up-to-date requires processes closer to those of rapid reviews (i.e. using accelerated and streamlined methods). Therefore, there is necessarily a trade-off between high-standard synthesis methods and real-time updating processes. Automated technologies may help define this trade-off by alleviating the burden of manual tasks for systematic reviewers. Several tools have been proposed to improve, hasten, and ease the search for trials, trial selection, extraction of data, and assessment of risk of bias. Live cumulative network meta-analysis may also raise issues regarding the current authoring and publishing system. Online posting may be more adequate to report periodically the findings of such "real-time" syntheses. Since Elliott et al. presented the theoretical framework of living systematic reviews, some examples have been published and have only partly addressed the aforementioned challenges; for instance, by using accompanying open-access websites to disseminate the updates of the systematic review.

### A primer on performing systematic reviews and meta-analyses [^112Knkb3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The number of systematic reviews published in the peer-reviewed literature has increased dramatically in the last decade, and for good reason. They have become an essential resource for clinicians who want unbiased and current answers for their clinical questions; researchers and funders who want to identify the most critical evidence gaps for study; payers and administrators who want to make coverage, formulary, and purchasing decisions; and policymakers who want to develop quality measures and clinical guidelines. Targeted to beginners interested in conducting their own systematic reviews and users of systematic reviews looking for a brief introduction, this primer (1) highlights the differences between review types; (2) outlines the major steps in performing a systematic review; and (3) offers a set of resources to help authors perform and report valid and actionable systematic reviews.

### Association of clinician diagnostic performance with machine learning-based decision support systems: a systematic review [^114KqXph]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

In addition to the issues already outlined, there was a marked heterogeneity in the metrics used to assess CDSSs. Together, these inconsistencies make a reliable comparison of the different systems almost impossible. The issue of performance comparability is well known to the field and initiated the creation of data challenges, notably in medical image analysis, to evaluate how competing algorithms perform on common data sets. This harmonization work should now be extended to the next phases of CDSS evaluation pathways, particularly when first used with human clinicians. Reporting guidelines would offer a practicable solution to this end.

Strengths and Limitations

The methodologic approach followed best practice standards for systematic reviews, and each step of the process was performed independently by at least 2 reviewers. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to put human clinicians, rather than the algorithms, at the forefront of a systematic review about the clinical use of ML-based CDSSs. This approach provides important information that nuances a commonly portrayed view that artificial intelligence may soon substantially improve clinician diagnostic performance across specialties. This approach also highlights the current lack of consideration of human factors when assessing the potential benefits of new CDSSs. In addition, this review provides material that can inform the development of further guidance on ML-based CDSS evaluation, complementing existing or upcoming reporting guidelines. Such guidance will be particularly relevant for safety and effectiveness evaluations before the execution of large-scale clinical trials.

This review has limitations. It is possible that some relevant literature was not retrieved owing to (1) the heterogeneous description of the target CDSSs across medical specialties, (2) the use of commercial names only in many studies, and (3) the only recent categorization of this technology in specialized search engines (machine learning was added as a MeSH term in PubMed in 2016). We addressed these issues by conducting a forward and backward literature search of the included studies as well as an additional search for common or new commercial names. Given the broad range of CDSSs evaluated herein, certain inclusion criteria had to be defined very precisely, and some of these definitions are debatable because there is no broad consensus in the literature.

### Methodologic issues in systematic reviews and meta-analyses [^111r2fni]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews of original research are increasing in number. Systematic reviews are distinct from narrative reviews because they address a specific clinical question, require a comprehensive literature search, use explicit selection criteria to identify relevant studies, assess the methodologic quality of included studies, explore differences among study results, and either qualitatively or quantitatively synthesize study results. Systematic reviews that quantitatively pool results of more than one study are called meta-analyses. Several organizations are collaboratively involved in producing high quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Familiarity with how to do a systematic review and meta-analysis will lead to greater skill in using this type of article. For clinicians, teachers, and investigators, systematic reviews and meta-analyses are useful sources of evidence.

TrialMind can make a comprehensive retrieval of studies from the literature

Finding relevant studies from medical literature like PubMed, which contains over 35 million entries, can be challenging. Typically, this requires the research expertise to craft complex queries that comprehensively cover pertinent studies. The challenge lies in balancing the specificity of queries: too stringent, and the search may miss relevant studies; too broad, and it becomes impractical to manually screen the overwhelming number of results. Previous approaches propose to prompt LLMs to generate the searching query directly, which can induce incomplete searching results due to the limited knowledge of LLMs. In contrast, TrialMind is designed to produce comprehensive queries through a pipeline that includes query generation, augmentation, and refinement. It also provides users with the ability to make further adjustments (Fig. 2 b).

### How is genetic testing evaluated? A systematic review of the literature [^114CZKgR]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

In contrast to our systematic review, the majority of reviews in the literature on evaluation frameworks for genetic tests have a narrative structure. The only three systematic reviews we retrieved are described as methods for the construction of an evaluation framework (ECRI, SynFRAME, Practical Framework), so their methodology is not strictly reported.

One limitation of our work might be a failure to retrieve some of the studies published in the gray literature. To maximize the sensitivity of the search, we used broad search terms, but these yielded results with low specificity; however, we corrected this during the selection process. Moreover, the comparison between the retrieved frameworks could have been affected by the fact that not all frameworks clearly defined their evaluation components, especially with respect to delivery models and organizational aspects.

In conclusion, the ACCE model proves to be a base for the technical appraisal of genetic tests. However, this model is not completely satisfying. We suggest the adoption of a broader HTA approach, including the assessment of the context-related evaluation dimensions (delivery models, economic evaluation, and organizational aspects). This approach would maximize population health benefits, facilitate decision-making and address the main challenges of the implementation of genetic tests, particularly in universal health care systems, where economic sustainability is a major issue.

### Demystifying the search button: a comprehensive PubMed search strategy for performing an exhaustive literature review [^113j2qqY]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

The ability to perform an effective search strategy comprises the foundation of any evidence-based discipline. Whether one is functioning in a clinical or research capacity, the assumption is that the expert suggestions offered arise from a complete review of the relevant literature. In systematic reviews and meta-analyses, this is taken a step further, necessitating that the methods of these exhaustive literature reviews be reproducible. The conveniences afforded by the basic PubMed search engine and algorithms, such as the "Related Citations" feature, provide powerful search tools but take much of the control out of the hands of the user. Blind usage of these hands-off methods weakens the user's ability to ensure a thorough, systematic, and reproducible search. A common solution to this problem is to limit the search strategy to include only the MEDLINE portion of the PubMed database, allowing for the usage of more robust, user-controlled search methods. Unfortunately, depending on the journal indexed, MEDLINE is often as much as a year behind the current research, leaving many of the most recent and relevant research citations out of the search results. The strategies presented in this article offer a solution to this problem.

The general landscape of PubMed has been previously described in a recent article by Lindsey and Olin. The objective of the current article is to augment that landscape by proposing a detailed method through which its many components may be employed and integrated into one highly efficient, reproducible, and exhaustive search strategy. True comprehension of this system provides the ability to create a master search for any topic. Furthermore, the many free tools provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the National Library of Medicine (NLM) through PubMed make it possible to receive timely notifications of citations, directly relevant to any area of one's field as they become available. Part I of this article discusses theories, methods, and key concepts for using medical subject headings (MeSH) to search PubMed's MEDLINE database, the less robust strategies necessary for searching the remaining non-MEDLINE database, and methods for restricting the less robust search tools to search only the non-MEDLINE database. Part II provides a step-by-step tutorial for implementing part I as well as methods for automating a search strategy so users may receive daily, weekly, or monthly ongoing updated results to their search query by email.

### Barriers and facilitating factors for conducting systematic evidence assessments in academic clinical trials [^113kZBE2]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

New clinical research requires a systematic assessment of the existing evidence; unnecessary or poorly informed clinical research is costly and unethical, limits the available funding for relevant and well-designed research, and diminishes the public's trust in science. A lack of a systematic assessment of prior research has led to thousands of patients being recruited into clinical trials and inadequately treated with no treatment or inferior control treatment well after the tested intervention was known to be effective. Nonsystematic reviews of the literature also often involve bias, with previous studies being selected to justify new research based on strategic considerations and preferences of the investigators, more often citing studies that have supportive, positive, and statistically significant findings vs those that have conflicting, negative, and nonsignificant findings. However, previous studies indicate that an evidence-based approach to clinical research remains insufficiently used.,

Previous research regarding the barriers and facilitating factors for using systematic reviews to justify and inform the design of new clinical trials is currently limited (search details are provided in eAppendix 1 in the Supplement). A survey conducted among delegates of the International Clinical Trials Methodology Conference in November 2015 found that time constraints were perceived as the biggest barrier to the use of systematic evidence synthesis when designing a new trial, followed by a belief that the trial was the first in the research area, a belief that previous trials were different from the current trial, financial constraints, and the fact that funders did not require systematic evidence synthesis. However, the response rate of the survey was only 17% (106 of 638 delegates), and 95% of registered delegates were from the UK and Ireland, severely limiting the validity and applicability of the survey.

### Interventions in the management of infection in the foot in diabetes: a systematic review [^111vJ5qQ]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The optimal approaches to managing diabetic foot infections remain a challenge for clinicians. Despite an exponential rise in publications investigating different treatment strategies, the various agents studied generally produce comparable results, and high-quality data are scarce. In this systematic review, we searched the medical literature using the PubMed and Embase databases for published studies on the treatment of diabetic foot infections as of June 2018. This systematic review is an update of previous reviews, the first of which was undertaken in 2010 and the most recent in 2014, by the infection committee of the International Working Group of the Diabetic Foot. We defined the context of literature by formulating clinical questions of interest, then developing structured clinical questions (PICOs) to address these. We only included data from controlled studies of an intervention to prevent or cure a diabetic foot infection. Two independent reviewers selected articles for inclusion and then assessed their relevant outcomes and the methodological quality. Our literature search identified a total of 15327 articles, of which we selected 48 for full-text review; we added five more studies discovered by means other than the systematic literature search. Among these selected articles were 11 high-quality studies published in the last 4years and two Cochrane systematic reviews. Overall, the outcomes in patients treated with the different antibiotic regimens for both skin and soft tissue infection and osteomyelitis of the diabetic foot were broadly equivalent across studies, except that treatment with tigecycline was inferior to ertapenem (± vancomycin). Similar outcomes were also reported in studies comparing primarily surgical and predominantly antibiotic treatment strategies in selected patients with diabetic foot osteomyelitis. There is insufficient high-quality evidence to assess the effect of various adjunctive therapies, such as negative pressure wound therapy, topical ointments or hyperbaric oxygen, on infection related outcomes of the diabetic foot. In general, the quality of more recent trial designs are better in past years, but there is still a great need for further well-designed trials to produce higher quality evidence to underpin our recommendations.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^111LvLiK]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline research questions and search strategies — CHEST guidelines are based on comprehensive and systematic reviews, with key clinical questions initially posed by expert panelists and frontline clinicians and then refined by methodologists and Executive Committee members into PICO elements (patient populations, interventions, comparators, and patient-important outcomes, not research end points). Methodologists create search strategies to comb MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and other databases (eg, CINAHL, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Web of Science), as well as the National Guidelines Clearinghouse and Guidelines International Network library; each search strategy is run in at least two databases without date limitations unless updating, with exceptions noted in individual methods. Manuscripts report the number of studies identified, screened, included, and excluded, and data from included studies are extracted into evidence tables.

### Identifying and resolving the frustrations of reviewing the improvement literature: the experiences of two improvement researchers [^113E2onG]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Box 1
Selected descriptions of QI in the literature

'QI is… a process of change in human behaviour,… driven largely by experiential learning'
'Modern QI concepts had their origins in the statistical process control measurements… the input is a work process needing improvement and the output is a new, improved version of the (existing) work process'
'Improvement science focuses on systematically and rigorously exploring 'what works' to improve quality in healthcare… the focus is… on structured quality improvement approaches, such as plan, do, study, act (PDSA) cycles'. 'Key elements… are the combination of a 'change' (improvement) combined with a 'method' (an approach or specific tools) to attain a superior outcome'. 'The combined and unceasing efforts of everyone — healthcare professionals, patients and their families, researchers, payers, planners and educators — to make the changes that will lead to better patient outcomes (health), better system performance (care) and better professional development'. 'Better patient experience and outcomes achieved through changing provider behaviour and organisation through using a systematic change method'

The search strategy and databases used by EJ and JF are included in online supplementary file appendix 1.

The methods we used to conceptualise the term 'quality improvement' have some limitations. For example, asking experts to clarify the nature of QI is subject to heterogeneity in opinions. We also made some concessions. For example, EJ used broad search terms such as 'quality adj2 improve$' (where the terms 'quality' and variations of 'improve' such as 'improvement' are identified within two words of each other). This captured titles such as 'Can quality circles improve hospital-acquired infection control?', which would not otherwise be identified by 'quality improvement'. However, this term also captured articles which described quality of care, rather than QI. To overcome problems with specificity, the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) 'Quality Improvement/' and 'TQM' are now in use, which guard against the possibility that review teams may not have thought of all relevant synonyms.

### Identifying and resolving the frustrations of reviewing the improvement literature: the experiences of two improvement researchers [^113DTpXw]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Background and Aims

Summarising quality improvement (QI) research through systematic literature review has great potential to improve patient care. However, heterogeneous terminology, poor definition of QI concepts and overlap with other scientific fields can make it hard to identify and extract data from relevant literature. This report examines the compromises and pragmatic decisions that undertaking literature review in the field of QI requires and the authors propose recommendations for literature review authors in similar fields.

Methods

Two authors (EJ and JF) provide a reflective account of their experiences of conducting a systematic literature review in the field of QI. They draw on wider literature to justify the decisions they made and propose recommendations to improve the literature review process. A third collaborator, (WC) co-created the paper challenging author's EJ and JF views and perceptions of the problems and solutions of conducting a review of literature in QI.

Results

Two main challenges were identified when conducting a review in QI. These were defining QI and selecting QI studies. Strategies to overcome these problems include: select a multi-disciplinary authorship team; review the literature to identify published QI search strategies, QI definitions and QI taxonomies; Contact experts in related fields to clarify whether a paper meets inclusion criteria; keep a reflective account of decision making; submit the protocol to a peer reviewed journal for publication.

Conclusions

The QI community should work together as a whole to create a scientific field with a shared vision of QI to enable accurate identification of QI literature. Our recommendations could be helpful for systematic reviewers wishing to evaluate complex interventions in both QI and related fields.

### ASH clinical practice guidelines: strategies to stay up-to-date [^1117KBNT]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

ASH Clinical Practice Guidelines updating strategies — pilot approaches include a living guideline approach and an annual monitoring strategy piloted in 2021. For the living approach, used for the ASH Guidelines on use of anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19, a research team continually and systematically searched for new evidence and then updated estimates, and when prespecified criteria were met the Guideline Panel voted to implement revised recommendations; however, the living approach was resource intensive, requiring both extensive time commitments from volunteers and ASH staff at significant cost, and is unlikely to be warranted or feasible for most ASH guidelines. The monitoring strategy, informed by a review of approaches by other international guideline developers and piloted in 2021, enlists a small working group of experts and a librarian to review new evidence and decide when a revision is required; the librarian initially refreshes the original literature search, limited to new systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and literature searches are also conducted to find studies of relevant new interventions, after which the expert working group advises the ASH Committee on Quality on whether the guidelines should be revised, retired, or continue to be monitored. For all guidelines, the monitoring process begins 2 years after the initial publication and is repeated annually until there is a decision to revise or retire; retirement would be warranted when a guideline is no longer valid or clinically relevant. ASH has completed this monitoring pilot process for 9 of its guidelines, and initially the subcommittee informed guideline panels that a revision would generally be warranted if there were new RCTs relevant to at least half of a guideline's existing recommendations, but this guidance was later abandoned because it proved overly simple and potentially restrictive.

### Systematic reviews and meta-analysis [^116Sejtb]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are important research tools in modern medicine. They serve to condense and clarify large amounts of data into resources that can educate clinicians, enhance patient care, help formulate clinical guidelines, and guide future research endeavors.

Methods

The existing literature, including recently updated guidelines, on systematic reviews and meta-analysis was reviewed and summarized.

Results

A brief background on the origins of systematic reviews is presented, and the advantages and disadvantages of this type of study are discussed. A step-by-step guide to conducting a proper systematic review is outlined, with many illustrative examples. The recently updated reporting guidelines for this type of study are included.

Conclusions

Using clinical examples and published guidelines, a framework is presented to help the reader properly conduct a systematic review. These guidelines also help the reader conduct a critical appraisal of systematic reviews published in the scientific literature. Even more importantly, principles regarding application of systematic review results to individual patients are addressed.

### Medical device regulation and oversight in African countries: a scoping review of literature and development of a conceptual framework [^113wUACy]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Regulatory and other governance arrangements influence the introduction of medical devices into health systems and are essential for ensuring their effective and safe use. Challenges with medical device safety, quality and use are documented globally, with evidence suggesting these are linked to poor governance. Yet, medical device regulation and oversight remain inadequately defined and described, particularly in low-income and middle-income settings. Through this review, we sought to examine the literature available on regulatory and oversight processes for medical devices in African countries. Following a systematic approach, we searched academic databases including PubMed, Embase (Ovid) and MEDLINE (Ovid), supplemented by search for grey literature and relevant organisational websites, for documents describing medical device regulation and oversight in African countries. We summarised the data to present key actors, areas for regulation and oversight and challenges. A total of 39 documents reporting regulation and oversight of medical devices were included for analysis. Regulatory and oversight guidelines and processes were reported as inadequate, including limited pre-market testing, reliance on international certifications and limited processes for post-market monitoring and reporting of adverse events. Challenges for regulation and oversight reported included inadequate funding, personnel and technical expertise to perform regulatory functions. The literature highlighted gaps in guidelines for donated medical devices and in information on governance processes at the national level. The current literature provides a general overview of medical device regulatory guidelines and limited evidence on the implementation of regulatory/oversight processes at national and especially subnational levels. We recommend further research to elucidate existing governance arrangements for medical devices within African countries and propose a conceptual framework to inform future studies. The framework provides entry points for careful examination of governance and oversight in policy and practice, the exploration of governance realities across the health system and the influence of wider system dynamics.

### How to write a systematic review [^111jvgNP]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the combination of the best available research evidence with clinical experience and patient needs. The concept of EBM as a part of clinical decision making has become increasingly popular over the last decade. In the hierarchy of studies meta-analysis and systematic reviews occupy the highest levels. A systematic review of a clinical question can be performed by following a relatively standard form. These techniques as described here can be performed without formal training. Systematic reviews conducted in this fashion can be used as a higher form of current concepts or as review articles and replace the traditional expert opinion narrative review.

### Painful total hip arthroplasty: a systematic review and proposal for an algorithmic management approach [^112ofVVP]. Pain Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The etiological diagnosis of painful primary total hip arthroplasty and its management is a complex clinical challenge for pain physicians. Extrinsic sources of pain in the hip joint might be efficiently treated by clinical pain units, although the topic remains controversial.

Objectives

To conduct a literature review and suggest an evidence-based algorithmic approach to managing painful hip arthroplasty.

Study Design

Systematic literature review with qualitative data synthesis.

Methods

We conducted an online search of Medline/Pubmed, Embase, Clinical Trials, and Cochrane database using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) and free terms on all biomedical literature published up to August 2019. Articles that described either the etiologies and management of painful primary total hip arthroplasty or the imaging techniques to specifically assess any of its causes were included. We collected the demographic data (gender, age, body mass index), main etiologies, diagnostic tests, and specific treatments applied in each study. Based on the reviewed evidence, we propose an algorithmic approach, with a special emphasis on etiologies that should be referred to pain clinics.

Results

Twenty-four studies were included for the synthesis, 16 of which were observational studies and 8 of which were non-systematic literature reviews that described a wide range of etiologies of painful primary total hip arthroplasty. The results showed that 2/3 of the causes of pain were intrinsic and need to be managed by orthopedic surgeons. One third of the etiologies were extrinsic and should be referred to pain clinics once intrinsic causes have been ruled out. Among extrinsic sources of pain, the most frequent was myofascial etiology.

Limitations

A publication bias might have been present due to the inclusion of studies published only in English, Spanish, and German. The included studies also had heterogeneous methodologies.

Conclusions

The current review suggests that painful hip arthroplasty is not a rare condition in clinical practice. We systematically reviewed etiologies and various treatments published in the literature and we suggest an algorithmic approach to management based on the available evidence. This approach incorporates the evidence regarding our knowledge of the etiologies, diagnosis, and management of chronic pain after total hip arthroplasty. Systematic review registration: The protocol was registered in PROSPERO the international prospective register of systematic reviews, ID CRD42020185663.

### Conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis in rehabilitation [^1156EtGE]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Systematic reviews are reviews of the literature using a step-by-step approach in a systematic way. Meta-analyses are systematic reviews that use statistical methods to combine the included studies to generate an effect estimate. In this article, we summarize 10 steps for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the field of rehabilitation medicine: protocol, review team and funding, objectives and research question, literature search, study selection, risk of bias, data extraction, data analysis, reporting of results and conclusions, and publication and dissemination. There are currently 64,958 trials that contain the word "rehabilitation" in CENTRAL (the database of clinical trials in the Cochrane Library), only 1246 reviews, and 237 protocols. There is an urgent need for rehabilitation physicians to engage and conduct systematic reviews and meta-analysis of a variety of rehabilitation interventions. Systematic reviews have become the foundation of clinical practice guidelines, health technology assessments, formulary inclusion decisions and to guide funding additional research in that area.

### Current state of ethics literature synthesis: a systematic review of reviews [^115JwSSM]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Selection

For the purpose of this meta-review on a still little-standardized review area we decided to apply rather sensitive and not too restrictive selection criteria. We selected all reviews that explicitly or implicitly indicated their objective to analyze and present ethics literature in a systematic manner. To be included, reviews had to be explicitly concerned with normative ethical considerations of medical topics; e.g. they had to pose an ethical question or determine ethical challenges. It was not deemed sufficient for the results of a review to be able to be regarded as "ethically relevant". Furthermore, reviews should have an identifiable description of at least some methodological elements describing a reproducible literature search (e.g. search terms, databases used, or inclusion/exclusion criteria). See Table 2. We labeled such reviews as semi-systematic reviews. Only those reviews that explicitly or implicitly reported on search, selection, analysis, and synthesis were labeled as (full) systematic reviews. Finally, we only included reviews written in English, German, or French.

Table 2
Inclusion/exclusion criteria: title/abstract level and full text level

Articles were selected first according to their title or abstract, and later by full text screening. See Table 2. All reviews for empirical, normative, and "mixed" literature were included at this stage. The in-depth analysis and corresponding data presented in this paper focused on the normative and mixed literature, because methodological particularities, especially concerning analysis and synthesis, have been much less widely discussed for normative and conceptual literature than for empirical research.

The selection was initially done by one researcher (MM). Then, a second researcher (HK) checked all the selection results (inclusion and exclusion) for consistency with the selection criteria. Discrepancies were discussed and successfully overcome via consensus-seeking discussions.

Because we aimed to assess the current state of the art of reviews of normative ethical literature, we did not exclude reviews that did not fulfill all PRISMA criteria. Depicting the state of art must also include reviews of "relatively bad" reporting quality. Also, it is possible that certain reviews demonstrate a fair reporting of analysis and synthesis of normative information but are not able to fulfill some basic PRISMA criteria. Excluding such reviews would deprive our review of important insights about how reviews of normative information are analyzing and synthesizing information. Nevertheless, we present slightly adapted PRISMA ratings as part of our results.

Apart from the reporting quality, it would also be impossible to assess the methodological quality of the included reviews because of the lack of specific quality assessment tools for reviews of normative ethics literature.

### A scoping review of professional identity formation in undergraduate medical education [^116Ju2SE]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Professional identity formation (PIF) in medical students is a multifactorial phenomenon, shaped by ways that clinical and non-clinical experiences, expectations and environmental factors merge with individual values, beliefs and obligations. The relationship between students' evolving professional identity and self-identity or personhood remains ill-defined, making it challenging for medical schools to support PIF systematically and strategically. Primarily, to capture prevailing literature on PIF in medical school education, and secondarily, to ascertain how PIF influences on medical students may be viewed through the lens of the ring theory of personhood (RToP) and to identify ways that medical schools support PIF.

Methods

A systematic scoping review was conducted using the systematic evidence-based approach. Articles published between 1 January 2000 and 1 July 2020 related to PIF in medical students were searched using PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC and Scopus. Articles of all study designs (quantitative and qualitative), published or translated into English, were included. Concurrent thematic and directed content analyses were used to evaluate the data.

Results

A total of 10443 abstracts were identified, 272 full-text articles evaluated, and 76 articles included. Thematic and directed content analyses revealed similar themes and categories as follows: characteristics of PIF in relation to professionalism, role of socialization in PIF, PIF enablers and barriers, and medical school approaches to supporting PIF.

Discussion

PIF involves iterative construction, deconstruction and inculcation of professional beliefs, values and behaviours into a pre-existent identity. Through the lens of RToP, factors were elucidated that promote or hinder students' identity development on individual, relational or societal levels. If inadequately or inappropriately supported, enabling factors become barriers to PIF. Medical schools employ an all-encompassing approach to support PIF, illuminating the need for distinct and deliberate longitudinal monitoring and mentoring to foster students' balanced integration of personal and professional identities over time.

### A practical guide to understanding systematic reviews and meta-analyses [^115MCoU1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

A systematic review is a transparent and unbiased review of available information. The published systematic review must report the details of the conduct of the review as one might report the details of a primary research project. A meta-analysis is a powerful and rigorous statistical approach to synthesize data from multiple studies, preferably obtained from a systematic review, in order to enlarge the sample size from smaller studies to test the original hypothesis and/or to generate new ones. The objective of this article is to serve as an easy to read practical guide to understand systematic reviews and meta-analyses for those reading them and for those who might plan to prepare them.

### A scoping review on pediatric sepsis prediction technologies in healthcare [^112thBvz]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

While our search strategy was broad, this approach to a scoping review for pediatric sepsis prediction was necessary for multiple reasons: inconsistencies in data reporting, endpoint definitions, patient characteristics, and the range of development strategies. The significant heterogeneity among the included studies subsequently limited our ability to compare performance outcomes systematically. Notably, most studies were retrospective, and some included small sample sizes. However, the reviewed studies, including some of those that were excluded (Supplementary Table 1), can inform eligibility criteria in future systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Future research can also address the identified limitations for future reviews through standardized reporting and analysis with specific patient cohorts — including high-risk segments, social determinants of health, and specific age groups. Aligning future endpoint definitions with the 2024 consensus criteria will also increase the capacity for rigorous and systematic analyses in this critical area.

Overall, this comprehensive scoping review highlights the heterogeneity of data-driven approaches for predicting sepsis-related outcomes in children and the challenges in translating current research into clinical practice. While promising approaches for improving pediatric sepsis prediction exist, they must be pursued with an awareness of the nuanced disparities across healthcare settings and patient demographics. In working towards enhancing patient outcomes in this vulnerable population, the 2024 international consensus criteria for pediatric sepsis and septic shockand standardized reporting practices can guide future research. Furthermore, there is a need to integrate clinical user perspectives and prioritize human factors in both the development and evaluation of predictive systems, specifically for prediction timings, approaches to automation, and supporting clinical judgment. The incorporation of this design component in future research will be critical to advancing the safe and effective implementation of data-driven pediatric sepsis prediction technologies.

### Methodology for ACOEM's occupational medicine practice guidelines-2025 revision [^115CjwHs]. ACOEM (2025). High credibility.

Clinical practice guideline–systematic review intersection — CPG developers should use systematic reviews that meet standards set by the Institute of Medicine's Committee on Standards for Systematic Reviews of Comparative Effectiveness Research. When systematic reviews are conducted specifically to inform particular guidelines, the GDG and systematic review team should interact regarding the scope, approach, and output of both processes. The ACOEM Guidelines relies on systematic reviews conducted in accordance with the highest standards to provide current guidance on the relevant clinical questions. ACOEM also utilizes Cochrane systematic reviews, in addition to other scientific systematic reviews that meet or exceed the IOM's Committee on Standards for Systematic Reviews of Comparative Effectiveness Research. The Research Team staff conduct exhaustive systematic literature reviews for each guideline topic/question. In order to identify all high- and moderate-quality original research studies, the literature search is broad and comprehensive. Medical Terms (MeSH Terms) are used to identify studies relevant to answer the questions regarding the treatments and diagnostic procedures. A combination of MeSH terms and other terms are typically used in order to determine the method that will yield the most relevant studies in the search process. ACOEM searches PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for primary sources of original research. ACOEM conducts extensive supplementary searches using review articles, systematic reviews, and reference lists of the included and excluded studies.

### Medical leadership competencies for physicians: a systematic scoping review [^1173WnBr]. BMJ Leader (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The concept of 'medical leadership' has emerged as a critical issue in healthcare, prompting numerous countries to adopt measures toward enhancing leadership competency among physicians. This includes the development of medical leadership competency models. This scoping review aims to map and systematise the existing literature on generalised medical leadership competency models and context-specific leadership competencies for physicians, providing a comprehensive framework for future research.

Methods

This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for the scoping review framework. A comprehensive search was conducted across peer-reviewed academic databases and grey literature sources.

Results

16 generalised medical leadership models and 13 context-specific competency studies were identified. While most models have been developed in North America and Europe, context-specific competency studies have expanded globally. Frequency analysis highlights the significant influence and application of medical leadership competency models from the UK, the United States, Canada and Switzerland.

Conclusion

A comparative analysis across countries emphasises the importance of considering contextual and cultural factors when developing and implementing medical leadership competencies. Over the last three decades, medical competency development has reflected a shift towards collective leadership within healthcare, with a focus on team-based, patient-centred approaches in the increasingly complex healthcare systems. Additionally, there is a growing need for competencies that address emerging challenges in healthcare, such as cultural sensitivity, crisis management, business skills and digital literacy.

### Ethics of wearable-based out-of-hospital cardiac arrest detection [^116QDza5]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Search Strategy and Selection Criteria

All data and supporting materials have been provided with the published article. This review was preregistered at the PROSPERO international register of systematic reviews (CRD42022370906). Because the literature specific to ethical challenges with wearable-based OHCA detection is nonexistent, a broad search string was constructed on wearable health technologies used for patient monitoring or location tracking in different health care settings, which could be applied to the case of wearable-based OHCA detection. The search string was constructed in collaboration with a librarian and consisted of a combination of three major concepts: ethics, health, and wearables. These were expanded with related terms, such as (1) moral, privacy, and bias; (2) health care, cardio, and medical; and (3) smartwatch, tracking, and mHealth. The entire search string can be found in. PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL were searched for academic literature published up to December 2023. Articles were included or excluded based on the criteria in Table 1.

Table 1.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria of the Systematic Literature Search

Search results from the three databases were merged in EndNote 20, where duplicates were removed. A total of 7033 articles were screened by the first author on title and abstract in AS Review. After the initial selection, the remaining 169 papers were screened in full text by two authors (ME and MARB) using Covidence, a web-based collaboration software tool for literature reviews. Reference lists of the included articles were searched to find additional relevant literature. After the article selection, relevant ethical challenges in the literature were labeled based on the four principles' approach of Beauchamp and Childress. These principles (i.e. beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice) provide a comprehensive and widely used framework for analyzing and addressing ethical challenges in health care. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed, but the quality assessment was considered unsuitable because of the conceptual nature of the ethics literature; all other Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses criteria were used for reporting findings.

### Rapid reviews methods series: guidance on literature search [^114bjECu]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Information sources and methods

To optimise the balance of search sensitivity and precision, RR teams should prioritise the most relevant information sources for the topic and the type of evidence required. These can include bibliographic databases (eg, MEDLINE/PubMed), grey literature sources and targeted supplementary search methods. Note that this approach differs from the Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews Standardswhere the same core set of information sources is required for every review and further supplemented by additional topic-specific and evidence-specific sources.

Choosing bibliographic databases

For many review topics, most evidence is found in peer-reviewed journal articles, making bibliographic databases the main resource of systematic searching. Limiting the number of databases searched can be a viable option in RRs, but it is important to prioritise topic-appropriate databases.

MEDLINE has been found to have high coverage for studies included in SRsand is an appealing database choice because access is free via PubMed. However, coverage varies depending on topics and relevant study designs. Additionally, even if all eligible studies for a topic were available in MEDLINE, search strategies will usually miss some eligible studies because search sensitivity is lower than database coverage. This means searching MEDLINE alone is not a viable option, and additional information sources or search methods are required. Known relevant records can be used to help assess the coverage of selected databases (see also online supplemental appendix C).

### When and how to update systematic reviews [^112LbvWN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Systematic reviews are most helpful if they are up-to-date. We did a systematic review of strategies and methods describing when and how to update systematic reviews.

Objectives

To identify, describe and assess strategies and methods addressing: 1) when to update systematic reviews and 2) how to update systematic reviews.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (1966 to December 2005), PsycINFO, the Cochrane Methodology Register (Issue 1, 2006), and hand searched the 2005 Cochrane Colloquium proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included methodology reports, updated systematic reviews, commentaries, editorials, or other short reports describing the development, use, or comparison of strategies and methods for determining the need for updating or updating systematic reviews in healthcare.

Data Collection and Analysis

We abstracted information from each included report using a 15-item questionnaire. The strategies and methods for updating systematic reviews were assessed and compared descriptively with respect to their usefulness, comprehensiveness, advantages, and disadvantages.

Main Results

Four updating strategies, one technique, and two statistical methods were identified. Three strategies addressed steps for updating and one strategy presented a model for assessing the need to update. One technique discussed the use of the "entry date" field in bibliographic searching. Statistical methods were cumulative meta-analysis and predicting when meta-analyses are outdated.

Authors' Conclusions

Little research has been conducted on when and how to update systematic reviews and the feasibility and efficiency of the identified approaches is uncertain. These shortcomings should be addressed in future research.

### Health literacy and health outcomes in persons living with HIV disease: a systematic review [^115t8zC9]. AIDS and Behavior (2019). Medium credibility.

Low health literacy is associated with challenges for those living with HIV including medication non-adherence and poorer health outcomes. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on health literacy and health outcomes in persons living with HIV. The extended guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, as well as A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklist were utilized to guide the approach to the review. A variety of electronic databases including PubMed, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and Cochrane Library were searched. Additional literature available on U.S. government websites was also included in the search. Search terms were used in a variety of combinations and included HIV, health literacy, adherence, and health outcomes. Forty-eight studies were identified that addressed health literacy and health outcomes in HIV. Although several studies in this review did not provide robust results of statistical significance linking health literacy with health outcomes, all of the studies addressed the key significance of health literacy within the scope of living with HIV disease. The relationship between health literacy and the identified health outcomes requires further research and explication.

### Conducting a high-quality systematic review [^114Dg6aM]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Systematic reviews (SRs) are a structured means of knowledge synthesis used by a variety of healthcare practitioners to aid in medical decision making. The SR, if conducted rigorously, is considered to be at the top of the hierarchy for research studies. In addition to synthesizing evidence, SRs identify research priorities, address questions that may not be answerable by individual studies, and identify gaps to be addressed in future primary research. There are several steps that need to be taken when developing SRs to provide the best available evidence-the most essential being the assessment of risk of bias (ROB). Several ROB tools have been developed for use according to study design. Increasingly used is the assessment of certainty of evidence using approaches such as those developed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) working group. Whereas ROB is assessed for individual studies, the certainty of evidence is assessed for each critical or important outcome across studies. Analysis can be quantitative (metaanalysis) or qualitative (narrative), with the former intended to develop estimates of the effect measure (ie, the statistic that compares collated data), with confidence limits around that estimate. This review will focus on the steps required to develop SRs, from registration of the review protocol to the conduct, analysis, and reporting, with a focus on the assessment of ROB and certainty of evidence to ensure the development of a methodological and rigorous process.

### Methodologies for the development of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^11781PdA]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST cough guideline development framework — living guidelines and evidence grading states that CHEST has embarked on a model of creating living guidelines to continually update recommendations as new evidence, pharmacotherapies, or medical technologies become available and now uses a more rigorous approach to grading evidence resulting in the downgrading of much of the cough research in some clinical areas. Where there are insufficient levels of evidence to create recommendations based on a systematic search of the literature, consensus suggestions are developed and revised using a modified Delphi approach, and CHEST's consensus-based approach combined with the evidence-based model results in a hybrid process supported by both evidence and expertise. The 2006 guidelines called for an empirical integrated approach to the diagnosis and management of cough, proposed future directions for research, and defined two new terminologies: upper airway cough syndrome and unexplained cough.

### Rapid reviews methods series: guidance on literature search [^114un3mK]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

This paper is part of a series of methodological guidance from the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group. Rapid reviews (RR) use modified systematic review methods to accelerate the review process while maintaining systematic, transparent and reproducible methods. In this paper, we address considerations for RR searches. We cover the main areas relevant to the search process: preparation and planning, information sources and search methods, search strategy development, quality assurance, reporting, and record management. Two options exist for abbreviating the search process: (1) reducing time spent on conducting searches and (2) reducing the size of the search result. Because screening search results is usually more resource-intensive than conducting the search, we suggest investing time upfront in planning and optimising the search to save time by reducing the literature screening workload. To achieve this goal, RR teams should work with an information specialist. They should select a small number of relevant information sources (eg, databases) and use search methods that are highly likely to identify relevant literature for their topic. Database search strategies should aim to optimise both precision and sensitivity, and quality assurance measures (peer review and validation of search strategies) should be applied to minimise errors.

### Systematic reviews and meta-analysis of published studies: an overview and best practices [^1136qFp5]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews and meta-analytic approaches are widely used in the clinical arena to integrate outcome data from published studies in a patient population that address a set of related research hypotheses. The credibility of this line of research is dependent on how the studies are chosen, how the data are assembled, and how the results are reported. In this brief report, we provide an overview of the minimum set of reporting requirements for systematic reviews and meta-analyses based on the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. As with any research, following a set of established guidelines is essential for quality and consistency of the findings across studies and for assessment of clinical utility.

### Meta-analysis in clinical research: an overview of the statistics of evidence synthesis [^111BTXvR]. Hospital Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric research is often faced with ethical and logistical challenges. Pediatric literature is dominated by studies that are performed to answer similar questions but of small sample size, varying in methodology, results, and conclusions. Therefore, evidence synthesis methods are necessary for summarizing existing evidence and recognizing gaps in knowledge. A systematic review is used to summarize evidence in conjunction with meta-analysis, a statistical technique that combines results from studies to generate a summary estimate with CIs. Systematic reviews with meta-analysis represent the highest level in the hierarchy of evidence to inform clinical practice. Meta-analysis, by combining studies, increases precision and may help determine certainty of evidence for a specific clinical question. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses allow the clinician to explore reasons for variability and heterogeneity. Based on the intended research question, several types of meta-analysis are available, which must be chosen appropriately. We review the principles and types of meta-analyses that are used to summarize clinical evidence. We also summarize the common strengths (eg, increasing precision) and limitations (eg, publication bias and study heterogeneity) of a meta-analysis. Our review will inform clinicians on appraising published meta-analyses and may equip them with a framework and methods to perform their own.

### The state of medical education on criminal justice health: a systematic review [^113FLe7w]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The justice-involved population faces significant health disparities yet is often overlooked in medical education, resulting in medical providers having limited preparation to serve this community. The objective of this study is to understand the scope and context of medical education in correctional healthcare.

Methods

Literature was systematically reviewed for curriculum on correctional healthcare aimed at undergraduate or graduate medical learners in U.S. educational institutions. The search strategy was developed with the guidance of a medical research librarian and included five literature databases, which were analyzed by two data analysts. The risk of bias was assessed using the appropriate Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists.

Results

Our search identified 49 studies highlighting 95 unique curricula. Curricula were evenly split between the undergraduate (n = 44) and graduate (n = 50) level. The two most represented specialties were psychiatry (n = 43) and general medicine (n = 30). Educational modalities included clinical rotation (n = 48), didactics (n = 14), or a combination (n = 28). Curricula increased knowledge in correctional and specialty-specific medicine and improved attitudes towards justice-involved patients; however, there was no significant effect on plans to work with the justice-involved population. Common themes of curricula included treating justice-involved patients with respect (n = 23), structure and function of the legal system (n = 20), and career recruitment (n = 16).

Discussion

There is limited education on the care of the justice-involved population and most learners are unlikely to experience education on this population during their training despite the extensive and unique health and psycho-social needs of this population. Quality of education remains variable and challenging to assess due to limited outcome data and the low quality of literature; however, our thorough search strategy and standardized approach allow for a complete and accurate representation of the literature.

### Methodological issues in systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies in orthopaedic research [^113LpTEn]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2009). Low credibility.

The validity and applicability of a systematic review depends on the quality of the primary studies that are included and the quality of the methods used to conduct the review itself. Sometimes, observational studies represent the best available evidence. Subject to selection, information, and confounding biases, observational studies are thought to overestimate treatment or exposure effects. A systematic review of observational data must therefore attempt to minimize or prevent these sources of bias by developing explicit but also broad inclusion and exclusion criteria focused on extracting the best available evidence relevant to the review question. Systematic reviews must also make use of an expansive search strategy, with use of multiple resources, to demonstrate the reproducibility of selection and quality-assessment criteria, to perform a quantitative analysis and adjustment for confounding where appropriate, and to explore possible reasons for differences between the results of the primary studies. In this paper, we address the advantages and limitations of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies and suggest solutions at the design phase of protocol development.

### Do systematic reviews on pediatric topics need special methodological considerations? [^113KgJYC]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Search strategy

Given the vast amount of research (e.g. currently 24 million citations of biomedical literature in PubMed alone), clinicians and researchers seeking research studies for targeted pediatric age subgroups, for example adolescence or neonates, need to target their literature searches so that the retrieved information is relevant to their patient population. Moreover, bibliographic databases have varying definitions of "child" and other age-based terms, inconsistent with other databases. Titles and abstracts of pediatric specific research describe the age of the study population very inconsistently, if at all. Pediatric systematic reviews have been reported to be particularly weak in terms of the comprehensiveness in their search to identify primary studies. Consequently, search filters have been developed, tested and validated to capture pediatric studies. A study by Kastner et. al. determined the retrieval characteristics of age-specific search terms in MEDLINE for pediatric and neonatal medicine and found that highest sensitivity and specificity was achieved by a combination of MESH terms and key words (pediatric medicine - 98 and 81.2% and neonatal medicine - 95.3 and 83.6%, respectively). While PRISMA recommends to present the full electronic search strategy, description of any tested pediatric search filters used in the systematic review including sensitivity and precision of the search filters for retrieving child health systematic reviews would improve the appropriateness of search methods used in the pediatric systematic review.

### Operationalization of artificial intelligence applications in the intensive care unit: a systematic review [^113i9J3p]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

This systematic review used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guideline. Prior to the literature search, this review was registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database. We continued a previous searchin publicly available databases and update findings and publications, transforming this in an AI-ICU LSR. This approach is essential for ensuring the review remains current and relevant in the rapidly evolving field of AI in health care, incorporating previous findings, allowing for longitudinal comparisons over time, effectively capturing progress, and concurrently identifying key challenges.

Search Strategy

The search was continued in 5 databases (Embase, MEDLINE ALL, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar) from July 28, 2020, to June 10, 2024. The search strategy was expanded with terms for generative AI and reinforcement learning due to recent advancements in these areas. The medical library of the Erasmus Medical Center assisted with the development of the search strategy. The databases were searched for keywords and synonyms for intensive care unit, artificial intelligence, and decision support. To capture the full scope of the development and deployment of generative AI in health care, the search strategy was modified to include non–decision support studies for generative AI. This adjustment was made given the anticipated use of generative AI for administrative purposes. The full search strategy is available in eAppendix 1 in Supplement 1.

Inclusion Criteria

Publications were considered for inclusion if they evaluated an AI application designed for use within the ICU, focused exclusively on adult patients (aged ≥ 16 years), were available in English in full text, and were published as original research. Publications were excluded when the data used to train the model were not collected during ICU stay or when the scope of the model extended beyond the ICU. An AI application was defined as the outcome of an algorithm trained on large datasets. Only publications stating that the model belongs to the AI domain or its synonyms were accepted. Publications were eligible if they evaluated AI models for clinical impact. Both peer-reviewed literature and preprints were included in the analysis. Detailed inclusion criteria are provided in eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1.

### The American Society of Addiction Medicine clinical practice guideline development methodology [^1111Jv8t]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Synthesis of evidence — systematic reviews include a qualitative synthesis that is a narrative description of what the evidence shows at a high level, including similarities and differences across studies, key studies that contribute the most, applicability to different populations or settings, and clarifying what is known and gaps in evidence; some systematic reviews may also include a quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis), and the study team determines whether clinical heterogeneity across studies is too great to conduct a meta-analysis and notes that clinical trials lend themselves more readily to meta-analysis than observational studies (with some exceptions); if there are many meaningful differences across studies a meta-analysis could be misleading, whereas assessing results across studies with some small differences can be an advantage, and the team – usually with a statistician with expertise in meta-analysis – can explore heterogeneity statistically and conduct subgroup and sensitivity analyses and even meta-regression analyses for larger bodies of literature; the systematic review team will also note the certainty of evidence supporting each finding using well-established criteria such as those proposed by the GRADE working group.

### Machine learning for understanding and predicting neurodevelopmental outcomes in premature infants: a systematic review [^112wzbPR]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Machine learning has been attracting increasing attention for use in healthcare applications, including neonatal medicine. One application for this tool is in understanding and predicting neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants. In this study, we have carried out a systematic review to identify findings and challenges to date.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Four databases were searched in February 2022, with articles then screened in a non-blinded manner by two authors.

Results

The literature search returned 278 studies, with 11 meeting the eligibility criteria for inclusion. Convolutional neural networks were the most common machine learning approach, with most studies seeking to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes from images and connectomes describing brain structure and function. Studies to date also sought to identify features predictive of outcomes; however, results varied greatly.

Conclusions

Initial studies in this field have achieved promising results; however, many machine learning techniques remain to be explored, and the consensus is yet to be reached on which clinical and brain features are most predictive of neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Impact

This systematic review looks at the question of whether machine learning can be used to predict and understand neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants. Our review finds that promising initial works have been conducted in this field, but many challenges and opportunities remain. Quality assessment of relevant articles is conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. This work identifies challenges that remain and suggests several key directions for future research. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first systematic review to explore this topic.

### Identifying and resolving the frustrations of reviewing the improvement literature: the experiences of two improvement researchers [^115RDcAk]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Our literature reviews required considerable debate to design a suitable search strategy, identify studies which could be defined as QI and categorise interventions into groups. In this account, we describe such debates as a 'black box' and we attempt to unravel why debate arose and the compromises and pragmatic solutions we employed to resolve them. We have termed this a 'black box' because typically debates such as why some papers were excluded and not others, are not included in scientific reporting, but authors are encouraged to explain when much arbitration was required to resolve disputes. Second, we justify the compromised and perhaps 'imperfect' decisions we made. Finally, by sharing what we learnt in the field of QI we make recommendations for others in fields characterised by similar complexity. To improve the credence of the paper, a third collaborator author (WC), challenged views of authors EJ and JF on the problems and solutions of conducting a review of literature in QI. She drew on her experiences of QI research and of writing a narrative synthesis (outside the field of QI) on the perceptions of patients and healthcare workers in women's' health.

### The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluate healthcare interventions: explanation and elaboration [^111iUGD6]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Explanation The search strategy is an essential part of the report of any systematic review. Searches may be complicated and iterative, particularly when reviewers search unfamiliar databases or their review is addressing a broad or new topic. Perusing the search strategy allows interested readers to assess the comprehensiveness and completeness of the search, and to replicate it. Thus, we advise authors to report their full electronic search strategy for at least one major database. As an alternative to presenting search strategies for all databases, authors could indicate how the search took into account other databases searched, as index terms vary across databases. If different searches are used for different parts of a wider question (such as questions relating to benefits and questions relating to harms), we recommend authors provide at least one example of a strategy for each part of the objective. We also encourage authors to state whether search strategies were peer reviewed as part of the systematic review process.

We realise that journal restrictions vary and that having the search strategy in the text of the report is not always feasible. We strongly encourage all journals, however, to find ways — such as a "web extra", appendix, or electronic link to an archive — to make search strategies accessible to readers. We also advise all authors to archive their searches so that (1) others may access and review them (such as replicate them or understand why their review of a similar topic did not identify the same reports), and (2) future updates of their review are facilitated.

Several sources provide guidance on developing search strategies. Most searches have constraints, such as relating to limited time or financial resources, inaccessible or inadequately indexed reports and databases, unavailability of experts with particular language or database searching skills, or review questions for which pertinent evidence is not easy to find. Authors should be straightforward in describing their search constraints. Apart from the keywords used to identify or exclude records, they should report any additional limitations relevant to the search, such as language and date restrictions (see also eligibility criteria, item 6).

### Statistical methods to adjust for treatment switching in real-world clinical studies: a scoping review and descriptive comparison [^1158ck2F]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Finally, many of the identified methods remain challenging to implement in practice, as they are not readily available in commonly used statistical software packages (e.g. SPSS, STATA). This lack of accessibility can pose a significant barrier for applied researchers, particularly those without advanced programming expertise. To address this challenge, future research should focus on developing and publishing tutorial articles that provide step‐by‐step guidance on their application, along with ready‐to‐use software code for platforms such as R and SAS. Such resources would facilitate a broader adoption of these methods and enhance the quality of RWD studies.

Strengths and limitations

This review provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches to adjust for treatment switching in RWD studies. We employed an extensive search strategy across two databases, supplemented by a snowball search, and conducted a thorough synthesis of statistical methods, detailing their assumptions, advantages, and disadvantages to support epidemiologists and clinical researchers in selecting the most appropriate approach. Nonetheless, our study has some limitations.

First, we identified 45 relevant studies, with 20 obtained through our systematic search and an additional 25 through snowballing. The relatively low number of studies retrieved through the systematic search alone likely reflects challenges in identifying relevant articles using database searches, as treatment switching methodologies are often not explicitly indexed or described in study abstracts. To address this, we employed an extensive snowballing approach, which allowed us to identify additional relevant studies missed in the initial search. This difficulty in study identification may also explain why a previous review included fewer relevant articles than our study.

Explanation: Reporting the full details of all search strategies (such as the full, line by line search strategy as run in each database) should enhance the transparency of the systematic review, improve replicability, and enable a review to be more easily updated. Presenting only one search strategy from among several hinders readers' ability to assess how comprehensive the searchers were and does not provide them with the opportunity to detect any errors. Furthermore, making only one search strategy available limits replication or updating of the searches in the other databases, as the search strategies would need to be reconstructed through adaptation of the one(s) made available. As well as reporting the search strategies, a description of the search strategy development process can help readers judge how far the strategy is likely to have identified all studies relevant to the review's inclusion criteria. The description of the search strategy development process might include details of the approaches used to identify keywords, synonyms, or subject indexing terms used in the search strategies, or any processes used to validate or peer review the search strategies. Empirical evidence suggests that peer review of search strategies is associated with improvements to search strategies, leading to retrieval of additional relevant records. Further guidance and examples of reporting search strategies can be found in PRISMA-Search.

### Motivations, challenges, and attitudes to self-management in kidney transplant recipients: a systematic review of qualitative studies [^111Bfneq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Kidney transplantation offers better outcomes compared to dialysis, but requires patients to adhere to an ongoing and complex self-management regimen. Medication nonadherence remains a leading cause of transplant loss, and inadequate self-management undermines transplantation and other health outcomes. We aimed to describe kidney transplant recipients' motivations, challenges, and attitudes toward self-management.

Study Design

Systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies.

Setting & Population

Kidney transplant recipients.

Search Strategy & Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched to October 2014.

Analytical Approach

Thematic synthesis.

Results

50 studies involving 1,238 recipients aged 18 to 82 years across 19 countries were included. We identified 5 themes: empowerment through autonomy (achieving mastery, tracking against tangible targets, developing bodily intuition, routinizing and problem solving, and adaptive coping), prevailing fear of consequences (inescapable rejection anxiety, aversion to dialysis, minimizing future morbidity, trivialization and denial, and defining acceptable risks), burdensome treatment and responsibilities (frustrating ambiguities, inadvertent forgetfulness, intrusive side effects, reversing ingrained behaviors, and financial hardship), overmedicalizing life (dominating focus, evading patienthood, and succumbing to burnout), and social accountability and motivation (demonstrating gratitude toward medical team, indebtedness to donor, and peer learning).

Limitations

Non-English articles were excluded.

Conclusions

Self-efficacy and social accountability are motivators for self-management, although adherence can be mentally and physically taxing. Multicomponent interventions incorporating personalized care planning, education, psychosocial support, decision aids, and self-monitoring tools may foster self-management capacity and improve transplantation outcomes.

### Rapid reviews methods series: guidance on literature search [^113mdKjt]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Conclusion

Decisions about search methods for an RR need to consider where time can be most usefully invested and processes accelerated. The literature search should be considered in the context of the entire review process, for example, protocol development and literature screening: Findings of preliminary searches often affect the development and refinement of the research question and the review's eligibility criteria. In turn, they affect the number of records retrieved by the searches and therefore the time needed for literature selection.

For this reason, focusing only on reducing time spent on designing and conducting searches can be a false economy when seeking to speed up review production. While some approaches (eg, text analysis, automated syntax translation) may save time without negatively affecting search validity, others (eg, skipping quality assurance steps, using convenient information sources without considering their topic appropriateness) may harm the entire review. Information specialists can provide crucial aid concerning the appropriate design of search strategies, choice of methods and information sources.

For this reason, we consider that investing time at the outset of the review to carefully choose a small number of highly appropriate search methods and optimise search sensitivity and precision likely leads to better and more manageable results.

### A systematic review of electronic community resource referral systems [^111NjY5Z]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Community Resource Referral Systems delivered electronically through healthcare information technology systems (e.g., electronic medical records) have become more common in efforts to address patients' unmet health-related social needs. Community Resource Referral System connects patients with social supports such as food assistance, utility support, transportation, and housing. This systematic review identifies barriers and facilitators that influence the Community Resource Referral System's implementation in the U.S. by identifying and synthesizing peer-reviewed literature over a 15-year period.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. A search was conducted on five scientific databases to capture the literature published between January 2005 and December 2020. Data analysis was conducted from August 2021 to July 2022.

Results

This review includes 41 articles of the 2,473 initial search results. Included literature revealed that Community Resource Referral Systems functioned to address a variety of health-related social needs and were delivered in different ways. Integrating the Community Resource Referral Systems into clinic workflows, maintenance of community-based organization inventories, and strong partnerships between clinics and community-based organizations facilitated implementation. The sensitivity of health-related social needs, technical challenges, and associated costs presented as barriers. Overall, electronic medical records-integration and automation of the referral process was reported as advantageous for the stakeholders.

Discussion

This review provides information and guidance for healthcare administrators, clinicians, and researchers designing or implementing electronic Community Resource Referral Systems in the U.S. Future studies would benefit from stronger implementation science methodological approaches. Sustainable funding mechanisms for community-based organizations, clear stipulations regarding how healthcare funds can be spent on health-related social needs, and innovative governance structures that facilitate collaboration between clinics and community-based organizations are needed to promote the growth and sustainability of Community Resource Referral Systems in the U.S.

### Junior doctor experiences and challenges in obtaining surgical informed consent: a qualitative systematic review and meta-ethnography [^114Dmppv]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Surgical informed consent (SIC) to procedures is necessary to ensure patient autonomy is adequately respected. It is also necessary to protect doctors, and their institutions, from claims of negligence. While SIC is often acquired by senior consultants, it also commonly falls to the junior doctors on a team to ensure SIC is adequately acquired and documented. A growing body of literature suggests that junior doctors are not sufficiently educated about the legal and practical issues concerned with obtaining medical consent. This may open up this cohort, and their hospitals, to medico-legal liability.

Aims

to provide a systematic review of the qualitative literature on junior doctors' experiences and challenges in consenting surgical patients and to synthesize evidence on this issue in order to guide policy-makers in the medicolegal and medical education spheres.

Methods

a systematic review of qualitative literature was performed. Analysis of the literature was guided by Noblit and Hare's seven-step approach to meta-ethnography, with the final synthesis presented as a thematic analysis of the literature.

Conclusion

This research concludes that a significant proportion of SIC is likely to be acquired by junior doctors, many of whom are Post-Graduate Year (PGY) 1–2 and who lack adequate training and education. This cohort face challenges in assessing capacity, in ensuring adequate disclosure related to surgical procedures, and in adequately documenting consent. This may impact the validity of any SIC they acquire. Medical educators and policy-makers should be aware of these issues when creating policies impacting SIC, and when designing surgical education programs for medical students and junior doctors alike.

### The American Society of Addiction Medicine clinical practice guideline development methodology [^116qohQ9]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) guideline methodology — literature search and study selection emphasizes that a quality literature search is an important first step guided by someone trained in literature search methodology, with databases such as PubMed, OVID MEDLINE, PsycINFO, AHRQ, and the Cochrane Library and, depending on topic, inclusion of "gray literature" (websites, governmental reports, conference abstracts). There is not currently a well-validated method for computerized identification of studies; typically, a search includes a relatively large number of titles and abstracts reviewed by study team members. There is no "correct" number, but a small yield (e.g., 100–200 or less) may indicate the strategy was too narrow, while a very large yield (e.g., 5000–7000 or more) may indicate it is too broad. The initial review of titles and abstracts is used to very quickly identify studies that are clearly irrelevant and can be safely excluded at the abstract level and to flag potentially promising studies for review at the "full-text" level.

### Chronic kidney disease and support provided by home care services: a systematic review [^1154c3U9]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

One of the strengths of our study is the comprehensive SR conducted on a topic where there were, to the best of our knowledge, no previous SR undertaken. The comprehensive electronic database searches coupled with hand searches and expert consultations resulted in the identification of several gaps in the literature.

Our study has several limitations. One of the limitations of our study is arising from the subject matter itself. HC, as encompassing a diverse set of medical and psycho-social services, is one of the health services research areas that are constantly evolving with limited standardization in terminology. Our study which focused on the intersection of home care with CKD faced additional challenges given the changes in CKD definition itself in the past years that is continuing through today. We made an attempt to balance this fundamental limitation by conducting comprehensive database searches, extensive hand searches and expert consultations. Second limitation of our study is the layered approached followed in study selection. Third limitation is the focus on studies published in English. Given the diversity of HC services, resource and time considerations were crucial factors in our decision to follow a layered study selection approach and to focus on studies published in English. As indicated above, we made an attempt to balance these limitations by conducting comprehensive database searches, extensive hand searches and expert consultations. Another limitation is our inability to conduct a meta-analysis for our study. The diversity of patient populations, HC interventions and outcomes studied made it impossible to conduct a meta-analysis.
