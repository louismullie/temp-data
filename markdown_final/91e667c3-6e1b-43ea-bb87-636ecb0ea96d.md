## Question

What's the medication that helps with allergies that last for 6 months?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what medication helps with allergies that last for 6 months. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this means perennial allergic rhinitis (persistent symptoms for much of the year) versus a fixed 6‑month treatment course. Then, I should review first-line continuous pharmacotherapy for persistent symptoms. Next, I will consider adjunctive options and when to escalate to allergen immunotherapy. Finally, I should verify safety, duration expectations, and shared decision-making points from contemporary guidelines and labels [^113a27BG] [^111rAJqm] [^113z3pRh].

> Wait, let me verify the intent: there is no single "6‑month allergy drug" per se; rather, for allergies that persist over months, we treat the underlying inflammatory rhinitis continuously and reassess control, whereas any disease‑modifying option (immunotherapy) generally requires multi‑year treatment, not a 6‑month course [^111rAJqm] [^115y7qA1] [^113z3pRh].

> Next, I should review first‑line therapy for persistent nasal symptoms. Intranasal corticosteroids are the cornerstone because they directly suppress the chronic nasal mucosal inflammation seen in persistent/perennial allergic rhinitis; they are favored over antihistamines for global nasal control and are suitable for continuous daily use in long‑duration disease; examples include budesonide (Rhinocort Aqua), ciclesonide (Omnaris), and beclomethasone (Qnasl) with labeled indications for seasonal/perennial allergic rhinitis across pediatric and adult ages, which supports ongoing use during prolonged symptomatic periods [^116Lkoz1] [^114WiwRt] [^115RBhZB] [^117BuJzf].

> Hold on, I should verify adjunctive symptom controllers. Second‑generation oral H1‑antihistamines (e.g., fexofenadine, cetirizine, loratadine, levocetirizine) are recommended for sneezing and itching and may be taken daily in a sustained manner for persistent symptoms; they are preferred over first‑generation agents due to less sedation and cognitive impairment; for example, fexofenadine 180 mg once daily is a labeled dose for adult seasonal allergic rhinitis and is commonly used off‑season for perennial symptoms as needed in combination with intranasal steroids, while avoiding sedating first‑generation antihistamines when possible [^112zsYQw] [^1129cT5F] [^115zC7ms] [^116uXdX3].

> Let me consider escalation when control is inadequate despite optimized pharmacotherapy and avoidance. Allergen immunotherapy (SCIT or SLIT) should be considered for moderate to severe allergic rhinitis not controlled with avoidance and/or medications, with decisions made via shared decision‑making; importantly, I should confirm duration expectations — both SCIT and SLIT are generally continued for a minimum of 3 years to achieve disease modification and long‑term tolerance rather than a 6‑month course; choice of route can be individualized as efficacy is established for both, with counseling on risks, benefits, convenience, and costs [^111rAJqm] [^115y7qA1] [^112ETqWm] [^113HCXeK].

> But wait, what if ocular symptoms are prominent during those months? I need to check if targeted ocular therapy adds benefit; topical antihistamine/mast‑cell stabilizer drops such as cetirizine ophthalmic solution can rapidly reduce ocular itching and redness and may also help associated nasal symptoms, serving as an adjunct to intranasal steroids and oral antihistamines during prolonged symptomatic periods [^114iGqzV] [^112j6r69].

> I should confirm that environmental measures and diagnosis are addressed in parallel, since persistent symptoms over 6 months often reflect perennial allergen exposure; tailored allergen avoidance (e.g., dust mite control, pet strategies) and confirming allergic versus nonallergic rhinitis phenotypes can improve outcomes and guide whether to pursue immunotherapy if pharmacologic control is suboptimal, reinforcing that management is individualized and guided by shared decision‑making and reassessment over time [^11643ugA] [^113z3pRh] [^111rAJqm].

> Hmm, wait a minute — at first I wondered whether there might be a standard "6‑month" medication regimen to recommend, but I should correct that thinking: guidelines do not endorse a fixed 6‑month course for persistent allergic rhinitis; instead, they support continuous intranasal corticosteroids (plus nonsedating antihistamines as needed), with escalation to multi‑year allergen immunotherapy for disease modification when appropriate [^113a27BG] [^115y7qA1] [^111rAJqm].

> Putting this together, the clinically sound path for "allergies that last 6 months" is: start or optimize a daily intranasal corticosteroid as the anchor therapy; add a daily second‑generation oral antihistamine for prominent sneezing/itching; layer ocular antihistamine drops if eye symptoms are significant; reinforce allergen avoidance; and if control remains inadequate after a fair trial (e.g., 3–6 months of optimized therapy and adherence), evaluate for allergen immunotherapy with counseling that efficacy requires at least 3 years for durable benefit, not a 6‑month course [^116Lkoz1] [^112zsYQw] [^111rAJqm] [^115y7qA1].

---

For allergic symptoms lasting 6 months, **intranasal corticosteroids** (e.g. fluticasone, mometasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, beclomethasone, triamcinolone) provide the most effective long-term control because they are safe for chronic use and address persistent inflammation [^116Lkoz1]. **Second-generation antihistamines** (e.g. cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine) are suitable for daily use with minimal sedation [^115zC7ms] and can be combined with intranasal steroids for added relief. For refractory symptoms, **allergen immunotherapy (SCIT or SLIT)** [^112ETqWm] is recommended to reduce symptoms and medication needs [^111rAJqm] [^113a27BG].

---

## Intranasal corticosteroids (INCS)

Intranasal corticosteroids are the cornerstone of long-term management for **perennial allergic rhinitis**, effectively reducing nasal inflammation, congestion, sneezing, and itching, and are safe for chronic use [^116Lkoz1].

- **Fluticasone propionate**: Effective for perennial allergic rhinitis; minimal systemic absorption; safe for long-term use.

- **Mometasone furoate**: Effective for perennial allergic rhinitis; minimal systemic absorption; safe for long-term use.

- **Budesonide**: Effective for perennial allergic rhinitis; minimal systemic absorption; safe for long-term use [^114WiwRt].

- **Ciclesonide**: Effective for perennial allergic rhinitis; minimal systemic absorption; safe for long-term use [^115RBhZB].

- **Beclomethasone dipropionate**: Effective for perennial allergic rhinitis; minimal systemic absorption; safe for long-term use [^117BuJzf].

- **Triamcinolone acetonide**: Effective for perennial allergic rhinitis; minimal systemic absorption; safe for long-term use.

Intranasal corticosteroids remain the preferred **first-line therapy** [^116Lkoz1] for perennial allergic rhinitis given their efficacy and safety profile.

---

## Second-generation antihistamines

Second-generation antihistamines are suitable for long-term use due to their **minimal sedation** [^115zC7ms] and favorable safety profile [^112zsYQw]. They effectively relieve sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea.

- **Cetirizine**: Effective for perennial allergic rhinitis; minimal sedation; safe for long-term use [^111RPkEM].

- **Loratadine**: Effective for perennial allergic rhinitis; minimal sedation; safe for long-term use.

- **Fexofenadine**: Effective for perennial allergic rhinitis; minimal sedation; safe for long-term use [^116uXdX3].

- **Levocetirizine**: Effective for perennial allergic rhinitis; minimal sedation; safe for long-term use [^113MkxPh].

Second-generation antihistamines can be used alone or in combination with **intranasal corticosteroids** for enhanced symptom control.

---

## Allergen immunotherapy (AIT)

Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is recommended [^111rAJqm] for patients with **persistent allergic symptoms** despite pharmacotherapy, as it modifies the underlying allergic response, providing long-term symptom relief and reducing medication dependence [^115y7qA1]. Within AIT, **subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT)** is administered by healthcare professionals as regular injections over several years, whereas **sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)** is taken orally at home with daily dosing over several years [^114UqM8Q]; both are effective for perennial allergic rhinitis [^112ETqWm]. AIT is particularly beneficial for patients with **moderate to severe allergic rhinitis** who do not respond adequately to pharmacotherapy [^113z3pRh].

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy — for example, an intranasal corticosteroid plus a second-generation antihistamine — may benefit patients with persistent symptoms despite monotherapy by providing **enhanced symptom control** and improved quality of life [^112zsYQw].

---

## Safety considerations

Long-term use of intranasal corticosteroids and second-generation antihistamines is **generally safe**, but patients should be monitored for potential side effects. For **intranasal corticosteroids**, adverse effects include nasal irritation, dryness, epistaxis, and rare systemic effects such as growth suppression in children and adrenal suppression. Second-generation antihistamines are associated with minimal sedation and rare cardiovascular effects like **QT prolongation** [^115zC7ms]. Regular follow-up and monitoring are essential to ensure **safety and efficacy** [^113a27BG].

---

## Patient-specific factors

The choice of medication depends on **patient-specific factors**, including age, comorbidities, symptom severity, and preferences. Shared decision-making between patients and healthcare providers is essential to optimize treatment outcomes [^113a27BG].

---

Intranasal corticosteroids are the preferred **first-line therapy** for perennial allergic rhinitis given their efficacy and safety. Second-generation antihistamines are suitable for **long-term use** and can be combined with intranasal corticosteroids for enhanced symptom control. Allergen immunotherapy is recommended for patients with **persistent symptoms** despite pharmacotherapy [^111rAJqm].

### First do no harm: Managing antihistamine impairment in patients with allergic rhinitis [^115zC7ms]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Antihistamines are effective medications that have been used for decades in the management of allergic rhinitis; however, they may be administered or selected in an inappropriate fashion and may be the source of drug-related morbidity. Our objective is to present relevant background information and an expert consensus statement on the use of antihistamines in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. In July 2002, 14 experts in allergy, clinical immunology, pharmacology, and impairment assessment were invited to participate in a roundtable conference to present concepts and develop a consensus statement on the clinical management of allergic rhinitis with antihistamines.

Many of the antihistamines used to treat allergic rhinitis, as well as the disease itself, may produce sedation, impairment, and reduced quality of life. Allergic rhinitis is more appropriately managed with the relatively non-impairing second-generation antihistamines (e.g. loratadine, desloratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine) because older agents (e.g. diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and brompheniramine) produce sedation and impairment and worsen sleep architecture. Although there is some debate surrounding the varying degrees of efficacy of second-generation antihistamines, it is known that some agents may produce varying levels of drowsiness or impairment, especially at higher than recommended doses. The differences with regard to safety among the second-generation antihistamines are smaller than the differences between the first and second generations.

### Minimal persistent inflammation in allergic rhinitis: Implications for current treatment strategies [^116Lkoz1]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with allergic rhinitis have traditionally been categorized into 'seasonal' and 'perennial' groups. These classifications do not account for the subclinical inflammatory state present in many patients. In individuals with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, even subthreshold doses of allergens can lead to inflammatory cell infiltration in the nasal mucosa. This includes increases in the expression of cellular adhesion molecules, nasal and conjunctival eosinophilia, and other markers of inflammation that do not result in overt allergy symptoms.

This subclinical state, termed 'minimal persistent inflammation', may contribute to hyperreactivity and an increased susceptibility to the development of clinical symptoms. It is also associated with common comorbidities of allergic rhinitis, such as asthma. Managing both the overt allergy symptoms and the underlying inflammatory state requires agents that have established clinical efficacy, convenient administration, potent anti-inflammatory effects, and proven long-term safety. This ensures that long-term continuous administration is feasible.

Of the three major classes of commonly used medications for allergic rhinitis — intranasal corticosteroids, antihistamines, and antileukotrienes — intranasal corticosteroids appear to be the most reasonable therapeutic option. They are particularly suitable for patients who would benefit from the continuous inhibition of persistent inflammation.

### The impact of allergies and allergy treatment on worker productivity [^111fuQGN]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Allergic disorders are a chronic and highly prevalent condition in the general population and the workforce. Their effect on workers and corporate costs goes beyond the direct cost of treatment, as the condition can lower a worker's productivity. Previous research includes estimates of the decrease in productivity associated with allergic disorders. None of these studies, however, offered an objective measure of how worker productivity is affected by allergic disorders.

In the present study, the productivity of telephone customer service representatives suffering from allergic disorders is examined before, during, and after the ragweed pollen season. In addition, these workers were surveyed as to the type of medication they used in response to their condition. A significant correlation was observed between an increase in pollen counts and a decrease in productivity for workers with allergies. Compared with workers without allergies, employees with allergies who reported using no medication showed a 10% decrease in productivity. No differences were observed among workers with allergies using different types of medications, although the medication groups had significantly higher productivity than the no-medication group. The expected lowered productivity of those workers with allergies who used sedating antihistamines may have been offset by their relatively lower level of symptom severity and by the nature of the job and the productivity measures used.

### The year in food allergy [^112xUkBs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Research into food allergies continues to rapidly evolve, driving real changes in the clinical approach to these diseases. The past year has seen the rollout of the first treatment approved for the active management of food allergies, more data on alternative methods of treatment, the continued evolution of strategies for prevention, a renewed interest in phenotyping food allergy subtypes, and, importantly, key new insights into the pathophysiology of food allergy. We expect that, in the coming years, therapies currently in preclinical or early clinical evaluation will make their way to the clinic, finally allowing the possibility of safe and effective treatments for food allergy.

The EAACI 2014 guidelines provide recommendations for nonpharmacologic interventions in cases of milk protein allergy, particularly concerning the use of hydrolyzed infant formulas. These guidelines advise against the use of soy formulas before 6 months of age and recommend avoiding them at any age if gastrointestinal symptoms are present. It is suggested that soy formulas can be considered on a case-by-case basis for patients between 6 and 12 months of age.

### Future research trends in understanding the mechanisms underlying allergic diseases for improved patient care [^1129325V]. Allergy (2019). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHR) is mainly based on skin tests and drug provocation tests, methods that are not free of risk, still lack standardization, and differ depending on the drug, mechanisms, and even the health system. There is an urgent need for developing new in vitro diagnostic tests or improving those already existing, such as the basophil activation test, to enhance the diagnostic workup. The complexity of DHR diagnosis and its lack of optimal specificity lead to an over‐diagnosis. This is an important problem, as patients "labeled" as allergic receive alternative treatments that are usually less effective and more toxic, so "de‐labeling" constitutes a public health measure. Primary care physicians are often the first point of contact for patients with DHRs; thus, they have a key role in diagnosis and need specific training.

Although the specific treatment of DHRs is avoiding the drug involved and those chemically related, desensitization is nowadays a frequent option. In that sense, rapid drug desensitization is a cost‐effective technique that activates inhibitory mechanisms and permits patients to receive the first‐choice medications to which they are allergic.

- **Research needs for DHRs**:
	- The prevalence and incidence of DHRs
	- Underlying mechanisms of DHRs
	- The most adequate classification of DHRs
	- Definition of endotypes and biomarker identification
	- The most accurate diagnostic approach:
		- Skin test standardization, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values for most drugs
		- A standardized protocol for performing tests

### How to define and manage low-risk drug allergy labels [^1136rEKY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

After antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the second most common drug class causing hypersensitivity reactions, described in up to 3.5% of the population. NSAIDs may induce a variety of reactions, although most occur within 6 hours and are cutaneous, such as urticaria and angioedema. However, systemic reactions, such as severe anaphylaxis and delayed skin reactions (e.g. fixed drug eruptions or Stevens-Johnson syndrome), have also been reported from NSAIDs.

- **Classification of NSAID-induced reactions**: This is based on clinical history (e.g. reaction timing and characteristics), presence of comorbid conditions, and drug challenges. NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema/anaphylaxis (NIUAA) is the most common phenotype, representing more than 40% of reported reactions in adults. Symptoms are typically elicited by potent cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitors, with isolated cutaneous symptoms reported most commonly. However, 9% to 28% of adults may report reactions consisting of blended features with symptoms or signs extending beyond the skin or anaphylaxis.

- **Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU)**: Up to 30% of patients with CSU experience an acute exacerbation of their disease after NSAID exposure, termed NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease (NECD). Notably, patients with NECD may tolerate NSAIDs during CSU remission or clinical control.

- **Respiratory reactions and comorbid conditions**: Patients with underlying asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, and nasal polyposis may react with acute respiratory reactions to COX-1 inhibitors in the context of aspirin- or NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD).

### Transition between subcutaneous and sublingual allergen immunotherapy: Recommendations of the Brazilian Association of Allergy and Immunology (ASBAI) [^113ojPe3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Low credibility.

What precautions should be taken when switching from SCIT to SLIT? The safety of SLIT allows for a change in application route with minimal chance of adverse effects. Patients must have controlled allergic disease. Patients and/or caregivers should be counseled on how to properly perform SLIT. As applications will occur daily or several times a week, the need for adherence to treatment to obtain the desired effects should be reinforced.

The Immunotherapy Department of the Brazilian Association of Allergy and Immunology offers the following recommendations:

- **Use extracts from the same supplier**: Preferably, use extracts from the same supplier.
- **Switching from SCIT to SLIT after induction phase completion**: If the patient undergoing SCIT has already completed the induction phase, the switch to SLIT can be performed by using doses recommended for maintenance from the beginning.
- **Perform periodic clinical evaluation**: Conduct periodic clinical evaluations, initially monthly, so that the effects of the treatment are analyzed.
- **Dose adjustment after evaluation**: After clinical evaluation, adjust the dose when necessary to increase effectiveness and/or prevent adverse effects.

### Quality of life indices may be predictive of placebo and medication response to treatment for allergic rhinitis [^1179mHQ7]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Quality of life (QOL) is known to be an important clinical endpoint in determining medication efficacy; however, the predictive value of QOL indices for response to medication or placebo has not been tested.

- **Objective**: To determine whether a correlation between measures of QOL and response to medication/placebo exists in an evaluation of budesonide for allergic rhinitis.

- **Methods**: Two hundred nine participants completed the 36-item short-form health QOL survey at screening for entry into a study examining the onset of action of budesonide in an allergen challenge system. During the treatment phase, symptom assessments were recorded hourly after dosing of double-blind medication. Participants were determined to be responders or nonresponders to study medication. A responder was defined as a participant who rated medication effectiveness as fair to excellent with regard to symptom relief for three consecutive hourly assessments during the study day or one whose total symptom score decreased by ≥ 25% for three consecutive hourly assessments. Baseline QOL scores were compared between responders and nonresponders.

- **Results**: Differences were noted among responders and nonresponders on the basis of whether budesonide or placebo was received. Ratings of general health perception, pain, physical function, and role limitation due to physical health were significantly lower among participants who responded to placebo compared with placebo nonresponders. In addition, the overall physical health and 36-item short-form health survey averages were significantly lower.

### Treatment outcomes associated with dupilumab use in patients with atopic dermatitis: 1-year results from the RELIEVE-AD study [^112DKeEP]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

The importance of this study lies in addressing the gap between clinical trial populations and real-world clinical practice. Insights from various settings can contribute significantly to clinical decision-making.

The objective was to evaluate self-reported disease control and quality of life after the initiation of dupilumab treatment in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) within a clinical setting.

The study's design involved a cohort study using an online survey. This survey was administered prior to baseline and at subsequent intervals of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the initiation of dupilumab. It included adults diagnosed with moderate-to-severe AD who began treatment with dupilumab through the US patient support program and consented to participate in the study. Data were collected from January 2018 to January 2020, with analysis completed in May 2020.

The intervention involved clinically driven treatment with dupilumab.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Disease control was assessed using the Atopic Dermatitis Control Tool (ADCT). This included evaluating concomitant AD therapies, satisfaction with therapy, and skin symptoms such as skin pain/soreness, hot/burning feelings, and sensitivity to touch, assessed through numerical rating scales. Other factors included flares, health-related quality of life using the Dermatology Life Quality Index, sleep problems assessed using the ADCT item and a stand-alone question, and the AD-specific Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire.

Results showed that out of 699 patients who initiated dupilumab (431 [61.7%] female, 515 [73.7%] White), 632 and 483 completed the survey at months 1 and 12, respectively. As observed from the results, most patients achieved adequate disease control (ADCT total score) at month 1 and maintained control throughout the year.

### Eaaci food allergy and anaphylaxis guidelines: diagnosis and management of food allergy [^117XwvfE]. Allergy (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for food allergy, more specifically with respect to corticosteroid autoinjectors, the EAACI 2014 guidelines recommend considering a prescription for patient-held corticosteroids. These should be administered (self-administered if traveling far from medical care, otherwise in an emergency department) in the case of an allergic reaction to prevent late-phase respiratory symptoms.

### Primary prevention of allergy: Avoiding risk or providing protection [^114bFKpT]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Primary prevention strategies of allergy have historically focused on combating the causes of allergies by avoiding risk factors and inhibiting their mechanisms of action. However, the results of trials testing food or airborne allergen avoidance as a prevention strategy were rather disappointing. A reverse approach for primary prevention of allergies aims to facilitate exposure to protective factors that promote the induction of immunologic tolerance against innocuous antigens. These factors are associated with the farming environment and a 'traditional lifestyle', but identification of these factors is quite difficult. Major candidates include food-borne microbes and helminths or their components, which are able to stimulate mucosal immunity, particularly in the gut. Similarly, new preventive and therapeutic strategies are being tested to induce specific food-allergen oral tolerance through progressively increasing doses of the offending food. This shift in allergy prevention research from avoidance to tolerance induction will hopefully help reverse the epidemic trend of allergy diseases.

### The influence of selection bias on identifying an association between allergy medication use and SARS-CoV-2 infection [^11469qUA]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

To understand the association between medications frequently used to control allergy symptoms (diphenhydramine, cetirizine, and hydroxyzine) and testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, we performed a retrospective analysis. The target population consisted of all patients in a single, large academic medical center, UF Health, in Gainesville, Florida. From the electronic health records (EHR), we obtained data on race, ethnicity, sex, age, and insurance type at the date of encounter, as well as allergy diagnoses documented on the EHR problem list. The associated ICD10 codes were J30, Z91.0x, L51, L50, and T78.4x.

Additionally, we gathered information on SARS-CoV-2 testing and results and documentation of cetirizine, hydroxyzine, or diphenhydramine use in patient medication lists. Insurance type was grouped as public for patients with any documented use of public insurance over the study period. The analytic sample was restricted to all health system encounters of adults 18 years of age or older who had exclusively outpatient encounters documented in their EHR from October 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020.

- **Study period and scope**: We used an extended study period including a time period before the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in order to include non-COVID-19 disease-related outpatient visits where usual care, medications, and problems and diagnoses may be documented.

We limited the study to exclusively outpatient visits since testing for inpatient admissions or procedures were frequently on different dates and could not be consistently associated. Additionally, with many tests ordered to allow asymptomatic patients to receive whatever hospital-based care was needed, we sought to eliminate that source of testing bias.

### Management of urticaria: Not too complicated, not too simple [^114jg8SM]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Regarding the use of anti-H2 antihistamines, most guidelines except the American guidelines have removed this recommendation.

- **Should treatment for CSU be provided on-demand or in a sustained manner**: The beneficial effects of nonsedating H1-antihistamines given on demand appear to be low. **Key point**: Nonsedating H1-antihistamines should be given in a sustained manner.

- **Does antihistamine-induced somnolence affect its use in CSU**: It is well known that H1-antihistamines cause sedation, somnolence, and fatigue, leading to impairment of cognitive function, memory, and psychomotor performance. A position paper of the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA2LEN) highlights the risk posed by first-generation H1-antihistamines, all of which are sedating and are generally regarded as safe due to their long-standing use. Given the unwanted side effects and potential dangers of first-generation H1-antihistamines, newer, nonsedating second-generation H1-antihistamines with superior risk/benefit ratios are strongly recommended, as they are widely available at competitive prices. **Key point**: Nonsedating antihistamines are recommended for CSU treatment.

### Quality of life in patients with allergic reactions to medications: Influence of a drug allergy evaluation [^117LWWvk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

Suspicion of an allergic drug reaction can cause significant disturbances in a patient's life.

- **Objective**: We evaluated, in a prospective multicenter study, the quality of life of patients who suffered a possible allergic drug reaction and analyzed the effect of a drug allergy evaluation.

- **Methods**: Patients over 18 years old answered a specific questionnaire twice: before the drug allergy evaluation and one month after it was completed. Statistics were performed using STATA.

- **Results**: A total of 360 patients (240, 66.6% female; mean age, 45.4 years; standard deviation [SD], 15.6 years) completed the first questionnaire. After the evaluation, 150 of 346 patients (43.4%) were diagnosed as allergic to the drug (115 of 150 immediate; 35 of 150 delayed), and 196 of 346 patients (56.6%) were nonallergic. The mean score of the first questionnaire was 32.14 (SD, 11.84). Patients with anaphylaxis, a non-anaphylactic immediate reaction, more than one drug reaction, or chronic osteoarticular disease had a statistically significantly higher score in Q0 (indicative of worse quality of life). After the allergy study, the mean score of the second questionnaire was 27.27 (SD, 9.96), showing a global improvement [P < .001]. Factors such as being female [P = 0.018], aged over 40 years [P = 0.030], having a chronic osteoarticular disease [P = 0.003], and experiencing more than one reaction to drugs [P < .001] were associated with a statistically significant worse quality of life after the evaluation.

- **Conclusions**: The study demonstrated that an evaluation for drug allergies can lead to an improvement in quality of life, despite certain factors like chronic conditions or multiple drug reactions contributing to ongoing quality of life concerns.

### Management of IgE-mediated food allergy in the 21st century [^116ioDXi]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2023). High credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines, including those upcoming from the GA2LEN Task Force, recommend that the choice of product for OIT should be guided by affordability, quality of an alternative, risk–benefit, patient preference, and local context.

To improve the safety profile of FA-AIT, alternative routes, such as epicutaneous and sublingual, have been investigated. These methods use minute amounts of allergen that carry a very low risk of systemic reactions. However, they do not raise the reactivity threshold in the short term or as high as OIT would while taking the daily maintenance dose. Notwithstanding, they appear to induce comparable changes in the allergen immune response over time, which suggests they could potentially offer the same long-term benefits once off therapy. This will need to be formally assessed in head-to-head trials specifically designed to assess sustained tolerance.

The GA2LEN group indicates that epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) probably increases the proportion able to tolerate peanut during therapy (p < .05, RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.8–3.8, moderate certainty), and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) may result in a large increase in the proportion able to tolerate peanut during therapy (p < .05, RR 4.7, 95% CI 1.6–13.8, low certainty). It is unclear whether subcutaneous immunotherapy has any impact because the certainty of evidence was very low. The GA2LEN Task Force suggests offering peanut epicutaneous immunotherapy under specialist supervision using licensed pharmaceutical products if they become available to selected children.

### 2019 ARIA care pathways for allergen immunotherapy [^113z3pRh]. Allergy (2019). Low credibility.

Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is a proven therapeutic option for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and/or asthma. Many guidelines or national practice guidelines have been produced, but the evidence-based method varies; many are complex, and none propose care pathways. This paper reviews care pathways for AIT using strict criteria and provides simple recommendations that can be used by all stakeholders, including healthcare professionals. The decision to prescribe AIT for the patient should be individualized and based on the relevance of the allergens, the persistence of symptoms despite appropriate medications according to guidelines, as well as the availability of good-quality and efficacious extracts.

Allergen extracts cannot be regarded as generics. Immunotherapy is selected by specialists for stratified patients. Currently, no validated biomarkers can predict AIT success. In adolescents and adults, AIT should be reserved for patients with moderate/severe rhinitis or those with moderate asthma who, despite appropriate pharmacotherapy and adherence, continue to exhibit exacerbations that appear to be related to allergen exposure, except in some specific cases. Immunotherapy may be even more advantageous in patients with multimorbidity. In children, AIT may prevent asthma onset in patients with rhinitis. mHealth tools are promising for the stratification and follow-up of patients.

### Phase III trials examining the efficacy of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% compared to vehicle for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^112j6r69]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

The primary efficacy comparisons examined the mean differences between cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24%-treated eyes and vehicle-treated eyes for ocular itching and conjunctival redness. These assessments were made 8 hours (Visit 3B, Day 0) and 15 minutes (Visit 4, Day 14) after dosing with either the study drug or vehicle. Analyses were conducted at 3, 5, and 7 minutes post-CAC for ocular itching, and at 7, 15, and 20 minutes post-CAC for conjunctival redness and all secondary efficacy endpoints.

- **Secondary efficacy measures**: These included assessments of ciliary and episcleral redness, chemosis, eyelid swelling, tearing, nasal allergy symptoms (such as rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, ear or palatal pruritus, nasal congestion), and a composite score of nasal symptoms. Ocular itching, conjunctival redness, and other symptoms were assessed on a 5-point scale, where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = moderate/severe, and 4 = severe, both prior to and after the CAC.

Safety and tolerability were reported for three additional trials by Malhotra et al. (2018, co-submitted). Tolerability measurements included drop comfort and descriptors at Visit 3A. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, and dilated fundoscopy. All AEs were coded to system organ class and preferred term using MedDRA Version 16.1.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^113NQupb]. Resuscitation (2021). Low credibility.

Oral H1-antihistamines relieve the cutaneous symptoms of anaphylaxis; combined H1- and H2-antihistamines may be more effective than H1-antihistamines alone, although data are limited. However, cutaneous symptoms are not life-threatening and also respond to adrenaline (although the effect may not be long-lasting). The ASCIA 2020 guideline cautions against the use of sedating antihistamines as "side effects (drowsiness or lethargy) may mimic some signs of anaphylaxis". Antihistamines may be helpful in treating cutaneous symptoms that persist following resolution of anaphylaxis symptoms, but are not recommended until the acute reaction has been successfully treated with more appropriate interventions. A non-sedating oral antihistamine is preferred to avoid confounding due to the risk of sedation, which can indicate reaction progression.

### Recent insights into the mechanisms of anaphylaxis [^113E7nMw]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Anaphylaxis is an acute, life-threatening systemic allergic reaction that can have a wide range of clinical manifestations. The most common triggers for anaphylaxis include food, medication, and venom. It is curious how so many different agents can induce a severe systemic clinical response, but only in a select subgroup of patients. Over the past decade, several important advances have been made in understanding the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms contributing to anaphylaxis, with mast cells (MCs) being an essential component.

Classically, cross-linked immunoglobulin E (IgE) bound to its high-affinity receptor induces MC mediator release. However, toll-like, complement, or Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptors also activate mouse and human MCs. While anaphylaxis secondary to foods has historically been more extensively characterized clinically and mechanistically, more recent studies have shifted focus toward understanding drug-induced anaphylaxis. This review highlights recent basic science developments and compares what is currently known regarding anaphylaxis to food, medications, and venom.

### Short-course subcutaneous treatment with birch pollen allergoids greatly improves symptom and medication scores in birch allergy [^112w9tED]. Allergy (2025). High credibility.

Subcutaneous immunotherapy has emerged as an effective option for treating allergic diseases. Here, we assessed the clinical impact of the mannan-conjugated birch pollen polymerized allergoid T502 in birch pollen-induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.

In this prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled phase III trial, 298 birch pollen-allergic adult patients were treated across 28 trial sites in Germany. Patients received either placebo or 23,000 mTU T502 subcutaneously over five pre-seasonal visits. Efficacy was assessed by comparing the combined symptom and medication score (CSMS) between placebo and T502 during the peak birch pollen season of 2022. Safety, tolerability, and immunologic effects were also analyzed.

During the peak birch pollen season, the median CSMS of the T502 group was reduced by 33% (p = 0.002) compared to placebo. The median daily symptom score and daily medication score were reduced by 30.4% (p < 0.001) and 56.3% (p = 0.045), respectively. Health-related quality of life improved as reflected by a reduction of RQLQ values by 31.5% (p < 0.0001). Production of Bet v 1 sIgG4 and Bet v 1 sIgG increased up to 6.2-fold and 3-fold respectively in the T502 group (p < 0.0001). The sIgE/sIgG4 ratio was strongly reduced in the T502 group at V7 (−62.9%, p < 0.0001).

No fatalities or serious adverse events were reported. In total, 16 systemic allergic reactions occurred (Grade I/II).

Treatment with T502 significantly reduced symptoms and medication need in rhinoconjunctivitis patients.

### Allergen immunotherapy for long-term tolerance and prevention [^115y7qA1]. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Allergen immunotherapy is effective for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, and Hymenoptera venom allergy. In view of potential side effects, cost, and the necessary patient commitment, an important question is whether allergen immunotherapy provides persistent clinical benefits after treatment discontinuation. Here, we appraise the existing evidence for long-term effects of both subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy in terms of clinical efficacy, immune mechanisms, prevention of asthma development, and prevention of new allergen sensitizations. Evidence from large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials that include a follow-up phase after treatment cessation demonstrate long-term efficacy. The data strongly support recommendations in international guidelines that both sublingual and subcutaneous immunotherapy should be continued for a minimum of 3 years to achieve disease modification and long-term tolerance. Grass pollen immunotherapy for seasonal rhinitis may inhibit the onset of asthma symptoms and requirements for asthma medication. Whether early intervention in infancy with mite sublingual immunotherapy may prevent asthma remains to be tested.

### Skin testing as a biomarker in drug allergy [^1151qUXe]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Despite the significant negative impact drug allergies can have on patient care, the diagnosis is largely based on clinical history, and there are limited diagnostic tests that can be done at the time of a reaction. Biomarkers are needed to improve the diagnosis and the identification of the culprit medication. Skin testing is the most useful biomarker for immediate- and delayed-type reactions available, but it is limited by its low sensitivity. To improve its accuracy and reproducibility, a standardized procedure must be used.

For immediate-type reactions, penicillin skin testing is the most widely studied, and it can be used in patients with a history of anaphylaxis or recent immunoglobulin E-mediated reaction, or for those for whom there is a significant risk if a reaction were to occur, such as during pregnancy. Skin testing is also important in allergy to platinum agents, allowing for continued first-line therapy.

For delayed-type reactions, patch testing and delayed intradermal testing used in conjunction with clinical history can help to improve the identification of the culprit medication depending on the type of reaction. Other biomarkers, including in vitro testing for specific immunoglobulin E, basophil activation test, lymphocyte transformation test, ELISpot, and genetic factors that increase the likelihood of reaction, are under investigation. These may be most helpful when used in combination with the clinical history and skin testing results.

### Advances and highlights in biomarkers of allergic diseases [^114ewF3x]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

11 CONCLUSIONS

The assessment and management of allergic diseases is challenging since the pathological molecular mechanisms are complex and heterogeneous in their clinical presentation. Improvement of disease management requires a personalized treatment regimen, which requires well‐defined and reliable biomarkers to unravel the phenotypes and endotypes of allergic diseases. There is a Need to identify prognostic biomarkers to guide the selection of appropriate therapies and to monitor treatment efficacy. Several biomarkers have been studied in allergic diseases, but only a few are readily available for clinical use. Newly identified biomarkers based on omics and novel imaging techniques must be validated and standardized before they can be routinely applied in clinical practice. The development of robust biomarkers will facilitate precision medicine‐based treatment approaches for allergic diseases.

### Antihistamines: Do they work? Further well-controlled trials involving larger samples are needed [^111RPkEM]. Allergy (2004). Low credibility.

Histamine is a crucial factor in the phlogistic allergic reaction, with its activity resulting from specific receptors on the cellular surface. H1-receptors of the second generation are the most commonly prescribed drugs for allergic diseases due to their high selectivity, minimal or no central sedative effect, rapid onset of action, and long half-lives. Antihistamines can modulate portions of immunological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation. This includes reducing mediator release, controlling the expression of adhesion molecules, and regulating the release of cytokines and chemokines, consequently affecting inflammatory cell recruitment. The anti-inflammatory effects of cetirizine, desloratadine, and levocetirizine are reviewed. Quality of life is also considered a main parameter in the global evaluation of antihistamine effects.

### Levocetirizine dihydrochloride [^115EdYwg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of levocetirizine dihydrochloride 1.25 mg once daily (for children 6 months to 5 years of age) and 2.5 mg once daily (for children 6 to 11 years of age) in treating symptoms of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria is supported. This support comes from the extrapolation of the demonstrated efficacy of levocetirizine dihydrochloride 5 mg once daily in patients aged 12 years and older, based on pharmacokinetic comparisons between adults and children.

Cross-study comparisons indicate that administering a 5 mg dose of levocetirizine dihydrochloride to pediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis results in approximately twice the systemic exposure (AUC) compared to when 5 mg is administered to healthy adults. Therefore, in children aged 6 to 11 years, the recommended dose of 2.5 mg once daily should not be exceeded. In a population pharmacokinetics study, administration of 1.25 mg once daily in children aged 6 months to 5 years resulted in systemic exposure comparable to that of 5 mg once daily in adults [see Dosage and Administration (2.2); Clinical Studies (14); and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Pediatric use information for patients aged 6 months to 5 years is approved for UCB Inc.'s levocetirizine dihydrochloride drug product. However, due to UCB Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled for use in these pediatric patients.

- **Geriatric use**: Clinical studies of levocetirizine dihydrochloride for each approved indication did not include sufficient numbers of patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.

### Sublingual immunotherapy: Past, present, paradigm for the future? A review of the literature [^113z4cmK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Since the early 1900s, allergen immunotherapy has been recognized as an effective treatment option for patients with inhalant allergies. Subcutaneous injection has traditionally been the main route of antigen delivery for immunotherapy in the United States. Over the past 15 years, sublingual administration of allergen extract has become a widely used method of immunotherapy in other countries, particularly in Europe. Although sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) has been used by some physicians in the United States, this technique has not found widespread utilization.

A growing interest in SLIT use in this country is developing. SLIT offers several potential advantages, including excellent safety and tolerability, increased access to immunotherapy, and improved method of antigen delivery to children. This paper reviews the basic and clinical science data available in the literature concerning the immunology, efficacy, and safety of SLIT. It is written to serve as a springboard for future discussions and clinical investigations regarding the potential expanded use of SLIT in the United States.

### Management of urticaria: Not too complicated, not too simple [^1129cT5F]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Given the safety of most antihistamines, doses can be increased up to four times the standard dose on an individual basis.

- **Can switching from one antihistamine to another attain an individualized response**: According to the British, American, and EAACI 2014 guidelines, all patients should be offered a choice between two or more nonsedating H1-antihistamines, because individual differences in response and tolerance to different antihistamines have been reported.

- **Is it useful to combine different antihistamines (i.e. sedating and nonsedating)**: In patients with severe, recalcitrant urticaria for whom the standard dose is not effective, combinations of antihistamines are frequently used as another way of updosing. This might involve, for example, two different second-generation antihistamines, or a second-generation antihistamine in the morning and a first-generation antihistamine in the evening. However, first-generation antihistamines are no longer recommended in chronic urticaria, and the clinical benefit of combining antihistamines is probably limited when H1-receptors are already occupied by another H1-antihistamine.

There are no studies that demonstrate that treatment with the combined use of sedating and nonsedating antihistamines is more effective than updosing the same antihistamine.

- **Is it useful to combine H1- and H2-antihistamines**: Several relatively small studies have shown that combined use of H1-antihistamines and H2-antihistamines (cimetidine, ranitidine) may be more effective than using H1-antihistamines alone.

### Sublingual or subcutaneous immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis [^112ETqWm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). High credibility.

Allergen immunotherapy is effective in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and, unlike antiallergic drugs, has been shown to modify the underlying cause of the disease, with proven long-term benefits. Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) has been the gold standard, whereas sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) has emerged as an effective and safe alternative. Previous Cochrane systematic reviews and meta-analyses have confirmed that both SLIT and SCIT are effective in patients with seasonal AR, while evidence for their efficacy in patients with perennial disease has been less convincing.

Recent large, adequately powered trials have demonstrated reductions in both symptoms and use of rescue medication in patients with seasonal and perennial AR. Here we appraise evidence for SCIT versus SLIT based on indirect evidence from Cochrane reviews and recent well-powered double-blind, randomized controlled trials versus placebo and the limited direct evidence available from randomized blind head-to-head comparisons. At present, based on an overall balance of efficacy and side effects, the patient is in equipoise. Pending definitive comparative trials, the choice might be determined largely by the local availability of SCIT and SLIT products of proven value and personal (patient) preference.

### Antihistamines for the common cold [^112b2X1r]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Although antihistamines are prescribed in large quantities for the common cold, there is little evidence regarding whether these drugs are effective.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antihistamines in alleviating nasal symptoms or in shortening the duration of illness in patients with a common cold.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialized Register and EMBASE up to December 2002, as well as the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and MEDLINE up to February 2003. References in identified papers were followed up, and further articles were sought out at a major international conference on Acute Respiratory Infections in 1997. Additionally, we corresponded with experts and contacted pharmaceutical companies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized, placebo-controlled trials on the treatment of the common cold with antihistamines, either used singly or in combination, in adults or children were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted by two reviewers, and authors were contacted for further data. Trials were subdivided into monotherapy and combination therapy. Data on general recovery, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and side effects were extracted and summarized in a systematic review.

- **Main results**: We included thirty-two papers describing 35 comparisons; 22 trials studied monotherapy, and 13 trials studied a combination of antihistamines with other medications. A total of 8,930 people suffering from the common cold were included. There were large differences in study designs, participants, interventions, and outcomes. There was no evidence…

### Determining the minimal important differences in the RQLQ score with grass and tree allergy immunotherapy versus placebo in adults with moderate-to-severe allergy [^11127BhF]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

Pollen from grasses and trees can trigger allergic rhinitis (AR), where the symptoms and associated consequences negatively affect quality of life (QoL). The Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) is frequently used in clinical trials of AR to assess QoL. To help interpret RQLQ data, the minimal important difference (MID) is used to assess whether a mean difference in QoL between treatment groups is clinically meaningful. In seasonal allergies, an MID differs according to the allergen, pollen exposure, symptom severity, patient age, and treatment; the same MID cannot be applied to all scenarios.

- **Methods**: Using data from four phase III clinical trials of SQ sublingual immunotherapy tablets in adults with moderate-to-severe allergy, between-group MIDs were derived for the RQLQ in grass pollen allergy (during the peak [n = 501] and entire [n = 514] pollen seasons) and in tree pollen allergy (during the birch [n = 516] and tree [n = 518] pollen seasons). This was done using anchor-based methodology, supported by distribution-based methods.

- **Results**: For grass pollen allergy, anchor-based derived between-group MIDs were 0.22 for the entire pollen season (n = 343) and 0.10 for the peak pollen season (n = 335). For tree pollen allergy, anchor-based derived between-group MIDs were 0.26 for the tree pollen season (n = 306) and 0.16 for the birch pollen season (n = 305), which is representative of the peak season. Distribution-based derived MIDs were supportive of the anchor-based values.

- **Conclusions**: This analysis has derived between-group MIDs specific to the trial population.

### Advances and highlights in biomarkers of allergic diseases [^112Eijzc]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

Several recommendations and guidelines have been published regarding the management of allergic diseases during the COVID‐19 pandemic. In an EAACI position paper, Klimek et al. recommend continuing personalized intranasal corticosteroid treatment in CRS patients. A consensus statement written by the ARIA‐EAACI Task Force provides recommendations for asthma and COVID‐19 management. Continuation of prescribed therapy and proper control of asthma and other allergic diseases are necessary, as severe and often uncontrolled diseases may contribute to a higher frequency of life‐threatening exacerbations. Biological therapies are used to treat severe cases of type 2 diseases. Biological treatment in non‐infected patients during the COVID‐19 pandemic should be continued. Once SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is confirmed, biologicals should be stopped and proper baseline disease control should be assured. After patient recovery, biological treatment should be resumed. Activities that may lead to disease deterioration should be avoided to minimize doctor/hospital visits and reduce the risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Respiratory symptoms developed upon allergen exposures may be a source of distress and concern during the COVID‐19 pandemic, particularly during pollen seasons. The source of observed manifestations (COVID‐19 vs. allergy) should always be consulted with a physician (preferably via teleconsultation) and individually assessed with regard to the patient's status and comorbidities. It should be noted that in pollen-allergic patients, nasal symptoms can also develop during COVID‐19.

### Drug allergy: an updated practice parameter [^114Sp9gd]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) result in major health problems in the United States in both inpatient and outpatient settings. ADRs are broadly categorized into predictable (type A) and unpredictable (type B) reactions. Predictable reactions are usually dose-dependent, are related to the known pharmacologic actions of the drug, and occur in otherwise healthy individuals. They are estimated to comprise approximately 80% of all ADRs. Unpredictable reactions are generally dose-independent, are unrelated to the pharmacologic actions of the drug, and occur only in susceptible individuals. Unpredictable reactions are subdivided into drug intolerance, drug idiosyncrasy, drug allergy, and pseudoallergic reactions. Both type A and B reactions may be influenced by the genetic predisposition of the patient.

### Classification and practical approach to the diagnosis and management of hypersensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^111YoHMe]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity reactions to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) constitute only a subset of all adverse reactions to these drugs but, due to their severity, pose a significant burden to patients and are a challenge to the allergist. In susceptible individuals, NSAIDs induce a wide spectrum of hypersensitivity reactions with various timing, organ manifestations, and severity, involving either immunological (allergic) or nonimmunological mechanisms. Proper classification of reactions based on clinical manifestations and suspected mechanisms is a prerequisite for the implementation of rational diagnostic procedures and adequate patient management. This document, prepared by a panel of experts from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Task Force on NSAIDs Hypersensitivity, aims to review the knowledge in the field and proposes uniform definitions and clinically useful classification of hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs. The document also proposes practical algorithms for the diagnosis of specific types of NSAIDs hypersensitivity (which include drug provocations, skin testing, and in vitro testing) and provides, when data are available, evidence-based recommendations for the management of hypersensitive patients, including drug avoidance and drug desensitization.

### Up-dosing with bilastine results in improved effectiveness in cold contact urticaria [^1143E2Up]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

The EAACI/GA²LEN/EDF/WAO guidelines for the treatment of urticaria recommend the first-line use of new-generation, nonsedating H₁-antihistamines and provide an option to increase the dosage up to fourfold if standard doses are not effective. In this study, we tested the validity of this recommendation by comparing the effectiveness of the H₁-antihistamine bilastine at the manufacturer's recommended standard dose with up-dosing to four times the standard dose.

Bilastine is a new H₁-antihistamine approved recently for the symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria. In vitro studies have shown bilastine to have moderate-to-high affinity and potent activity at the histamine H₁-receptor while having negligible affinity or effects at 30 other receptors. A review of preliminary clinical data has shown that bilastine is rapidly and effectively absorbed, undergoes negligible metabolism, and is a substrate for P-glycoprotein, which limits its passage across the blood-brain barrier. At the recommended dose of 20 mg, bilastine is nonsedative, does not enhance the effects of alcohol or lorazepam, does not impair actual driving tests, and shows no cardiotoxicity. Bilastine's long duration of action, efficacy, and freedom from central nervous system sedative effects make it a potentially attractive option for use in this clinical situation.

The model used to study bilastine was cold contact urticaria (CCU), a rare but severe and potentially lethal condition characterized by itchy wheal and flare responses due to the release of histamine.

### Allergen immunotherapy for the prevention and treatment of asthma [^113k48iN]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

- **General principles of asthma management**: Asthma management aims to achieve good symptom control, prevent asthma exacerbations, and minimize the future risk of persistent airflow limitation, asthma-related death, and treatment-related side effects. Management involves a continual cycle of assessment, treatment, and review of the patient's response. Treatment options depend on asthma severity and are based on evidence from randomized controlled trials, pragmatic studies, and strong observational data. These options also rely on treatment availability and cost. At the individual patient level, adjustments consider the patient's characteristics, phenotype, views, and practical issues. The management of asthma by conventional pharmacotherapy is detailed in Data S2.

- **Severe asthma and corresponding unmet needs**: Severe asthma requires a high level of conventional pharmacological treatment, specifically high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). A definition widely used in recent years, supported by the European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society, specifies severe asthma as requiring treatment with high doses of ICS, provided the diagnosis of asthma is confirmed and comorbidities are addressed.

### Causes, symptoms and prevention of food allergy [^116nhCQP]. Postępy Dermatologii i Alergologii (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on food allergy:

- **Definition**: Food allergy is an adverse food-stimulated immune response initiated on exposure to a given food.

- **Pathophysiology**: Food allergy is mostly caused by IgE-mediated antibodies (type 1 or early; 48%) and IgE-independent immune responses including type IV (18%), type III (10%), and type II (6%). These responses are influenced by genetic and environmental factors such as improved hygiene, lifestyle, diet, and nutrition. Specific foods involved include:
	- **Common allergens**: milk, eggs, wheat, fish, soy, peanuts, shellfish, nuts, seeds
	- **Fruits**: cherries, peaches, plums, apricots

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy in the US is estimated at 10,000 in 100,000 adults.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of an immediate reaction include anaphylactic shock, urticaria, and angioedema. Symptoms of a late reaction include:
	- **Neurological and psychological symptoms**: fatigue, irritability, depression, hyperactivity, insomnia, headache, poor concentration
	- **Dermatological and systemic symptoms**: paleness, itching limbs, involuntary bedwetting
	- **Respiratory symptoms**: asthma, colds
	- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: indigestion, colic, diarrhea, bloating
	- **Skin symptoms**: skin lesions
	The disease impairs quality of life, necessitating lifelong prevention of the specific food.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The mortality risk associated with fatal anaphylaxis is less than 1%.

### Appropriate and inappropriate use of immunotherapy [^112Q5TxH]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

The primary objective of this review is to discuss indications for the appropriate and inappropriate use of allergen immunotherapy (IT), including the discussion of contraindications, adverse events, and alternative protocols and methods.

A review of the literature on indications, contraindications, adverse events, and alternative methods and protocols associated with allergen IT was conducted. The opinion of the author was used to select and review relevant data.

Clinical trials have proven the benefit of allergen IT for allergic rhinitis, asthma, and anaphylaxis because of stinging insects such as Hymenoptera and fire ants. Allergen IT may improve quality of life and decrease medication requirements for allergic rhinitis and asthma, especially for younger patients, and probably will assist in the prevention of the progression of allergic disease from rhinitis to asthma. Subcutaneous allergen IT is well-established as clinically effective through multiple, blinded, placebo-controlled studies. The data for alternate therapies and routes of therapy are extensively reviewed and critiqued.

Allergen IT is a highly valuable form of treatment for IgE-mediated diseases. Documentation of sensitivity to allergen sensitization associated with symptoms is critical before the use of allergen IT. Symptoms should also be of sufficient duration and severity to warrant IT. Before allergen IT is used, there must be an available allergen extract that is suitable for the treatment of the relative sensitivity. It is essential for patients rec

### Real-world evidence for the long-term effect of allergen immunotherapy: Current status on database-derived European studies [^112qnbJn]. Allergy (2022). High credibility.

AIT is the only treatment option that targets the underlying pathophysiology of allergy, and therefore shows disease‐modifying effects. A number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated long‐term clinical efficacy persisting for years after treatment discontinuation. There is also evidence that AIT can prevent the development of new sensitizations and reduce the risk of subsequent asthma development in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR).

In 1964, the first randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study using subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for the treatment of IgE‐mediated allergies to inhalant allergens was conducted. Starting from that point, many RCTs have proved efficacy and safety for several seasonal and perennial allergens in allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma.

RCTs are still considered the best and most reliable way to assess the efficacy and safety of an AIT product. The majority of statements in clinical guidelines are based on results from RCTs. One key feature of RCTs is that they include an "ideal" study population because they follow strict inclusion and exclusion criteria and study protocols. Thus, they inevitably lack external validity since extrapolations to patients in real life are difficult. In contrast, real‐world data (RWD) analyses include higher patient numbers, using variable treatment patterns and a wide range of alternative interventions applied by many physicians in daily practice. RWD can focus on the epidemiology, effectiveness, safety, medication adherence, or cost of treatment related to allergen immunotherapy.
