## Question

Should I work up cafe au lait spots in a newborn

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate café-au-lait spots in a newborn and when to pursue a workup for underlying genetic syndromes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline prevalence and benignity of isolated café-au-lait macules in infants. Then, I should verify the numerical thresholds that meaningfully increase the likelihood of neurofibromatosis type 1 and related disorders. Next, I will examine morphologic clues that distinguish syndromic patterns, especially McCune-Albright syndrome. After that, I need to check for associated systemic features that would prompt immediate evaluation. Then, I will review the revised diagnostic criteria for NF1 and Legius syndrome and the role of genetic testing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified algorithm for newborn management and follow-up, including when to refer and what surveillance to offer.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk in otherwise healthy newborns with isolated café-au-lait macules. One or two café-au-lait macules are relatively common in infants and are usually benign, with studies suggesting about 2.5% of infants have 1–2 CALMs without an underlying disorder, so I should not overcall disease in this scenario [^1172ygDL]. Wait, let me verify the threshold for concern: more than three CALMs in a healthy infant is uncommon, occurring in only about 0.4% of children, which should raise my index of suspicion for an underlying condition rather than a normal variant [^1172ygDL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check the numerical cutoffs linked to NF1 risk. The classic NIH criterion uses six or more CALMs as a diagnostic feature, but in infants this threshold carries high predictive value for NF1 even when no other signs are present, with approximately 79–88% of infants younger than 14 months with six or more CALMs ultimately diagnosed with NF1 as additional features emerge or via genetic testing, so six is a meaningful action threshold in newborns [^1172ygDL]. I need to ensure I also consider Legius syndrome, which can present with six or more CALMs and axillary/inguinal freckling but lacks the tumor risk of NF1; importantly, fewer than six CALMs does not exclude Legius syndrome, so I should keep that in mind when morphology is typical and family history is suggestive [^116gtMSQ] [^113iqfJF].

> Next, I should review morphologic clues that shift pretest probability. Let me think about borders and distribution: NF1-associated CALMs tend to be round or oval with smooth "coast of California" borders and can cross the midline, whereas McCune-Albright syndrome classically shows large, irregular "coast of Maine" bordered macules that respect the midline. Recognizing this pattern in a newborn should prompt consideration of MAS and a plan to monitor for precocious puberty and fibrous dysplasia even if bone disease is not yet evident [^117QPQk4] [^112Yfd2e]. But wait, what if the lesions are segmental or linear? Segmental or plaque-like CALMs can reflect mosaic NF1, so I should consider tissue-aware genetic testing if suspicion is high despite a negative blood-based assay [^1114eZNR].

> I will now examine associated features that, if present, mandate immediate evaluation beyond a dermatology referral. I need to check for axillary or inguinal freckling, Lisch nodules, macrocephaly, tibial bowing or other bony dysplasia, plexiform neurofibroma, optic pathway glioma, developmental delay, short stature or precocious puberty, and a family history of NF1 or childhood cancers; any of these should trigger expedited genetics involvement and targeted imaging or subspecialty referrals [^115w2w5t] [^113JXPaN]. Hold on, I should verify cancer predisposition red flags: multiple CALMs with a personal or family history of early-onset hematologic or brain tumors, consanguinity, or features suggesting constitutional mismatch repair deficiency warrant urgent genetics referral and cancer surveillance planning because of the profound childhood cancer risk in CMMRD [^114UKPVe] [^111gi96s].

> Let me consider the diagnostic framework and the role of genetic testing, since clinical criteria are age dependent and often not fully manifest in infancy. The revised international consensus allows a genetic diagnosis of NF1 when a pathogenic NF1 variant is identified, and it recommends genetic testing in young children who meet pigment-only features or have segmental findings; this accelerates diagnosis and guides surveillance, and I should include SPRED1 testing when only CALMs and freckling are present to evaluate for Legius syndrome [^116gtMSQ] [^1114eZNR]. I should confirm that mosaic NF1 is plausible when blood testing is negative but clinical suspicion remains high; in that case, testing affected skin or other involved tissue can improve yield, and long-read or comprehensive NF1 assays can detect mosaic or intronic variants missed by routine panels [^1114eZNR] [^112fGapo].

> Now, I need to synthesize a practical newborn algorithm. If there are one to two small, typical CALMs and no other abnormal findings, I should reassure the family, document the lesions, and arrange routine pediatric follow-up, as the likelihood of NF1 is low in this group [^1172ygDL]. If there are three to five CALMs, I should obtain a careful family history, perform a complete skin and systems exam looking for freckling, bony anomalies, and neurodevelopmental concerns, and consider early referral to pediatric dermatology or genetics, especially if the number increases over time or if there are atypical features; this intermediate-risk pathway balances timely detection with avoidance of overtesting [^1172ygDL]. If there are six or more CALMs, I should refer urgently to clinical genetics for NF1/SPRED1 testing and initiate NF1-focused surveillance planning, because the positive predictive value for NF1 exceeds 80% in this group even in infancy [^1172ygDL] [^1114eZNR].

> For morphology-driven concerns, I should double-check for MAS when CALMs are large, jagged, and respect the midline, and if suspected I will plan endocrine surveillance for precocious puberty and growth hormone excess and obtain a bone-age radiograph and skeletal survey if clinically indicated, recognizing that endocrine manifestations may not be present at birth but can emerge in early childhood [^117QPQk4] [^112Yfd2e]. If the distribution is segmental or there is a history suggestive of mosaicism, I should discuss tissue-aware testing and counsel that mosaic NF1 may have a milder but still meaningful risk profile requiring individualized surveillance [^1114eZNR].

> I should confirm that my counseling and follow-up plan is explicit. For low-risk infants, I will provide anticipatory guidance and arrange a 6–12 month revisit to reassess the number and morphology of CALMs and to screen for new systemic signs. For intermediate-risk infants, I will coordinate genetics input within the first few months. For high-risk infants, I will ensure genetics evaluation within weeks and initiate NF1 surveillance pathways including annual ophthalmology for Lisch nodules and optic pathway glioma risk, age-appropriate neurodevelopmental screening, and orthopedic assessment if tibial bowing or other dysplasia is suspected [^116E3XJ5] [^113JXPaN]. Hold on, I should verify that families understand the age dependence of features; many children with six CALMs will not meet full NIH criteria until later, so a negative early evaluation does not exclude evolving NF1, which justifies ongoing surveillance and re-evaluation at 6–12 month intervals in the first years of life [^1172ygDL].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed special scenarios. If there is a family history of NF1, I should offer parental testing when available to guide prenatal or neonatal testing and to refine recurrence risk counseling, recognizing that de novo mutations and mosaicism can complicate interpretation and that phenotype prediction remains limited even with a known variant [^113tijqD] [^1156mhF6]. If there are red flags for CMMRD or other cancer predisposition syndromes, I should expedite genetics referral and discuss surveillance protocols given the early and aggressive cancer risk, even when newborn features are subtle [^114UKPVe] [^111gi96s].

In newborns, **isolated café-au-lait spots are common and usually benign** [^1172ygDL]; no workup is needed if there are 1–2 small, well-circumscribed macules without other anomalies [^1172ygDL]. Workup is indicated for **≥ 6 CALMs** (≥ 5 mm prepubertal) [^116E3XJ5], large or irregular "coast of Maine" lesions [^117QPQk4], segmental or axillary/inguinal distribution, or any associated features such as dysmorphism, developmental delay, seizures, or family history of NF1 or other genetic disorders [^116gtMSQ]. Initial evaluation includes a detailed history, family history, and complete physical exam; if criteria are met or suspicion is high, order NF1/SPRED1 genetic testing and consider ophthalmology, neurology, and endocrinology referrals [^1114eZNR] [^114TW14N]. Early identification of NF1 or related syndromes enables timely surveillance and management [^113gHG1u].

---

## Clinical significance of café-au-lait spots in newborns

CALMs are **common benign birthmarks** [^113SwqTu] that may also signal genetic syndromes such as NF1, Legius syndrome, McCune-Albright syndrome, and CMMRD [^1149Fuy8] [^115qL6kK]. The likelihood of an underlying disorder rises with the number, size, and distribution of lesions and with associated anomalies [^111J2CWu].

---

## Indications for further workup

Workup is indicated when any of the following are present:

- **Number**: ≥ 6 CALMs ≥ 5 mm in prepubertal infants [^116E3XJ5].
- **Size and morphology**: Large (> 1 cm), irregular, "coast of Maine" borders [^117QPQk4], or segmental distribution [^113xq72F].
- **Distribution**: Axillary or inguinal freckling [^116E3XJ5].
- **Associated features**: Dysmorphic features, developmental delay, seizures, macrocephaly, skeletal anomalies, or family history of NF1 or other genetic disorders [^113JXPaN].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

### Initial evaluation

During the initial evaluation, obtain a **detailed history** covering prenatal and perinatal events, developmental milestones, and a three-generation family history of genetic disorders, café-au-lait spots, neurofibromas, and malignancies [^113JXPaN]. Conduct a **complete physical examination** documenting the number, size, shape, distribution, and associated anomalies such as dysmorphism, skeletal abnormalities, and neurologic deficits [^111J2CWu].

---

### Genetic testing

Order **NF1 and SPRED1 testing** when ≥ 6 CALMs are present or when fewer lesions are accompanied by suggestive features or family history [^1114eZNR]. Consider **mosaic NF1** if disease appears segmental or features are limited to one area [^111Xzw1W].

---

### Additional evaluations

Obtain an **ophthalmologic examination** for Lisch nodules, optic pathway gliomas, and other ocular anomalies [^116gtMSQ]. Order **neurologic assessment** if seizures, developmental delay, or macrocephaly are present [^notfound]. Pursue **endocrine evaluation** when features suggest McCune-Albright syndrome (e.g. precocious puberty, growth hormone excess) [^112Yfd2e].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Genetic testing** |
|-|-|-|
| Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) | - ≥ 6 CALMs <br/> - Axillary/inguinal freckling <br/> - Lisch nodules <br/> - Neurofibromas <br/> - Skeletal dysplasia | NF1 gene mutation [^1172ygDL] |
| Legius syndrome | - Multiple CALMs <br/> - Axillary/inguinal freckling <br/> - No neurofibromas or Lisch nodules | SPRED1 gene mutation [^114CyDMf] |
| McCune-Albright syndrome | - Large, irregular CALMs <br/> - Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia <br/> - Endocrine abnormalities | GNAS somatic mutation [^112Yfd2e] |
| Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) | - Multiple CALMs <br/> - Childhood malignancies <br/> - Immunodeficiency | MMR gene mutations (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) [^114UKPVe] |

---

## Management and follow-up

Management and follow-up should include **regular surveillance** for new lesions, developmental milestones, vision changes, skeletal abnormalities, and signs of malignancy [^116E3XJ5]. Provide **genetic counseling** to explain diagnosis, inheritance, and reproductive implications [^113JXPaN]. Coordinate **multidisciplinary care** with dermatology, ophthalmology, neurology, endocrinology, and orthopedics as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by **underlying diagnosis**: NF1 is progressive with risks of tumors and complications, whereas isolated CALMs without a syndrome have an excellent prognosis [^11546ob5] [^113SwqTu].

---

Isolated café-au-lait spots in newborns are usually benign, but **≥ 6 lesions or atypical features warrant workup** for genetic syndromes. Early recognition and targeted testing enable timely surveillance and management.

### Predicting neurofibromatosis type 1 risk among children with isolated caf é-au-lait macules [^117DGTbu]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although isolated cafe-au-lait macules (CALMs) are a common skin finding, they are an early feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).

Objective

We sought to develop an algorithm determining the risk of children with CALMs to have constitutional NF1.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of patients with isolated CALMs. Diagnosis of NF1 was based on detecting NF1 mutation in blood or fulfilling clinical criteria.

Results

In all, 170 of 419 (41%) and 21 of 86 (24%) children with isolated CALMs who underwent molecular testing and clinical follow-up, respectively, were given a diagnosis of NF1. Presence of fewer than 6 CALMs at presentation or atypical CALMs was associated with not having NF1 (P < .001). An algorithm based on age, CALMs number, and presence of atypical macules predicted NF1 in both cohorts. According to the algorithm, children older than 29 months with at least 1 atypical CALM or less than 6 CALMs have a 0.9% (95% confidence interval 0%-2.6%) risk for constitutional NF1 whereas children younger than 29 months with 6 or more CALMs have a high risk (80.4%, 95% confidence interval 74.6%-86.2%).

Limitations

The study was designed to detect constitutional NF1 and not NF1 in mosaic form.

Conclusions

A simple algorithm enables categorization of children with isolated CALMs as being at low or high risk for having NF1.

### Recommendations on surveillance and management of biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (BMMRD) syndrome: a consensus statement by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^115qL6kK]. Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (BMMRD) characteristics — BMMRD "is characterized by the absence of DNA-MMR activity from birth, and results in brain tumors, colonic polyps, colorectal and small-bowel cancers, leukemias, and lymphomas", and "also is called constitutional MMR deficiency (CMMRD), because those born with biallelic inactivation of any one of the MMR genes have no DNA MMR activity in any tissue". Patients "often have cafe-au-lait macules and other stigmata that can be mistaken for neurofibromatosis type 1", with "Somatic mutations in the NF1 gene as a consequence of constitutional absence of DNA MMR activity" proposed as an explanation. "The lifetime risk of gastrointestinal cancer among BMMRD patients is the highest reported of all gastrointestinal cancer predisposition syndromes as a function of age, with tumors often diagnosed in the first decade of life", and "The rate of progression of adenomas among BMMRD patients appears to be accelerated and more rapid than in LS". Surveillance experience is noted: "Over the past 15 years, BMMRD patients have been followed up with a clinical surveillance protocol designed to diagnose tumors in asymptomatic patients amenable to surgical resection".

The criteria for clinical diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are not sensitive in young children. Recognition is easier when one of their parents has been diagnosed with this condition, and the causal mutation is known. We present a case of a girl with isolated café-au-lait spots, whose father was diagnosed with NF1. However, both were found to carry different de novo mutations in the NF1 gene. This possibility has significant implications for the diagnostic process and genetic counseling.

Background

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a rare genetic disorder characterized with the development of multiple benign tumors on the nerves and skin.

Case presentation

This report described a neonatal case with a large mass observed on the left side of the maxillofacial and cervical region at birth. Meantime, multiple cafe-au-lait macules (CALMs) were seen on the trunk and both lower extremities.

Conclusions

In this case, the clinical features of the rare NF1 neonate are discussed along with its ultrasound findings.

### Diagnostic difficulties and possibilities of NF1-like syndromes in childhood [^112Xz5jW]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen's disease, is caused by heterozygous inactivating pathogenic variations in the NF1 gene. NF1 is the most frequent (prevalence 1–5/10000) neurocutaneous genetic disorder, which is characterized by an autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance pattern with complete penetrance, but very heterogeneous and age-related expressivity. Its most distinctive features affect the skin, skeletal and nervous system. NF1 is associated with an increased risk for benign and malignant tumors and can be identified by genetic testing or clinical diagnostic criteria. The latter were assembled by The NIH consensus development conference in 1987 and are still in use. The recommendation says that the diagnosis of NF1 should be established if the patient fulfills at least two criteria, or suspected if an individual meets only one of them:
 ≥ 6 café-au-lait macules (CALMs) (> 5 mm in greatest diameter in prepubertal individuals and > 15 mm in greatest diameter in postpubertal individuals),
 ≥ 2 neurofibromas of any type or ≥ 1 plexiform neurofibroma,
freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions,
optic pathway glioma (OPG),
 ≥ 2 Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas),
a distinctive osseous lesion (sphenoid dysplasia or tibial pseudarthrosis),
a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, offspring) with NF1 as defined by the above criteria.

### Genetic counseling for neurofibromatosis 1, neurofibromatosis 2, and schwannomatosis-practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^114CyDMf]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2020). High credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 differential diagnosis and mosaicism — clinical patterns and related conditions are noted as follows: Somatic and germline mosaicism have been reported in NF1, and somatic mosaicism may present in a segmental pattern limited to one area of the body with a tendency for milder presentation than generalized NF1. There are several conditions phenotypically similar to NF1 that may warrant concurrent or sequential genetic interrogation during diagnostic evaluation, including Legius syndrome, caused by variants in SPRED1, which is often considered in individuals presenting only with cafe au lait macules or intertriginous freckling, and RASopathy syndromes, such as Noonan syndrome with or without multiple lentigines, which have features that can resemble NF1 and should be considered in individuals with atypical clinical presentations; other conditions include constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD), McCune–Albright syndrome, Russell–Silver syndrome, and PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome disorders, or chromosomal abnormalities may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.

RESULTS

Distribution Characteristics of Damaged Skin

Among the 471 patients, 351 (74.52%) had CALMs on the cheek, 45 (9.55%) on the forehead, 51 (10.83%) on the temple, 8 (16.99%) under the jaw, 13 (2.76%) in the perioral area, 30 (6.37%) on the nose, 19 (4.03%) on the neck, 12 (2.55%) on the trunk, and 15 (3.18%) on the limbs. A total of 407 (86.41%) patients had a single lesion and 64 (13.59%) had multiple lesions.

Morphologic Characteristics of Damaged Skin

The CALMs were generally round and irregular in shape, and the boundary was clear. The lesional skin color was uniform and consistent in 457 patients (97.03%), among whom 109 patients (23.14%) had sandy beige lesions, 308 (65.39%) had brown lesions, 40 (8.49%) had dark brown lesions, and 14 (2.97%) had heterogeneous lesions. The diameter of the CALMs was ≤ 2 cm in 271 patients (57.54%), > 2–5 cm in 126 (26.75%), > 5–10 cm in 52 (11.04%), and > 10 cm in 22 (4.67%). One 5‐year‐old girl had a skin lesion on her right forearm that showed a pattern of linear array; one patient had a traumatic tattoo, two had nevus of Ota, three had freckles, four had neurofibromatosis, and five had nevus spilus.

### Caf é-au-lait macules and neurofibromatosis type 1: a review of the literature [^115puKZF]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The first sign of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in a child is often the presence of multiple café-au-lait macules. Although previous studies reported that almost individuals with multiple café-au-lait macules will eventually develop NF1 based on clinical criteria, recent studies and clinical observations suggest that a significant percentage of them do not have NF1.

Methods

We conducted the first systematic review of the literature on the prevalence of definitive NF1 among patients referred for isolated café-au-lait macules, searching more precisely for the proportion of those patients who do not have NF1. Because we now know that the presence of café-au-lait macules and freckling might not distinguish between NF1 and other conditions such as Legius syndrome, definitive NF1 was defined as the presence of café-au-lait macules with or without freckling plus one of the following: Lisch nodules, neurofibroma, plexiform neurofibroma, bone dysplasia, optic pathway glioma, or familial history of NF1.

Results

Six articles reported sufficient data to meet our inclusion criteria. Grouping all studies together, we found that 19.5% to 57.1% of all patients with isolated café-au-lait macules did not have a diagnosis of NF1 after follow-up or genetic testing.

Conclusion

A significant portion of the patients presenting with isolated café-au-lait macules at initial consultation might not have NF1. Genetic testing could help guide the follow-up of those patients, but further evidence is required to make recommendations.

### Caf é-au-lait patches and senile plaques: how APPt the connection? [^116mamfa]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes the protein neurofibromin. Patients exhibit characteristic hyperpigmented patches called café-au-lait patches. Melanocytes of NF1 patients differ from normal human melanocytes, but no differences account completely for lesional hyperpigmentation. An association between beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and neurofibromin, and their localization to the melanosome, may help explain the development of café-au-lait patches.

### Metyrapone as treatment in the neonatal McCune-Albright syndrome [^115Hyyt1]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives To present a case report of succesfully metyrapone treatment of a neonatal patient with McCune-Albrigth syndrome (MAS), a rare disease caused by a genetically mosaic disorder and is characterized by variable hyperfunctional endocrinopathies, bone dysplasia, and café-au-lait spots. Case presentation A preterm newborn was admitted to hospital and she presented difficulty controlling hypertension, café-au-lait spots, and failure to thrive. An abdominal ultrasound and a magnetic resonance showed a high volume of both suprarenal glands. Therefore, MAS was suspected. Laboratory data confirmed adrenocorticotropic hormone-independent Cushing's syndrome with hepatic dysfunction and metyrapone treatment was initiated. A progressive normalization of cortisol levels was achieved despite poor oral tolerance. Conclusion Our case shows that metyrapone is useful in the management of neonatal Cushing's syndrome due to McCune-Albright syndrome.

Therapeutic Effect

Comparison of therapeutic effect among different treatment times

Of the 471 patients, the treatment result was curative in 140 (29.72%) patients, significantly effective in 124 (26.33%), and effective in 110 (23.35%). The treatment success rate was 79.41%, and 56.05% of patients achieved significantly effective improvement (Table 1). The treatment efficiency was positively correlated with the number of therapy sessions (rs = 0.26, P < 0.0001); that is, the therapeutic efficacy was statistically different according to the number of treatments (H = 38.25, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1).

Comparison of therapeutic effect among different sex, age, and skin lesions

The difference in treatment efficacy according to the age at onset, age at treatment and lesion position, color, and size was not statistically significant (P > 0.05) (Table 2). The nonparametric rank and inspection results of the treatment effect showed that sex (female vs. male) (H = 5.04, P = 0.0247) and different treatment intervals (H = 12.83, P = 0.0003) had statistical significance.

Abstract

The criteria for clinical diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are not sensitive in young children. Recognition is easier when one of their parents has been diagnosed with this condition, and the causal mutation is known. We present a case of a girl with isolated café‐au‐lait spots, whose father was diagnosed with NF1. However, both were found to carry different de novo mutations in the NF1 gene. This possibility has significant implications for the diagnostic process and genetic counseling.

### Treatment of caf é-Au-lait spots using Q-switched alexandrite laser: analysis of clinical characteristics of 471 children in mainland China [^1177YrT1]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Café‐au‐lait spots, also known as café‐au‐lait macules (CALMs), are common hyperpigmented skin lesions in children. Most are congenital and appear on the face. These lesions affect the children's appearance, often decreasing their self‐esteem and thus adversely affecting their learning and social interaction 1. Parents of affected children tend to prefer early treatment to avoid these adverse consequences. However, the treatment efficacy of CALMs by laser therapy is variable. We treated 471 children with CALMs at the laser clinic of Beijing Children's Hospital from January 2004 to December 2015. These children were treated by Q‐switched alexandrite laser (755 nm) therapy and had good clinical improvement. We analyzed the efficacy, safety, and clinical factors of this treatment technique for CALMs.

### Safety and efficacy of selumetinib in pediatric and adult patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibroma [^112yzTe2]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

The limitations of our study should be addressed. As our study has a single institutional design, the generalizability of its conclusion may be limited. Furthermore, as a single-arm analysis, there was no control group available for comparison. The QoL scores might have been influenced by the location and growth rate of PN, as well as the degree of PN-related pain and the extent of PN reduction. Furthermore, the complete establishment of the causal effect of selumetinib remains elusive due to the lack of comprehensive endocrine and auxology studies to ascertain the growth effect. Additionally, the reported alleviation of café-au-lait spots with MEK inhibitors may have been influenced by factors such as sun avoidance or the inherent propensity for café-au-lait spots to fade with age in post-pubertal patients. Finally, an optimal dosage of selumetinib cannot be recommended because no significant differences were observed among the different dosage groups in terms of safety and efficacy. However, it is worth noting that a larger number of patients achieved PR with higher dosages. More studies are required to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties among various ethnic groups. Additionally, longer-term evaluations are needed to compare the safety and efficacy among different dosage groups, especially considering the current indication and activity of selumetinib in NF1-related PN, rather than as a generic NF1 drug addressing multiple manifestations of the disease. As part of an ongoing study, the gene and protein expression profiles are being investigated to comprehend the molecular network that underlies the therapeutic effects of selumetinib in NF1.

In conclusion, our phase II trial of selumetinib on Korean pediatric and adult patients with NF1 showed encouraging results in reducing PN regardless of age. Importantly, selumetinib demonstrated a wide range of beneficial effects on the systemic manifestations of NF1. Considering its significant effectiveness in both children and adults with NF1, continued and sustained treatment with selumetinib should be considered along with safety monitoring.

### Inherited bone marrow failure in the pediatric patient [^114Rnv91]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

FA

FA was first described by Fanconi in 1927. It is usually inherited as an autosomal recessive (AR) trait, but in a small subset of patients, it can be an X-linked recessive disorder. Patients with FA are clinically heterogeneous. Typical features include BMF development and an increased predisposition to cancer. Affected individuals may also have ≥ 1 extrahematopoietic abnormalities, including dermatological (eg, cafe au lait spots), skeletal (eg, radial hypoplasia), genitourinary (eg, single kidney), gastrointestinal (eg, duodenal atresia), and neurological abnormalities (Table 2). Approximately one-third of patients have no overt extrahematopoietic abnormalities. Most patients are diagnosed at the end of the first decade of life; however, some patients are diagnosed in adulthood.

### Revised diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis type 1 and legius syndrome: an international consensus recommendation [^116gtMSQ]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

At the 2018 meeting in New York, working groups developed nine revised statements concerning diagnostic criteria for discussion, including discussion about changing the format of the diagnostic criteria into a tiered system with A and B features. Fifty-eight of 76 NF experts (76%) participated by rating the nine revised statements (Supplementary Fig. 3). There was very high consensus (more than 80% agreement) for four proposed changes: adding a new criterion of genetic diagnosis, and recommending genetic testing for patients with segmental clinical findings, for families with two affected siblings and clinically unaffected parents, and for children who meet the criteria based on pigmentary findings alone. There was high consensus (agreement 60–80%) for three proposed changes: considering genetic testing for individuals with multiple bilateral spinal nerve neurofibromas without other features of NF1, requiring use of slit lamp or indirect ophthalmoscopy for identification of Lisch nodules, and including choroidal abnormalities as a diagnostic criterion. Finally, there was more agreement to retain the current format as opposed to selecting A/B criteria (71% agreement). In total, 74/76 NF experts (97%) were involved in the revision process (data S4).

Nine of 12 (75%) non-NF specialists responded to the survey (data S5) and strongly agreed with the proposed changes to the NF1 diagnostic criteria. The experts agreed that nonspecialists would be able to use the revised criteria.

Proposed new diagnostic criteria for NF1 and LGSS

Ultimately, consensus was reached on the minimal clinical and genetic criteria for diagnosing NF1 and LGSS. Final recommendations for NF1 are listed in Table 1 and for LGSS in Table 2.

Table 1
Revised diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).

a If only café-au-lait macules and freckling are present, the diagnosis is most likely NF1 but exceptionally the person might have another diagnosis such as Legius syndrome. At least one of the two pigmentary findings (café-au-lait macules or freckling) should be bilateral.

b Sphenoid wing dysplasia is not a separate criterion in case of an ipsilateral orbital plexiform neurofibroma.

### Challenges in the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in young children facilitated by means of revised diagnostic criteria including genetic testing for pathogenic NF1 gene variants [^113iqfJF]. Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 4
Diagnostic criteria for Legius syndrome according to Legius et al. (2021)

a The presence of fewer than 6 café-au-lait macules does not exclude Legius syndrome

It is important to add that in some patients with multiple isolated CALM, pathogenic variants are not found in either the SPRED1 gene or the NF1 gene by the molecular testing of blood. In sporadic patients, the underlying cause may be somatic mosaicism for a pathogenic NF1 or SPRED1 variant that is present only in melanocytes and absent from blood cells (Maertens et al; Legius et al.). To provide guidance for the correct diagnosis, diagnostic criteria for mosaic NF1 and mosaic Legius syndrome have also been formulated and published as an international consensus recommendation (Legius et al.). It has been estimated that ~ 10% of sporadic NF1 patients have mosaic NF1 caused by postzygotic NF1 mutations that are absent from, or present in, a very low proportion of blood lymphocytes (Messiaen et al.). This may be concluded from the pathogenic variant detection rate determined by means of comprehensive genetic testing including the genomic DNA and cDNA sequencing of the NF1 gene as well as the assessment of copy number variants of single and multiple NF1 exons and entire NF1 gene deletions (Messiaen et al.). Mosaicism has also been observed in Legius syndrome but it would appear to be rare (Jobling et al.). The clinical suspicion of mosaicism justifies genetic testing for Legius syndrome and NF1, as now included in the newly formulated diagnostic criteria for the mosaic forms of both conditions (Legius et al.).

### Clinical reasoning: a girl presenting with stiffness episodes during sleep, cafe-au-lait spots, and flecked retina [^113J1U2u]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

A 4-year-old girl who had been born of normal pregnancy and delivery and had an unremarkable family or personal history was referred to a neuropsychiatric department because of the appearance of peculiar nocturnal episodes. Parents described that their child abruptly became stiff during sleep. These episodes usually ranged from 20 to 40 seconds, and after that the child continued to sleep. Initially she presented 1 episode per week, but there was a progressive increase in frequency up to 3 to 4 times per night. The child never presented similar episodes while awake. Her examination revealed some café-au-lait spots, congenital microcephaly (3rd centile) and low stature for the age (10th centile). She did not present any neurologic deficit, but she failed to develop an age-appropriate speech, with a delay in the main language milestones.

### Anophthalmia: an uncommon manifestation of neurofibromatosis type 1 [^115qov4V]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder, affecting approximately 1 of 3500 people. Ocular disorders, such as Lisch nodules, optic gliomas, and anterior segment defects, are typical with clinical presentation. Anophthalmia, as a rare eye malformation, has never been reported in patients with NF-1. We report a 27-year-old patient in whom clinical manifestations of café au lait spots, neurofibromas, osseous orbital dysplasia, and anophthalmia were observed. The diagnosis of NF-1 was made, according to clinical course and brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Because the patient refused aggressive management approaches, she was managed conservatively and is well on follow-up. We suggest that patients presenting with anophthalmia need serious evaluation and that NF-1 needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis.

### Treatment of caf é-Au-lait spots using Q-switched alexandrite laser: analysis of clinical characteristics of 471 children in mainland China [^113VamjB]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Measurement Method

The demographic and clinical data of the patients were recorded, including name, sex, age at diagnosis, date of diagnosis, age at onset, and lesion site and size. A consent form was signed and clinical photographs were taken before each laser treatment, and the treatment parameters were recorded after each treatment.

Before each laser treatment, a clinical examination was performed to assess the color and size of the lesions as well as any pigmentary abnormalities and the presence of scars. For children aged > 3 months, compound lidocaine cream (Beijing Purple Light Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Beijing, China) was applied to the skin and covered by plastic film to enhance absorption. The skin was cleaned after 60–90 minutes, and laser treatment was performed. The clinician using the laser wore protective goggles and placed wet gauze or an eye mask over the patients' eyes. Appropriate treatment parameters were chosen according to the children's age, the color and size of the lesion, and the experience of the clinician. The laser handpiece was held vertically to the skin at a distance of 4 cm, and laser therapy was delivered to the skin evenly without overlap or omission. Test spots were performed to the treatment endpoint to achieve a gray‐white "frost change". The laser energy was reduced if the skin reacted with wounding or blister formation. Ice compression was immediately provided for 15 minutes after laser treatment. The parents were requested to keep the skin dry, avoid contact with water and scratching, and apply barrier creams to prevent infection and enhance skin recovery for 1 week. Exposure to strong sunshine was avoided for 1–3 months, and wide‐brim hats and sunscreen were advised during outdoor activities 2, 3. If blisters occurred, they were punctured by sterile needles to release the blister fluid. If significant edema developed, a topical corticosteroid cream was applied twice per day to reduce inflammation. The treatment interval was adjusted based on the patients' age and treatment reaction, which ranged from 3 to 12 months.

### Caféau lait spots: when and how to pursue their genetic origins [^114TW14N]. Clinics in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Café au lait spots are common birthmarks seen sporadically and in association with several genetic syndromes. Dermatologists are often asked to evaluate these birthmarks both by other physicians and by parents. In some cases, it is challenging to know when and how to pursue further evaluation. Diagnostic challenges may come in the form of the appearance of the individual lesions, areas and patterns of cutaneous involvement, and associated features (or lack thereof). In this review, we aim to clarify when and how to evaluate the child with multiple or patterned café au lait spots and to explain some emerging concepts in our understanding of the genetics of these lesions.

### Long-read sequencing for NF1 gene analysis: enhancing diagnostic accuracy for neurofibromatosis type 1 [^112fGapo]. Human Molecular Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

The Clinical diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in pediatric patients is challenged by incomplete manifestation of age-dependent phenotypes, and molecular genetic testing is usually required to confirm the diagnosis. Early differential diagnosis is particularly crucial for children presenting solely with multiple Cafe-au-lait spots (CALMs). Here we developed a comprehensive analysis of the NF1 gene (CANF1) based on long-range PCR and long-read sequencing (LRS) for genetic testing of NF1. This blinded retrospective study evaluated the clinical utility of CANF1 in 191 samples from 189 individuals (180 probands, 9 NF1 family members) by comparing it to next-generation sequencing (NGS), primarily exome sequencing (ES), as control methods. The results demonstrated concordant findings in 97.4% (186/191) of samples and 97.2% (175/180) of probands, and discordant results in 2.6% (5/191) of samples and 2.8% (5/180) of probands, including one newly established diagnosis due to a patient harboring the pathogenic deep intronic variant c.5812+332A > G. Among 126 pediatric probands with NF1, this assay achieved a diagnostic yield of 92.1%, outperforming ES with cost-competitive advantages. In conclusion, this study established an NF1 genetic assay employing LRS, demonstrating reliable detection for various variant types of the NF1 gene. The CANF1 assay provides an alternative screening approach for precise and cost-effective NF1 diagnosis, particularly valuable for pediatric cases not fulfilling NF1 clinical diagnostic criteria but presenting with a characteristic NF1 feature such as CALMs.

### Phenotypic variability among caf é-au-lait macules in neurofibromatosis type 1 [^115AKjtP]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Café-au-lait macules (CALMs) in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are an early and accessible phenotype in NF1, but have not been extensively studied.

Objective

We sought to more fully characterize the phenotype of CALMs in patients with NF1.

Methods

In all, 24 patients with a diagnosis of NF1 confirmed through clinical diagnosis or molecular genetic testing were recruited from patients seen in the genetics department at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. CALM locations were mapped using standard digital photography. Pigment intensity was measured with a narrowband spectrophotometer, which estimates the relative amount of melanin based on its absorption of visible light. The major response was defined as the difference between the mean melanin from the CALM and the mean melanin from the surrounding skin. The major response for each spot was compared with spots within an individual and across individuals in the study population.

Results

There was significant variability of the major response, primarily attributable to intrapersonal variability (48.4%, P < .0001) and secondly to interpersonal variability (33.0%, P < .0094). Subsequent analysis based on genetic mutation type showed significantly darker spots in individuals with germline mutations leading to haploinsufficiency.

Limitations

The study was performed on a small population of patients and the method has not yet been used extensively for this purpose.

Conclusions

CALMs vary in pigment intensity not only across individuals, but also within individuals and this variability was unrelated to sun exposure. Further studies may help elucidate the molecular basis of this finding, leading to an increased understanding of the pathogenesis of CALMs in NF1.

### The biology of cutaneous neurofibromas: consensus recommendations for setting research priorities [^116JibV6]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The clinical spectrum of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is broad and dependent on in which cell type the biallelic inactivation of the NF1 (Neurofibromin 1) gene takes place, such as melanocytes (café-au-lait macules [CALM]), osteoblasts (tibial dysplasia), and Schwann cells (cutaneous neurofibroma [cNF] and plexiform neurofibroma [pNF]). Importantly, the 2 main types of neurofibroma (cNF and pNF) differ widely clinically. cNF typically become apparent around puberty and increase in number with age. They reside exclusively in the dermis and never progress to malignancy. In contrast, pNF are often congenital, and progress predominantly during childhood and adolescence. Although pNF can involve the skin, they are generally deep tumors involving nerve plexuses below the dermis and they carry a risk of sarcomatous transformation. Despite knowing that the NF1 syndrome and its manifestations are caused by mutation of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, there is little understanding about why the multiple manifestations of NF1 occur in some people but not others and with variable severity, even within families.

The most common tumor in adults with NF1 is cNF, presumably resulting from the biallelic loss of NF1 in the Schwann cell lineage. cNF can vary widely in size (from millimeters up to few centimeters) and in numbers (from a few to thousands that can cover most of the skin surface) and can develop in virtually any location of the body. In addition to the important psychosocial consequence of cNF tumors, irritation, bleeding, pain, and superficial infections are unmet clinical needs. There are no preventative measures, and the only treatment options are surgical.

Researchers interested in understanding cNF biology face multiple critical challenges. First, the human NF1 gene and its mRNA are relatively largeand difficult to manipulate into expression vectors. Therefore, the biochemistry of the different protein domains of NF1 (except for the GTPase-activating protein [GAP] domain) is not well-understood. Second, cNF are slow-growing, noncancerous tumors. Consequently, isolating and maintaining primary cultures from cNF is difficult. Third, the generation of robust 3D in vitro culture systemsand in vivo modelsare notoriously challenging. In an effort to address these gaps, based on existing data from both cNF and pNF literature, this group sought to identify the key gaps in the understanding of cNF biology that require investigation in order to accelerate the development of effective therapies for these tumors.

### How many is too many? A review of the significant numbers in pediatric skin lesions and their recommended evaluation [^113F8Psy]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pediatric dermatologists are frequently consulted to evaluate children for cutaneous signs of systemic disorders. Numerical thresholds of significance have been described in the dermatologic literature for various skin findings where the likelihood of an associated extracutaneous abnormality or known genetic syndrome increases significantly. Knowledge of these numerical thresholds facilitates diagnosis and management, which improves clinical outcomes and avoids severe complications. This review highlights the clinical presentation, complications, evaluation, and numerical significance, when applicable, for the following skin findings: infantile hemangiomas, capillary malformations, café-au-lait macules, hypopigmented macules, juvenile xanthogranulomas, pilomatricomas, and angiofibromas.

### Pigmentation disorders: diagnosis and management [^112zTbr6]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Pigmentation disorders are commonly diagnosed, evaluated, and treated in primary care practices. Typical hyperpigmentation disorders include postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, melasma, solar lentigines, ephelides (freckles), and café au lait macules. These conditions are generally benign but can be distressing to patients. Appropriate dermatologic history, skin examination, and skin biopsy, when appropriate, can help exclude melanoma and its precursors. In addition to addressing the underlying condition, hyperpigmentation is treated with topical agents, chemical peels, cryotherapy, light or laser therapy, or a combination of these methods. Café au lait macules are treated with surgical excision or laser therapy if treatment is desired. Hypopigmentation disorders include vitiligo, pityriasis alba, tinea versicolor, and postinflammatory hypopigmentation. Treatment of vitiligo depends on the distribution and extent of skin involvement, and includes topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, ultraviolet A therapy (with or without psoralens), narrowband ultraviolet B therapy, and cosmetic coverage. Patients with stable, self-limited vitiligo may be candidates for surgical grafting techniques, whereas those with extensive disease may be candidates for depigmentation therapy to make skin tone appear more even. Other hypopigmentation disorders may improve or resolve with treatment of the underlying condition.

### Implementation of universal newborn bloodspot screening for sickle cell disease and other clinically significant haemoglobinopathies in england: screening results for 2005–7 [^111PsBgA]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

To support the development of policy, various subgroups were established, including a laboratory subgroup and a training and education subgroup. The laboratory subgroup drew representation from the various relevant professionally led organisations and societies, as well as the recognised experts in the field, both clinicians and scientists. From this a plan for implementation was developed for each region or catchment area covered by a laboratory. The programme required the development and implementation of training for front-line staff involved with the programme, particularly midwives, and for this training to have been undertaken before implementation could proceed. The programme also liaised with a major quality assurance (QA) scheme and worked closely to support the development of a bespoke quality assurance for newborn screening based on dried blood spots to run alongside the existing liquid sample scheme. Most areas of policy are now clarified but work is ongoing to develop a consensus regarding unidentified variants and Hb Bart's reporting, emphasising the need for better data on costs and benefits and further research.

The methods recommended by the programme were for an initial screening test using either HPLC or IEF to be performed with the biochemical screening already taking place for phenylketonuria and hypothyroidism. For initial screen-positive tests, a confirmatory test using a different technique was recommended. The decision to use two-stage testing to minimise incorrect identification of abnormal haemoglobins and ensure a high level of quality was based on the experience of the UK laboratories already using this approach and the USA, which had not routinely used a second test. The increase in workload implied by the roll-out for the West Midlands laboratory who were screening 15 000, and would increase to approximately 70 000 per annum, prompted an evaluation of available methodologies and the potential of each for automation. A primary focus was the potential of the technology to permit positive specimen identification (blood-spot card accession number) to follow a baby's blood spot electronically from the punched disk to the analytical result.

### Large caf é-au-lait spots on a 5-year-old boy [^112Yfd2e]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answer:
A. Tuberous sclerosis – Incorrect. Neither café-au-lait spots nor fibrous dysplasia is characteristic of tuberous sclerosis.
B. Neurofibromatosis 1 – Incorrect. While patients with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) can experience café-au-lait spots and long bone dysplasia, the café-au-lait spots of NF1 have a smooth "coast of California" border. This is to be contrasted with the jagged "coast of Maine" border characteristic of the café-au-lait spots observed in McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS). Respect for the midline is another distinctive feature of this patient's café-au-lait spots that favors association with MAS over NF1 and other conditions manifesting with café-au-lait spots.
C. Neurocutaneous melanosis – Incorrect. Neurocutaneous melanosis is characterized by a congenital melanocytic nevus with associated neuromelanosis. While some melanocytic nevi can visually resemble the café-au-lait spots of MAS, neuromelanosis is associated with a melanocytic proliferation within the leptomeninges and brain parenchyma and not associated with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia.
D. McCune-Albright syndrome – Correct. MAS is a rare disorder characterized by a triad of café-au-lait spots with jagged "coast of Maine" borders, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, and endocrine dysfunction. The diagnosis can be made clinically as long as 2 features of this triad are observed. Endocrine abnormalities most often take the form of precocious puberty, thyroid dysfunction, or growth hormone excess. For more information regarding laboratory testing and imaging to be performed in suspected and newly diagnosed MAS patients, see the referenced consensus guidelines.
E. Congenital dermal melanocytosis – Incorrect. Congenital dermal melanocytosis is characterized by a patch, that is more blue or gray in color than this patient's café-au-lait spots.

### Hypermelanoses of the newborn and of the infant [^111qAkVP]. Dermatologic Clinics (2007). Low credibility.

This article discusses hypermelanoses present at birth or appearing in the first months of life. They may be transient or permanent, localized - as in café-au-lait spots - or segmental, or more rarely, complex or generalized. In most pigmentary diseases, physical examination, including Wood's lamp examination and a detailed history, is usually sufficient. Time of onset, distribution pattern, and associated clinical and sometimes histopathologic findings are helpful in differentiating these disorders. Recently, molecular diagnosis has become available for some rare entities, such as hereditary symmetrical dyschromatoses, but the bulk of nevoid lesions are not understood at the molecular level.

### Decision-making process for conditions nominated to the recommended uniform screening panel: statement of the US department of health and human services secretary's advisory committee on heritable disorders in newborns and children [^11463mby]. Genetics in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The US Secretary of Health and Human Services provides guidance to state newborn screening programs about which conditions should be included in screening (i.e., the "Recommended Uniform Screening Panel"). This guidance is informed by evidence-based recommendations from the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children. This report describes the Advisory Committee's revised decision-making process for considering conditions nominated to the panel.

Methods

An expert panel meeting was held in April 2012 to revise the decision matrix, which helps to guide the recommendation process. In January 2013, the Advisory Committee voted to adopt the revised decision matrix.

Results

The revised decision matrix clarifies the approach to rating magnitude and certainty of the net benefit of screening to the population of screened newborns for nominated conditions, and now includes the consideration of the capability of state newborn screening programs for population-wide implementation by evaluating the feasibility and readiness of states to adopt screening for nominated conditions.

Conclusion

The revised decision matrix will bring increased quality, transparency, and consistency to the process of modifying the recommended uniform screening panel and will now allow formal evaluation of the challenges that state newborn screening programs face in adopting screening for new conditions.

### Challenges in the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in young children facilitated by means of revised diagnostic criteria including genetic testing for pathogenic NF1 gene variants [^1172ygDL]. Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Café-au-lait macules (CALM)

One or 2 CALM occur in 2.5% of infants (< 1 year old) without a known underlying disorder (Alper et al.). However, the presence of more than 3 CALM is rare, being detected in only 0.4% of healthy children ≤ 11 years of age (Whitehouse; Alper et al; Burwell et al.) (Table 2). NF1 is the most frequent disorder associated with the occurrence of more than 5 CALM (Lalor et al.).

Table 2
Number of café-au-lait macules (CALM) in infants (< 1 year) and older children without a known underlying disorder as determined in 3 different studies

In children presenting with isolated CALM at the time of first investigation, the predictive value of CALM for the diagnosis of NF1 has been assessed in several studies (DeBella et al; Nunley et al; Ben-Shachar et al.). These analyses indicated that the higher the number of CALM, the more likely it is that a child has indeed NF1. According to the study of Ben-Shachar et al. 79% of children younger than 14 months with ≥ 6 isolated CALM and no other disease features were diagnosed with NF1 later in life as additional clinical features of NF1 became apparent. If comprehensive genetic testing for pathogenic NF1 variants was applied, 88.4% of children younger than 14 months with ≥ 6 isolated CALM were diagnosed with NF1 (Ben-Shachar et al.). By contrast, none of the children younger than 14 months of age with fewer than 6 isolated CALM were diagnosed with NF1, at least according to the clinical diagnostic criteria. However, 16% of these children were diagnosed with NF1 by means of genetic testing (Ben-Shachar et al.). These findings indicate two important points: First, the presence of ≥ 6 CALM greatly increases the likelihood that children younger than 14 months have NF1. The risk for children with fewer than 6 CALM appears to be significantly lower, as confirmed by other studies (Korf; Nunley et al.). Further, these findings indicate that comprehensive genetic testing for pathogenic NF1 variants increases the proportion of children presenting with isolated CALM, who can be diagnosed with NF1, by at least 10–16%. Thus, including the detection of a pathogenic NF1 variant among the revised diagnostic criteria has been very important in facilitating the early diagnosis of NF1 in this subgroup of children (Legius et al.) (Table 1). This conclusion has been confirmed by the results of the studies of Guigliano et al. and Castellanos et al. as summarized in Table 3.

### Treatment of caf é-Au-lait spots using Q-switched alexandrite laser: analysis of clinical characteristics of 471 children in mainland China [^112Pxk2p]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Café‐au‐lait spots, also known as café‐au‐lait macules (CALMs), are a common pigmentary disorder. Although various laser modalities have been used to treat CALMs, the efficacy of laser treatment in children differs from that in adults. We investigated the efficacy, safety, and clinical factors of the treatment of CALMs using Q‐switched alexandrite laser (755 nm) therapy in children.

Methods

In total, 471 children with CALMs underwent Q‐switched alexandrite laser therapy at a treatment interval of 3–12 months. The safety and efficacy of the laser treatment were evaluated by reviewing clinical records and photographs before and after treatments.

Results

Of the 471 patients, 140 (29.72%) were cured completely, 124 (26.33%) showed substantial improvement, 110 (23.35%) showed improvement, and 97 (20.60%) showed no improvement after one to nine treatments. The overall treatment success rate was 79.41%, and the treatment efficacy was positively correlated with the number of laser treatments (rs = 0.26, P < 0.0001). Sex and the interval of laser treatments were also associated with significant differences in treatment outcomes (P < 0.05). No obvious adverse effects were observed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the number of treatments influenced the treatment efficacy (odds ratio, 2.130; 95% confidence interval, 1.561–2.908).

Conclusions

Q‐switched alexandrite laser (755 nm) therapy is safe and highly effective for CALMs in children, and the number of treatments affects the treatment efficacy. Lasers Surg. Med. © 2019 The Authors. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Congenital glaucoma and neurofibromatosis in a monozygotic twin: case report and review of the literature [^113A774f]. Journal of Child Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

We describe a dramatic case of an identical twin presenting at birth with unilateral congenital glaucoma. Because of the suspicion of neurofibromatosis 1 a magnetic resonance image of the neural axis was obtained, which revealed a plexiform neurofibroma with spinal cord impingement. Diagnosis of neurofibromatosis 1 was confirmed by 3 months of age with the emergence of café-au-lait spots. This case was compared with all 19 reports published in the English literature of neurofibromatosis 1 associated with congenital glaucoma. Initial presentation, family history, characteristics ofthe clinical syndrome, and outcome of glaucoma in infants with neurofibromatosis 1 and congenital glaucoma were reviewed. A plexiform neurofibroma of the ipsilateral eyelid was present in eight patients and ipsilateral facial hypertrophy occurred in three patients. Café-au-lait spots appeared between the ages of 5 weeks and 8 years; none of the patients were reported to have café-au-lait spots at birth. Newborns with unilateral congenital glaucoma should raise high suspicion for neurofibromatosis 1 and its associated findings, which might need immediate intervention.

### Cafe ́ au lait spots: the pediatrician's perspective… [^113Yq43w]. publications.aap.org (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives After completing this article, readers should be able to: Every pediatrician faces the challenge of deciding if a patient who has café au lait spots has an underlying genetic condition. CAL spots typical of neurofibromatosis type 1 are discrete, round or oval, uniformly hyperpigmented skin patches. Their color varies from light to dark brown, and the border may be smooth or irregular. They usually are smaller in newborns, enlarge as children get older, and are less prominent in adults. The histologic basis of CAL spots is increased melanin content, with the presence of giant melanosomes in both melanocytes and basal keratinocytes and no melanocytic proliferation. The giant melanosomes in CAL spots are not unique to NF1; they can be seen in unaffected skin of adults who have NF1 and occasionally in normal skin of healthy individuals. Therefore, the presence of giant melanosomes is not helpful for diagnosing NF1. The. Comments

### Dermoscopy aids in differentiating caf é-au-lait macules from congenital melanocytic nevi in patients with darker skin phototypes [^116mA3HA]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

In infants, differentiating café‐au‐lait macules (CALMs) from congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) can be challenging. Distinguishing between these two entities in a timely manner is important in the consideration of associated diagnoses and potential workup. Dermoscopy enables noninvasive in vivo 10× magnification and visualization of epidermal and dermal structures. Distinct features of melanocytic growths, such as pigment globules (nests of melanocytes), are readily visualized using dermoscopy. The features of CMN differ from those of CALMs under dermoscopy. Despite the utility of dermoscopy to supplement clinical assessment, literature regarding the dermoscopic features of skin growths in infants and children with darker skin is limited. In this report, we describe the dermoscopic features of CALMs in pediatric patients with phototypes IV and V skin (Table 1).

### Congenital pigmentary anomalies in the newborn [^113SwqTu]. NeoReviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Congenital pigmentary anomalies may be evident at birth or soon after, with some birthmarks becoming apparent later in infancy or early childhood. It is important to recognize various pigmentary anomalies in the neonate, most of which are benign but a subset of which are associated with cutaneous morbidity or systemic ramifications and require further evaluation. This review will focus on pigmentary mosaicism, congenital melanocytic nevi, nevus spilus, dermal melanocytosis, and pigmentary anomalies associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (café au lait spots, freckling, plexiform neurofibromas, nevus anemicus), tuberous sclerosis (hypomelanotic macules), and incontinentia pigmenti.

### The diagnostic and clinical significance of caf é-au-lait macules [^1149Fuy8]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Café-au-lait, also referred to as café-au-lait spots or café-au-lait macules, present as well-circumscribed, evenly pigmented macules and patches that range in size from 1 to 2 mm to greater than 20 cm in greatest diameter. Café-au-lait are common in children. Although most café-au-lait present as 1 or 2 spots in an otherwise healthy child, the presence of multiple café-au-lait, large segmental café-au-lait, associated facial dysmorphism, other cutaneous anomalies, or unusual findings on physical examination should suggest the possibility of an associated syndrome. While neurofibromatosis type 1 is the most common syndrome seen in children with multiple café-au-lait, other syndromes associated with one or more café-au-lait include McCune-Albright syndrome, Legius syndrome, Noonan syndrome and other neuro-cardio-facialcutaneous syndromes, ring chromosome syndromes, and constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome.

### Diagnostic value of multiple caf é-au-lait macules for neurofibromatosis 1 in Chinese children [^113dwv9K]. The Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. The appearance of multiple café-au-lait macules is an early sign of the condition, which often alert physicians to follow up and further examine the patient for the possibility of NF1. In order to determine the predictive value of multiple café-au-lait macules at early age for NF1 in Chinese patients, we recruited 19 children who shared the common sign of multiple café-au-lait macules from a general pediatric clinic in Shanghai. All the patients were clinically evaluated following the National Institutes of Health criteria for NF1 and molecular tested for sequence variants and copy number changes. Nine children met the clinical diagnostic criteria of NF1, and molecular tests confirmed all nine patients with pathogenic variants including two genomic deletions, two novel frame-shift variants, four novel nonsense and a splicing variants. In addition, four children who did not meet the diagnostic criteria were also found to carry pathogenic NF1 variants. Overall, 68.4% (13/19) of children with café-au-lait macules and various other clinical presentations were molecularly confirmed with NF1. This study demonstrated that the majority of Chinese children with multiple café-au-lait macules who came to seek for medical attention had NF1. Molecular testing is necessary to be used as an adjunct and sometimes as the main tool for confirming and diagnosing children of NF1 at early age.

### Safety and efficacy of selumetinib in pediatric and adult patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibroma [^114y6m4C]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Another possible therapeutic effect of selumetinib shown in our study is the improvement of growth profiles in prepubertal NF1 children, which might also be associated with the restoration of RAS-MAPK activity. Short stature is one of the characteristic manifestations of genetic disorders (RASopathy) caused by germline gain-of-function mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway, such as Noonan syndrome, and growth hormone therapy is recommended for children with short stature (< −2 SD score). However, growth hormone treatment can be controversial for NF1 patients because of the risks of tumor growth. Therefore, our results suggest a potential indication for selumetinib treatment in children with NF1 who have short stature. Our observation needs to be validated through age- and sex-matched, randomized controlled trials with detailed endocrine and auxology studies. Moreover, we found that café-au-lait spots became fainter with selumetinib treatment, and this effect increased with a longer duration of treatment. This is an encouraging result considering that café-au-lait spots are one of the psychological and social burdens causing mental conflict on NF1 patients. Also, the only currently available treatment using laser has shown limited efficacy. However, as avoidance of sun exposure or the natural tendency for café-au-lait spots to fade with increasing age in post-pubertal patients should be considered as other affecting factors, these preliminary results should be validated through age-adjusted, randomized controlled trials.

Segmental CALMs, a subtype of CALMs, is usually limited to a specific part of the body. Mosaic neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; OMIM 162200) is a common congenital disorder associated with segmental CALMs with an incidence of about 1 case/40000 patients, which is lower than the prevalence of patients with germline NF1 mutations 1,2.

### Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency is the diagnosis in 0.41% of pathogenic NF1 / SPRED1 variant negative children suspected of sporadic neurofibromatosis type 1 [^114UKPVe]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD; MIM 276300) is a recessive childhood cancer syndrome caused by pathogenic variants (PVs) in both alleles of one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes (MLH1, MIM *120436; MSH2, MIM *609309; MSH6, MIM *600678; PMS2, MIM *600259).CMMRD is associated with an extraordinarily high tumor risk, with 321 malignancies in a cohort of 197 CMMRD patients analyzed in 2017. Nearly all known CMMRD patients developed a malignancy within the first three decades of life, predominantly in the first decade. The spectrum of CMMRD-associated malignancies is very broad, including primarily hematological malignancies, tumors of the central nervous system, and carcinomas associated with Lynch syndrome. Therefore, rigorous surveillance protocols, including annual to biannual brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) from the time of diagnosis and colonoscopy starting at age 6–8 years, are recommended. – Timely diagnosis of CMMRD also has implications for the patient's family. The risk of recurrence in a sibling is 25%, and the parents are carriers of heterozygous MMR gene PVs that predispose to Lynch syndrome-associated cancers in adulthood.

CMMRD shows phenotypic overlap with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), a common neurocutaneous disorder (incidence 1:2000–3000). Hallmark features of NF1 are café-au-lait macules (CALMs), skinfold freckling, and neurofibromas. These, and additional characteristic features, are included in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (Consensus Conference) diagnostic criteria for NF1. Presence of at least two of these NIH criteria confirms NF1. However, young children often do not fulfill these criteria as NF1 is a progressive disorder and approximately half of NF1 patients are sporadic cases. Highly sensitive NF1 variant analysis protocols, enable early diagnosis in these children without waiting for unequivocal clinical presentation. If no germline NF1 PV is found, mosaic or segmental NF1 due to postzygotic mutationsand Legius syndrome caused by a SPRED1 PV are the most important differential diagnosesexpected to account for at least 10% and 2.4%, respectively.

### Health supervision for children with neurofibromatosis… [^116E3XJ5]. publications.aap.org (1995). Low credibility.

This set of guidelines is designed to assist the pediatrician in caring for the child in whom the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis has been made. Although the pediatrician's first contact with the child is usually during infancy, occasionally the pregnant woman who has been given the prenatal diagnosis of neurofibromatosis will be referred for advice. Therefore, these guidelines offer advice for this situation as well. At least two distinct types are recognized — neurofibromatosis 1, or NF-1, and neurofibromatosis 2, or NF-2. This discussion addresses only issues concerning the diagnosis and management of NF-1. 1–8 Neurofibromatosis 1 is a progressive, multisystem disorder affecting about 1 in 3, 000 individuals.

9 A National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference 10 regarding NF-1 demarcated seven features, of which two or more are required to establish firmly the diagnosis of NF-1:

1. Six or more cafe-au-lait spots or macules, greater than or equal to 5 mm in diameter in prepubertal patients and 15 mm in diameter in postpubertal patients;
2. Two or more neurofibromata of any type, or one plexiform neurofibroma;.
3. Freckling in the axillary or inguinal region;
4. Optic glioma; 5. Two or more Lisch nodules;
6. A distinctive osseous lesion such as sphenoid dysplasia or cortical thinning of long bones, with or without pseudarthrosis; or 7. A first-degree relative with NF-1 according to the preceding criteria. Diagnosis in nonfamilial pediatric cases may be difficult because certain clinical features are age-pendent. Comments.

Abstract

Dermoscopy aids in the diagnosis and management of pigmented growths and disorders of pigmentation in children. However, there is limited literature on the dermoscopic appearance of café‐au‐lait macules (CALMs) and congenital melanocytic nevi in patients with dark skin. We report two cases of young children with dark skin and many hyperpigmented patches in whom dermoscopy was utilized to accurately diagnose CALMs and facilitate testing for neurofibromatosis.

We describe a 4-year-old, otherwise healthy boy with a congenital history of a perioral and labial segmental café-au-lait macule, who was noted to have unilateral localized gingival hyperpigmentation that aligned with the café-au-lait macule. This case is highly illustrative of the embryologic timing of the genetic event locally, which leads to café-au-lait type hyperpigmentation. Because the facial features and the ectoderm overlying the facial muscles develop around the third to fourth week of gestation, the distribution of this café-au-lait macule suggests development at the same time.

Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (OMIM 276300) is caused by germline mutations in mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2 (including methylation due to EPCAM deletion), MSH6, and PMS2) and is characterized by a high risk of developing cancers during childhood, including Lynch syndrome–associated cancers, hematologic malignancies, and embryonic tumors; individuals often have neurofibromatosis type 1–like features with café-au-lait macules in most cases, and they do not always have a family history of cancer.

### Challenges in the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in young children facilitated by means of revised diagnostic criteria including genetic testing for pathogenic NF1 gene variants [^114Ubb34]. Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most frequent disorder associated with multiple café-au-lait macules (CALM) which may either be present at birth or appear during the first year of life. Other NF1-associated features such as skin-fold freckling and Lisch nodules occur later during childhood whereas dermal neurofibromas are rare in young children and usually only arise during early adulthood. The NIH clinical diagnostic criteria for NF1, established in 1988, include the most common NF1-associated features. Since many of these features are age-dependent, arriving at a definitive diagnosis of NF1 by employing these criteria may not be possible in infancy if CALM are the only clinical feature evident. Indeed, approximately 46% of patients who are diagnosed with NF1 later in life do not meet the NIH diagnostic criteria by the age of 1 year. Further, the 1988 diagnostic criteria for NF1 are not specific enough to distinguish NF1 from other related disorders such as Legius syndrome. In this review, we outline the challenges faced in diagnosing NF1 in young children, and evaluate the utility of the recently revised (2021) diagnostic criteria for NF1, which include the presence of pathogenic variants in the NF1 gene and choroidal anomalies, for achieving an early and accurate diagnosis.

### A genotype-first approach identifies high incidence of NF1 pathogenic variants with distinct disease associations [^11546ob5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The human disease gene NF1 encodes the protein neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor and negative regulator of the RAS/MAPK pathway –. Heterozygous loss of function variants within the NF1 gene lead to the autosomal dominant disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 3000 –. NF1 is often cited as a classic example of a pleiotropic genetic disorder with variable expressivity and complete penetrance; that is, every individual with a germline pathogenic NF1 variant is expected to meet NF1 diagnostic criteria, although their specific presentation and degree of organ involvement may vary –. The classic features as defined by the NIH clinical diagnostic criteria include: cutaneous café-au-lait macules (CALMs), neurofibromas, axillary/inguinal freckling, iris hamartoma, and certain skeletal anomalies. Affected individuals also are at increased risk for hypertension, cardiovascular anomalies, and certain malignancies, making early diagnosis and screening a critical aspect of care.

The malignancies classically seen in NF1 patients are of neural crest derivation, however patients with NF1 also have been observed to have increased risk for a broad range of different malignancies, often with distinctive disease behavior and prognosis. For example, breast cancers in female patients with NF1 are thought to be characterized by an earlier age of onset, increased mortality, and unfavorable prognostic factors, such as estrogen/progesterone receptor negativity and HER2 amplification –. With the advent of widespread tumor sequencing in cancer patients without NF1, it has become clear that somatic NF1 driver mutations are also common in certain tumors, including melanoma, glioblastoma, and breast and ovarian cancer.

Somatic mosaic NF1 variants also have rarely been reported in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age- and oncologic treatment-related phenomenon characterized by the presence of clonal expanded, genetically distinct subpopulations of the hematopoietic lineage within a single patient, and in the condition known as segmental neurofibromatosis, a subtype of NF1 with a reported incidence of roughly 1 in 75,000. Segmental NF1 results from a somatic post-zygotic mutation arising early during embryogenesis, with the resultant mutant cell lineage going on to populate limited areas of the body which manifest as foci of affected tissue displaying classic NF1-associated features, and with the causal NF1 variant detectable only in affected cells. On the other hand, CH results from somatic mutations occurring late in life limited to the blood, and is therefore not expected to be associated with classic NF1 presentations.

### Multiple caféau lait spots in a group of fair-skinned children without signs or symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1 [^1123TVYw]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of six or more café au lait (CAL) spots is a criterion for the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). Children with multiple CAL spots are often referred to dermatologists for NF-1 screening. The objective of this case series is to characterize a subset of fair-complected children with red or blond hair and multiple feathery CAL spots who did not meet the criteria for NF-1 at the time of their last evaluation.

Methods

We conducted a chart review of eight patients seen in our pediatric dermatology clinic who were previously identified as having multiple CAL spots and no other signs or symptoms of NF-1.

Results

We describe eight patients ages 2 to 9 years old with multiple, irregular CAL spots with feathery borders and no other signs or symptoms of NF-1. Most of these patients had red or blond hair and were fair complected. All patients were evaluated in our pediatric dermatology clinic, some with a geneticist. The number of CAL spots per patient ranged from 5 to 15 (mean 9.4, median 9).

Conclusion

A subset of children, many with fair complexions and red or blond hair, has an increased number of feathery CAL spots and appears unlikely to develop NF-1, although genetic testing was not conducted. It is important to recognize the benign nature of CAL spots in these patients so that appropriate screening and follow-up recommendations may be made.

INTRODUCTION

Nomenclature and history

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; OMIM 613113), inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, is characterized by multiple café-au-lait macules (CALMs), skinfold freckling (more correctly termed lentiginous macules since they occur in non–sun exposed areas), iris Lisch nodules, tumors of the nervous system, and other features. Disease manifestations can occur in any body system. There is a significantly increased risk of certain cancers, including female breast cancer < 50 years, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), and brain tumors. The modern history of nomenclature of neurofibromatosis started in 1987 with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference on Neurofibromatosis. Until that time there had been confusion in the literature as to whether bilateral vestibular schwannomas (previously termed acoustic neuromas) were a feature of NF1 or a distinct entity. Riccardi laid the groundwork for the NIH consensus criteria by proposing a numerical classification system based on the presence/absence of CALMs and skinfold freckling, specific eye signs, neurofibromas, and complications specific to each type. The mapping of the NF1 gene to chromosome 17and the NF2 gene to chromosome 22allowed the consensus conference to establish diagnostic criteria for the two conditions (Table S1). The 1988 panel recognized that "[p]atients who do not fit into the NF1 or NF2 group by clinical or genetic criteria may, in the future, constitute the basis for establishing additional types of NF".

The NIH criteria include the most frequent disease manifestations (CALMs, freckling, neurofibromas, and Lisch nodules) alongside disease complications typical of NF1. Since 1987 there has been one formal review of the NF1 criteria by the Clinical Care Advisory Board of the National Neurofibromatosis Foundation (now the Children's Tumor Foundation). No criteria alterations were suggested.

The NF1 gene was cloned in 1990. Subsequent cell biology studies have found that neurofibromin, the NF1 gene product, largely operates as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates the RAS/MAPK pathway activity by accelerating the hydrolysis of RAS-bound GTP. Cell biology advances and animal models have led to the identification of MEK inhibitors as a treatment for plexiform neurofibromas. In April 2020, selumetinib was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of children with NF1-related symptomatic plexiform neurofibroma.

### Healthcare professionals' perspectives on supporting individuals with NF1 during pregnancy and decision-making processes [^1156mhF6]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

3.1.3 Subtheme 3 – The sensitivity of discussing the possibility of their child inheriting, in the context of uncertainoutcomes, complicates decision‐making and communication

Most HCPs described how the unpredictable nature of NF1 complicates reproductive decision‐making and communication around it, particularly around prenatal testing. Although prenatal testing can confirm the presence of an NF1 variant in the fertilized egg, it does not provide insight into the severity of the condition in children. Some described how parents struggled with the decision to terminate a pregnancy as it is not possible to know how severely the child would be affected, especially when the outcome for the child could be relatively mild. The inability to provide clear outcomes contributed to a sense of emotional burden for both parents and clinicians.

[from a patient's perspective] What if I end a pregnancy for an affected baby, but actually that child was only going to be mildly affected — potentially no symptoms in childhood, maybe just a few café‐au‐lait spots… That's really an ethically quite challenging discussion to have.

These conversations were more complex when NF1 was already present in the parent or another family member. Some HCPs shared that discussing reproductive options in such contexts could feel deeply personal, raising the possibility of avoiding transmission could feel like a judgment on their own or their child's lives, especially when individuals had lived with well‐managed NF1 for many years.

But ensuring you have a child without NF1 is almost like saying to them, well, we make sure somebody like you isn't born, which is really difficult and some parents find that incredibly difficult to understand.

Most HCPs also observed that parents' decisions were influenced by their own or family members' experiences when making decisions. One HCP remarked that, in some cases, "people do think because they're mildly affected they think the baby is gonna be mildly affected (HCP‐13)", which required careful communication about the condition's variability. They considered the perinatal period as particularly challenging for families, regardless of the decisions made, with concerns extending beyond genetic risk to include tumor growth, pregnancy complications, and long‐term fears about the child's appearance, relationships, and future reproductive choices.

### Clinical practice guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^1135DSkA]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric hypertension — physical examination and history suggesting secondary causes or end-organ damage are organized by system, with representative examples as follows: Vital signs such as "Tachycardia" may indicate "Hyperthyroidism, PCC, [or] Neuroblastoma", and vascular findings like "Decreased lower extremity pulses; drop in BP from upper to lower extremities" suggest "Coarctation of the aorta". Ocular findings of "Retinal changes" are noted as "Severe HTN, more likely to be associated with secondary HTN". Characteristic head and neck features include "Elfin facies" linked to "Williams syndrome" and "Webbed neck" linked to "Turner syndrome". Skin findings include "Café-au-lait spots" pointing to "Neurofibromatosis" and "Acanthosis nigricans" associated with "T2DM". Cardiac examination may reveal "Apical heave" consistent with "LVH", while abdominal auscultation of an "Epigastric, flank bruit" suggests "RAS". Genitourinary history of "Ambiguous or virilized genitalia" indicates "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia". Extremity symptoms of "Muscle weakness" may reflect "Hyperaldosteronism, Liddle syndrome, [or] Reninoma", and neurologic/metabolic symptoms such as "Hypokalemia, headache, dizziness, polyuria, nocturia" point to "Monogenic HTN (Liddle syndrome, GRA, AME)".

Question 2: In addition to skeletal problems, this patient is at highest risk for which of the following?
A. Precocious puberty
B. Seizures
C. Optic glioma
D. Gastrointestinal neoplasia
E. Infertility

Answer:
A. Precocious puberty – Correct. Precocious puberty itself was formerly a component of the MAS triad, before thyroid dysfunction and growth hormone excess, among other endocrinopathies, were recognized as typical manifestations of the disease. Precocious puberty in males with MAS most often manifests as testicular enlargement, appearance of axillary and pubic hair, and increased body odor. Additionally, renal involvement as manifested by phosphate wasting is another common feature of patients with MAS.
B. Seizures – Incorrect. Port-wine stains involving the forehead can be associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome in which patients are at risk for seizures. Although the café-au-lait spot of this patient involves the forehead, it is not a port-wine stain and he is not at increased risk for seizures.
C. Optic glioma – Incorrect. The incidence of optic gliomas among patients with NF1 is 15% to 20%. On the other hand, patients with MAS are not at increased risk.
D. Gastrointestinal neoplasia – Incorrect. Patients with certain conditions such as Peutz-Jehgers syndrome and Cowden disease are at increased risk for gastrointestinal polyps and gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma, but this is not the case for patients with MAS.
E. Infertility – Incorrect. Female patients with MAS are at increased risk for menstrual disturbance and infertility. However, infertility occurs secondarily to precocious puberty and menstrual irregularity; furthermore, this patient is a male.

### Updated approach to patients with multiple caféau lait macules [^111J2CWu]. Dermatologic Clinics (2022). Medium credibility.

Café au lait macules (CALMs) are a normal and frequent finding in the general population, but multiple CALMs raise the possibility of an underlying neurocutaneous disease like neurofibromatosis type I. Certain features of CALMs like number, size, shape, and distribution are important in identifying children at higher risk of having a neurocutaneous disorder or another genetic disorder. Genetic testing can be especially helpful in establishing a diagnosis in atypical presentations, or when the child is young and other features of the disease aside from CALMs have not manifested.

This report presents a case of ring chromosome 7 syndrome with bilateral cleft lip and palate. A four-year-old boy presented with bilateral cleft lip and palate, microcephaly, clenched toes, cafe-au-lait spots, a history of epilepsy, and severe intellectual disability. Genetic karyotyping revealed 46 XY r(7) (p22q36). His cheiloplasty and delayed palatoplasty were successful. A review of 22 previous r(7) patients revealed that 22.7% had cleft lip and/or palate. This case demonstrates the importance of a multidisciplinary evaluation for cleft patients, particularly those with syndromic features and global developmental delay.

2 CASE REPORTS

Patient 1: A newborn with phototype V skin and many (> 8) hyperpigmented macules and patches on the torso (Figure 1A, B). The macules and patches were dark brown in color and present on the torso and all four extremities. Most were larger than 5 mm. The patient's mother was taking several psychiatric medications during pregnancy, but none were associated with eruptive nevi in children. She was not on a biologic or immunosuppressive medication. Dermatology was consulted to aid in determining if the hyperpigmented patches were CALMs versus CMNs. Polarized dermoscopy of the largest patch on the chest (Figure 1C) reveals uniform hyperpigmentation with a diffuse fine reticular pattern and an abrupt border. No pigment globules were present, and the reticulation did not darken centrally or fade at the edge. Based on the clinical and dermoscopic findings, testing for neurofibromatosis was recommended and subsequently positive for NF1 gene mutation.

Patient 2: A 17‐month‐old girl with phototype IV skin presented to the outpatient clinic due to many brown macules and patches on the skin. The patches were all larger than 1 cm and present bilaterally on the upper back and buttock (Figure 2). Under polarized dermoscopy, the patches were uniformly brown (slightly darker than the unaffected skin) with delicate reticulation and abrupt edges. There was no follicular accentuation or central hyperpigmentation. No pigment globules were visualized, and the patches did not display hypertrichosis. The patient's mother also had many hyperpigmented macules and was known to have neurofibromatosis type 1.

### A genotype-first approach identifies high incidence of NF1 pathogenic variants with distinct disease associations [^117ExxCi]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Half of NF1 PV carriers do not have a clinical NF1 diagnosis

Chart review revealed that only 23 of the 58 NF1 PV carriers in PMBB (39.7%) had a known diagnosis of NF1. We thus divided the PMBB cohort into two groups: the Clinical-NF1 group (those with an NF1 PV and a known NF1 diagnosis) and the PV-Only group (those with an NF1 PV but without a known diagnosis of NF1). Only one of the 35 PV-Only individuals had medical history at all suggestive of NF1 (Supplementary Data 2); individual 39 was noted to have fifteen CALM on skin exam and had upper limb deformities and spina bifida; a diagnosis of NF1 had not been made, although she appears to meet clinical diagnostic criteria. No other patients in the PV-Only group had reported evidence of cafe au lait macules, axillary/inguinal freckling, or neurofibromas. Chart review revealed that individual 32 was the same individual that had been referred to our clinic as Case 1, reported above, with no evidence of NF1 on our own detailed physical exam. In the Clincal-NF1 group, individual 41 had been evaluated in our clinic and was given a clinical diagnosis of NF1 based on widespread CALM and innumerable neurofibromas, with all dermatomes apparently affected. However, clinical genetic testing of the NF1 gene in this patient returned negative, whereas research-based sequencing in PMBB revealed an NF1 PV with a variant allele fraction (VAF) of 0.10, suggesting post-zygotic mosaicism for the variant.

Question 3: Which term best describes the GNAS gene mutation of McCune-Albright syndrome?
A. Autosomal dominant
B. X-linked recessive
C. Anticipation
D. Autosomal recessive
E. Somatic mutation

Answer:
A. Autosomal dominant – Incorrect. The mutation in GNAS that is associated with MAS is a somatic mutation that occurs after fertilization. MAS is commonly confused with NF1, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.
B. X-linked recessive – Incorrect. X-linked ichthyosis, X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder, and hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia are examples of X-linked dermatologic diseases. GNAS is located on chromosome 20, not the X-chromosome.
C. Anticipation – Incorrect. Anticipation is a feature of many trinucleotide repeat disorders. MAS is not a trinucleotide repeat disorder.
D. Autosomal recessive – Incorrect. The GNAS mutations associated with MAS are somatic and not germline; therefore, these mutations are not inherited.
E. Somatic mutation – Correct. In MAS, a mutation to the GNAS gene occurs that is a somatic missense gain-of-function mutation at Arg201 or Gln227. It occurs after fertilization, resulting in genetic mosaicism; germline involvement of such gain-of-function mutations is presumed to be incompatible with life as MAS has not been observed to be inherited. The presentation and natural course of MAS are variable and dependent on which cells incurred that GNAS mutation. GNAS encodes the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-regulating protein subunit, Gsα, and its mutation in MAS causes a constitutively active cyclic adenosine monophosphate pathway in the affected cells. In the skin, Gsα mediates the action of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone to stimulate melanin production, resulting in the characteristic café-au-lait spots of MAS.

Consideration for leukemia predisposition syndromes — given the risk of increased treatment-related toxicity, increased risk of secondary malignancy, and need for surveillance beyond what is typical for patients with a history of leukemia, it is important that a clinician perform a thorough physical exam to look for features of an underlying genetic syndrome (eg, cafe au lait macules), and additionally a thorough family history should be taken to assess for others with hematologic or other malignancies, with or without antecedent cytopenias, in order to screen for patients who may have a leukemia predisposition syndrome. Additional considerations include low hypodiploidy, which could indicate the presence of a germline TP53 mutation, and for individuals that undergo genomic testing, the presence of tumor variants of potential germline relevance.

### Postnatal gestational age estimation using newborn screening blood spots: a proposed validation protocol [^1116fhwX]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Our work suggests potential value in using dried blood spot-derived analytes for the postnatal assessment of gestational age. This approach may be particularly useful in low-resource settings where reliable estimates of gestational age at the time of birth are difficult to obtain. Postnatal estimates may be useful both in guiding the course of care and for population surveillance of the burden of preterm birth. Before this goal may be realised, however, our previously published gestational age prediction model must be validated in other infant populations. This study aims to evaluate the performance of our reference model on newborn screening profiles taken from infants born in low-resource settings for whom prenatal dating ultrasound scans are available. Additionally, although newborn heel-prick samples are the standard used by newborn screening programs, cord blood may be more easily collected without discomfort to the infant and stress to the parents. We will therefore also evaluate model performance in data derived from cord blood samples.

### Precision immuno-oncology approach for four malignant tumors in siblings with constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome [^113Qt57c]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We gained several important clinical insights during the management of these two siblings with CMMRD, which, we believe, will be extremely useful in managing future patients with such rare and complex disorders.

First, we observed that the clinical phenotype can vary between two siblings harboring the same germline pathogenic variants in CMMRD. Here, only the younger brother harbored café-au-lait macules, which is otherwise the commonest clinical manifestation triggering evaluation for germline disorders like neurofibromatosis and CMMRD in the context of a childhood malignancy. It was recently demonstrated that children with CMMRD and café-au-lait macules uniformly lack germline variants in NF1 or SPRED1 genesbut can harbor somatic mosaicism for such aberrations explaining such inter-patient heterogeneity. Second, the high prevalence and early onset of multiple malignancies in this aggressive cancer syndrome highlight the importance of systematic cancer surveillance in these patients. Notably, both malignancies in the second sibling were detected on imaging-based surveillance in the asymptomatic state, plausibly contributing to the improved outcome in this patient.

Next, we demonstrate that the germline genomic instability in CMMRD patients not only leads to the development of hypermutant cancers but can also contribute to the rapid evolution of the mutational spectrum between the primary diagnosis and recurrence. The first patient's PDHGG harbored a combination of MMRD and polymerase-proofreading deficiencies, which not only contributed to the extreme TMB, and MSI burden both at diagnosis and recurrence but resulted in the acquisition of diverse novel somatic variants at recurrence. This underscores that a repeat biopsy followed by genomic analyses of a recurrent tumor should be an important consideration in a patient with CMMRD. As recently reported for these genomically unstable RRD cancers, known drivers of immune evasion in lung and other cancers, including defects in antigen presentation and interferon signaling, were not demonstrated to be enriched at recurrence and persistently high immunogenicity was noted. This underscores that a repeat biopsy followed by genomic analyses of a recurrent tumor should be an important consideration in a patient with CMMRD, as this can allow re-initiation of treatment and continuation of immunotherapy can lead to second, even if, delayed responses.

### Value of a caf é-au-lait macules screening clinic: experience from the hospital for sick children in toronto [^113gHG1u]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Café-au-lait macules (CALMs) are a characteristic feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), but also occur in other genetic disorders. Differential diagnosis of CALMs remains challenging and can be stressful for families. We sought to examine the role of an established CALMs screening clinic in diagnosing CALMs-related disorders.

Method

We retrospectively reviewed patients seen between July 2012 and January 2019 in a CALMs screening clinic at The Hospital for Sick Children, a tertiary pediatric hospital in Toronto, Canada. Pediatric patients were referred because of multiple CALMs or suspected NF1. Selection was based on a chronological referral sample with no exclusions. A pediatric dermatologist examined all patients for CALMs and NF1 manifestations. Genetic testing was offered to confirm a clinical diagnosis or when clinical findings were inconclusive.

Results

Three hundred patients, of which 152 (50.7%) were female and had a mean age of 5.6 ± 4.8 years were seen during the study period. NF1 was diagnosed in 76 (25.3%) patients, mosaic NF1 in 38 (12.7%) patients, and 8 (2.7%) patients received other genetic diagnoses. One hundred and twelve (37.3%) patients were diagnosed with isolated CALMs not associated with an underlying genetic disease. Furthermore, 36 (12%) of our patients did not have CALMs.

Conclusions

The CALMs screening clinic aided in the early diagnosis of genetic disorders such as NF1 and distinguished CALMs from other hyperpigmented lesions. We encourage the adoption of this clinic model in referral centers to streamline and optimize care of patients with presumptive diagnosis of CALMs.

### Caf é-au-lait spots and cleft palate: not a chance association [^117VJac9]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The recognition of syndromic forms of cleft palate is important for condition-specific management. Here, we report a patient with cleft palate, congenital heart disease, intellectual disability, and café-au-lait spots who had a deletion of chromosome 15q14. The identification of the precise breakpoints using a Nanopore-based long-read sequencer showed that the deletion spanned MEIS2 and SPRED1 loci. Cleft palate and café-au-lait spots can be ascribed to MEIS2 and SPRED1, respectively. Patients with cleft palate and café-au-lait spots should be encouraged to undergo a detailed genomic evaluation, including screening for a 15q14 deletion, to enable appropriate anticipatory medico-surgical management and genetic counseling.

DISCUSSION

CALMs are a hyperpigmented skin lesions that commonly appear in children. The etiology is not clear, and the morbidity is about 10%–20%, of which 2% appear in newborns 4. In the present study, most patients developed CALMs within 1 year of age (93.63%, n = 441), which is consistent with relevant literature reports. The sex of the patient did not affect the age at onset of CALMs. CALMs appeared mostly on the face and less often on the limbs and trunk; they were circular or irregular in shape with a light brown to dark brown color and clear boundaries 5. The size of the CALMs generally increased proportionately with age and development of the body; however, the lesions usually remained < 5 cm. There were more female than male patients among all 471 patients. CALMs were seen on the face and neck in 456 patients (96.82%), accounting for the vast majority of cases. Parents tended to pay more attention to the lesion when the patient was a female whose CALMs were present on an exposed part of the body, generally increasing the urgency for treatment. Neurofibromatosis was present in four patients (6.25%) among those with multiple lesions (n = 64, 13.59%). Multiple CALMs should alert the clinician to the possibility of neurofibromatosis 6, 7, 8, Albright syndrome 9, Watson syndrome, and other genetic diseases and solid tumors 10; relevant genetic investigations are necessary in such cases.

NF1 genetic testing — Proposed approach (Figure 1) begins at Patient Meets Diagnostic Clinical Criteria and routes testing by presentation. For individuals meeting criteria, blood/saliva NF1 (include SPRED1 if only CALM and freckling) is followed by either consider additional testing (related conditions), or refer to NF specialist when results are uninformative, or follow disorder-specific management when positive. For Mosaic/Segmental Presentation, testing uses blood/saliva and tissue NF1 (include SPRED1 if only CALM and freckling), with uninformative blood/saliva results prompting consider additional testing (tissue, related conditions), or refer to NF specialist and positive tissue results proceeding to follow disorder-specific management. For cases with only café-au-lait macules and freckling, blood/saliva NF1/SPRED1 is obtained; if results are uninformative, consider mosaicism or somatic variant and consider tumor testing or refer to NF specialist, while positive results proceed to follow disorder-specific management. For isolated nerve sheath tumors, the pathway lists blood/saliva or tissue NF1 or tumor/oncology panel.

c If only café-au-lait macules and freckles are present, the diagnosis is most likely NF1 but exceptionally the individual might have another diagnosis such as Legius syndrome. At least one of the two pigmentary findings (café-au-lait macules or freckles) must be bilateral

d Sphenoid wing dysplasia is not a separate criterion in case of an ipsilateral orbital plexiform neurofibroma

e Thinning of the long bone cortex turned out not to be the primary lesion. Instead, anterolateral bowing of the lower limb and medullary canal narrowing as well as cortical thickening in the tibia and/or fibula is observed. Therefore, the orthopaedic criterion has been rephrased accordingly

f In the revised diagnostic criteria, only an affected parent but not affected siblings and offspring qualify as a criterion for NF1. If only siblings are affected, the diagnosis of CMMRD is possible. 'Offspring' was omitted because if an adult person has only one diagnostic criterion and one offspring meeting the diagnostic criteria, mosaic NF1 cannot be excluded

In this review, the challenges presented by the diagnosis of NF1 in young children are outlined, and the utility of the recently revised diagnostic criteria for NF1 (which include genetic testing) for overcoming these problems, are discussed.

### Can the diagnosis of NF1 be excluded clinically? A lack of pigmentary findings in families with spinal neurofibromatosis demonstrates a limitation of clinical diagnosis [^113pG224]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Consensus clinical diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) include café-au-lait macules and skinfold freckling. The former are frequently the earliest manifestation of NF1, and as such are of particular significance when assessing young children at risk of the condition. A phenotype of predominantly spinal neurofibromatosis has been identified in a small minority of families with NF1, often in association with a relative or absolute lack of cutaneous manifestations. An association with splicing and missense mutations has previously been reported for spinal neurofibromatosis, but on the basis of molecular results in only a few families.

Method

Patients with spinal NF1 were identified through the Manchester nationally commissioned service for complex NF1.

Results

Five families with spinal NF1 were identified, with a broad spectrum of NF1 mutations, providing further evidence that this phenotype may arise in association with any genre of mutation in this gene. Pigmentary manifestations were absent or very mild in affected individuals. Several further affected individuals, some with extensive spinal root tumours, were ascertained when additional family members were assessed.

Conclusions

Clinical NF1 consensus criteria cannot be used to exclude the diagnosis of spinal NF1, especially in childhood. This emphasises the importance of molecular confirmation in individuals and families with atypical presentations of NF1.

A 6-hour-old infant was found to have large irregularly bordered brown patches on the trunk, neck (Fig 1), and buttocks. The infant otherwise had a normal-term delivery without any concerning findings.

Question 1: Which of the following syndromes typically presents with lesions featuring the morphology seen here?
A. McCune-Albright syndrome
B. LEOPARD syndrome
C. Neurofibromatosis type 1
D. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome
E. Legius syndrome

Answers:
A. McCune-Albright syndrome – Correct. McCune-Albright syndrome is characterized by abnormalities in endocrine function, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, and café-au-lait spots. The café-au-lait spots are generally large, respect the midline, and often have irregular, jagged borders, resembling the coast of Maine. These spots are the presenting finding.
B. LEOPARD syndrome – Incorrect. LEOPARD syndrome is a rare inherited disorder associated with multiple congenital anomalies also known as multiple lentigines syndrome. LEOPARD is an acronym for the major findings in this disease: multiple Lentigines, EKG (electrocardiogram) conduction abnormalities, Ocular hypertelorism, Pulmonic stenosis, Abnormal genitalia, Retardation of growth, and sensorineural Deafness.
C. Neurofibromatosis type 1 – Incorrect. The café-au-lait spots found in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 typically have regular borders resembling the coast of California, are often smaller, and do not respect the midline. Although linear segmental variants of neurofibromatosis type 1 can present with larger, segmental café-au-lait spots, these lesions also typically have more regular borders.
D. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome – Incorrect. Patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome have multiple perioral lentigines and intestinal polyps and a predisposition for gastrointestinal tract and other malignancies. These patients do not typically have café-au-lait spots.
E. Legius syndrome – Incorrect. Almost all patients with Legius syndrome present with 6 or more café-au-lait spots. These café-au-lait spots are similar to those present in neurofibromatosis type 1, with their regular borders, smaller size, and crossing of the midline.

Any cancer experience — subsequent malignancy risk and genetic predisposition evaluation: Potential late effects include Subsequent malignancy and Risk of malignancy in offspring. Strongly consider assessment for cancer predisposition in the following settings: Any tumor listed in Table 1; Any bilateral cancer; > 1 primary cancer; ≥ 1 first degree relative(s) with cancer; Other concerning family history including consanguinity; Diagnosis of adult-type cancer in a child (basal cell carcinoma, breast, colon, gastrointestinal, ovarian, etc.); Diagnosis of cancer predisposition syndrome in a relative. For patients who may be at risk for cancer predisposition by history or, with a history of one of the cancer types listed in Table 1, consider: Referral to genetic counseling or clinical genetics and Referral for preconception/prenatal counseling. SYSTEM = SMN SCORE = 1. Additional Information advises to consider patient and cancer/treatment factors, pre-morbid/co-morbid health conditions, and health behaviors that may increase risk, noting common cancers where underlying predisposition risk is increased under specific clinical scenarios including: AML with personal or family history of cytopenias or chronic infections, monosomy 7, short stature, microcephaly, other congenital anomalies, or 3 or more café au lait macules; B-Cell ALL with low hypodiploid cytogenetics (32–39 chromosomes); Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma diagnosed < 2 years old, diffuse anaplasia or botryoid subtype, or in genitourinary location; Medulloblastoma of SHH or WNT subtypes, or diagnosed < 3 years old if subtype unknown; Hepatoblastoma with family history of GI cancer/polyps, or with features of hemihyperplasia/overgrowth syndrome; and Wilms tumor diagnosed < 2 years old with GU anomalies (including history of undescended testicle or hypospadias), hemihyperplasia/overgrowth, or other syndromic features.
