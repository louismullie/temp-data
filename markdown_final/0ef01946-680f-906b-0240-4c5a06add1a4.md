## Question

54 yo F with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and low-dose prednisone presents with cough, fever, and new pulmonary infiltrate on CXR. Sputum analysis reveals *Pneumocystis jirovecii*. She is alert, O₂ sat 97% on room air, creatinine 1.2 mg/dL. Allergy to sulfa drugs (rash, not anaphylaxis). Infectious disease recommends atovaquone for PCP; nephrology consult advises adding a single IV dose of rasburicase for newly detected uric acid of 10.2 mg/dL, anticipating possible tumor lysis syndrome. Proceed with rasburicase?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to give rasburicase for a uric acid of 10.2 mg/dL in a 54-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis, Pneumocystis pneumonia, and no evidence of tumor lysis syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there is a valid indication for rasburicase. Then, I should verify the safety prerequisites, especially G6PD status. Next, I will weigh the risk–benefit balance in this specific context. Finally, I will outline an alternative plan and confirm sample handling if rasburicase were ever indicated in the future.

> Let me first confirm the indication. Rasburicase is indicated for initial management of plasma uric acid in pediatric and adult patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or solid tumors who are receiving anticancer therapy expected to cause tumor lysis and subsequent hyperuricemia; it is not indicated for hyperuricemia in the absence of malignancy or impending cytotoxic therapy, and it is not indicated for gout or other non-malignant causes of hyperuricemia [^113yLEZr] [^115E1AWS]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — could this patient's immunosuppression mimic TLS risk? No, TLS risk arises from rapid tumor cell lysis with cytotoxic therapy, which is not present here, so there is no oncologic indication for rasburicase in this scenario [^115E1AWS].

> Wait, let me verify the safety prerequisites before even considering dosing. Rasburicase is contraindicated in G6PD deficiency due to risk of severe hemolysis and methemoglobinemia, and guidelines recommend screening patients at higher risk prior to use; if G6PD deficiency is present, rasburicase should be avoided and allopurinol used instead [^114TeaVv] [^112rhdt2] [^112V8jVv]. I should confirm that G6PD status is unknown here, which means rasburicase cannot be administered safely without testing, and even then, there remains no indication in this non-malignant context [^114TeaVv].

> I need to check the risk–benefit balance carefully. The potential benefit of rasburicase is rapid enzymatic degradation of uric acid to prevent uric acid nephropathy in TLS; however, in the absence of TLS, there is no proven clinical benefit, while the risks of hypersensitivity, hemolysis, and methemoglobinemia remain real, even if uncommon, and the drug is costly and off-label in this setting [^113yLEZr] [^114TeaVv] [^112GKM8h]. Hold on, I should verify whether a uric acid of 10.2 mg/dL alone justifies prophylaxis; it does not, in the absence of malignancy and cytotoxic therapy, so the net benefit is unfavorable here [^115E1AWS].

> Let me consider alternatives. For asymptomatic hyperuricemia without TLS, observation with hydration and follow-up labs is reasonable; if treatment is ever needed for gout or chronic hyperuricemia, allopurinol or febuxostat would be appropriate, but neither is indicated acutely in this scenario either, and neither carries the hemolysis risk of rasburicase [^notfound]. I should double-check that no guideline supports rasburicase for non-malignant hyperuricemia; indeed, there are none, reinforcing expectant management now [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the nephrology suggestion reflects concern for uric acid nephropathy even without TLS? I should confirm that uric acid nephropathy risk is tied to high uric acid load from rapid cell lysis; in the absence of cytotoxic therapy and TLS, that risk is not present, so rasburicase would not mitigate a nonexistent pathophysiologic process in this case [^115E1AWS]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if a single fixed dose might still be reasonable as a precaution; however, that would be a misapplication of evidence from oncology settings to a non-malignant context, so I should correct that line of thinking and avoid off-label use here [^113yLEZr].

> Next, I should review practical steps if rasburicase were ever indicated in the future. If rasburicase is considered for a malignancy-associated TLS risk, I need to ensure G6PD testing is completed and negative, use a single fixed dose of 3–6 mg or weight-based 0.05–0.2 mg/kg, and handle uric acid samples on ice with prompt processing to avoid spuriously low results due to ex vivo degradation; repeat dosing is individualized based on response and ongoing risk [^116WCZLg] [^115E1AWS] [^114TeaVv]. Hold on, I should verify that these dosing and lab-handling details align with NCCN and FDA guidance; yes, they do, but again, they apply to oncology contexts, not to this patient's situation [^116WCZLg] [^114TeaVv].

> Final recommendation: Do not administer rasburicase. There is no oncologic indication, the patient has no TLS risk, G6PD status is unknown, and the potential harms outweigh any theoretical benefit in this non-malignant hyperuricemia scenario. Monitor uric acid and renal function with hydration, and reserve urate-lowering therapy for appropriate indications if hyperuricemia persists or becomes symptomatic [^113yLEZr] [^115E1AWS] [^114TeaVv].

---

Do not give rasburicase here. The patient has **no malignancy or chemotherapy** [^113yLEZr], so there is **no tumor lysis syndrome risk** [^115E1AWS] and no indication for rasburicase [^notfound]. Rasburicase is for **TLS-related hyperuricemia** [^115E1AWS] and is contraindicated without checking G6PD status [^114TeaVv] due to hemolysis risk [^114TeaVv]. The isolated uric acid of 10.2 mg/dL is not an emergency; monitor and hydrate, and avoid rasburicase unless TLS develops [^notfound].

---

## Indications for rasburicase

Rasburicase is indicated for **initial management of plasma uric acid** in pediatric and adult patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or solid tumors who are receiving anticancer therapy expected to cause tumor lysis and hyperuricemia [^113yLEZr]. It is **not indicated** for hyperuricemia without TLS risk [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BSH) provide clear recommendations on rasburicase use:

- **NCCN guidelines**: Rasburicase is recommended for patients at intermediate or high risk of TLS, particularly when renal dysfunction is present or when uric acid, potassium, or phosphate levels are elevated above the upper limit of normal [^115E1AWS]. For low-risk patients, allopurinol or febuxostat is recommended [^112wwHJq].

- **BSH guidelines**: Rasburicase is recommended for patients with established TLS or those at high risk of TLS, particularly when hyperuricemia is present or when rapid uric acid reduction is required [^113B7pmp].

In this case, the patient has **no malignancy or chemotherapy**, so there is **no TLS risk** and therefore **no indication for rasburicase** [^notfound].

---

## Risks and contraindications

Rasburicase carries significant risks, including:

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening [^114TeaVv].

- **Hemolysis**: Particularly in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which can lead to severe anemia and methemoglobinemia [^114TeaVv].

- **Methemoglobinemia**: A potentially serious condition requiring immediate medical intervention [^114TeaVv].

Given these risks, rasburicase should only be used when clearly indicated and after screening for G6PD deficiency [^114TeaVv].

---

## Alternative management of hyperuricemia

In patients without TLS risk, **management of isolated hyperuricemia** should focus on:

- **Hydration**: Adequate fluid intake to promote uric acid excretion.

- **Dietary modifications**: Limiting purine intake.

- **Allopurinol or febuxostat**: Xanthine oxidase inhibitors for chronic hyperuricemia management, particularly in patients with gout or chronic kidney disease.

In this case, given the absence of TLS risk, **conservative management with hydration and monitoring** is appropriate [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Rasburicase is **not indicated** for this patient because there is **no TLS risk** [^notfound]. The isolated hyperuricemia should be managed conservatively with hydration and monitoring. Rasburicase should be reserved for patients with malignancy-related hyperuricemia and TLS risk, after screening for G6PD deficiency [^114TeaVv].

If patients have significant bone marrow involvement or large amount of extramedullary disease, increased TLS risk should be a concern. For prophylaxis against TLS prior to CAR T cell therapy, allopurinol should be administered. In patients with established TLS after CAR T cell therapy, rasburicase should be considered, and testing for G6PD deficiency prior to administration of rasburicase can be considered in patients at high risk of TLS.

### Rasburicase: future directions in tumor lysis management [^115NVEXt]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Acute tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an oncologic emergency resulting in several metabolic derangements. Hyperuricemia and its associated complications are the most frequent manifestations of TLS. Crucial to the management is the prompt initiation of a hypouricemic agent such as rasburicase. An established dose of 0.2 mg/kg of rasburicase is effective at decreasing uric acid levels significantly in 4 h of administration and to undetectable levels in 48 h of initiation. The mean uric acid AUC is significantly lower for patients treated with rasburicase when compared to those receiving allopurinol. Rasburicase has demonstrated excellent tolerability and is potentially cost-effective in patients at high risk for TLS. Rasburicase is a safe and effective hypouricemic agent for both adults and children at high risk for TLS and for this reason should be considered the uricolytic agent of choice in these patients.

### Recombinant urate oxidase (rasburicase) in the prevention and treatment of malignancy-associated hyperuricemia in pediatric and adult patients: results of a compassionate-use trial [^11159L9L]. Leukemia (2001). Low credibility.

To confirm the efficacy of recombinant urate oxidase (rasburicase) and to establish its safety profile, we reviewed the data on 173 children and 72 adults with malignancy who were treated with this new uricolytic agent in a compassionate-use trial. Rasburicase (0.20 mg/kg) was administered intravenously daily for 1 to 7 days and could be given every 12 h for the initial 72 h. Subsequent courses were allowed at a later date. Rasburicase produced a dramatic decrease in uric acid concentrations in all patients whether they received it for prophylaxis (n = 79) or treatment (n = 166) (P < 0.001 in all comparisons between the levels at diagnosis and those after treatment). The median post-treatment levels were 0.5 to 0.7 mg/dl. Repeated administrations were also effective in all 11 evaluable patients. Four children and five adults had mild adverse reactions that were drug related or of unknown etiology. In two of the children, the adverse events occurred during the second course. Rasburicase is highly effective and safe in the prophylaxis or treatment of malignancy- or chemotherapy-associated hyperuricemia in children and adults.

### Tumor lysis syndrome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia with novel targeted agents [^117FPC4p]. The Oncologist (2017). Low credibility.

The NCCN recommends rasburicase for patients with any high‐risk feature (e.g. bulky disease requiring immediate therapy) in whom adequate hydration is not possible or allopurinol is ineffective, or in patients with acute renal failure [4]. Although the schedule of rasburicase was initially recommended as 0.2 mg/kg daily for up to 5 days, subsequent data support a single dose of 0.15–0.2 mg/kg, with a second dose the next day if the uric acid level is not back to within normal range [20]. A single fixed dose of 6 mg rasburicase administered intravenously is also common for lowering uric acid in the management of TLS [21], [22]. Although rasburicase is effective in correcting hyperuricemia, there are no randomized controlled trials showing that it prevents renal failure or death [23], [24]. Patients who are considered candidates for rasburicase, especially those of African or Mediterranean descent, should first be tested for glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency because those with a deficiency of the enzyme are at risk for hemolysis and methemoglobinemia.

Alkalinization of the urine is no longer recommended as a management strategy because it may be associated with metabolic acidosis and calcium phosphate precipitation [1], [25]. To avoid the risk of nephropathy due to calcium phosphate deposition, treatment of asymptomatic hypocalcemia is generally not recommended. Dialysis should be considered for patients with acute kidney injury who have life‐threatening electrolyte disturbances [1].

### Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia… [^112hqV9V]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor A recent JAMA Insights article reviewed indications for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis in immunocompromised adults. 1 The authors commented that patients receiving corticosteroids at doses equivalent to at least 20 mg/d of prednisone for at least 4 weeks who have an additional cause of immunosuppression. should receive Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis. 1 They also noted there is no consensus for when to initiate PCP prophylaxis among patients with autoimmune disease. 1 Unfortunately, without consensus and with no clear definition of "additional cause of immunosuppression, " confusion may arise regarding the appropriateness of PCP prophylaxis in individual cases.

To help decide whether PCP prophylaxis for patients with autoimmune disease is indicated, clinicians can consider the number needed to treat to prevent 1 episode of PCP balanced against the number needed to harm. In a systematic review of patients with malignancies, a PCP risk greater than or equal to 6. 2% determined the threshold for prophylaxis, 2 likely exceeding the PCP risk among patients with certain autoimmune disorders. 3 Among patients with cancer, the NNT was 19 to prevent 1 case of PCP. 2 In a study of patients with rheumatic disease receiving greater than 30 mg/d of prednisone for more than 4 weeks, PCP risk was higher for certain diseases, including microscopic polyangiitis and dermatomyositis., and for initial prednisone doses of greater than 60 mg/d. 4 The NNT for patients receiving a prednisone dose greater than 60 mg/d was 32, whereas the NNT was 215 among patients receiving more than 30 mg/d of prednisone, which is higher than the NNH of 131.
4. In another study of patients with rheumatologic illnesses receiving lower doses of corticosteroids, the NNT for patients receiving greater than or equal to 15 mg/d and less than 30 mg/d of prednisone or the equivalent was 204, exceeding the NNH of
45. 5 However, the NNT fell to 31 for a "high-risk" subgroup, defined as patients with baseline lymphopenia or receiving pulse-dose steroids. 5 It is unknown whether these calculations can be extended to other autoimmune diseases or to patients receiving corticosteroids in combination with newer, targeted biologic therapies, which may be less immunosuppressive.

Although steroids are an established risk factor for PCP, there is heterogeneity in the risk conferred by the underlying disease, concomitant immunosuppressive therapies, and patient comorbidities. When available, the NNT and NNH can inform decision-making regarding PCP prophylaxis. When unavailable, careful consideration of the abovementioned factors, in addition to corticosteroid dose and duration, may enable clinicians to balance the risk and benefit of administering PCP prophylaxis.

### A family physician's guide to monitoring methotrexate… [^115fTcCW]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

2 Currently, methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. However, the drug has also been found efficacious in the treatment of other diseases, including asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn's disease, myositis, vasculitis and ectopic pregnancy. 3–5 Many physicians use methotrexate for its steroid-sparing properties in patients with asthma and others who may have side effects related to corticosteroid use. 6 The key to the success of methotrexate in treating any of these diseases is the recognition that low-dose therapy achieves efficacy while minimizing side effects. It is not uncommon for a family physician to monitor the efficacy and safety of methotrexate therapy in a patient receiving concurrent care from the subspecialist who prescribed the drug.

Minor and Major Toxic Effects Methotrexate is a toxic medication, but if it is dosed correctly and monitored appropriately, its toxic effects can be minimized. 7 These effects are categorized as minor or major. Rheumatoid nodules may also increase in size during methotrexate therapy, despite good control of the disease process. 10 Major toxic effects of methotrexate, such as hepatic, renal, pulmonary and bone marrow disorders, occur less frequently than the minor effects but may be life threatening. 7 Patients should be warned of the possible development of malignant hematologic diseases such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma during therapy. The methotrexate package insert cites cases in which malignant lymphoma regressed after withdrawal of methotrexate without the need for antilymphoma treatment.

Appropriate risk assessment is required to ensure selection of the proper candidate for methotrexate therapy. HEPATOTOXICITY Although not appreciably metabolized, methotrexate concentrates in the liver. Abnormal liver histology appears to be more common in patients with psoriasis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. 7 Patients may experience a range of liver problems from mild fatty infiltrate to moderate or severe fibrosis, necrosis and cirrhosis. 8 Hepatotoxic effects are associated with long-term use and high doses of methotrexate and are common in patients taking a daily dose, which is never advisable.
7. Monitoring of serum aspartate aminotransferase and serum albumin levels is recommended for all patients receiving methotrexate. 8 These laboratory assessments were correlated with serious liver disorders in a mail survey of rheumatologists. 11 Approximately 30 percent of all patients on long-term therapy have AST elevation.

Values exceeding two times the normal level for a period of one month warrant discontinuation of therapy.
7. Because liver function tests do not always predict hepatotoxic effects from methotrexate use, a liver biopsy may be indicated under the following circumstances in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: persistent elevation in liver enzymes; abnormal results in five of nine determinations of AST levels within a 12-month period; and a decrease in serum albumin values below the normal range. A premethotrexate liver biopsy is indicated for patients who have a history of excessive alcohol intake, elevated AST values or chronic hepatitis B or C. 7, 12 Other factors that may increase the risk of hepatotoxic effects are included in Table 1. 7, 8, 13 The dermatology literature recommends performing a liver biopsy in the first four months of therapy in patients with significant risk factors. 13.

### Rasburicase (Elitek) [^116yr6gt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Study 3

Study 3 was a multi-institutional, single-arm study conducted in 130 pediatric patients and 1 adult patient with hematologic malignancies. Patients received Elitek at either a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day (n = 12) or 0.2 mg/kg/day (n = 119). The primary efficacy objective was determination of the proportion of patients with maintained plasma uric acid concentration at 48 hours as defined for Study 2 above.

The study population demographics were: age < 13 years (76%), Caucasian (83%), males (67%), ECOG = 0 (67%), and leukemia (88%).

The proportion of patients with maintenance of uric acid concentration at 48 hours in Study 3 was 92% in the 0.15 mg/kg group (n = 12) and 95% in the 0.2 mg/kg group (n = 119).

Pooled Analyses of Studies 1, 2, and 3

Data from the 3 studies (n = 265) were pooled and analyzed according to the plasma uric acid levels over time. The pretreatment plasma uric acid concentration was ≥ 8 mg/dL in 61 patients and was < 8 mg/dL in 200 patients. The median uric acid concentration at baseline, at 4 hours following the first dose of Elitek, and the per-patient fall in plasma uric acid concentration from baseline to 4 hours, were calculated in those patients with both pretreatment and 4-hour post-treatment values. Among patients with pretreatment uric acid ≥ 8 mg/dL (baseline median 10.6 mg/dL [range 8.1–36.4]), the median per-patient change in plasma uric acid concentration by 4 hours after the first dose was a decrease of 9.1 mg/dL (0.3–19.3 mg/dL). Among the patients with a pretreatment plasma uric acid level < 8 mg/dL (baseline median 4.6 mg/dL [range 0.2–7.9 mg/dL]), the median per-patient change in plasma uric acid concentration by 4 hours after the first dose was a decrease of 4.1 mg/dL (0.1–7.6 mg/dL).

### NCCN guidelines® insights: B-cell lymphomas 3.2025 [^116WCZLg]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Supportive care — tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) management centers on hydration and hyperuricemia control; allopurinol, febuxostat, and rasburicase are highly effective for the management of hyperuricemia, and data suggest that a single fixed dose of rasburicase (6 mg or 3 mg) or a single weight-based dose of rasburicase (0.05–0.15 mg/kg) are effective in adult patients with hyperuricemia or high-risk factors for TLS.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: B-cell lymphomas 3.2025 [^112rhdt2]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

B-cell lymphomas — TLS management emphasizes that TLS is best managed if anticipated and treatment is started prior to chemotherapy, with a centerpiece of treatment including rigorous hydration, management of hyperuricemia, and frequent monitoring of electrolytes and aggressive correction (essential); additionally, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) testing is required prior to use of rasburicase, rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with a history consistent with G6PD, and in these patients rasburicase should be substituted with allopurinol.

### Fixed-dose rasburicase 6 mg for hyperuricemia and tumor lysis syndrome in high-risk cancer patients [^116mNKdq]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Rasburicase is indicated for the initial management of plasma uric acid levels in adults receiving anticancer therapy who are at risk for acute tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and subsequent hyperuricemia. The labeled dose is 0.2 mg/kg/day administered intravenously over 30 minutes for up to 5 days. Our institutional adult guidelines recommend rasburicase 6 mg for uric acid levels > 8 mg/dL in most adults with TLS, or 4–8 mg/dL in high-risk patients. Repeat dosing is indicated for uric acid levels > 4 mg/dL determined ≥ 12 hours following the initial dose.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of a single dose of rasburicase 6 mg per institutional adult TLS guidelines to decrease uric acid levels to < 4 mg/dL by day 3, as well as to determine the effect on serum creatinine and phosphorus concentrations. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the appropriateness of our institutional guidelines and identify TLS risk factors.

Methods

The study was approved by the University of Maryland Medical Center Institutional Review Board. A retrospective review of all adults between July 2008 and February 2009 who received at least one 6-mg dose of rasburicase, with redosing, if indicated, before day 3, was conducted. Subsequent TLS monitoring over 7 days after initial dosing was recorded. Patients were excluded if dosing did not adhere to institutional guidelines.

Results

We observed a decline in median uric acid levels from 9.2 mg/dL (interquartile range 8.1–10.4) on day 1 to between 1.8 (1.0–3.8) on day 3 and 3.8 mg/dL (2.1–4.4) on day 7 (p < 0.0001) with 2 patients requiring repeat dosing before day 3 (n = 34). The majority of the population was hyperuricemic (> 8 mg/dL; 76%) or at high risk for TLS (85%).

Conclusions

A 6-mg dose of rasburicase effectively decreased uric acid to < 4 mg/dL by day 3, rarely requiring repeat dosing, in a high-risk population.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: B-cell lymphomas 3.2025 [^117XvaWj]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Supportive care — safety with rasburicase for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) specifies that rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency due to an increased risk of methemoglobinemia or hemolysis; G6PD testing should be considered prior to the initiation of rasburicase, and rasburicase should be substituted with allopurinol if there is G6PD deficiency.

### A randomized trial of a single-dose rasburicase versus five-daily doses in patients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome [^115Fmqhq]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by hyperuricemia and metabolic derangements. The efficacy of rasburicase, administered daily for 5 days, has been well established. However, the optimal duration of therapy is unknown in adults.

Patients and Methods

We evaluated the efficacy of rasburicase (0.15 mg/kg) administered as single dose followed by as needed dosing (maximum five doses) versus daily dosing for 5 days in adult patients at risk for TLS.

Results

Eighty of the 82 patients enrolled received rasburicase; 40 high risk [median uric acid (UA) 8.5 mg/dl; range, 1.5–19.7] and 40 potential risk (UA = 5.6 mg/dl; range, 2.4–7.4). Seventy-nine patients (99%) experienced normalization in their UA within 4 h after the first dose; 84% to an undetectable level (< 0.7 mg/dl). Thirty-nine of 40 (98%) patients in the daily-dose arm and 34 of 40 (85%) patients in single-dose arm showed sustained UA response. Six high-risk patients within the single-dose arm required second dose for UA > 7.5 mg/dl. Rasburicase was well tolerated; one patient with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency developed methemoglobinemia and hemolysis.

Conclusions

Rasburicase is highly effective for prevention and management of hyperuricemia in adults at risk for TLS. Single-dose rasburicase was effective in most patients; only a subset of high-risk patients required a second dose.

### Rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia and haemolytic anaemia in a patient with G6PD deficiency [^114BBEvc]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme indicated in patients at a high risk of tumour lysis syndrome. Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, given the risk of precipitating oxidative stress, haemolytic anaemia, as well as methemoglobinemia. We present a case of a man in his 40s without risk factors for G6PD deficiency, who after rasburicase administration developed severe haemolytic anaemia and hypoxia. Although studies validating the use of rasburicase were at a dosage of 0.2mg/kg up to 5days, there are new studies suggesting a lower dose such as 3mg be just as efficacious in normalising uric acid. There is no evidence to date suggesting higher risk of haemolytic anaemia with increased dosage of rasburicase, but this case highlights the need to assess on a broader level whether 3mg as a one-time dose should be the new standard of care or whether lower dosages are safer for patients.

### Rasburicase in tumor lysis syndrome of the adult: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112GKM8h]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The use of rasburicase has been evaluated extensively in children, but not in adults. We review the current literature to evaluate its effect on adults.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting & Population

Adults receiving rasburicase for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS).

Selection Criteria For Studies

Electronic databases, regulatory documents, and websites were searched up to August 7, 2012. Reference lists of published articles were examined for additional relevant references. Any controlled trial or observational studies (controlled before and after) were included. Studies considering children only or mixing data for children and adults were excluded.

Intervention

Rasburicase for TLS.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was TLS development. Secondary outcomes included percentage of patients improving, total adverse events, acute kidney failure, deaths, and serum uric acid and creatinine levels.

Results

21 studies (24 publications) reported data for 1,261 adult patients, 768 receiving rasburicase for either the treatment or prophylaxis of TLS; these comprised 4 controlled trials and 17 observational studies. No statistically significant differences in clinical TLS development were observed in the controlled trials between the rasburicase and control groups. For the observational studies, 7.4% of patients developed clinical TLS after rasburicase (95% CI, 1.7%-16.7%), 93.4% of patients achieved normalized serum uric acid levels after rasburicase treatment (95% CI, 91.7%-94.6%), 4.4% developed acute kidney injury (95% CI, 3.0%-6.0%), and 2.6% died (95% CI, 0.95%-5.0%). The mean reduction in serum uric acid levels ranged from 5.3–12.8 mg/dL, and for serum creatinine levels, from 0.10–2.1 mg/dL.

Limitations

Controlled trials differed in outcomes reported; meta-analysis was not performed.

Conclusions

Rasburicase is effective in reducing serum uric acid levels in adults with TLS but at a significant cost, and evidence currently is lacking in adults to report whether rasburicase use improves clinical outcomes compared with other alternatives. Until new evidence is available, use of rasburicase may be limited to adult patients with a high risk of TLS.

### Rasburicase vs. allopurinol: mortality in hematological malignancies post anti-hyperuricemic therapy-real-world study [^117QkGJ1]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Study results indicate (1) rasburicase when compared with allopurinol significantly reduces TLS-associated mortality, and (2) PS matching successfully corrects before and after overall covariate and individual baseline covariate imbalances in comparing mortality. It is well known that rasburicase and allopurinol control uric acid levels via distinctly different mechanisms; rasburicase enzymatically converts existing uric acid to allantoin while allopurinol works via inhibiting the production of uric acid. Future studies will be required to determine the exact mechanisms responsible for these observations. Unless contraindicated, rasburicase is the Tx of choice in patients with hematological malignancies with TLS or at high risk of developing TLS.

### Reduced-dose rasburicase (recombinant xanthine oxidase) in adult cancer patients with hyperuricemia [^115c4qP3]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Recombinant urate oxidase (rasburicase) lowers uric acid levels rapidly to very low levels at the labeled dose of 0.15–0.2 mg/kg daily for 5 days. Our past experience showed that a lower dose (3 mg) lowered uric acid levels sufficiently in most patients. A retrospective review was conducted to determine the effect of a fixed 3 mg dose of rasburicase in 43 adult patients with cancer undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or receiving chemotherapy who had elevated or rising uric acid levels (6.4–16.8 mg/dl; median 9.6). Six patients received a second dose of rasburicase (3 mg in four patients and 1.5 mg in two patients) 24 h later. Patients received allopurinol, adequate hydration, as well as other supportive therapy as required. Uric acid levels declined by 6–95% (median 43%) within the first 24 h after rasburicase administration, and levels at 48 h were 9–91% (median 65%) lower than the baseline levels. Serum creatinine changed by ≤ 10% in 21 patients, increased by > 10% in four patients and decreased by > 10% in 18 patients. No significant renal dysfunction developed in any of the patients. We conclude that rasburicase is effective in lowering uric acid levels at a fixed dose of 3 mg, which is much lower than the recommended dose.

### A phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose rasburicase (1.5mg) in adolescent and adult acute leukemia and high-grade lymphomas with tumor lysis syndrome [^115eaxqN]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2023). Medium credibility.

The FDA recommended dose of rasburicase 0.2mg/kg/day till the resolution of TLS or up to 5days, might be in excess and is prohibitively expensive. The quality of evidence supporting low dose rasburicase is limited. The objective is to study the plasma uric acid response rate. This is a single center, non-randomised phase II study. Duration is 10 June 2017 till 30 July 2019. Study setting is at Adult Hematolymphoid Unit, Tata Memorial Center. Participants are patients with acute leukemia and high-grade lymphomas aged ≥ 18years, with ECOG PS of 0–3, with either laboratory or clinical TLS. Rasburicase was administered at fixed-dose of 1.5mg. The subsequent doses (1.5mg each dose) were administered only if plasma UA levels did not decline by > 50% on day 2, at the physician's discretion. We demonstrate that a low-dose rasburicase strategy leads to rapid and sustained reductions of uric acid in about 52% patients.

### Rasburicase for the treatment and prevention of hyperuricemia [^115PnEqx]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the information currently available on rasburicase for treatment and prevention of hyperuricemia.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966-August 2002) was searched for primary and review articles.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

Studies evaluating rasburicase, including abstracts and proceedings, were considered for inclusion. English-language literature was evaluated for the pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, therapeutic use, and adverse effects of rasburicase.

Data Synthesis

Rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase, has been shown to be effective in lowering uric acid and preventing uric acid accumulation in patients with hematologic malignancies who had hyperuricemia or who were at high risk for developing hyperuricemia. It has been approved for pediatric use in the US.

Conclusions

In addition to allopurinol, hydration, and urinary alkalinization, rasburicase is a new alternative for the treatment and prevention of hyperuricemia in patients with hematologic malignancies. Its rapid onset of action and the ability to lower preexisting elevated uric acid levels are the advantages of rasburicase compared with allopurinol. It may allow the patient to receive chemotherapy treatment without delay.

### Effectiveness of a single 3-mg rasburicase dose for the management of hyperuricemia in patients with hematological malignancies [^114Pwtdz]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Rasburicase was administered at a fixed dose of 3mg to treat 287 episodes of elevated serum uric acid levels (> 7mg/dL) in 247 adult patients with hematological malignancies. The median total dose of 36μg/kg (range: 18–65) was a fraction of the recommended total pediatric dose of 0.75–1.0mg/kg. The median change in uric acid levels at 24h was -4.1mg/dL (range: -12 to +1) and -45% (range: -95 to +9). Uric acid levels normalized at 24h in 72% of patients. There was no relationship between the weight-based dose and uric acid decline. The only predictor of success was the baseline uric acid; the failure rate was 84% with baseline level > 12mg/dL and 18% if it was ≤ 12. Uric acid levels continued to decline beyond 24h in most patients without additional treatment. Serum creatinine remained stable over 24h, and declined over 48h and 7 days. There was no relationship between the extent of reduction in uric acid levels and serum creatinine. We conclude that a single 3-mg dose of rasburicase, used with close monitoring, is sufficient to treat most adults with uric acid levels up to 12mg/dL.

### Rasburicase (Elitek) [^117EZoD9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1	Pediatrics

Elitek was administered in three studies to 265 patients with acute leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. These clinical studies were largely limited to pediatric patients (246 of 265). Elitek was administered as a 30-minute infusion once (n = 251) or twice (n = 14) daily at a dose of 0.15 or 0.2 mg/kg/dose (total daily dose 0.2–0.4 mg/kg/day). Elitek was administered prior to and concurrent with antitumor therapy, which consisted of either systemic chemotherapy (n = 196) or steroids (n = 69).

Study 1

Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled study conducted at six institutions, in which 52 pediatric patients were randomized to receive either Elitek (n = 27) or allopurinol (n = 25). The dose of allopurinol varied according to local institutional practice. Elitek was administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes once (n = 26) or twice (n = 1) daily at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/dose (total daily dose 0.2–0.4 mg/kg/day). Initiation of dosing was permitted at any time between 4 to 48 hours before the start of antitumor therapy and could be continued for 5 to 7 days after initiation of antitumor therapy. Patients were stratified at randomization on the basis of underlying malignant disease (leukemia or lymphoma) and baseline serum or plasma uric acid levels (< 8 mg/dL and ≥ 8 mg/dL). The primary study objective was to demonstrate a greater reduction in uric acid concentration over 96 hours (AUC0–96 hr) in the Elitek group as compared to the allopurinol group. Uric acid AUC0–96 hrwas defined as the area under the curve for plasma uric acid levels (mg hr/dL), measured from the last value prior to the first dose of Elitek until 96 hours after that first dose. Plasma uric acid levels were used for all uric acid AUC0–96 hrcalculations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

14.2	Studies in Adults

A total of 342 adults with either leukemia, lymphoma, or other hematologic malignancy received Elitek in five studies (one randomized study, Study 4, and four uncontrolled studies). Across the five studies, Elitek was administered at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day (n = 38) or 0.2 mg/kg/day (n = 304).

Study 4 was a randomized (1:1:1), multi-center, open-label study conducted in patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumor malignancies at risk for hyperuricemia and TLS. A total of 275 adult patients received at least one dose of study drug. The median age was 56 years, 62% were males, 80% were Caucasian, 66% had leukemia, 29% had lymphoma; 18% were hyperuricemic (uric acid > 7.5 mg/dL) at study entry. Patients in Arm A received Elitek for 5 days (n = 92). Patients in Arm B received Elitek from day 1 through day 3 followed by oral allopurinol from day 3 through day 5 (overlap on day 3: Elitek and allopurinol administered approximately 12 hours apart) (n = 92). Patients in Arm C received oral allopurinol for 5 days (n = 91). Elitek was administered at the dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day as a 30-minute infusion once daily. Allopurinol was administered orally at the dose of 300 mg once a day. Patients were eligible for the study if they were either at high risk or potential risk for TLS. The major endpoint of this study was the uric acid response rate defined as the proportion of patients with plasma uric acid levels ≤ 7.5 mg/dL from day 3 to day 7, after initiation of antihyperuricemic treatment.

### Impact of early rasburicase on incidence of clinical tumor lysis syndrome in lymphoma [^114knw3g]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2019). Medium credibility.

Early administration of rasburicase to enhance uric acid (UA) elimination has been adopted without robust evidence in support of its impact on clinical outcomes in tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), specifically, the prevention of acute kidney injury (AKI). This was a retrospective cohort study of adult lymphoma patients at intermediate or high risk for TLS. Excluded patients had AKI or were on dialysis at hospital admission. The incidence of new AKI in the setting of TLS was described along with predictors of its development, including early rasburicase use. In 383 included patients, the incidence of new-onset AKI during hospitalization was 6%. Predictors included age, history of renal or cardiovascular disease, and UA > 8mg/dL. Rasburicase use did not significantly impact the risk of developing AKI (HR 2.3; p = .11). The UA level at the time of administration did not modify the effect of rasburicase on prevention of AKI (p = .36 for the interaction term).

### Efficacy and safety of rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase (elitek), in the management of malignancy-associated hyperuricemia in pediatric and adult patients: final results of a multicenter compassionate use trial [^113dwoXR]. Leukemia (2005). Low credibility.

The recombinant urate oxidase, rasburicase (Elitek, Sanofi-Synthelabo, Inc.), has recently received regulatory approval for the prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia in children with leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumors. Prior to approval, 682 children and 387 adults in the US and Canada received rasburicase on compassionate-use basis. Uric acid concentration declined rapidly in both adult and pediatric patients after rasburicase treatment. Similar responses were observed in patients treated with subsequent courses. Possible drug-related adverse events, including allergic reactions, were uncommon. These data confirm that rasburicase is effective and safe for the treatment and prophylaxis of children and adults with malignancy-associated hyperuricemia.

### Plasma uric acid response to rasburicase: early marker for acute kidney injury in tumor lysis syndrome? [^115DZzGL]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2014). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality in tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). The goal of this study was to assess a practical approach involving a simple risk-prediction model for AKI in patients at high risk for clinical TLS treated according to standardized guidelines. We collected data on 62 patients at high risk for clinical TLS. We evaluated whether the magnitude of the plasma uric acid decrease in response to rasburicase predicted AKI. According to RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, sustained Loss, End-stage kidney disease), 41 (66.1%) patients had AKI. AKI was associated with higher hospital (26.8% vs. 0%, p = 0.01) and 6-month (41.4% vs. 9.5%, p = 0.04) mortality. The plasma uric acid decrease after rasburicase was significantly larger in patients who did not develop AKI than in those who did (95% vs. 84%; p < 0.01). By multivariate analysis, independent determinants of AKI were hypertension and a plasma uric acid decrease smaller than 92.9% 6 h after rasburicase.

### Acute kidney injury in critically ill cancer patients: an update [^112hFAL3]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that does not have the hypersensitivity profile of allopurinol and does not require dosing adjustments for reduced GFR. Like allopurinol, febuxostat is not expected to decrease the accumulation of xanthine or the risk for xanthine stone formation. Febuxostat may be a reasonable, albeit expensive, alternative to allopurinol in the prophylaxis of TLS in patients with decreased estimated GFR.

Rasburicase is a recombinant form of Aspergillus -derived urate oxidase and catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin, which is 5–10 times more soluble than uric acid and is readily excreted. Rasburicase was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for children in 2002 and adults in 2009. The US FDA-recommended dosing guideline for rasburicase in pediatric patients is 0.15 mg/kg or 0.2 mg/kg administered once daily for a maximum of 5 days. Treatment beyond 5 days or for more than one course of therapy is not recommended. The first dose of rasburicase should be administered 4–24 hours before starting chemotherapy. Rasburicase is given as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes and should not be given as a bolus infusion. Currently, in the adult population, the dose often utilized in practice is 0.2 mg/kg. Rasburicase is now a standard of care for patients at high risk of TLS despite continuing debate on whether its profound and rapid lowering of plasma uric acid levels translates into hard patient outcomes (e.g. AKI with a need for RRT or mortality). Two recent meta-analyses concluded that the mortality and cost-effectiveness benefits of this expensive drug remain to be proven. Several studies have reported higher rates of serious adverse reactions (pulmonary hemorrhage, respiratory failure, supraventricular arrhythmias, ischemic coronary artery disorders, and abdominal and gastrointestinal infections) with rasburicase compared with allopurinol.

2.4		Recommended Premedication and Prophylactic Medications

Infusion-Related Reactions

Premedication to reduce the risk of IRRs is outlined in Table 4 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Hypotension may occur during GAZYVA intravenous infusions. Consider withholding antihypertensive treatments for 12 hours prior to and throughout each GAZYVA infusion and for the first hour after administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Tumor Lysis Syndrome Prophylaxis

Patients with high tumor burden, high circulating absolute lymphocyte counts (greater than 25 × 109/L) or renal impairment are considered at risk of tumor lysis syndrome and should receive prophylaxis. Premedicate with anti-hyperuricemics (e.g., allopurinol or rasburicase) and ensure adequate hydration prior to start of GAZYVA therapy. Continue prophylaxis prior to each subsequent GAZYVA infusion, as needed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Antimicrobial Prophylaxis

Patients with Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia lasting more than one week are strongly recommended to receive antimicrobial prophylaxis until resolution of neutropenia to Grade 1 or 2. Consider antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis for patients with severe and long lasting (> 1 week) neutropenia.

### Consensus conference on the management of tumor lysis syndrome [^1111B4fM]. Haematologica (2008). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome is a potentially life threatening complication of massive cellular lysis in cancers. Identification of high-risk patients and early recognition of the syndrome is crucial in the institution of appropriate treatments. Drugs that act on the metabolic pathway of uric acid to allantoin, like allopurinol or rasburicase, are effective for prophylaxis and treatment of tumor lysis syndrome. Sound recommendations should regulate diagnosis and drug application in the clinical setting. The current article reports the recommendations on the management of tumor lysis syndrome that were issued during a Consensus Conference project, and which were endorsed by the Italian Society of Hematology (SIE), the Italian Association of Pediatric Oncologists (AIEOP) and the Italian Society of Medical Oncology (AIOM). Current concepts on the pathophysiology, clinical features, and therapy of tumor lysis syndrome were evaluated by a Panel of 8 experts. A consensus was then developed for statements regarding key questions on tumor lysis syndrome management selected according to the criterion of relevance by group discussion. Hydration and rasburicase should be administered to adult cancer patients who are candidates for tumor-specific therapy and who carry a high risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Cancer patients with a low-risk of tumor lysis syndrome should instead receive hydration along with oral allopurinol. Hydration and rasburicase should also be administered to patients with clinical tumor lysis syndrome and to adults and high-risk children who develop laboratory tumor lysis syndrome. In conclusion, the Panel recommended rasburicase for tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis in selected patients based on the drug efficacy profile. Methodologically rigorous studies are needed to clarify its cost-effectiveness profile.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has recently been subclassified into either laboratory TLS or clinical TLS, and a grading system has been established. Standardized guidelines, however, are needed to aid in the stratification of patients according to risk and to establish prophylaxis and treatment recommendations for patients at risk or with established TLS.

Methods

A panel of experts in pediatric and adult hematologic malignancies and TLS was assembled to develop recommendations and guidelines for TLS based on clinical evidence and standards of care. A review of relevant literature was also used.

Results

New guidelines are presented regarding the prevention and management of patients at risk of developing TLS. The best management of TLS is prevention. Prevention strategies include hydration and prophylactic rasburicase in high-risk patients, hydration plus allopurinol or rasburicase for intermediate-risk patients, and close monitoring for low-risk patients. Primary management of established TLS involves similar recommendations, with the addition of aggressive hydration and diuresis, plus allopurinol or rasburicase for hyperuricemia. Alkalinization is not recommended. Although guidelines for rasburicase use in adults are provided, this agent is currently only approved for use in pediatric patients in the United States.

Conclusion

The potential severity of complications resulting from TLS requires measures for prevention in high-risk patients and prompts treatment in the event that symptoms arise. Recognition of risk factors, monitoring of at-risk patients, and appropriate interventions are the key to preventing or managing TLS. These guidelines should assist in the prevention of TLS and improve the management of patients with established TLS.

### Emergencies in haematology: tumour lysis syndrome [^111s8aMm]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is a significant complication of haematologic malignancies and their management. The syndrome consists of laboratory abnormalities either alone (laboratory TLS) or with clinical sequelae including renal failure, seizures, and arrhythmias (clinical TLS). Clinical TLS is a predictor for worse overall morbidity and mortality in cancer patients, but can be prevented. Thus, accurate prognostication is critical to appropriate management of patients at risk for TLS, and incorporates both disease factors (tumour type and burden) and patient factors (baseline renal insufficiency or hyperuricaemia). Strategies to prevent TLS include hydration and allopurinol in low- and intermediate-risk patients and rasburicase in high-risk patients.

### Management of hematological patients requiring emergency chemotherapy in the intensive care unit [^113JH3Bh]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Due to the risk of uratic nephropathy, the treatment includes a hypouricemic therapy, favoring rasburicase over allopurinol starting from the biological TLS stage. However, ruling out glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is essential beforehand to prevent rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia.

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) should be discussed early, in addition to the usual criteria, in the event of persistent hyperphosphatemia, although no threshold could be determined by consensus. In this context, the early consideration of hyperphosphatemia is part of an approach to prevent the onset or worsening of AKI. Clinical, ECG, and biological monitoring is essential before and during the initiation of anti-tumor treatment (cytoreduction or chemotherapy). The main biological abnormalities (serum potassium, phosphoremia, calcemia, uremia, creatinine, uric acid level, and eventually LDH) must be checked every 4–6 h during the acute phase.

### Use of single-dose rasburicase in an obese female [^1138C8Rs]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the use of single-dose rasburicase in an obese patient.

Case Summary

A 53-year-old obese African American woman weighing 136 kg (ideal body weight [IBW] 55 kg) with new-onset chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in leukocytic blast crisis was treated with hydroxyurea 5 g daily. In addition, she received allopurinol 300 mg daily for prevention of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). The following day, allopurinol was discontinued and rasburicase was administered at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg of IBW for a serum uric acid level of 11.9 mg/dL. The patient's serum uric acid level decreased to 1.9 mg/dL 48 hours after a single dose.

Discussion

Rasburicase is indicated for the initial management of elevated plasma uric acid levels in patients with hematologic and solid tumor malignancies who are at risk for TLS. This case is unique because the patient received one dose of rasburicase followed by allopurinol rather than 5 daily doses of rasburicase. Additionally, the dose was based on IBW rather than actual body weight. Efficacy of this approach is apparent from the uric acid levels and the lack of hemodialysis requirements.

Conclusions

A single dose of rasburicase (based on IBW) followed by allopurinol can effectively prevent TLS based on serum uric acid concentration. This approach resulted in a substantial cost savings.

### Fixed-dose rasburicase in overweight and obese patients versus normal-weight patients [^113iE2jD]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Fixed-dose rasburicase (FDR) is common practice in treating hyperuricemia associated with tumor lysis syndrome in adults; however, there is a lack of data regarding the effectiveness of this dosing strategy specifically in the overweight and obese patient populations.

Objective

To determine if patient weight per body mass index (BMI) category is associated with failure of initial FDR as defined by the need for additional dose(s) based on a uric acid level (UAL) ≥ 7.5 mg/dL within 10 days of previous rasburicase administration.

Method

Adults who received FDR per institutional guidelines from October 2008 to August 2013 were reviewed. Patients had either a baseline UAL ≥ 7.5 mg/dL or were considered high risk (leukemia or lymphoma diagnosis with white blood cell count > 50 000/mm³ or lactate dehydrogenase level greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal). Patients were stratified by BMI as underweight (< 18.5), normal (18.5–24.9), overweight (25–29.9), or obese (30+).

Result

Overall, 12 out of 151 patients who received FDR required a repeat dose of rasburicase. The percentage of patients requiring a repeat rasburicase dose was not different between obese/overweight versus normal/underweight patients (8.7% vs 6.4%, P = 0.75). Similarly, there was no difference between obese alone versus normal/underweight patients (12.3% vs 6.4%; P = 0.51).

Conclusion

In this retrospective analysis, patient BMI did not correlate with failure of FDR in adults, suggesting that this dosing strategy is efficacious in the adult population.

Acute tumor lysis syndrome management in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia states that patients with ALL may be at high risk, particularly with highly elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts before induction; standard prophylaxis includes hyperhydration with crystalloid IV fluids that do not contain potassium, with a loop diuretic (eg, furosemide) to promote diuresis if urine output remains low after optimal hydration, and urine alkalinization is not recommended; in high-risk TLS, low-intensity initial therapy (corticosteroid monotherapy for 3–7 days) may be used; allopurinol should be started prior to chemotherapy for patients with low WBC counts (eg, < 100 × 10⁹/L) and LDH < 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN), and low tumor burden, whereas rasburicase is indicated prophylactically for patients with high WBC counts (eg, > 100 × 10⁹/L), LDH > 2 x ULN, high tumor burden, or those with renal dysfunction, elevated uric acid (eg, > 8 mg/dL), or inability to tolerate hydration.

### Rasburicase (Elitek) [^117A329j]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 2 presents the response rates in the three treatment arms. The response rate in arm A was significantly greater than in arm C (p = 0.0009). The response rate was higher for arm B compared to arm C; this difference was not statistically significant.

There were no patients with documented failure to control uric acid in arms A or B. In arm C, 34% of patients did not have a uric acid response; 11% due to failure to control uric acid and 4.4% due to the need for extended antihyperuricemic treatment.

Box and whisker plots of uric acid over time for the patient population (Figure 2) show that in the two arms containing Elitek, uric acid levels were ≤ 2 mg/dL in 96% of patients at 4 hours of the day 1 dose.

Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)

Clinical TLS was defined by changes in at least two or more laboratory parameters for hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia and at least one of the following events occurring within 7 days of treatment: renal failure/injury, need for renal dialysis, and/or serum creatinine increase > 1.5 ULN, arrhythmia or seizure. Clinical TLS occurred in 3% of Elitek-treated patients, 3% of Elitek/allopurinol-treated patients, and 4% of allopurinol-treated patients.

### Tumor lysis syndrome [^114SAimQ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an oncologic emergency that occurs due to the massive lysis of tumor cells resulting in hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Patients are at significant risk for acute kidney injury, arrhythmia, seizures, and sudden death as sequelae of this condition. Management is dependent on severity but often includes acute stabilization, aggressive hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and uric acid-lowering medications, such as rasburicase and allopurinol. TLS carries high morbidity and mortality risk making prevention through intravenous hydration and prophylactic medications the best management strategy.

### Real-world outcomes and management strategies for venetoclax-treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients in the United States [^114t5ubo]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

TLS has been suggested as the most critical toxicity with venetoclax, contributing to early treatment-related deaths in clinical trials, particularly before the current dose ramp-up schedule was implemented in trials to minimize TLS risk. In our study, TLS rates were higher than those reported in most recent trials. In this cohort, 18 patients (13.4%) had TLS; 12 (9.0%) cases were laboratory TLS events and 6 (4.5%) cases were clinical events. In the initial phase I venetoclax study, 18% of patients experienced TLS (12.5% laboratory, 5.6% clinical). However, once the dosing schedule was modified to minimize TLS risk, 1.7% of patients had laboratory TLS and none had clinical TLS. More recently reported clinical trials using the standard dose rampup protocol have shown laboratory TLS rates of 2.2%and 4.7%and clinical TLS rates of 0%. – Despite the higher rates of TLS observed in our study, only 19.4% of patients were deemed high risk for TLS versus 25–49% of patients classified as high risk in the clinical trials setting. –

Overall, adherence to TLS prophylaxis recommendations was excellent. The majority (92%) received allopurinol, which is recommended for all patients regardless of risk category. Guidelines per the US venetoclax prescribing information document also recommend oral hydration and intravenous normal saline for high risk patients, which was followed for all patients in our cohort. Similarly, rasburicase is recommended for patients with elevated baseline uric acid. This was used in over one-quarter of all cases and almost half of the high-risk cases. All high-risk patients had at least one planned hospitalization during dose escalation. Three of 25 high-risk patients forwent the second recommended hospitalization given lack of TLS development during the first hospitalization. Most low and intermediate-risk patients were hospitalized at least once, suggesting a conservative approach was utilized in this series during the dose rampup as outpatient dosing, with close monitoring. As per United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label guidelines, low and intermediate-risk patients can also be managed in the outpatient setting without hospitalization and we suspect future real-world series will demonstrate a higher proportion of low and intermediate-risk patients managed in the clinic during the dose rampup period.

### Comparison of fixed versus traditional weight-based dosing of rasburicase in a pediatric population [^116R7BNs]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recommend rasburicase for the treatment of pediatric patients with hyperuricemia at risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) using a weight-based dose of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg once daily for 1–7 days. However, there has been a trend in practice due to recent data showing benefit using a fixed-dose approach. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety between fixed and weight-based dosing of rasburicase in a pediatric population.

Procedure

This was a retrospective chart review of 48 patients from January 1, 2007 to August 31, 2016 at Children's National Health System. Patients less than 18 years old with a documented diagnosis of a malignancy and baseline uric acid level were included; patients less than 30 kg at the time of rasburicase administration were excluded.

Results

The primary endpoint of this study was the treatment success of normalization of uric acid level (< 5 mg/dl) within 24 hr of rasburicase administration. Eighty-three percent of patients had success with normalization of uric acid post rasburicase dose. Eighty-five percent of patients had success in the weight-based group compared to eighty-one percent in the fixed-dose group (P = 0.715). Mean percent reduction of uric acid at 24 hr was relatively similar between both groups (94% vs. 89%).

Conclusion

Our results suggest that a fixed-dose strategy of rasburicase is both safe and effective in reducing uric acid levels in the pediatric patient population. A fixed dose of rasburicase 6 mg is a cost-effective treatment option for TLS.

To determine the probability of study selection for each patient for whom a physician provided information, the national patient incidence data were used for each tumor type from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute. A total of 266 of these 323 physicians participated by providing requested data; the study participation rate was 82.4%.

To randomize patient selection for the 2021 chart audit study, each participating physician was instructed to select up to the last four study-qualified patients seen within the previous 12 months. The physicians provided anonymized data for 715 randomized patients with hematological malignancy treated in the previous year for HUA risk and TLS potential.

This report focuses on a subset of these data: patients who received anti-HUA monotherapy with either rasburicase or allopurinol, who did not experience pre-HUA Tx TLS nor spontaneous TLS, and who could be matched to an appropriate degree on potential confounders for which study data were available.

5	WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1	Hypersensitivity Reactions

Elitek can cause serious and fatal hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis. In clinical studies, anaphylaxis was reported in < 1% patients receiving Elitek. This can occur at any time during treatment including the first dose. Signs and symptoms of these reactions include bronchospasm, chest pain and tightness, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, shock, and urticaria. Immediately and permanently discontinue Elitek administration in any patient developing clinical evidence of a serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

The safety and efficacy of Elitek have been established only for a single course of treatment once daily for 5 days.

5.2	Hemolysis

Elitek is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency because hydrogen peroxide is one of the major by-products of the conversion of uric acid to allantoin. In clinical studies, hemolysis occurs in < 1% patients receiving Elitek; severe hemolytic reactions occurred within 2–4 days of the start of Elitek. Immediately and permanently discontinue Elitek administration in any patient developing hemolysis. Institute appropriate patient monitoring and support measures (e.g., transfusion support). Screen patients at higher risk for G6PD deficiency (e.g., patients of African or Mediterranean ancestry) prior to starting Elitek [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4)].

5.3	Methemoglobinemia

In clinical studies, methemoglobinemia occurred in < 1% patients receiving Elitek. These included cases of serious hypoxemia requiring intervention with medical support measures. It is not known whether patients with deficiency of cytochrome b5reductase (formerly known as methemoglobin reductase) or of other enzymes with antioxidant activity are at increased risk for methemoglobinemia or hemolytic anemia. Immediately and permanently discontinue Elitek administration in any patient identified as having developed methemoglobinemia. Institute appropriate monitoring and support measures (e.g., transfusion support, methylene-blue administration) [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4)].

5.4	Laboratory Test Interference

At room temperature, Elitek causes enzymatic degradation of the uric acid in blood/plasma/serum samples potentially resulting in spuriously low plasma uric acid assay readings. Special sample handling procedure must be followed to avoid ex vivo uric acid degradation [see Boxed Warning, Drug Interactions (7)].

### Recommendations for the evaluation of risk and prophylaxis of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) in adults and children with malignant diseases: an expert TLS panel consensus [^117QDkbR]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is a life-threatening oncological emergency characterized by metabolic abnormalities including hyperuricaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hyperkalaemia and hypocalcaemia. These metabolic complications predispose the cancer patient to clinical toxicities including renal insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, neurological complications and potentially sudden death. With the increased availability of newer therapeutic targeted agents, such as rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase), there are no published guidelines on the risk classification of TLS for individual patients at risk of developing this syndrome. We convened an international TLS expert consensus panel to develop guidelines for a medical decision tree to assign low, intermediate and high risk to patients with cancer at risk for TLS. Risk factors included biological evidence of laboratory TLS (LTLS), proliferation, bulk and stage of malignant tumour and renal impairment and/or involvement at the time of TLS diagnosis. An international TLS consensus expert panel of paediatric and adult oncologists, experts in TLS pathophysiology and experts in TLS prophylaxis and management, developed a final model of low, intermediate and high risk TLS classification and associated TLS prophylaxis recommendations.

### Rasburicase (Elitek) [^115V79xn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The demographics of the two study arms (Elitek vs allopurinol) were as follows: age < 13 years (82% vs 76%), males (59% vs 72%), Caucasian (59% vs 72%), ECOG performance status 0 (89% vs 84%), and leukemia (74% vs 76%). The median interval, in hours, between initiation of Elitek and of antitumor treatment was 20 hours, with a range of 70 hours before to 10 hours after the initiation of antitumor treatment (n = 24, data not reported for 3 patients).

The uric acid AUC0–96 hrwas significantly lower in the Elitek group (128 ± s.e. 14 mg hr/dL) as compared to the allopurinol group (328 ± s.e. 26 mg hr/dL). All but one patient in the Elitek arm had reduction and maintenance of uric acid levels to within or below the normal range during the treatment. The incidence of renal dysfunction was similar in the two study arms; one patient in the allopurinol arm developed acute renal failure.

Study 2

Study 2 was a multi-institutional, single-arm study conducted in 89 pediatric and 18 adult patients with hematologic malignancies. Patients received Elitek at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day. The primary efficacy objective was determination of the proportion of patients with maintained plasma uric acid concentration at 48 hours where maintenance of uric acid concentration was defined as: 1) achievement of uric acid concentration ≤ 6.5 mg/dL (patients < 13 years) or ≤ 7.5 mg/dL (patients ≥ 13 years) within a designated time point (48 hours) from initiation of Elitek and maintained until 24 hours after the last administration of study drug; and 2) control of uric acid level without the need for allopurinol or other agents.

The study population demographics were: age < 13 years (76%), males (61%), Caucasian (91%), ECOG performance status = 0 (92%), and leukemia (89%).

The proportion of patients with maintenance of uric acid concentration at 48 hours in Study 2 was 99% (106/107).

TLS

Laboratory TLS occurred in 10 patients (12.3%) including 3 (3.7%) with clinical TLS. Variables related to TLS for the overall cohort and for patients who developed TLS are shown in Table 6. For the overall cohort, most patients had low (61%) or intermediate (32%) risk for TLS, 53% were admitted at least once for TLS monitoring, and the majority received prophylactic allopurinol (90%) and/or IV fluids (67%). For patients who developed TLS, the median age was 66 years (range, 57–79), 3 had low risk and 5 had intermediate risk for TLS (missing data for 2 patients), 7 received venetoclax monotherapy and 3 received venetoclax in combination with other agents, and 7 were admitted for TLS monitoring at least once. The venetoclax dose at which the first TLS event occurred was 20 mg in 7 patients and 50 mg in 2 patients (missing data for 1 patient). In terms of TLS-related biochemical abnormalities (data available for all 10 patients with TLS), phosphate levels of ≥ 4.5 mg/dL occurred in 8 patients, uric acid ≥ 8 mg/dL in 4 patients, calcium ≤ 7 mg/dL in 4 patients, potassium ≥ 6 mmol/L in 3 patients, and creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL in 3 patients. Six patients required rasburicase. Six patients developed TLS and had data available for response assessment, of whom 3 responded (2 CR, 1 PR, 1 SD, and 2 PD).

### Pediatric aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1133gNN7]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas — tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is described as a potentially serious complication with risk factors including bulky disease at presentation, elevated LDH, oliguria, preexisting renal impairment, dehydration, and evidence of TLS prior to therapy; hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia are the primary electrolyte abnormalities, and hydration along with frequent monitoring and correction of electrolyte abnormalities is essential. Prophylaxis with allopurinol or rasburicase prior to initiation of systemic therapy is indicated for certain patients. Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency; G6PD testing should be considered prior to the initiation of rasburicase, and in patients with TLS at risk for end-organ injury and unknown G6PD status, the benefit of rasburicase may outweigh the risk.

### Recombinant urate oxidase (rasburicase) for the treatment of hyperuricemia in pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies: results of a compassionate prospective multicenter study in Korea [^112X28KT]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperuricemia accompanying tumor lysis syndrome is a serious complication in neoplasia with rapid proliferation and destruction. To confirm the efficacy of recombinant urate oxidase (rasburicase) and its safety profile, a phase IV compassionate use prospective study was performed in Korean pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies.

Procedure

Rasburicase was administered at 0.2 mg/kg/day once daily for 3–5 days (twice daily allowed during the first 72 hr) by intravenous route for hyperuricemia (uric acid > 7.5 mg/dl). The study period was 5 weeks and consisted of a baseline assessment within 48 hr before the administration of rasburicase, 3–5 days of assessment during treatment and a follow-up assessment at 4 weeks after its final administration.

Results

The uric acid endpoint (≤ 7.0 mg/dl) was reached in 97.3% (36/37) of the patients and uric acid levels were significantly reduced in all patients (P < 0.001). Drug related toxicities were mild and reversible without any grade 4 or serious adverse event associated with rasburicase.

Conclusion

This study confirms that rasburicase is a safe and effective agent for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with hematologic malignancies in pediatric patients.

Introduction

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is one of the common oncological emergencies encountered and is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs in adults and children. TLS may occur spontaneously with a heavy tumor burden or following initiation of cytotoxic therapy and rapid destruction of malignant cells with abrupt release of potassium, phosphorous, and nucleic acids that are metabolized into hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid (UA). Hyperkalemia can cause dysrhythmias; hyperphosphatemia can cause hypocalcemia, leading to tetany, dysrhythmia, and seizure, and precipitation of calcium phosphate in various organs. UA can induce acute kidney injury by intrarenal crystals and by crystal-independent mechanisms such as renal vasoconstriction.

The incidence of TLS appears to be increasing, and TLS mortality is understudied. Out of a large national inpatient database, Pathak et al. reviewed the National Inpatient Sample Database from 2009 to 2011 in patients ≥ 18 years of age with a diagnosis of TLS. Pathak et al. integrated the National Inpatient Sample Database from 2009 to 2011 and identified 997 inpatient admissions with the diagnosis of TLS and demonstrated an associated inpatient mortality rate of 14.4%. Moreover, a more recent paper (2019) has noted that the incidence of TLS is not well defined because of a historical lack of standardized diagnostic criteria and the variability of patient populations and treatment regimens. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are two examples of widely used targeted therapies that have been shown to induce TLS as single-agent therapies or in combination with conventional chemotherapies. Morbidity and mortality may be higher with newer therapies because of a lack of recognition, inadequate prophylaxis, and delayed treatment. The most widely used TLS diagnosis criteria were developed by Cairo and Bishop and account for the severity of illness from grade 0 (asymptomatic) to grade 5 (death). TLS risk evaluation and prophylaxis have been further addressed by the recommendations developed through an international panel of TLS experts convened by Cairo and others.

Tumor lysis syndrome

Tumor lysis syndrome is more likely with the first dose of cancer treatment and is a potentially life-threatening emergency that can occur either spontaneously or because of cell death from cancer treatments. Tumor lysis syndrome of any grade was reported in 3% of patients in the InO arm compared with 2% of patients receiving standard therapy in the INO-VATE study. Prompt detection and management of tumor lysis syndrome is important to prevent potentially fatal complications such as acute renal failure, arrhythmias, seizures, and death.

Recommendations

Patients receiving InO should be monitored for signs and symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome and treated accordingly (Table 4). Cytoreduction before the first InO dose is recommended in patients with > 10,000/mm³ circulating lymphoblasts. In patients who have baseline uric acid levels > 7.5 mg/dl and in patients at high risk of developing tumor lysis syndrome, administration of rasburicase should be considered. Additional preventative measures (e.g. hydration, allopurinol) may also be considered if warranted.

Prolonged QT syndrome

Torsades de pointes, associated with QT prolongation, is a potentially sudden and fatal arrhythmia. Some common medications known to cause QT prolongation include antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g. quinidine, procainamide, amiodarone), antibiotics (e.g. macrolides, ketoconazole), antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine, astemizole), antidepressants (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants), and antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol). In the INO-VATE trial, prolonged QT syndrome of any grade was reported in 2% of patients in the InO group and none of the patients in the standard-therapy group. Although QT prolongation is not commonly associated with InO, it is important to monitor for and attempt to prevent this potentially life-threatening syndrome.

Recommendations

Electrolyte levels and electrocardiogram results should be monitored before starting InO and periodically throughout treatment (Table 4). InO should be used with caution in patients with electrolyte imbalances or a history of prolonged QT syndrome and in recipients of medications known to prolong the QT interval.

### Urate oxidase for the prevention and treatment of tumour lysis syndrome in children with cancer [^114oSJXV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is a serious complication of malignancies and can result in renal failure or death. Previous reviews did not find clear evidence of benefit of urate oxidase in children with cancer. This review is the second update of a previously published Cochrane review.

Objectives

To assess the effects and safety of urate oxidase for the prevention and treatment of TLS in children with malignancies.

Search Methods

In March 2016 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. In addition, we searched the reference lists of all identified relevant papers, trials registers and other databases. We also screened conference proceedings and we contacted experts in the field and the manufacturer of rasburicase, Sanofi-aventis.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) and controlled clinical trials (CCT) of urate oxidase for the prevention or treatment of TLS in children under 18 years with any malignancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted trial data and assessed individual trial quality. We used risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data.

Main Results

We included seven trials, involving 471 participants in the treatment groups and 603 participants in the control groups. No new studies were identified in the update. One RCT and five CCTs compared urate oxidase and allopurinol. Three trials tested Uricozyme, and three trials tested rasburicase for the prevention of TLS. The RCT did not evaluate the primary outcome (incidence of clinical TLS). It showed no clear evidence of a difference in mortality (both all-cause mortality (Fisher's exact test P = 0.23) and mortality due to TLS (no deaths in either group)), renal failure (Fisher's exact test P = 0.46), and adverse effects between the treatment and the control groups (Fisher's exact test P = 1.0). The frequency of normalisation of uric acid at four hours (10 out of 10 participants in the treatment group versus zero out of nine participants in the control group, Fisher's exact test P < 0.001) and area under the curve of uric acid at four days (MD -201.00 mg/dLhr, 95% CI -258.05 mg/dLhr to -143.95 mg/dLhr; P < 0.00001) were significantly better in the treatment group. One CCT evaluated the primary outcome; no clear evidence of a difference was identified between the treatment and the control groups (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.33; P = 0.34). Pooled results of three CCTs showed significantly lower mortality due to TLS in the treatment group (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.89; P = 0.04); no clear evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality was identified between the groups (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.42; P = 0.26). Pooled results from five CCTs showed significantly lower incidence of renal failure in the treatment group (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.89; P = 0.03). Results of CCTs also showed significantly lower uric acid in the treatment group at two days (three CCTs: MD -3.80 mg/dL, 95% CI -7.37 mg/dL to -0.24 mg/dL; P = 0.04), three days (two CCTs: MD -3.13 mg/dL, 95% CI -6.12 mg/dL to -0.14 mg/dL; P = 0.04), four days (two CCTs: MD -4.60 mg/dL, 95% CI -6.39 mg/dL to -2.81 mg/dL; P < 0.00001), and seven days (one CCT: MD -1.74 mg/dL, 95% CI -3.01 mg/dL to -0.47 mg/dL; P = 0.007) after therapy, but not one day (three CCTs: MD -3.00 mg/dL, 95% CI -7.61 mg/dL to 1.60 mg/dL; P = 0.2), five days (one CCT: MD -1.02 mg/dL, 95% CI -2.24 mg/dL to 0.20 mg/dL; P = 0.1), and 12 days (one CCT: MD -0.80 mg/dL, 95% CI -2.51 mg/dL to 0.91 mg/dL; P = 0.36) after therapy. Pooled results from three CCTs showed higher frequency of adverse effects in participants who received urate oxidase (RR 9.10, 95% CI 1.29 to 64.00; P = 0.03). Another included RCT, with 30 participants, compared different doses of rasburicase (0.2 mg/kg versus 0.15 mg/kg). The primary outcome was not evaluated. No clear evidence of a difference in mortality (all-cause mortality (Fisher's exact test P = 1.0) and mortality due to TLS (no deaths in both groups)) and renal failure (no renal failure in both groups) was identified. It demonstrated no clear evidence of a difference in uric acid normalisation (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.28; P = 0.49) and uric acid level at four hours (MD 8.10%, 95% CI -0.99% to 17.19%; P = 0.08). Common adverse events of urate oxidase included hypersensitivity, haemolysis, and anaemia, but no clear evidence of a difference between treatment groups was identified (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.48; P = 0.42). The quality of evidence ranks from very low to low because of imprecise results, and all included trials were highly susceptible to biases.

Authors' Conclusions

Although urate oxidase might be effective in reducing serum uric acid, it is unclear whether it reduces clinical TLS, renal failure, or mortality. Adverse effects might be more common for urate oxidase compared with allopurinol. Clinicians should weigh the potential benefits of reducing uric acid and uncertain benefits of preventing mortality or renal failure from TLS against the potential risk of adverse effects.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) supportive care — Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency; however, in patients with TLS at risk for end-organ injury with unknown G6PD status, the benefit of rasburicase may outweigh the risk. Rasburicase is given as a single dose of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg; the maximum dose is 6 mg and it should be repeated only if necessary based on laboratory values, and if used, blood samples for uric acid must be placed on ice to avoid spuriously low levels. Hyperkalemia management per Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) removes exogenous potassium sources, with frequent potassium checks (every 4–6 hours), continuous cardiac monitoring, and oral sodium polystyrene sulfonate recommended; glucose plus insulin or beta agonists can be temporizing measures, and calcium gluconate may be used to reduce dysrhythmia risk while awaiting hemodialysis and/or hemofiltration, which most effectively remove potassium. Hyperphosphatemia is managed with a phosphorus-restricted diet and consideration of phosphate binder such as sevelamer; do not use calcium carbonate in patients at risk for TLS, especially if the calcium phosphate product is > 60 mg²/dL². For hypocalcemia, correct hyperphosphatemia and avoid calcium supplementation unless symptomatic with tetany, muscle spasm, or Trousseau/Chvostek signs. Consider hemodialysis/continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) for worsening renal function when electrolyte abnormalities do not correct with medical management. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Hemolysis and methemoglobinemia secondary to rasburicase administration [^112UJ6e7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia developing after rasburicase administration to a patient with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.

Case Summary

A 50-year-old African American man was hospitalized with new onset seizure, diabetic ketoacidosis, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. Serum uric acid concentrations were elevated, and the patient was treated with one dose of intravenous rasburicase 22.5 mg for acute renal failure secondary to hyperuricemia. Routine arterial blood gas analyses performed after rasburicase was administered revealed elevated methemoglobin concentrations, which peaked at 14.7%. Hemolytic anemia developed as evidenced by a fall in blood hemoglobin from 14.8 to 5.3 g/dL. The patient made a full recovery following aggressive fluid therapy, blood transfusions, and respiratory support. G6PD deficiency was subsequently confirmed. The Naranjo probability scale indicated that rasburicase was a probable cause of hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia.

Discussion

Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency as it may cause hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia. As of September 26, 2005, simultaneous occurrence of hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia has not been reported in patients receiving rasburicase.

Conclusions

As of September 26, 2005, screening for G6PD deficiency should be performed whenever possible prior to chemotherapy administration in patients at risk of developing tumor lysis syndrome.

The case of rasburicase (urate oxidase)

This drug, licensed about 10 years ago for the prohpylaxis and treatment of hyperuricaemia associated with tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), deserves special attention for several reasons. First, with other drugs the precise chemical mechanism whereby they cause oxidative damage is not fully understood: for rasburicase – a genetically engineered form of the enzyme urate oxidase – we know instead that, like all other oxidases, one of the products of the enzyme reaction is hydrogen peroxide, of which one molecule is produced stoichiometrically for every molecule of uric acid that is catabolized. In normal cells, hydrogen peroxide is promptly degraded by either glutathione peroxidase (GSHPX) or catalase, but in red cells of G6PD-deficient subjects, GSHPX activity is impaired because GSH is in short supply (Fig 4), and catalase may also be impaired because the intracellular NADPH concentration is low (Gaetani et al). Second, presumably as a result of this mechanism, in G6PD-deficient subjects rasburicase causes both AHA and acute methaemoglobinaemia – the latter can reach levels of up to 20%, much higher than that seen with other drugs. This literally colours the clinical picture, because the patient appears cyanotic; and methaemoglobinaemia makes the tissue hypoxia consequent on anaemia more severe, because methaemoglobin does not carry oxygen. Third, rasburicase is used in patients who have malignancies (such as acute leukaemia with high blast counts, large cell lymphoma, and sometimes other solid tumours), and who, following chemotherapy, may develop TLS. This means that the drug is administered to a patient who is already quite ill, may be already anaemic, and may be already at risk of renal failure. In addition, rasburicase has a t½ of 18–24 h resulting in the production of hydrogen peroxide for several days. Fourth, the association between rasburicase-induced AHA and G6PD deficiency is so strong, that this is formally stated as a contra-indication. In a recent compilation of case reports (Sonbol et al,), three patients were listed as G6PD normal, but in fact in one of them the test was not done (Kizer et al,); in two no quantitative results were given (Kizer et al; Bauters et al,), and the test was carried out after a haemolytic attack (when a false-normal result is possible), and after blood transfusion: therefore the G6PD status must be regarded as doubtful (the enzyme test ought to have been repeated subsequently, or a molecular test should have been done).

### A randomized comparison between rasburicase and allopurinol in children with lymphoma or leukemia at high risk for tumor lysis [^117Sv3Ht]. Blood (2001). Low credibility.

Standard therapy in the United States for malignancy-associated hyperuricemia consists of hydration, alkalinization, and allopurinol. Urate oxidase catalyzes the enzymatic oxidation of uric acid to a 5 times increased urine soluble product, allantoin. Rasburicase is a new recombinant form of urate oxidase available for clinical evaluation. This multicenter randomized trial compared allopurinol to rasburicase in pediatric patients with leukemia or lymphoma at high risk for tumor lysis. Patients received the assigned uric acid-lowering agent for 5 to 7 days during induction chemotherapy. The primary efficacy end point was to compare the area under the serial plasma uric acid concentration curves during the first 96 hours of therapy (AUC(0–96)). Fifty-two patients were randomized at 6 sites. In an intent-to-treat analysis, the mean uric acid AUC(0–96) was 128 ± 70 mg/dL.hour for the rasburicase group and 329 ± 129 mg/dL.hour for the allopurinol group (P < .0001). The rasburicase versus allopurinol group experienced a 2.6-fold (95% CI: 2.0–3.4) less exposure to uric acid. Four hours after the first dose, patients randomized to rasburicase compared to allopurinol achieved an 86% versus 12% reduction (P < .0001) of initial plasma uric acid levels. No antirasburicase antibodies were detected at day 14. This randomized study demonstrated more rapid control and lower levels of plasma uric acid in patients at high risk for tumor lysis who received rasburicase compared to allopurinol. For pediatric patients with advanced stage lymphoma or high tumor burden leukemia, rasburicase is a safe and effective alternative to allopurinol during initial chemotherapy.

Other toxicities

Primary CAR induction-associated toxicities

Additional toxicities associated with primary IEC induction have been described, including allergic reaction, sepsis, and TLS. One patient developed anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest within minutes of completing a third infusion of T cells that had been transduced with a CAR derived from a murine antibody to human mesothelin, although this appears to be an isolated incident.

More commonly, several studies have reported TLS after CAR T cell treatment, a pathology arising due to dramatic electrolyte and metabolite imbalances after widespread release of cancer cell contents into the bloodstream, which can cause kidney damage due to elevated levels of serum uric acid and LDH. To prevent TLS in patients from undergoing CAR T therapy, prophylactic allopurinol is sometimes administered prior to infusions. However, several trials have reported TLS, despite preinfusion allopurinol. Symptoms typically resolved after fluid resuscitation and administration of the recombinant urate oxidase drug rasburicase. In an analysis of 328 pediatric ALL patients undergoing chemotherapy, factors predictive of TLS were male sex (OR 1.8; p = 0.041), age ≥ 10 years (OR 4.5; p < 0.0001), splenomegaly (OR 3.3; p < 0.0001), mediastinal mass (OR 12.2; p < 0.0001), T cell immunophenotype (OR 8.2; p < 0.0001), CNS involvement (OR 2.8; p = 0.026), serum LDH ≥ 2000 U/L (OR 7.6; p < 0.0001), and elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts (≥ 20 × 10⁹/L) (OR 4.7; p < 0.0001). In two separate studies of TLS in patients with AML, predictive risk factors were male sex, LDH levels above normal values, creatinine > 1.4 mg/dL, uric acid > 7.5 mg/dL, and WBC count > 25 × 10⁹/L.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) tumor lysis management — rasburicase use and urine alkalinization guidance states that "Standard tumor lysis prophylaxis includes hydration with diuresis, and allopurinol administration or rasburicase treatment". "Rasburicase should be considered as initial treatment in patients with rapidly increasing blast counts, high uric acid, or evidence of impaired renal function". Before use, "patients should be evaluated for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, as rasburicase use in these patients is contraindicated and is associated with an increased risk of inducing hemolysis". Regarding alkalinization, "Urine alkalinization was previously recommended"; however, "this method is not generally favored as there are no data to support this practice and similar effects could be seen with saline hydration alone", and it "can complicate care by increasing calcium phosphate deposits in vital organs (eg, kidney, heart) as a result of hyperphosphatemia". In contrast, rasburicase has the benefit of rapid uric acid breakdown, "eliminating the need for urine alkalinization".

### Control of plasma uric acid in adults at risk for tumor lysis syndrome: efficacy and safety of rasburicase alone and rasburicase followed by allopurinol compared with allopurinol alone – results of a multicenter phase III study [^114rSWDt]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Rasburicase is effective in controlling plasma uric acid in pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies. This study in adults evaluated safety of and compared efficacy of rasburicase alone with rasburicase followed by oral allopurinol and with allopurinol alone in controlling plasma uric acid.

Patients and Methods

Adults with hematologic malignancies at risk for hyperuricemia and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) were randomly assigned to rasburicase (0.20 mg/kg/d intravenously days 1–5), rasburicase plus allopurinol (rasburicase 0.20 mg/kg/d days 1 to 3 followed by oral allopurinol 300 mg/d days 3 to 5), or allopurinol (300 mg/d orally days 1 to 5). Primary efficacy variable was plasma uric acid response rate defined as percentage of patients achieving or maintaining plasma uric acid ≤ 7.5 mg/dL during days 3 to 7.

Results

Ninety-two patients received rasburicase, 92 rasburicase plus allopurinol, and 91 allopurinol. Plasma uric acid response rate was 87% with rasburicase, 78% with rasburicase plus allopurinol, and 66% with allopurinol. It was significantly greater for rasburicase than for allopurinol (P = 0.001) in the overall study population, in patients at high risk for TLS (89% v 68%; P = 0.012), and in those with baseline hyperuricemia (90% v 53%; P = 0.015). Time to plasma uric acid control in hyperuricemic patients was 4 hours for rasburicase, 4 hours for rasburicase plus allopurinol, and 27 hours for allopurinol.

Conclusion

In adults with hyperuricemia or at high risk for TLS, rasburicase provided control of plasma uric acid more rapidly than allopurinol. Rasburicase was well tolerated as a single agent and in sequential combination with allopurinol.

These fungi are found in the lungs of mammals where they reside without causing overt infection until the host's immune system becomes debilitated. Then, an oftentimes lethal pneumonia can result. Asexual phase: trophic forms replicate by mitosis to. Sexual phase: haploid trophic forms conjugate and produce a zygote or sporocyte.

The zygote undergoes meiosis and subsequent mitosis to produce eight haploid nuclei. Spores exhibit different shapes. It is postulated that elongation of the spores precedes release from the spore case. It is believed that the release occurs through a rent in the cell wall. After release, the empty spore case usually collapses, but retains some residual cytoplasm. A trophic stage, where the organisms probably multiply by binary fission is also recognized to exist. The organism causes disease in immunosuppressed individuals. Geographic Distribution Worldwide, in humans and animals. Serologic evidence indicates that most healthy children have been exposed by age 3 to 4. Pneumocystis pneumonia occurs in immunosuppressed individuals and in premature, malnourished infants. Clinical Presentation The symptoms of Pneumocystis pneumonia include dyspnea, nonproductive cough, and fever.

Figure 1.
Final recommended once‐daily dosing schedule for venetoclax 5‐week dose ramp‐up used in clinical trials for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and/or small lymphocytic lymphoma.

A comprehensive data review of reports of TLS across venetoclax clinical trials revealed that a combination of tumor burden (bulky lymph nodes ≥ 5 cm and/or elevated absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 25 × 10⁹) and reduced renal function at screening could be used to identify patients at risk of developing TLS, and guidelines per risk category were implemented [57]. Along with the gradual 5‐week dose ramp‐up described above (Fig. 1), all patients now receive oral or intravenous fluids, based on the risk of TLS, beginning 48 hours prior to the first dose of venetoclax, as well as oral uric acid‐reducing agents starting 72 hours prior to first dose. Rasburicase is recommended for patients at high risk for developing TLS and who have high baseline uric acid levels. For patients with low to medium tumor burden, dosing can be in an outpatient setting, with monitoring of laboratory values within 72 hours prior to the first dose at each step of the ramp‐up, and at 0, 8, and 24 hours after dose (Table 3). For patients with high tumor burden or those with creatinine clearance < 80 mL per minute, the initial 20 mg and 50 mg doses are given in the hospital, with laboratory monitoring at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours; subsequent ramp‐up doses may be given in an outpatient setting (Table 3). Based on clinical data from venetoclax studies, up to 24 hours is the period of time that requires monitoring for risk of TLS when initiating therapy. With these current measures, four of 296 patients across three clinical studies of venetoclax monotherapy had five adverse events of TLS as reported by investigators (one patient had two events) [59]. Based on medical review, no clinical TLS was observed and only one adverse event met Howard criteria for laboratory TLS (decreased calcium and increased phosphate). All of the laboratory TLS events were observed within the 5‐week dose ramp‐up and were managed with prompt hydration, electrolyte correction, and temporary dose interruption. Patients resumed dosing without clinical sequelae and no patient discontinued venetoclax owing to TLS [59].

2.3 	Recommended Premedication and Prophylactic Medications

Premedication

Administer the following premedications to reduce the risk of CRS and infusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Tumor Lysis Syndrome Prophylaxis

Before starting COLUMVI, administer anti-hyperuricemics to patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome, ensure adequate hydration status, and monitor as appropriate [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Antiviral Prophylaxis

Before starting COLUMVI, consider initiation of antiviral prophylaxis to prevent herpes virus reactivation. Consider prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus infection in patients at increased risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia (PJP)

Consider PJP prophylaxis prior to starting COLUMVI in patients at increased risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

2.4	Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions

No dosage reduction for COLUMVI is recommended.

Cytokine Release Syndrome

Identify CRS based on clinical presentation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension.

If CRS is suspected, withhold COLUMVI and manage according to the recommendations in Table 4 and current practice guidelines. Administer supportive care for CRS, which may include intensive care for severe or life-threatening cases.

Neurologic Toxicity, Including ICANS

Management recommendations for neurologic toxicity, including ICANS, is summarized in Table 5. At the first sign of neurologic toxicity, including ICANS, consider neurology evaluation and withholding COLUMVI based on the type and severity of neurotoxicity. Rule out other causes of neurologic symptoms. Provide supportive therapy, which may include intensive care.
