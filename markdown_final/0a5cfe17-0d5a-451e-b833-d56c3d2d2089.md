## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage a 15-year-old boy with two months of generalized body aches and malaise, whose COVID-19, influenza, and mononucleosis tests were reportedly "normal", and who now has a new red rash. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the significance of the timing and the initial negative infectious workup. Then, I should verify what "normal" testing means for each pathogen and whether false negatives or timing issues could have been missed. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis that includes infectious, immune-mediated, rheumatologic, and oncologic causes. After that, I should outline a targeted diagnostic workup with labs, imaging, and referrals. Finally, I will synthesize a working diagnosis and immediate management plan, while double-checking for pitfalls and ensuring the plan aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and why the two-month timeline matters. A two-month course of generalized body aches and malaise moves us beyond the acute infectious window and into subacute or chronic etiologies, including post-viral syndromes, immune-mediated disease, and less common but serious conditions like malignancy; I need to ensure I do not anchor prematurely on an acute infection given this chronology.

> Wait, let me verify what "COVID-19 testing was normal". If this meant a single negative NAAT early in the course, that could be a false negative due to timing or sampling; IDSA notes that serology is not reliable for acute diagnosis in the first two weeks and that NAAT sensitivity can be imperfect, especially with suboptimal timing or sampling, so a negative early test does not exclude COVID-19 in this window [^113Q2vGM] [^113983Ma]. I should also consider that MIS-C can present weeks after exposure with negative PCR but positive serology and systemic inflammation; the CDC notes MIS-C typically follows SARS-CoV-2 exposure by 2–6 weeks and may have negative PCR at presentation, so I need to check for MIS-C features and inflammatory markers now [^116mxwQN] [^111F6WDc].

> Hold on, I should verify the influenza and mononucleosis results similarly. For influenza, a single negative test outside the early symptomatic window or with poor sampling can miss infection; clinical overlap is substantial, so a negative test does not fully exclude influenza in a non-acute presentation, though persistence for two months makes ongoing acute influenza less likely as the sole driver here [^117QQUns]. For infectious mononucleosis, I need to check whether testing included a heterophile antibody test and EBV-specific serology; the Monospot has imperfect sensitivity early and in younger children, and EBV IgM/IgG or EBV DNA may be needed if suspicion remains, especially with posterior cervical nodes, fatigue, and atypical lymphocytes on CBC differential [^111L39fR].

> Now, the new red rash changes the calculus; I should not jump to conclusions, but I need to broaden the differential. Infectious considerations include measles, rubella, dengue or chikungunya if epidemiologically plausible, enteroviruses, parvovirus B19, and acute HIV; immune-mediated differentials include serum sickness–like reactions, vasculitis, and drug eruptions; rheumatologic entities like systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis or Still's disease can present with rash and systemic symptoms; and I must keep oncologic processes such as Hodgkin lymphoma in mind given the age and B symptoms, even if subtle [^113om2Ce] [^1133pgtw] [^116SAfX4] [^113gymPY].

> I will now examine the infectious possibilities more closely. Measles and rubella remain in the differential if there is a morbilliform rash with cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis; dengue and chikungunya should be considered with fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash, especially with travel or local transmission; parvovirus B19 causes a "slapped cheek" or lace-like rash and can cause arthralgias; enteroviruses can cause viral exanthems with systemic symptoms; acute HIV can present with a generalized maculopapular rash and flu-like symptoms, so I should have a low threshold to test a 15-year-old with a compatible syndrome using a 4th-generation Ag/Ab assay and follow the CDC algorithm if reactive [^113om2Ce] [^1133pgtw] [^111V54mX].

> But wait, what if this is immune-mediated rather than infectious. A serum sickness–like reaction can follow drugs or infections and presents with urticarial or erythematous rash, arthralgia, and fever; I should double-check medication exposures, including over-the-counter agents and antibiotics. Vasculitis can present with palpable purpura or livedo and systemic symptoms; if suspected, I should check urinalysis, renal function, and consider ANCA. Drug eruptions are common in adolescents; I need a meticulous medication and supplement history, including new exposures in the weeks before the rash [^112FnXE2].

> Let me consider rheumatologic causes next. Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis or adult-onset Still's disease can present with evanescent salmon-colored rash, quotidian fevers, and systemic inflammation; I should check ESR, CRP, ferritin, and CBC, and look for hepatosplenomegaly or serositis on exam. Given the broad differential, I should confirm that EULAR/PReS guidance to exclude infection, malignancy, and other autoinflammatory disorders is followed before labeling a rheumatic disease [^116SAfX4].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook malignancy. Hodgkin lymphoma in adolescents can present with generalized pruritus, fatigue, and B symptoms; I should examine all nodal stations and the spleen carefully and obtain a CBC with differential, ESR/CRP, LDH, and a metabolic panel; if there are concerning nodes or systemic features, I should escalate to imaging and tissue diagnosis per pediatric oncology standards [^113gymPY].

> Next, I should review the immediate diagnostic workup to test these hypotheses. I will order a CBC with differential to assess for leukocytosis, leukopenia, atypical lymphocytes, anemia, or thrombocytopenia; ESR and CRP to screen for inflammation; a comprehensive metabolic panel including liver enzymes; urinalysis to screen for renal involvement; and HIV Ag/Ab with reflexes per CDC if reactive. I will add EBV IgM/IgG or EBV DNA if not previously done and mononucleosis remains suspected. Depending on epidemiology and season, I should consider measles/rubella serologies, dengue/chikungunya testing, and parvovirus B19 IgM. If MIS-C is on the table, I will add inflammatory markers, troponin, BNP, and a coagulation profile, and consider echocardiography if cardiac involvement is suspected [^111V54mX] [^116mxwQN].

> Hold on, I should verify the imaging and referral strategy. A chest radiograph is reasonable if there are respiratory symptoms or to screen for mediastinal disease; an abdominal ultrasound can assess for organomegaly or lymphadenopathy; and if lymphadenopathy is present, a neck ultrasound can characterize nodes. Given the breadth of the differential and the new rash, I should involve pediatric infectious diseases early; if rheumatologic features emerge, pediatric rheumatology should be consulted; and if there are B symptoms or abnormal labs suggesting malignancy, pediatric oncology should be engaged promptly [^113gymPY].

> Let me synthesize a working diagnosis while acknowledging uncertainty. The most likely unifying diagnosis, given the two-month systemic symptoms and new rash in an adolescent, is a post-viral or immune-mediated process such as serum sickness–like reaction or an early rheumatic disease like systemic JIA, with a guarded consideration for MIS-C if there was prior COVID-19 exposure and inflammatory markers are elevated; however, I must actively exclude acute HIV, EBV infection if serology was incomplete, and malignancy such as Hodgkin lymphoma before finalizing that pathway [^116SAfX4] [^116mxwQN] [^113gymPY].

> I should double-check immediate management steps. Supportive care remains foundational: acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and myalgia, hydration, and rest; I will avoid amoxicillin or ampicillin if mononucleosis is suspected due to rash risk; I will counsel to avoid contact sports if splenomegaly is possible until cleared; and I will treat pruritus with non-sedating antihistamines if the rash is urticarial. If a serum sickness–like reaction is suspected, a short, tapering course of corticosteroids may be appropriate after weighing risks and benefits; if systemic JIA is suspected, rheumatology-directed therapy may be indicated; if MIS-C is suspected, urgent inpatient evaluation and immunomodulatory therapy may be required [^113MdZ4T] [^112FnXE2] [^116mxwQN].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the negative COVID-19 testing definitively excluded SARS-CoV-2–related disease, but I should correct that assumption. Negative early NAAT does not exclude prior infection, and MIS-C can present with negative PCR but positive serology and marked inflammation; thus, I need to ensure I reassess for MIS-C features and obtain appropriate inflammatory and cardiac markers if the clinical picture fits, even with prior negative testing [^116mxwQN] [^111F6WDc].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and safety-netting are explicit. I will arrange close follow-up within 1–2 weeks to review new labs and clinical evolution, with clear return precautions for fever, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, altered mental status, or bleeding; I will document a thorough review of systems and exam at each visit to catch evolving B symptoms, lymphadenopathy, or organomegaly that would pivot the workup toward malignancy or systemic disease [^113gymPY].

The most likely diagnosis is **infectious mononucleosis (IM)** [^111L39fR] given the patient's age, prolonged fatigue, and myalgias, with a negative initial workup for COVID-19, influenza, and IM. The new red rash suggests a **drug eruption** (notably to amoxicillin or ampicillin) [^113MdZ4T] or a **viral exanthem** (such as parvovirus B19 or enterovirus) [^notfound]. IM remains possible despite initial negative tests because early heterophile testing can be falsely negative; confirm with EBV-specific serology and atypical lymphocyte count [^111L39fR]. If EBV is negative, evaluate for acute HIV [^111V54mX], Lyme disease [^notfound], and autoimmune or rheumatologic conditions. Management is supportive, avoid amoxicillin if IM is suspected, and monitor for complications.

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Infectious etiologies

- **Infectious mononucleosis (IM)**: Common in adolescents; presents with fatigue, myalgias, and rash (often drug-induced with amoxicillin/ampicillin) [^113MdZ4T]. Initial heterophile tests can be falsely negative early; confirm with EBV-specific serology and atypical lymphocytes [^111L39fR].

- **Parvovirus B19**: "Slapped cheek" rash, arthralgias, and myalgias; consider if rash is erythematous and lacy [^notfound].

- **Enteroviral infections**: Hand-foot-mouth or generalized maculopapular rash with myalgias and fatigue [^notfound].

- **Acute HIV infection**: Flu-like symptoms and rash; test with HIV RNA/DNA or 4th-generation Ag/Ab assay [^111V54mX].

- **Lyme disease**: Erythema migrans or nonspecific rash with myalgias; test if exposure risk [^114AGEKL].

---

### Autoimmune and rheumatologic conditions

- **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Malar rash, myalgias, fatigue; check ANA, dsDNA, and complement levels.

- **Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)**: Persistent arthralgias/myalgias with rash; assess inflammatory markers and rheumatoid factor.

- **Dermatomyositis**: Heliotrope rash and proximal muscle weakness; check CK, aldolase, and ANA.

---

### Other considerations

Other considerations include **drug eruption** — commonly to amoxicillin/ampicillin, especially with IM — and **post-viral fatigue syndrome**, in which persistent fatigue and myalgias follow a viral illness [^116tVWvz] [^113v68ZT].

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

| **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| EBV-specific serology (IgM/IgG) | Confirm or exclude IM |
| CBC with differential | Atypical lymphocytes, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia |
| LFTs | Hepatic involvement (common in IM) |
| HIV RNA/DNA or 4th-gen Ag/Ab | Exclude acute HIV |
| Lyme serology | If exposure risk |
| ANA, RF, ESR/CRP | Screen autoimmune disease |
| Skin biopsy | If rash atypical or persistent |

---

## Management and follow-up

Management is **supportive care** — rest, hydration, and analgesics — and **amoxicillin/ampicillin should be avoided** if IM is suspected because of the high risk of a morbilliform rash [^113MdZ4T]. Monitor for complications such as splenomegaly, hepatitis, or airway obstruction, and arrange follow-up to track symptom resolution and address new findings.

---

## Conclusion

The most likely diagnosis is **IM** given the patient's age and clinical picture, with the new rash suggesting a drug eruption or viral exanthem. Confirm with EBV serology and atypical lymphocytes; if negative, broaden to HIV, Lyme, and autoimmune etiologies. Management is supportive, with avoidance of amoxicillin if IM is suspected.

Much has been reported on the clinical course of severe COVID-19, but less is known about the natural history and sequalae of mildly symptomatic cases and the prospects of reinfection or recurrence of symptoms. We report a case of a patient with mildly symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 who, after being symptom-free for 2 weeks, redeveloped symptoms and was found to be PCR-positive again > 4 weeks from original testing. Surprisingly, IgG and IgM antibody testing was negative 2 months after reinfection. Although no negative testing was performed between the two symptomatic bouts, this case raises the possibility of reinfection after controlling the virus and highlights the long period with which a patient can shed virus and experience symptoms after initial infection. Characterising variations in clinical symptoms and length of viral shedding after improvement is essential for informing recommendations on patients safely resuming contact with others.

IDSA serologic testing — diagnosis in the first 2 weeks: The IDSA panel recommends against using serologic testing to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first 2 weeks following symptom onset (strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Remarks note that serologic testing should not be routinely performed for diagnosis of acute COVID-19 and that accuracy may be worse in vaccinated or previously infected populations; anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies typically become detectable more than 2 weeks after symptom onset, and serology lacks sufficient sensitivity in the acute phase.

Abstract.

A 25-year-old medical student presented in Multan, Pakistan with a high fever, cough, myalgia, and diarrhea consistent with the typical signs and symptoms of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The patient had traveled to high COVID-19–risk areas within Pakistan and had no significant medical and surgical history. Based on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab testing, the patient was found to be negative for COVID-19. He subsequently developed a diffuse rash and had serology consistent with dengue and measles. The patient was treated symptomatically, and his condition gradually improved over 7 days. This case highlights the high prevalence of many tropical diseases in low-income countries and the need for clinicians to consider alternate diagnoses in addition to testing for COVID-19 during the pandemic.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^1152B3P6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — first 2 weeks after symptom onset: The IDSA panel recommends against using serologic testing to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first 2 weeks following symptom onset (strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Most studies included in this recommendation's literature review assessed unvaccinated individuals and so the panel's findings might not apply to individuals who have been vaccinated, especially with respect to specificity, rendering test accuracy worse than presented. Similarly, in today's population there is a higher likelihood of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection than assessed in the included studies, which could also negatively affect specificity, rendering test accuracy worse than presented. Analogous to other respiratory viruses where nonserologic tests are preferred for diagnosis of acute infection, serologic testing should not be performed routinely for diagnosis of acute COVID-19.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing (January 2023) [^114VVppE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

COVID-19 antigen (Ag) testing in symptomatic patients — benefits and harms indicate that within 5 days of symptom onset the false-negative rate ranged from 5 (range: 3 to 8) per 1000 at 5% prevalence to 55 (range: 35 to 85) per 1000 at 50% prevalence, while specificity remained close to 100% regardless of time from symptom onset. After 5 days of symptoms, sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 44% to 64%), and because of potential harms a negative result in someone with continued suspicion for COVID-19 should be confirmed promptly with a standard NAAT. As currently available therapies are recommended to be started within 5 days of symptoms, Ag testing during this period yielded almost no false-positive results even when prevalence was as low as 5% (range: 0 to 9 false-positive results per 1000 patients tested).

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^112xH3Wr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA serologic testing — background on seroprevalence and timing: As of December 2022, more than 96% of the US population was estimated to have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and the utility of antibody testing has declined as seroprevalence due to vaccination and natural infection has increased. Anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies typically become detectable more than 2 weeks after onset of symptoms; consequently, serology lacks sufficient sensitivity in the acute phase and positive results may reflect vaccination or distant history rather than acute or recent infection.

### Comparison of clinical characteristics and peripheral blood tests of COVID-19 and influenza B patients [^113hd3Mh]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

We suggest the use of COVID-19 testing in patients with a low to moderate fever and decreased red blood cell and lymphocyte counts, but influenza B testing in patients with a moderate to high fever and a sore throat, cough, and decreased white blood cell and neutrophil counts. Considering that virus antigen testing methods are unavailable in primary care hospitals, the criteria may help differentiate these two diseases and expedite timely referral to a higher-level hospital for relevant pathogenic testing. Nevertheless, given the overlap in clinical and laboratory manifestations, testing for both infections should be done whenever feasible and when both viruses are circulating.

In addition to typical respiratory clinical manifestations, 1 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may also exhibit extrapulmonary clinical manifestations. As we continue to discover more about SARS-CoV-2, it is becoming evident that its presentation, course of disease, and clinical manifestations differ from person to person. Not only that, it is presenting with a wide range of findings, skin manifestations might be one of the rare signs of the disease. 2 We encountered a unique case in our outpatient setting via telemedicine. Our patient presented with usual signs and clinical manifestations of the disease and developed a total body urticarial eruption with red margins and raised skin-colored center 4 days after our initial encounter. Later, she tested positive for COVID-19. She did not require hospitalization and was managed with supportive care and antihistamines.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has become an important public health issue in the world. More than 118 000 cases were confirmed around the world. The main clinical manifestations were respiratory symptoms and occasional gastrointestinal symptoms. However, there is no unified standard for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. In the retrospective analysis, we report nine cases of COVID-19, describe the history of contact, clinical manifestations, the course of diagnosis and clinical treatment before, during and after treatment.

### Does this patient have infectious mononucleosis? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^111L39fR]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Early, accurate diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis can help clinicians target treatment, avoid antibiotics, and provide an accurate prognosis.

Objective

To systematically review the literature regarding the value of the clinical examination and white blood cell count for the diagnosis of mononucleosis.

Data Sources

The databases of PubMed (from 1966–2016) and EMBASE (from 1947–2015) were searched and a total of 670 articles and abstracts were reviewed for eligibility.

Study Selection

Eleven studies were included that reported data sufficient to calculate sensitivity, specificity, or both for clinical examination findings and white blood cell count parameters compared with a valid reference standard.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were abstracted from each article by at least 2 reviewers, with discrepancies reconciled by consensus. Clinical findings evaluated in only 1 study are reported with sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio (LR), and 95% confidence interval, which were calculated from the available data. Findings evaluated in only 2 studies were summarized with their range, findings evaluated in 3 studies were summarized with a univariate random-effects summary, and findings evaluated in 4 or more studies were summarized with a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and LRs for the diagnosis of mononucleosis.

Results

Mononucleosis is most commonly present among patients aged 5 to 25 years (especially those aged 16–20 years, among whom approximately 1 in 13 patients presenting with sore throat has mononucleosis). The likelihood of mononucleosis is reduced with the absence of any lymphadenopathy (summary sensitivity, 0.91; positive LR range, 0.23–0.44), whereas the likelihood increases with the presence of posterior cervical adenopathy (summary specificity, 0.87; positive LR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.6–5.9]), inguinal or axillary adenopathy (specificity range, 0.82–0.91; positive LR range, 3.0–3.1), palatine petechiae (specificity, 0.95; positive LR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.1–13]), and splenomegaly (specificity range, 0.71–0.99; positive LR range, 1.9–6.6). Symptoms are of limited value for the diagnosis of mononucleosis; sore throat and fatigue are sensitive (range, 0.81–0.83) but nonspecific. The presence of atypical lymphocytosis significantly increases the likelihood of mononucleosis (summary LR, 11.4 [95% CI, 2.7–35] for atypical lymphocytes ≥ 10%, 26 [95% CI, 9.6–68] for those with 20%, and 50 [95% CI, 38–64] for those with 40%). The combination of a patient having greater than 50% lymphocytes and greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes also is useful (specificity, 0.99; positive LR, 54 [95% CI, 8.4–189]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In adolescent and adult patients presenting with sore throat, the presence of posterior cervical, inguinal or axillary adenopathy, palatine petechiae, splenomegaly, or atypical lymphocytosis is associated with an increased likelihood of mononucleosis.

### A case of bleeding during infection with COVID-19 [^111mkuBE]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Dr. Patrick Lowe: Our case today is that of a 47-year-old woman who was referred to our emergency department (ED) due to bloody urine, dark tarry stools, red spots on her skin, and bruising throughout her body. Fourteen days prior to presentation, she began exhibiting intermittent fevers, headache, shortness of breath, and a dry cough, and she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19 pneumonia). Over the 3 days prior to her ED presentation, she experienced a headache that was more intense than the headaches she had been having in the preceding 2 weeks. She reported episodes of both dark urine as well as bright red blood in her urine. In addition, she had multiple dark stools described as tar-like when asked. On the day of her ED presentation, the patient noted a red rash throughout her body. In addition, earlier in the day, she had atraumatic self-limited epistaxis. She denied any falls or head strikes, vision changes, focal weakness or numbness, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, or peripheral swelling.

### Case report: diagnosis of COVID-19 versus tropical diseases in Pakistan [^114eM8Pa]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

CASE

A 25-year-old man presented to the emergency department of Nishtar Hospital, Multan, Pakistan with a 3-day history of high fever, chills, dry cough, myalgias, and diarrhea. He reported a sudden onset of symptoms. The patient is a medical student with no prior medical history. He reported recent travel with his family to Islamabad and Karachi, regions with known novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission, but family members denied similar complaints. The patient's childhood and adult immunization records showed that all immunizations were up to date.

Considering the emergence of COVID-19 and the patient's travel history, he was admitted to the hospital. Droplet and contact precautions were initiated. The staff caring for the patient were provided appropriate personal protective equipment.

In the ward, the patient was continuously shivering, with a temperature of 39.5°C, pulse 140 per minute, blood pressure 95/60 mm Hg, respiratory rate 18 per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% while breathing ambient air. Breath sounds were equal and clear in both lung fields. Chest radiographs showed no abnormalities.

Initial laboratory tests were mostly unremarkable but showed mild elevation of liver function tests (Table 1). Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 by reverse transcriptase–Polymerase chain reaction, and both tests were negative. Therefore, we decided to steer the patient's management toward other infectious diseases within our differential diagnosis.

Table 1
Clinical laboratory results

The patient was treated with intravenous hydration, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and paracetamol. Initially, he experienced relapsing high fevers, productive cough, severe myalgias, and worsening diarrhea. On the third day of hospital admission, the patient developed a maculopapular rash on the face and trunk, which gradually spread to the extremities over 2 days. To evaluate the rash, measles and varicella antibody tests were also conducted.

Microscopy of thick and thin smears for malaria, serology and surface antigen markers for viral hepatitis, and bacterial blood and stool cultures were negative. Testing for dengue showed positive IgM titers (1.6 U/L) and borderline NS1 antigen (0.8 µg/mL) results. Further serologic investigation revealed elevated IgM (137 U/L) against measles virus and negative serology for varicella. The same treatment measures were continued. By day 7, the patient's fever, rash, and diarrhea had subsided; intravenous access was removed; and he was discharged.

### Serum sickness-like reaction following an administration of the first dose of inactivated COVID19 vaccine [^112FnXE2]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 43-year-old previously healthy female patient presented to a dermatology outpatient clinic with pruritic blanchable erythematous macules and patches and excoriated papules and plaques on her trunk and extremities, which resolved with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (Fig 1, A and D). The lesions on the chest and back of the right shoulder exhibited a feature resembling reticulate erythema (Fig 1, B and D). Four days prior, the patient had received the first dose of an inactivated COVID19 vaccine (CoronaVac; Sinovac, Beijing) without any immediate adverse reaction. The rashes started as a single patch on the chest and became generalized within 9 days; they appeared randomly and did not follow a pattern of centrifugal distribution. The rashes were accompanied by fever (body temperature, 38.1 °C), generalized malaise, severe myalgia and arthralgia, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Before this presentation, the patient had not had any recent history of respiratory tract infection, taken any medication, vaccination, or blood transfusions. Laboratory investigations revealed leukocytosis predominated by neutrophils and elevation of various inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (42 mm/hr; normal range, 4–20 mm/hr), C-reactive protein (165.74 mg/L; normal range, 0–5 mg/L), ferritin (3210.2 ng/mL; normal range, 15–150 ng/mL), and lactate dehydrogenase (336 U/L; normal range, 125–220 U/L). Chest x-ray, urinalysis, and serum creatinine level were normal. Serology for hepatitis viruses indicated an inactive carrier state for hepatitis B virus infection (viral load, 24 IU/mL with normal liver function tests) and the absence of hepatitis C infection. Hemocultures, nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction, and tests for antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factors were negative. Complement levels, including C3c and C4, were normal. A test for anti-CIC C1q IgG antibodies, which indicate the presence of an abnormal circulating immune-complex, was also negative. Biopsy of the lesional skin demonstrated superficial perivascular and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrates (Fig 2) composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, nuclear dust, and extravasation of erythrocytes (Fig 2, inset). Fibrinoid necrosis of the blood vessel wall was not observed. Histopathologic differential diagnoses might encompass urticarial vasculitis; nonetheless, the overall clinical presentation, the temporal relationship with the vaccine, together with the normal complement levels, favored the diagnosis of vaccine-related SSLR (Table I). The diagnosis prompted the prescription of high-dose oral corticosteroid treatment (prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day), colchicine (1.2 mg/day), antihistamines, and a moderate-potency topical steroid. Given the rapid improvement of the patient's condition in less than a week, a 2-week taper was attempted; however, the symptoms recurred with this regimen. Therefore, prednisolone was reintroduced at 15 mg per day with gradual tapering guided by erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels. After 2 months of treatment, inflammatory markers normalized, allowing a slow withdrawal of corticosteroid treatment while continuing others. Because of the prolonged course and severity of the illness, the caring physicians and the patient agreed to cancel further vaccine doses. The reaction was reported to the vaccine adverse event reporting system.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111V54mX]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosing acute HIV infection — screening and testing algorithm — Health care providers should consider a diagnosis of acute HIV infection in a person who has a suggestive clinical syndrome or in asymptomatic individuals who report recent engagement in activities that may put them at high risk of HIV acquisition. Thus, even in the absence of reported high-risk activities, health care providers should have a low threshold for considering a diagnosis of acute HIV infection. Health care visits to the emergency departments provide an opportunity for health care providers to screen for acute or established HIV infection, as well as other sexually transmitted infections. Since 2019, the United States Preventive Services Task Force has recommended routine screening for HIV in adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 years (Grade A recommendation). Testing of remnant blood specimens from an emergency department identified acute HIV infection in approximately 5 of 499 (1%) people presenting with flu-like symptoms, and acute HIV infection was also diagnosed in 7 of 563 (1.2%) people presenting for evaluation of possible mononucleosis with negative heterophile antibody tests. A study of HIV screening in nine emergency departments in six U.S. cities found that a new HIV diagnosis was made in 0.4% of 214,524 adolescents and adults, of whom 14.5% had acute HIV infection. The recommended initial laboratory HIV testing algorithm includes combination immunoassays that detect HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies, as well as HIV p24 antigen (Ag/Ab assays), primarily due to their enhanced ability to detect acute HIV infection. Specimens that are reactive on an initial Ag/Ab assay should be tested with an immunoassay that differentiates HIV-1 from HIV-2 antibodies. Specimens that are reactive on the initial assay and that have either a negative or indeterminate antibody differentiation test result should be tested for a quantitative or qualitative HIV RNA; an undetectable HIV RNA test result indicates that the original Ag/Ab test result was a false positive. Detection of HIV RNA in this setting indicates that acute HIV infection is highly likely. People presenting to care during the earliest days following HIV infection may have yet to develop a positive p24 Ag response, which typically occurs with viral load levels of > 20,000 to 30,000 copies/mL.

### Case report: viral shedding for 60 days in a woman with COVID-19 [^113bymhp]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a public health emergency of international concern. This was first noted in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and since then has become widespread globally. We report a 71-year-old woman with documented viral shedding (based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing) of SARS-CoV-2 for 60 days from the onset of symptoms (55 days from her first positive test and 36 days after complete resolution of symptoms). This is to our knowledge the longest duration of viral shedding reported to date. This case demonstrates that viral shedding after COVID-19 diagnosis can be prolonged.

### Generalized granuloma annulare after COVID-19 vaccination [^111wjQ7U]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 58-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia and bipolar disorder presented to our dermatology clinic because of a 3-month rash, which began 2 weeks after her second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The rash began on her trunk and spread to her upper and lower extremities. She endorsed mild pruritus. Examination revealed multiple papules coalescing into plaques with central clearing on the back, flank, inguinal folds, and extremities (Fig 1). Based on morphology, a diagnosis of generalized GA was favored, and a punch biopsy provided confirmation (Fig 2). Laboratory tests revealed a normal complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function, and hemoglobin A1c; HIV and hepatitis panels were negative. A real-time polymerase chain reaction test result for SARS-CoV-2 was negative. The patient had elevated levels of total cholesterol (299 mg/dL; reference range, < 200 mg/dL) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (196 mg/dL; reference range, < 100 mg/dL). Treatment was initiated with an intramuscular injection of triamcinolone 40 mg and clobetasol 0.05% topical cream with improvement 1 month later, at which point she was started on hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice a day following clearance from an ophthalmologist. At followup 2 months later, there was a reduction and flattening of the skin lesions (Fig 3). She was continued on hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice a day and topical clobetasol. The patient was advised to receive the COVID-19 booster dose through a shared decision-making process, as the benefits of vaccination were deemed to be greater than the possible risk of a GA flare. The patient followed up 2 weeks after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 booster dose, complaining of new lesions, increased itching, and redness of her rash, which started less than a week after the third dose (Fig 4). The patient was instructed to continue her current treatment, and hydroxyzine 25 mg every night at bedtime was prescribed.

### How does post COVID differ from other post-viral conditions in childhood and adolescence (0–20 years old)? A systematic review [^113v68ZT]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Some viral infections are known to cause post-acute infection syndromes, and may represent a considerable healthcare burden, with social and economic consequences for children, adolescents, and their families. The clinical presentation is heterogeneous and includes both physical and psychological symptoms, usually without any specific clinical findings or laboratory abnormalities. The features may vary according to the etiology of the viral infection, individual patient response (complete recovery, relapse, or remitting pattern), and age (younger children being more prone to respiratory symptoms and older children often presenting with chronic fatigue). It can be argued that post-viral syndromes often share a similar symptom profile, irrespective of the involved pathogen. This suggests the potential existence of a common etiopathogenesis. Post-viral fatigue syndrome, also referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome, presents symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, and variable neurological abnormalities. Many viruses have been thought to be associated with post-acute infection syndromes, most commonly Coxsackie viruses, but also Influenza, Varicella, Epstein–Barr, Ebola, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 infection may be followed by a comparable post-acute, long-lasting multi-organ syndrome. The most commonly reported symptoms of Long/post COVID conditions include fatigue, headache, attention disorder, hair loss, cough, chest pain and dyspnea; however, with a lower prevalence in children to young adults as compared to adults. Fatigue is a dominant feature of Long/post COVID, potentially lasting for weeks to months. According to adult data, prolonged illness duration and persistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection will generally resolve within six months or less, except for severe fatigue or post-exertional malaise.

Post COVID-19 conditions became a global concern after the initial acute phase of the pandemic, however little is known about the pathogenesis and long-term clinical course both in adults as well as in children, adolescents and young adults. The overlap between the clinical presentation and course of post COVID and other post-viral conditions highlights the need to review the clinical characteristics, duration of symptoms, and possible healthcare burden in the pediatric population of both entities.

This review aims to systematically describe the available evidence on symptoms persisting beyond acute COVID infection, as compared to other viral infections; to evaluate clinical characteristics, duration, and healthcare burden.

### Case report: dengue and COVID-19 coinfection in Thailand [^116VfZAx]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract.

We report a 50-year-old Thai woman with recent travel to Denmark who presented with acute high-grade fever, vomiting, and myalgia for 1 day. Initial laboratory results revealed leukopenia, elevated aspartate transaminase, and elevated alanine transaminase. Chest radiograph showed no pulmonary infiltration. Reverse transcriptase–PCR (RT-PCR) of the nasopharyngeal swab detected SARS-CoV-2, and RT-PCR of the blood detected dengue virus serotype 2. COVID-19 with dengue fever co-infection was diagnosed. Her symptoms were improved with supportive treatment. Integration of clinical manifestations, history of exposure, laboratory profiles, and dynamic of disease progression assisted the physicians in precise diagnosis. Co-circulating and nonspecific presentations of dengue infection and COVID-19 challenge the healthcare system in tropical countries. To solve this threat, multi-sector strategies are required, including public health policy, development of accurate point-of-care testing, and proper prevention for both diseases.

### Extrapulmonary clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients [^114gqnYF]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology.

According to studies, in most cases, the severity of cutaneous lesions was not correlated with COVID-19 severity. It is considered that viral rashes and drug reactions are clinically and histologically similar, and it is difficult to determine whether these manifestations are related to viral infection or not. Also, it has not been well confirmed that if these dermatological symptoms are caused by a skin infection or the consequences of respiratory infection. According to some theories, it is postulated that viral particles in the cutaneous blood vessels in COVID-19 patients can lead to lymphocytic vasculitis which can be followed by the production of cytokines and damage to the blood vessels in the skin. Following a viral infection, Langerhans cells migrate to the regional lymph nodes to induce dendritic cells. It can result in vasodilation and spongiosis, giving rise to the cutaneous manifestations.SARS-CoV-2 can induce hypoxia leading to the accumulation of deoxygenated blood in venous plexus. This accumulation can cause livedo reticularis-resembling manifestations. Cutaneous adverse events of antimalarials include cutaneous eruptions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, urticaria, pruritus, dry skin, rashes, flares of psoriasis and exfoliating lesions, Stevens‐Johnson–like syndrome, mucocutaneous dyspigmentation, alopecia, and bleaching of hair. Azithromycin can induce cutaneous severe skin reaction associated with fever, angioedema, skin pain, and generalized red or purple skin rashes. Regarding the asymptomatic features of COVID-19, these manifestations can act as an indicator for early diagnosis and prevent further outbreaks of this disease. According to a case report of a COVID-19 patient with cutaneous manifestations, serology tests against anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were negative. However, based on PCR testing of the skin, SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers was detected. Hence, SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing of skin biopsy samples can be used as an additional diagnostic tool.

### Comparison of clinical characteristics and peripheral blood tests of COVID-19 and influenza B patients [^111UDtZN]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the differences in clinical features and routine peripheral blood testing between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and influenza B infection. Patients with COVID-19 and influenza B admitted to our fever clinic from January 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022 were recruited. A total of 607 patients were included (301 with COVID-19 infection and 306 with influenza B infection). The results of a statistical analysis showed that 1) patients with COVID-19 infection were older and had a lower temperature and shorter duration from fever onset to clinic visit than patients with influenza B infection; 2) apart from fever, viral infection symptoms appeared to be more common in patients with influenza B infection than in patients with COVID-19 infection, including sore throat, cough, muscle aches, weeping, headache, fatigue, and diarrhea (P < 0.001); and 3) compared with patients with influenza B infection, patients with COVID-19 infection had higher numbers of white blood cells and neutrophils but lower numbers of red blood cells and lymphocytes (P < 0.001). In summary, several important differences were identified between COVID-19 and influenza B, which may help to guide clinicians in their initial diagnosis of these two respiratory viral infections.

### Surveillance, case investigation and contact tracing for monkeypox [^113om2Ce]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for mpox, more specifically with respect to case definition, WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to define suspected case as a patient meeting all of the following criteria:

- a patient of any age presenting in a mpox non-endemic country with an unexplained acute rash

- **≥ 1 of the following signs or symptoms, since 15 March 2022**: headache, acute onset of fever (> 38.5 °C), lymphadenopathy, myalgia, back pain, profound weakness

- the following common causes of acute rash do not explain the clinical picture: varicella zoster, herpes zoster, measles, herpes simplex, bacterial skin infections, disseminated gonococcal infection, primary or secondary syphilis, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, granuloma inguinale, molluscum contagiosum, allergic reaction (such as to plants) and any other locally relevant common causes of papular or vesicular rash.

### Severe infectious mononucleosis in the older adult: a case report and review of the literature [^112NRcFD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the causative agent for infectious mononucleosis (IM), a diagnosis classically made in adolescence and young adulthood. IM is uncommon later in life generally because of previous exposure. When the disease does affect advanced age groups, diagnostic challenges exist and delays to appropriate treatment may occur.

Case Presentation

An 86-year-old man presented to the emergency department for evaluation of severe generalized weakness for greater than one week. Significant findings in the ED consisted of thrombocytopenia, elevated liver function testing, and atypical lymphocytosis. Infectious Monospot testing was positive. Given his clinical presentation, hospitalization was required. A broad workup in the hospital setting revealed a principal diagnosis of IM based on EBV DNA quantification and EBV IgM positivity. After a weeklong hospital stay, he was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation.

Discussion

This case highlights the importance of considering IM in advanced age groups who are not typically considered classic for the presentation and avoiding diagnostic closure in unrevealing workups. Although IM is rarely reported in patients beyond the third decade of life, our patient's severe fatigue and laboratory findings warranted further evaluation with immunologic studies, clinching the diagnosis.

Conclusion

This report illustrates the need for emergency providers to consider IM in the differential even for older adults given their potential for decompensation.

### Delayed positive COVID19 nasopharyngeal test, a case study with clinical and pathological correlation [^113983Ma]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated in Wuhan, China at end of year 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) has become a global pandemic. In united states, the confirmed COVID 19 cases have surged over 38 million, accounting for 15–20% of the entire world counts. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most commonly used laboratory test for SARS-CoV-2. When performed on upper respiratory swab samples, its sensitivity is reported to be in the range of 60–70%. A considerable proportion of COVID-19 patients may have an initial negative RT-PCR result. Besides the performance characteristic of assays, time of sampling and source of specimen significantly contribute to the "false" negative results. We present a case to discuss one possible pathophysiological explanation, which has not been reported before.

### Metastatic pulmonary dissemination as differential diagnosis of COVID-19 disease [^115La9gP]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 13-year-old boy presented to hospital with 3-day self-limited fever, followed by dry cough, persistent asthenia and impaired general condition of 2 weeks' duration. Blood analyses showed a severe inflammatory status and chest X-ray images were consistent with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia. He developed an acute respiratory failure that required paediatric intensive care admission and non-invasive ventilation. A targeted COVID-19 treatment was initiated with hydroxicloroquine, corticosteroids, enoxaparine and a single dose of tocilizumab. Repeated serological tests and real-time reverse transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. Other infectious pathogens were also ruled out. Thoracic high resolution CT showed an intense bilateral pulmonary dissemination with lytic vertebral bone lesions. After diagnostic investigations, Ewing's sarcoma with metastatic pulmonary dissemination was diagnosed. Nowadays, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 community pandemic, we cannot forget that COVID-19 clinical presentation is not specific and other entities can mimic its clinical features.

Laboratory examinations.

Routine blood test results were as follows: white blood cells, 2.91 × 10⁹/L; neutrophils, 55.7%; lymphocytes, 30.2%; total number of lymphocytes, 0.88 × 10⁹/L; C-reactive protein (CRP), 35.1 mg/L; potassium, 4.3 mmol/L; sodium, 138 mmol/L; urea, 21 mg/dL; D-dimer, 210 ng/mL; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 52 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 117 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 575 U/L; ferritin, 428 ng/mL; international normalized ratio, 1.07; prothrombin time, 11 minutes; total bilirubin, 0.5 mg/dL; and direct bilirubin, 0.2 mg/dL. Cardiac acute damage marker values such as creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB: 3.80 U/L) and troponin (13.6 pg/mL) were among normal reference values at the time of hospital admission.

The patient's baseline serum creatinine (Cr) level was 0.91 mg/dL and baseline serum CK level was 4,267 U/L. Changes in CK, CRP, AST, ALT, LDH, ferritin, and D-dimer during the patient's hospitalization are presented in Table 1.

Table 1
Changes in biochemical markers during the patient's hospitalization

Blood tests for rapid detection of influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B were all negative. Electrocardiogram was normal; no significant cardiac arrhythmia was detected.

Clinical diagnosis.

The patient, who was admitted with frequent complaints of myalgia and fatigue, was diagnosed in the emergency department. Considering the clinical features, physical examination, and chest radiography, the patient was hospitalized with the diagnosis of suspected viral infection. However, considering COVID-19 infection to the epidemic area, atypical pneumonia virus infection had to be ruled out. On the same day, a chest computerized tomography (CT) scan was performed, and small ground-glass nodules were seen, suggesting viral pneumonia scattered across the two lungs (Figure 1). Two days later, a real-time reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of the patient's throat swab sample indicated SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Haemoptysis as the first presentation of COVID-19: a case report [^116g1Lxw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing pandemic that profoundly challenges healthcare systems all over the world. Scientific evidence on this new virus is growing and the clinical characteristics are increasingly understood. Among COVID-19 patients, fever, cough and fatigue are the most commonly reported clinical symptoms. The main reason for hospitalisation is the onset of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Haemoptysis is rarely reported as a symptom of COVID-19. Only very few cases have been described in literature. Here, we report an unusual case of a man who presented with life-threatening haemoptysis as the first and unique symptom of COVID-19.

Case

A previously healthy 33-month-old boy presented to the emergency department with 2 days of fever, emesis, and rash. Examination revealed a tachycardic, interactive toddler with erythematous macules on his thighs. Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription PCR testing was initially negative; the repeat test was indeterminate. SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing was positive. Laboratory findings were remarkable for normal white blood cell count with bandemia and elevated inflammatory markers. Chest radiograph was unremarkable. Cardiac markers were normal; echocardiogram showed trace pericardial effusion. Electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia without improvement with fluid resuscitation. He was admitted to the hospital and treated with empiric antibiotic therapy for 48 hours, IV methylprednisolone, IV immunoglobulin (IVIG), anakinra, prophylactic anticoagulation, and supportive therapy for a presumed diagnosis of MIS-C. The figure depicts the patient's clinical course.

### Back to normal; serological testing for COVID-19 diagnosis unveils missed infections [^113vKTBW]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The gold standard for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) diagnosis has been the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). On the other hand, serological testing for COVID-19 may offer advantages in detecting possibly overlooked infections by NAAT.

Methods

To evaluate seroconversion of NAAT-negative pneumonia patients, immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were semiquantified by an immunofluorescence assay. Seroconversion was confirmed by another serological method, targeting the nucleocapsid protein.

Results

Eight suspected but unconfirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients (median age, 39 years; range, 21–55) were included. The median period between symptom onset and NAAT sample collection was 6 days (2–27days). None of them had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by NAAT. In contrast, all eight patients revealed seropositivity with the two serological methods, indicating actual seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2. The median period between onset and blood sampling was 26.5 days (7–51days).

Conclusion

Eight patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, initially tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by NAAT, were finally confirmed of the diagnosis by serological testing. To cover the whole spectrum of this heterogenous infectious disease, serology testing should be implemented to the multitiered diagnostic algorithm for COVID-19.

### An adolescent with a retropharyngeal swelling: to drain or not to drain? keeping a broad vision during the COVID-19 pandemic [^111xQhny]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Course

The initial differential diagnosis included syphilis, HIV infection, gonorrhea, Kawasaki disease, and MIS-C). Laboratory testing for sexually transmitted diseases produced negative results. Because of the multiorgan involvement, increased infection parameters, negative serology for sexually transmitted diseases, age, and positive SARS-CoV-2 serology, the patient received a diagnosis of MIS-C. After treatment with IV immunoglobulins, colchicine, and acetylsalicylic acid, the clinical situation improved with normalization of body temperature, infection parameters, and disappearance of the dermal abnormalities. Coronary aneurysms were excluded by echocardiography and a coronary CT scan, and the patient was discharged after 6 days of hospitalization. Postoperative outpatient consultations were uneventful except for a little fatigue. Control echocardiography 3 months after discharge revealed no cardiac complications.

Retropharyngeal edema in MIS-C has previously been described; however, we present a case of MIS-C that mimicked a retropharyngeal phlegmon, thereby delaying the diagnostic process. In retrospect, surgery and IV antibiotics were unnecessary, and earlier IV immunoglobulins could have prevented further deterioration. Being acquainted with cues such as dermal abnormalities and multiorgan involvement after a recent history of COVID-19 in children or adolescents could guide physicians in diagnosing MIS-C.

Patient 2

A 8.3-year-old girl referred to our department due to a persistent cough, chest distress for 18 days, and wheezing for 7 days. Simultaneously, the patient's mother and grandmother presented with upper respiratory symptoms and positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests. She has a medical history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and recurrent eczema. She did not receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the past year. On physical exam, mild wheezes were detected upon chest examination and reddish rashes were observed on her right ankle and acrotarsium. Chest CT imaging showed subpleural nodular consolidation with cavitation and adjacent ground-glass opacification (Fig. 1 B). Hence, SARS-CoV-2 infection and pulmonary vasculitis were considered. Routine blood and urine tests were clinically normal. Repeated nasopharyngeal swabs for PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 were negative, however, antibody testing was positive for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. BALF cultures for bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria were negative. The levels of serum immunoglobulin were in normal ranges. The D-dimer level was normal (0.05 mg/L). Clinical workup for autoimmune disorders were all negative. Further skin biopsies were taken, which showed thickening of vascular walls with infiltration of lymphocytes, neutrophils, histocytes, nuclear dust, and scattered extravascular red blood cells, which demonstrated small vasculitis (Supplementary Fig. 1A), the diagnose of pulmonary vasculitis arose.

She received intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/d) therapy, followed by oral prednisone, which were effective for symptom relief and the gradual resolution of pulmonary lesions. One month after discharge the whole exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous splicing mutation (c.61 + 1G > A) in the TNFRSF13B gene (ACMG: Pathogenic, GnomAD-All-None, PVS1 + PM2), which is associated with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). The patient received corticosteroids for a total of 6 months. Currently, treatment has been discontinued for 9 months without evidence of recurrence.

### Characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) confirmed using an IgM-IgG antibody test [^111rpuiZ]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by a novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly developed into a pandemic since it was first reported in December 2019. Nucleic acid testing is the standard method for the diagnosis of viral infections. However, this method reportedly has a low positivity rate. To increase the sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnoses, we developed an IgM-IgG combined assay and tested it in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 56 patients were enrolled in this study and SARS-CoV-2 was detected by using both IgM-IgG antibody and nucleic acid tests. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Our findings suggest that patients who develop severe illness might experience longer virus exposure times and develop a more severe inflammatory response. The IgM-IgG test is an accurate and sensitive diagnostic method. A combination of nucleic acid and IgM-IgG testing is a more sensitive and accurate approach for diagnosis and early treatment of COVID-19.

Case 4

A 10-year-old girl presented with fever and itching skin rash from 5 days prior to admission. One day before admission, her general condition worsened; she got toxic and cough, abdominal pain, generalized edema and oliguria developed. The maculopapular and target shape skin rashes appeared with more accumulation around the neck, trunk, and axillary. Mucous membranes were intact except for bilateral conjunctivitis and cracked lips. She had a history of COVID-19 in family members. Physical examination at admission revealed the following: body temperature, 39.4 °C; pulse, 120 beats/min; respiration, 36 breaths/min; blood pressure, 66/40 mmHg; and oxygen saturation, 90%. Laboratory evaluation revealed anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and impaired renal function tests (Table 1). According to hypotension and shock, vasoactive drugs in addition to meropenem, clindamycin, vancomycin, IVIG, packed cell, and albumin prescribed (Table 1). The hemodynamic status of the patient stabilized after 3 days. Liver transaminases, PT, PTT, CPK, troponin, LDH, fibrin degradation products (FDP), C3, C4, and total hemolytic complement (CH50) were in a normal range. Antistreptolysin O, antiphospholipid antibody, and antinuclear antibody (ANA) were negative too. Blood and urine culture were also negative. Chest roentgenogram (CXR) and CT-scan were normal on the first admission day. COVID-19 RT-PCR test result was negative but COVID-19 immunoglobulin G (IgG) test was positive 7 days following admission. On day 3, edema, severe pain of right lower extremity, and venous stasis appeared due to central venous catheter insertion in the right femoral vein. Color Doppler ultrasonography of lower limb veins was normal. Enoxaparin was started as prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Chest CT-scan on the fourth day showed COVID-19 compatible changes with mild bilateral pleural effusion. The urinary system was normal in ultrasonography. Echocardiography was performed for three times and showed mild tricuspid regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary insufficiency, with normal ejection fraction and coronary arteries. Fever eased 4 days after admission, vitamin D, and zinc gluconate were added to the patient's drugs. The general condition improved and vasoactive drugs tapered gradually. After 11 days, the patient was discharged with complete improvement.

### From telemedicine to the ICU-fever and rash in a 9-year-old girl [^112eQ5mZ]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

A 9-year-old girl presented to her primary care pediatrician via telemedicine during the initial months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic because of 4 days of warmth perceived by her mother, decreased energy, and a new rash on her upper extremities. After 10 additional days of documented fever > 38°C, worsening fatigue, and 1 day of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, she was allowed to schedule an in-person visit with her pediatrician after testing negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. She appeared ill on arrival to clinic, and her pediatrician recommended evaluation in an emergency department. Her initial laboratory testing revealed nonspecific elevation in several inflammatory markers and leukopenia, and she responded well to intravenous hydration. Over the next 2 weeks, her fever persisted, constitutional symptoms worsened, and she developed progressively painful cervical lymphadenopathy and pancytopenia. She was evaluated in clinic by several specialists and eventually was urged to present to the emergency department again, at which time she was admitted to the PICU. After consulting additional specialists and waiting for laboratory results, the team reached a definitive diagnosis and initiated therapy; however, she experienced rapid clinical decline shortly thereafter. The specialists who assisted with identification of the underlying etiology of her symptoms were able to work together to manage the subsequent complications.

### A 29-year-old woman with flu-like symptoms: review of influenza diagnosis and treatment [^117QQUns]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Peaks of seasonal influenza activity occur annually in many countries, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Using the case of Ms R, a 29-year-old woman who presented with acute onset of respiratory symptoms and was evaluated for influenza, considerations regarding symptoms and signs, evaluation, treatment, and prevention of influenza are discussed. Symptoms of influenza can be similar to those of other respiratory viruses, making diagnosis challenging. Laboratory testing should be reserved for patients who are seriously ill or for whom test results may affect management or have public health implications. For most cases of influenza, treatment is supportive and specific antiviral medication is not needed. Annual vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection. Educating patients on practical steps to reduce the spread of influenza in the community is critical.

### Development and clinical application of a rapid IgM-IgG combined antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis [^116tqowh]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

However, these efforts are limited by one hard problem: how to differentiate the COVID‐19 cases from the healthy. For confirmed COVID‐19 cases, reported common clinical symptoms include fever, cough, myalgia, or fatigue. Yet these symptoms are not unique features of COVID‐19 because these symptoms are similar to that of other virus‐infected diseases such as influenza. Currently, virus nucleic acid real‐time polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), CT imaging, and some hematology parameters are the primary tools for clinical diagnosis of the infection. Many laboratory test kits have been developed and used in testing patient specimens for COVID‐19 by Chinese CDC, US CDC, and other private companies. The virus nucleic acid RT‐PCR test has become the current standard diagnostic method for the diagnosis of COVID‐19. Yet these RT‐PCR test kits suffer from many limitations: (1) These tests have long turnaround times and are complicated in operation; they generally take on average over 2 to 3 hours to generate results. (2) The PCR tests require certified laboratories, expensive equipment, and trained technicians to operate. (3) There are some numbers of false negatives for RT‐PCR of COVID‐19. These limitations make RT‐PCR unsuitable for use in the field for rapid and simple diagnosis and screening of patients. It limits the outbreak containment effort. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a rapid, simple to use, sensitive, and accurate test to quickly identify infected patients of SARS‐CoV‐2 to prevent virus transmission and to assure timely treatment of patients.

### Infant Kawasaki disease complicated with supraventricular tachycardia: a case report and literature review [^114y6uFM]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

On June 21, 2023, a 6-month-old and 13-day-old male infant was brought to the Emergency Department of West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, due to an unexplained persistent fever for 4 days and mild cough. Blood cell examination revealed a significant increase in white blood cells (WBC count of 16.6 × 10⁹/L, normal range 4.03–11.09 × 10⁹/L; neutrophils percentage 73.1%), normal hemoglobin (133 g/L, normal range 108–144 g/L), normal platelet count (398 × 10⁹/L, normal range 128–420 × 10⁹/L), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP 42.1 mg/L, normal range 0–8 mg/L). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated (54 mm/h, normal range < 25 mm/h). Initial assessment suggested that the fever might be caused by an acute upper respiratory tract infection, and ceftriaxone was administered for 2 days. However, he had a persistent high fever without any significant worsening of infection symptoms (only mild cough and diarrhea). On the 6th day of illness, new symptoms appeared, including generalized congestive rash, conjunctival congestion without exudate, flushed and chapped lips, limb swelling, enlarged lymph nodes in the right neck, and redness at the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination site. Breath sounds in both lungs were symmetrical, with no rales. The abdomen was soft, and the liver and spleen were not palpable or enlarged, and neurological examination showed negative pathological signs. These symptoms were typical clinical manifestations of KD. Due to a fever persisting for more than five days, no response to antimicrobial treatment, and the manifestation of six clinical symptoms that meeting with the diagnostic criteria for complete KD, in conjunction with elevated ESR, WBC, and CRP levels, we are considering a diagnosis of KD. Further examinations revealed a significant increase in WBC (WBC count of 15.4 × 10⁹/L, neutrophils 59.2%), a slight decrease in hemoglobin (106 g/L), a slight increase in platelet count (430 × 10⁹/L), and elevation of CRP (55.5 mg/L). Liver enzymes were markedly elevated (Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) 280U/L, normal range < 49U/L; Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) 231U/L, normal range < 40U/L). Electrolyte levels were within normal ranges (Na +, K +, Ca 2+). Cardiac injury markers were within normal limits (cTnI, CK-MB, Myoglobin). Further, infectious diseases and other immune diseases were excluded by pathogen-specific examinations such as respiratory pathogen tests, stool routine and culture, blood culture, sputum culture, and serological testing for autoantibodies. Two novel coronavirus nucleic acid tests were negative (ruling out the possibility of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children - MIS-C). The echocardiogram revealed the presence of a small coronary artery aneurysm in the left coronary artery (LCA = 2.7 mm, Z-score = 3.27), dilation in the left anterior descending artery (LAD = 2.0 mm, Z-score = 2.01), while the left circumflex artery and right coronary artery showed normal dimensions (LCX = 1.7 mm, Z-score = 1.52; RCA = 2.0 mm, Z-score = 1.94). The dimensions of the atria and ventricles were normal, and both systolic and diastolic functions of the heart appeared normal.

### Vaping-associated lung injury during COVID-19 multisystem inflammatory syndrome outbreak [^114mZ4rq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) is a complex inflammatory syndrome predominantly seen in adolescents and young adults. The clinical and laboratory profile can easily mimic infectious and noninfectious conditions. The exclusion of these conditions is essential to establish the diagnosis. Recently, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic introduced the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). MIS-C knowledge is evolving. The current criteria to establish the diagnosis are not specific and have overlapping features with EVALI, making the accurate diagnosis a clinical challenge during continued COVID-19 transmission within the community.

Case Report

Three young adults evaluated at our emergency department for prolonged fever and gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms were initially assessed for possible MIS-C due to epidemiologic links to COVID-19 and were eventually diagnosed with EVALI. The clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics of both entities are explored, as well as the appropriate medical management. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Physician awareness of overlapping and differentiating EVALI and MIS-C features is essential to direct appropriate diagnostic evaluation and medical management of adolescents and young adults presenting with systemic inflammatory response during the unfolding pandemic of COVID-19.

### Evidence of gender differences in the diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 patients: an analysis of electronic health records using natural language processing and machine learning [^114oM84f]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: The impact of sex and gender in the incidence and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains controversial. Here, we aim to describe the characteristics of COVID-19 patients at disease onset, with special focus on the diagnosis and management of female patients with COVID-19. Methods: We explored the unstructured free text in the electronic health records (EHRs) within the SESCAM Healthcare Network (Castilla La-Mancha, Spain). The study sample comprised the entire population with available EHRs (1,446,452 patients) from January 1st to May 1st, 2020. We extracted patients' clinical information upon diagnosis, progression, and outcome for all COVID-19 cases. Results: A total of 4,780 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified. Of these, 2,443 (51%) were female, who were on average 1.5 years younger than male patients (61.7 ± 19.4 vs. 63.3 ± 18.3, p = 0.0025). There were more female COVID-19 cases in the 15–59-year-old interval, with the greatest sex ratio (95% confidence interval) observed in the 30–39-year-old range (1.69; 1.35–2.11). Upon diagnosis, headache, anosmia, and ageusia were significantly more frequent in females than males. Imaging by chest X-ray or blood tests were performed less frequently in females (65.5% vs. 78.3% and 49.5% vs. 63.7%, respectively), all p < 0.001. Regarding hospital resource use, females showed less frequency of hospitalization (44.3% vs. 62.0%) and intensive care unit admission (2.8% vs. 6.3%) than males, all p < 0.001. Conclusion: Our results indicate important sex-dependent differences in the diagnosis, clinical manifestation, and treatment of patients with COVID-19. These results warrant further research to identify and close the gender gap in the ongoing pandemic.

### Analysis of 4 cases of children with false-positive results of novel coronavirus-specific antibody [^117X39hB]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Case 2

A male child, 14 months old, was admitted to the Department of cardiology for a chief complaint of "fever for 7 days, rash for 3 days, red eye for 2 days" and was clinically diagnosed with mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. EDTA anticoagulated plasma samples were examined for 2019-nCoV IgM/IgG antibodies using reagents A and B, respectively. The results were both IgM (+) and IgG (-). Meanwhile, the child's coagulation function test showed a significantly elevated fibrinogen (FiB) concentration of 5.57 g/L. However, after the removal of FiB, the results were all IgM (-) and IgG (-). On July 8, 2020, the protein mass spectrometry result returned negative. After treatment, the patient's plasma sample was reexamined. Moreover, the results from both kits were IgM (-) and IgG (-). Also, the FiB level was 2.82 g/L on the same day. Our analysis believed an increased FiB level could cause false-positive results.

Case 3

A female child, 4 years and 1-month-old was diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis due to "fever, rash for 6 days, nasal congestion and snoring for 4 days" in the outpatient clinic. The patient's peripheral blood serum samples were tested for 2019-nCoV IgM/IgG antibodies using reagents A and B, respectively. Furthermore, the results were all IgM (+) and IgG (-). Moreover, the percentage of heterogeneous lymphocytes in the peripheral blood was 18%, EBV-DNA was positive, and EBV capsid antibody IgM was > 160 (positive), all of which led to the diagnosis of EB virus infection. The protein mass spectrometry result returned negative. After treatment, the patient's serum sample was reexamined, and the test results from both kits were IgM (-) and IgG (-). In our analysis, we believed the false-positive result could be caused by an elevated heterophile antibody (HA) level.

### Subacute thyroiditis after sars-COV-2 infection [^116sZiHr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is a thyroid disease of viral or postviral origin. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that began in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly worldwide and Italy has been severely affected by this outbreak.

Objectives

The objective of this work is to report the first case of SAT related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods

We describe the clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of an 18-year-old woman who came to our attention for fever, neck pain radiated to the jaw, and palpitations occurring 15 days after a SARS-CoV-2-positive oropharyngeal swab. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had been mild and the patient had completely recovered in a few days.

Results

At physical examination the patient presented with a slightly increased heart rate and a painful and enlarged thyroid on palpation. At laboratory exams free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine were high, thyrotropin undetectable, and inflammatory markers and white blood cell count elevated. Bilateral and diffuse hypoechoic areas were detected at neck ultrasound. One month earlier, thyroid function and imaging both were normal. We diagnosed SAT and the patient started prednisone. Neck pain and fever recovered within 2 days and the remaining symptoms within 1 week. Thyroid function and inflammatory markers normalized in 40 days.

Conclusions

We report the first case of SAT after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We alert clinicians to additional and unreported clinical manifestations associated with COVID-19.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a new contagious respiratory disease associated with a novel coronavirus, has spread worldwide and become a global health concern after its first outbreak in Guangdong Province of the People's Republic of China in November 2002. The clinical presentation and the radiologic, hematologic, biochemical, and microbiologic findings of a 56-day-old male infant with SARS are described. Some clinical and laboratory features are similar to those reported in adult and pediatric patients. However, this infant had a more severe clinical course as compared with the older children. This is the youngest patient with symptomatic SARS reported to date.

### Fatigue in adults: evaluation and management [^115G7o22]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Fatigue is among the top 10 reasons patients visit primary care offices, and it significantly affects patients' well-being and occupational safety. A comprehensive history and cardiopulmonary, neurologic, and skin examinations help guide the workup and diagnosis. Fatigue can be classified as physiologic, secondary, or chronic. Physiologic fatigue can be addressed by proper sleep hygiene, a healthy diet, and balancing energy expenditure. Secondary fatigue is improved by treating the underlying condition. Cognitive behavior therapy, exercise therapy, and acupuncture may help with some of the fatigue associated with chronic conditions. Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic, severe, and potentially debilitating disorder with demonstrated inflammatory, neurologic, immunologic, and metabolic abnormalities. ME/CFS has a poor prognosis, with no proven treatment or cure. It may become more common after the COVID-19 pandemic because many patients with long COVID (post-COVID-19 condition) have symptoms similar to ME/CFS. The most important symptom of ME/CFS is postexertional malaise. The 2015 National Academy of Medicine diagnostic criteria diagnose ME/CFS. Exercise can be harmful to patients with ME/CFS because it can trigger postexertional malaise. Patients should be educated about pacing their activity not to exceed their limited energy capacity. Treatment should prioritize comorbidities and symptoms based on severity.

### A unique presentation of delirium in a patient with otherwise asymptomatic COVID-19 [^116hGxWF]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), manifests with a wide spectrum of presentations. Most reports of COVID-19 highlight fever and upper respiratory symptoms as the dominant initial presentations, consistent with the World Health Organization guidelines regarding suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, atypical presentations of this disease have been evolving since the initial outbreak of the pandemic in December 2019. We report a case of an older male patient who presented at our hospital with an unusual manifestation of COVID-19.

Design

Brief report.

Setting

A university hospital in Saudi Arabia.

Participant

A 73-year-old man who presented with confusion in the absence of any respiratory symptoms or fever.

Intervention

The patient was initially admitted with delirium and underwent a further work-up.

Measurements

Given his recent history of domestic travel and the declaration of a global COVID-19 pandemic status, the patient was administered a swab test for SARS-CoV-2.

Results

The patient's positive test led to a diagnosis of COVID-19. Although he began to experience a spiking fever and mild upper respiratory symptoms, he recovered rapidly with no residual sequela.

Conclusion

The recognition of atypical presentations of COVID-19 infection, such as delirium, is critical to the timely diagnosis, provision of appropriate care, and avoidance of outbreaks within healthcare facilities during this pandemic. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:1382–1384, 2020.

### Haemoptysis as the first presentation of COVID-19: a case report [^116VekWo]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an ongoing pandemic that profoundly challenges healthcare systems all over the world. Fever, cough and fatigue are the most commonly reported clinical symptoms.

Case Presentation

A 58-year-old man presented at the emergency department with acute onset haemoptysis. On the fifth day after admission, he developed massive haemoptysis. Computed tomography (CT) angiography of the chest revealed alveolar haemorrhage, more prominent in the left lung. Flexible bronchoscopy confirmed bleeding from the left upper lobe, confirmed by a bronchial arteriography, which was successfully embolized. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) tested for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) repeatedly returned negative. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 was eventually detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid.

Conclusions

Life-threatening haemoptysis is an unusual presentation of COVID-19, reflecting alveolar bleeding as a rare but possible complication. This case emphasises the added value of bronchoscopy with BAL in the diagnostic work-up in case of high clinical suspicion and negative serial NPS in patients presenting with severe symptoms.

### Analysis of the diagnostic value of serum specific antibody testing for coronavirus disease 2019 [^1142N2x1]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread to various regions worldwide. As of 27 April 2020, according to real-time statistics released by the World Health Organization, there have been 84341 confirmed cases and 4643 deaths in China, with more than 2979484 confirmed cases and 206450 deaths outside China. The detection of antibodies produced during the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections has become an important laboratory method for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, at present, a little research on these specific antibodies has been conducted. In this study, a retrospective analysis was used to explore the dynamic changes of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibody and factors affecting diagnostic efficacy, so as to provide a theoretical basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

### Mass psychogenic illness: role of the individual physician [^1115yhJA]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Mass psychogenic illness is characterized by symptoms, occurring among a group of persons with shared beliefs regarding those symptoms, that suggest organic illness but have no identifiable environmental cause and little clinical or laboratory evidence of disease. Mass psychogenic illness typically affects adolescents or children, groups under stress and females disproportionately more than males. Symptoms often follow an environmental trigger or illness in an index case. They can spread rapidly by apparent visual transmission, may be aggravated by a prominent emergency or media response, and frequently resolve after patients are separated from each other and removed from the environment in which the outbreak began. Physicians should consider this diagnosis when faced with a cluster of unexplained acute illness.

### A prospective observational study of post-COVID-19 chronic fatigue syndrome following the first pandemic wave in Germany and biomarkers associated with symptom severity [^1129LAzf]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We report here on the first results of our ongoing prospective observational cohort study initiated at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin in August 2020 to characterize patients with persistent fatigue and exertion intolerance following mild to moderate COVID-19 according to WHO criteria and to assess whether they meet diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. Our study is a substudy of the Pa-COVID-19 study, a prospective observational cohort study assessing pathophysiology and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 at Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin. This detailed description includes clinical characteristics and biomarker findings of patients from the first pandemic wave suffering from post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) at six months following COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients had COVID-19 between March and June 2020 when there were no variants of SARS-CoV-2 reported in our region. Due to the complexity of symptoms, patients were comprehensively evaluated by a team of medical professionals from various disciplines including clinical immunology, rheumatology, neurology, cardiology, endocrinology, and pulmonology with long-standing experience in diagnosing ME/CFS. We hypothesized that COVID-19 can lead to a persistent fatigue syndrome which fulfills diagnostic criteria of ME/CFS and that patients suffering from ME/CFS display specific characteristics. Our findings confirm initial concerns that COVID-19 leads to persistent fatigue syndromes in a subset of young individuals following mild to moderate infectious disease.

### Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma, version 3.2021 [^113gymPY]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma — history, physical, and laboratory workup should include determination of B symptoms defined as unexplained recurrent fevers > 38°C within the last month, drenching night sweats within the last month, and weight loss of > 10% of body weight within 6 months of diagnosis, with examination of lymphoid regions and spleen. Essential tests include complete blood count with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and/or C‑reactive protein, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. A pregnancy test should be performed before individuals of childbearing potential undergo treatment, and HIV and hepatitis B and C testing are encouraged for patients with risk factors for HIV or unusual disease presentations. An immunodeficiency workup should also be considered for patients < 5 years of age, those with recurrent infections, those with an atypical presentation, and those with a personal or family history of immunodeficiency.

### The diagnostic value of peripheral blood lymphocyte testing in children with infectious mononucleosis [^117XvUps]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

This study had some limitations. First, this was a single-center study with a relatively small population. Secondly, the correlation between CD8 + and CD4+/CD8 + ratios and the severity of IM or other factors were not compared or analyzed.

In summary, CD8 + and CD4+/CD8 + ratios demonstrate excellent specificity and sensitivity for IM diagnosis and peripheral blood lymphocyte testing provides a novel laboratory basis for the early and accurate clinical diagnosis of IM. It provides clinicians a reliable and sensitive tool for diagnosing IM, especially in cases where the clinical symptoms are non typical or complex. By incorporating peripheral blood lymphocyte testing into the diagnostic workflow, clinicians can improve their diagnostic accuracy and confidence, leading to earlier intervention and more effective patient management. Furthermore, the standardization of diagnostic criteria using these biomarkers has the potential to facilitate research and clinical trials, enabling the development of more targeted and effective therapies for IM.

:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Relevant patient history|- Presence of gravity-dependent edema <br/> - Fever episodes, pain, abdominal discomfort, fatigue <br/> - Risk factors for secondary causes, such as sickle cell disease, HIV, SLE, hepatitis B, malaria, parvovirus B19, and medications, especially in patients from endemic areas before starting immunosuppressant medications <br/> - Screen for tuberculosis|

### Use of the lymphocyte count as a diagnostic screen in adults with suspected Epstein-Barr virus infectious mononucleosis [^1135R8Ys]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To evaluate the predictive diagnostic accuracy of the lymphocyte count in Epstein-Barr virus-related infectious mononucleosis (IM).

Study Design

Retrospective case note and blood results review within a university-affiliated teaching hospital.

Methods

A retrospective review of 726 patients undergoing full blood count and Monospot testing was undertaken. Monospot testing outcomes were compared with the lymphocyte count, examining for significant statistical correlations.

Results

With a lymphocyte count of ≤ 4 × 10⁹/L, 99% of patients had an associated negative Monospot result (sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 94%). A group subanalysis of the population older than 18 years with a lymphocyte count ≤ 4 × 10⁹/L revealed that 100% were Monospot negative (sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97%). A lymphocyte count of ≤ 4 × 10⁹/L correlated significantly with a negative Monospot result.

Conclusions

A lymphocyte count of ≤ 4 × 10(9) /L appears to be a highly reliable predictor of a negative Monospot result, particularly in the population aged > 18 years. Pediatric patients, and adults with strongly suggestive symptoms and signs of IM, should still undergo Monospot testing. However, in adults with more subtle symptoms and signs, representing the vast majority, Monospot testing should be restricted to those with a lymphocyte count > 4 × 10(9) /L.

### A mercury toxicity case complicated by hyponatremia and abnormal endocrinological test results [^114nuodk]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Mercury (Hg) poisoning is considered a rare disease by the National Institutes of Health and the diagnosis can present great challenges to clinicians. Children who are exposed to Hg can present with a wide variety of symptoms, including acrodynia, tremor, excessive salivation, and psychiatric symptoms, including insomnia. However, endocrinologic manifestations from Hg exposure are less well known. This is a case report of a 12-year-old boy who presented with body rash, irritability, insomnia, and profuse sweating after returning from a summer camp. The child was initially managed in the outpatient setting, and the investigation was mainly targeted toward infectious etiology, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease. He was eventually admitted to the hospital with altered mental status and was noted to have hyponatremia with serum sodium of 121 mEq/L. Thyroid studies also revealed elevated free thyroxine levels in the presence of normal triiodothyronine and thyrotropin. The patient developed hypertension and tachycardia, and was found to have elevated 24-hour vanillylmandelic acid and metanephrines. Finally, heavy metal measurements revealed a blood Hg level that was greater than the reference values of 0 to 9 ng/mL. Chelation treatment with 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate was subsequently initiated and over a period of 8 months his symptoms resolved and his thyroid function test returned to normal. This case highlights some of the challenges commonly encountered in identifying Hg exposure. More importantly, it illustrates that exposure to Hg should be considered in children who present with the symptoms and abnormal endocrinologic test results described in this report.

Results

Clinical Course and Factors Associated With Severe COVID-19

Of 308 patients with ALL/LLy who were receiving therapy during the study period, 110 (36%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a median age of 8.2 (IQR, 5.3–14.5) years. Sixty-eight of these patients (62%) were male, 42 (38%) were female, 24 (22%) were of African American or Black race, 17 (15%) were Hispanic, 89 (81%) had non-Hispanic ethnicity, and 81 (74%) were of White race (Table 1). Compared with those without SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were older at the diagnosis of ALL/LLy (median age, 6.7 [IQR, 3.7–12.8] vs 5.3 [IQR, 3.0–10.5] years) and more likely to be of Hispanic or unspecified ethnicity. Most patients had mild to moderate illness (62 [56%]) (Table 2). Seventeen SARS-CoV-2 infections (16%) were detected on asymptomatic screening. Seven patients (6%) met criteria for severe COVID-19, 6 of them presenting before the less virulent Omicron variant became the dominant strain in the US (before December 27, 2021) (Figure; eTable 1 in Supplement 1).

### Chronic fatigue syndrome after infectious mononucleosis in adolescents [^113i3fEX]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal was to characterize prospectively the course and outcome of chronic fatigue syndrome in adolescents during a 2-year period after infectious mononucleosis.

Methods

A total of 301 adolescents (12–18 years of age) with infectious mononucleosis were identified and screened for nonrecovery 6 months after infectious mononucleosis by using a telephone screening interview. Nonrecovered adolescents underwent a medical evaluation, with follow-up screening 12 and 24 months after infectious mononucleosis. After blind review, final diagnoses of chronic fatigue syndrome at 6, 12, and 24 months were made by using established pediatric criteria.

Results

Six, 12, and 24 months after infectious mononucleosis, 13%, 7%, and 4% of adolescents, respectively, met the criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Most individuals recovered with time; only 2 adolescents with chronic fatigue syndrome at 24 months seemed to have recovered or had an explanation for chronic fatigue at 12 months but then were reclassified as having chronic fatigue syndrome at 24 months. All 13 adolescents with chronic fatigue syndrome 24 months after infectious mononucleosis were female and, on average, they reported greater fatigue severity at 12 months. Reported use of steroid therapy during the acute phase of infectious mononucleosis did not increase the risk of developing chronic fatigue syndrome.

Conclusions

Infectious mononucleosis may be a risk factor for chronic fatigue syndrome in adolescents. Female gender and greater fatigue severity, but not reported steroid use during the acute illness, were associated with the development of chronic fatigue syndrome in adolescents. Additional research is needed to determine other predictors of persistent fatigue after infectious mononucleosis.

### Accuracy of signs, symptoms, and hematologic parameters for the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114hfSRB]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The accuracy of individual symptoms, signs, and several easily obtainable hematologic parameters for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis (IM) still needs to be confirmed. Improving the diagnosis of IM based on the clinical findings could prompt physicians to identify better which patients need a diagnostic test for IM. This study performed a systematic review to determine the accuracy of symptoms, signs, and hematologic parameters in patients with suspected IM that used heterophile antibody test or viral capsid antigen tests as the reference standard.

Methods

The PubMed database was searched for all relevant articles. Two reviewers reviewed all studies in parallel and assessed the quality of the selected studies using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) criteria. The pooled measures of diagnostic performance were calculated by bivariate meta-analysis for each clinical finding, which included sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, the diagnostic odds ratios, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

Results

Seventeen studies were included in our final analysis. The prevalence of IM ranged from 2.1% to 80% among prospective cohort studies. The presence of splenomegaly (positive likelihood ratio [LR+], 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–5.51), palatal petechiae (LR+, 1.32–11.40), posterior cervical lymphadenopathy (LR+, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.45–5.20), and axillary or inguinal cervical lymphadenopathy (LR+, 3.05; 95 CI, 1.85–4.70) were moderately useful for ruling in IM. The most helpful hematologic parameters for ruling in IM include lymphocytes greater than 4 × 10⁹/L and greater than 40% to 50%, or atypical lymphocytes greater than 40%. A combination of lymphocytes greater than 50% and atypical lymphocytes greater than 10% (LR+, 50.40; 95% CI, 8.43–162) was also found to be helpful to rule in disease. Most of the clinical findings have limited diagnostic value in ruling out the disease when absent.

Conclusions

Although most symptoms and signs were unhelpful, the likelihood of IM is appreciably increased by several examination findings. Hematologic parameters were more accurate than symptoms and signs. Since most clinical findings have limited diagnostic value in ruling out the disease, physicians should not rely on the absence of any individual symptom or clinical sign for ruling out IM.

### Assessment of psychosocial aspects in adults in post-COVID-19 condition: the EURONET-SOMA recommendations on core outcome domains for clinical and research use [^111CQGwq]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The bodily distress syndrome (BDS) checklist with its 25 items is a screening tool for functional somatic disorder. Functional somatic disorder is a relatively new umbrella term suggested by the EURONET-SOMA group for conditions involving persistent and burdensome physical symptoms that cannot be understood as purely somatic or purely mental. If the BDS indicates that a functional somatic disorder is already present or suspected, further diagnostics and treatment may be necessary. The BDS checklist can also be used as a measure of physical symptom burden. Numeric Rating Scales (NRS) as recommended by the EURONET-SOMA group can be used for the efficient assessment of symptom intensity and symptom interference.

Although the PHQ-15 (or the SSS-8) allows for measuring tiredness or fatigue, a more specific instrument for assessing fatigue seems appropriate since fatigue is a prevalent and disabling symptom in individuals suffering from post-COVID-19 condition. Fatigue is a cardinal post-COVID-19 condition symptom, the most common symptom 6 to 12 months after acute infection and one of the major causes of substantial interference with daily life in post-COVID-19 condition patients. One established instrument for assessing fatigue is the Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS), which comprises 11 items. Each item is answered on a 4-point scale from the asymptomatic to maximum symptomology. The CFS covers the severity of physical and mental fatigue, has good psychometric properties, and has been utilized in clinical and non-clinical samples as well as in several studies on post-COVID-19 condition, making it valuable tool for accurately and efficiently assessing fatigue in post-COVID-19 condition patients. Fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM) assessment are also of particular interest due to the overlapping symptoms with myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/ CFS). A questionnaire explicitly assessing PEM is the DePaul Post-Exertional Malaise Questionnaire (DSQ-PEM); this 5-item questionnaire assesses the frequency and severity of PEM during the last 6 months.

### Underestimation of invasive meningococcal disease in Italy [^114zK4Eu]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Case 1

A 20-year-old, previously healthy woman had sudden onset of high fever with chills and general malaise. The next day, her general condition rapidly deteriorated. She was then referred to the emergency department but died on the way to the hospital. A diagnosis of sudden death was made; no blood test was performed. A few years later, autoptic specimens (formalin-fixed lung, kidney, and adrenal gland tissue) were tested (for legal reasons) at the Immunology and Infectious Disease Laboratory of the Anna Meyer Children's Hospital by using rPCR; all specimens were found to be positive for N. meningitidis serogroup B.

Case 2

A 5-month-old male infant was found dead in his crib. In the preceding days, he had shown poor feeding and irritability. He was born from healthy, nonconsanguineous parents at the end of a normal pregnancy. In accordance with the national diagnostic protocol for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), an autopsy was performed. Autoptic samples (i.e. formalin-fixed lung, kidney, brain, and adrenal gland tissue) for diagnosis of infectious diseases were immediately transferred to the Immunology and Infectious Disease Laboratory, where rPCR showed the presence of N. meningitidis serogroup C in all the specimens.

Case 3

A 17-year-old male adolescent was admitted to the hospital with fever, diarrhea, vomiting, purpuric rash, and lethargy, symptoms that had manifested suddenly during the preceding 6 hours. He had a normal clinical history and a normal history of school attendance, and he had participated in sports. Blood tests performed on his arrival showed a high leukocyte count (> 70,000 cells/μL) and a low platelet count (< 38,000/μL). He died in the hospital 1 hour after his arrival. During the following days, all culture-based test results were negative, and a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia resulting in death was made. Three days after his death, a family member was admitted to the hospital with a similar clinical signs and symptoms. The pathologist in charge of postmortem examination for the first patient was immediately alerted so that an infectious disease diagnosis could be considered. The pathologist decided to send formalin-fixed tissue samples to the Immunology and Infectious Disease Laboratory. Blood samples from the second patient were also sent, and rPCR results led to a diagnosis of N. meningitidis group C infection in both patients.

### Twelve out of 117 recovered COVID-19 patients retest positive in a single-center study of China [^113n3DTY]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

2.2 Procedures

All the patients with COVID-19 selected in this study need to meet the diagnostic criteria according to the World Health Organization interim guidance. Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 was done by real-time RT-PCR of sputum, throat-swab specimens or feces collected from patients. For the patients with expectoration, sputum test was carried out, while for the patients without expectoration, throat swab specimens and feces were taken. Among the 12 patients retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 8 were performed with sputum specimens, and the other 4 were performed with feces. Laboratory confirmation by real-time RT-PCR was done in two different institutions: the Chinese CDC laboratory and in Affiliated Yueqing Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. RT-PCR detection reagents were provided by Shanghai BioGerm Medical Biotechnology Co. Ltd. The primers sequences were as follows: forward primer 5′- CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA-3′; reverse primer 5′- ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA-3′. Conditions for the amplifications were 50 °C for 15 min, 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Other respiratory viruses were all be excluded, including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H7N9), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, SARS coronavirus, and MERS coronavirus. The selected patients need to complete the examination when they are on admission, including complete blood count, procalcitonin, hypersensitive C-reactive protein, T lymphocyte subsets, coagulation profile, serum biochemical tests (including liver and renal function, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase), myocardial enzymes, arterial blood gas analysis and chest CT scan. COVID-19 patients who met the discharge criteria were isolated after discharge and asked to be reviewed by RT-PCR in Affiliated Yueqing Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University within 1–2 weeks. Patients with positive RT-PCR were divided into positive group and patients with negative RT-PCR were divided into negative group.

2.3 Data collection

We collected demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics, and treatments data from electronic medical records database of Affiliated Yueqing Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Clinical data were followed from January 2020 to March 2020. Three researchers (HY, CZ and LY) reviewed the data collection forms to double check the data collected independently.

### Immune thrombocytopenic purpura presenting in a patient after renal transplant for diabetic nephropathy [^112wcktT]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

A 43-year-old male with hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM), complicated by diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy, underwent preemptive living related renal transplant by donation from his 33-year-old wife on 6th of May 2015. Neither the donor, nor the recipient had any history of autoimmune diseases or blood dyscrasias and both were IgG seropositive for Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). Prior to transplantation, there was no history of blood or blood product transfusion. HLA tissue typing revealed antigen match at loci A✱03, B✱57, DRB1✱03 and DQB1✱05. The patient received Basiliximab at induction as per protocol and was maintained on a triple immunosuppressive regimen of tacrolimus, mycophenolate and steroids. Tacrolimus trough levels were successfully maintained between 7 to 12 ng/ml and his immediate post-transplant period was uneventful. Steroids were tapered over a period of 8 weeks to a dose of 5 mg once daily. He received standard prophylaxis with valganciclovir, nystatin oral drops and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Six months post-transplant, upon follow- up, there was no history of any preceding or current fever, flu- like illness, cough, dyspepsia, gastrointestinal discomfort, altered bowel habits, rash, skin discoloration, body aches or joint pains. He denied taking any non-prescribed drugs including herbal, homeopathic or traditional medications. His blood sugars were adequately controlled. The examination was unremarkable for petechiae, bruises, edema, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Laboratory reports were normal except for isolated thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 40, 000/microL (40, 000/microL, 40 × 10⁹/L, and 40,000 × 10⁹/mL). Blood work showed a normal white blood cell count (9.2 × 10³/microL), normal hemoglobin level (14.5 g/dl) and an absence of sinister cells or fragmentation in the peripheral smear. His renal function tests (creatinine 1.2 mg/dl), liver function tests, and electrolytes were normal.

### Mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents: a review of the current research [^1134hNCQ]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Research confirms that children and adolescents are experiencing significant anxiety and depression during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Adolescents may be at greater risk, particularly females. Social isolation, loneliness, lack of physical exercise, and family stress may contribute to these problems. Children who feel unsafe with regards to coronavirus disease 2019 may be more likely to experience somatic symptoms, depression, and anxiety. Parental stress and mental health problems may put children at an increased risk for maltreatment. Medical and behavioral health professionals should routinely screen for depression and anxiety. Increased access to mental health services will be critical.

### Postdengue chronic fatigue syndrome in an adolescent boy [^111bHVR2]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is often preceded by a viral illness and has recurrent 'flulike' symptoms which include a wide spectrum of musculoskeletal and neurological clinical features. The condition is also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis and systemic exertional intolerance syndrome. CFS has been reported following dengue among adult patients. We report the case of an 11-year-old boy who developed CFS following recovery of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). The reported child was initially managed as for DHF and was clinically asymptomatic on post-discharge day 3. He was re-admitted after 3weeks with severe joint pains, myalgia and unbearable headache. As his symptoms persisted, he was investigated in-depth. All investigations were normal except mild elevation of liver functions. The diagnosis of CFS secondary to DHF was made by exclusion of differential diagnosis. At 1-year follow-up, patient continues to have symptoms after treatment with physiotherapy and nutrition counselling.

### Tracking post-infectious fatigue in clinic using routine lab tests [^111U7yvy]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

While biomarkers for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are beginning to emerge they typically require a highly specialized clinical laboratory. We hypothesized that subsets of commonly measured laboratory markers used in combination could support the diagnosis of post-infectious CFS (PI-CFS) in adolescents following infectious mononucleosis (IM) and help determine who might develop persistence of symptoms.

Methods

Routine clinical laboratory markers were collected prospectively in 301 mono-spot positive adolescents, 4% of whom developed CFS (n = 13). At 6, 12, and 24 months post-diagnosis with IM, 59 standard tests were performed including metabolic profiling, liver enzyme panel, hormone profiles, complete blood count (CBC), differential white blood count (WBC), salivary cortisol, and urinalysis. Classification models separating PI-CFS from controls were constructed at each time point using stepwise subset selection.

Results

Lower ACTH levels at 6 months post-IM diagnosis were highly predictive of CFS (AUC p = 0.02). ACTH levels in CFS overlapped with healthy controls at 12 months, but again showed a trend towards a deficiency at 24 months. Conversely, estradiol levels depart significantly from normal at 12 months only to recover at 24 months (AUC p = 0.02). Finally, relative neutrophil count showed a significant departure from normal at 24 months in CFS (AUC p = 0.01). Expression of these markers evolved differently over time between groups.

Conclusions

Preliminary results suggest that serial assessment of stress and sex hormones as well as the relative proportion of innate immune cells measured using standard clinical laboratory tests may support the diagnosis of PI-CFS in adolescents with IM.

### A prospective observational study of post-COVID-19 chronic fatigue syndrome following the first pandemic wave in Germany and biomarkers associated with symptom severity [^115U2Kpc]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Several diagnostic criteria have been proposed for use in ME/CFS, of which CCC are recommended for diagnosis confirmation in secondary care and in research. Severity and duration of PEM is a key diagnostic criterion of the CCC. In contrast to the original minimum length of 24 h of PEM required by the CCC, we set the duration criterion at 14 h as shown by others to yield the highest diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to discriminate patients with ME/CFS from patients with fatigue due to other chronic illnesses. Strikingly, while all PCS patients suffered from moderate to severe fatigue and exertion intolerance, a subset did not fulfill the CCC criteria for ME/CFS mostly due to a shorter PEM lasting < 14 h. We have not seen such a symptom constellation in other chronic postinfectious syndromes so frequently. The previously widely used Fukuda or CDC-1994 criteria do not require PEM for the diagnosis of ME/CFS thus most PCS/non-ME/CFS patients from our study would have been classified as ME/CFS. Fukuda criteria are, however, no longer recommended to be used for ME/CFS diagnosis as they do not require PEM, the key symptom of ME/CFS. The IOM (Institute of Medicine) criteria do not define the length of PEM but require that it should occur at least half of the time with moderate to severe intensity. Thus many patients not classified as ME/CFS in our study would not have fulfilled the IOM criteria either

### Hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by sea anemone sting: a case report [^112K5hQL]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

In November 2019, a 37-year-old man with no underlying disease presented with pain, a rash, and swelling in the right thigh. Two days prior, he was stung by a sea anemone while scuba diving in Cebu, Philippines. He was administered a tetanus injection at a hospital in Philippines. We made the diagnosis based on the characteristic shape of the wounds, which were caused by a sea anemone tentacle, and the patient's statement.

On admission, generalized swelling and redness were observed on the right leg. A 20 × 15 cm wound and a purpuric, reticulated patch were observed on the right thigh (Fig. 1 a). His blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg, and his body temperature was 36.6 ℃. His white blood cell count was 17,900 cells/mm³, hemoglobin level was 13.9 g/dL, platelet count was 303,000/mm 3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level was 51 mg/dL, creatinine level was 5.12 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase level was 370 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase level was 209 IU/L, and serum creatine phosphokinase level was 401 IU/L (1–171 IU/L).

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Erythrodermic psoriasis — case 6 presents a 29-year-old man with a family history of psoriasis who developed plaque type psoriasis at 12 years of age initially treated with low-potency topical corticosteroids, with progressive worsening over the subsequent 6 years. He was treated initially with 15 mg per week of oral methotrexate (MTX) that led to significant elevations in his liver function test (LFT) findings after 9 months of therapy requiring discontinuation, failed to respond to a 12-week course of intramuscular alefacept, and thereafter obtained significant improvement with etanercept; approximately 7 months after his last etanercept dose an upper respiratory infection led to rapid worsening with involvement of most of his body surface area (BSA) sparing only the palms and soles. On examination he was afebrile with other vital signs within normal limits and had generalized erythematous inflammatory patches and plaques covering 95% of his BSA with superficial exfoliation of the face, palms, and soles, pitting edema of the lower extremities, and swelling of the toes without any specific individual joint tenderness.

### Clinical features of pregnant women in iran who died due to COVID-19 [^116hiEhr]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

To evaluate the clinical presentation of pregnant women in Iran who died due to COVID-19.

Methods

Data were evaluated of pregnant women who died following a laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. The data were obtained from electronic medical records. Additionally, a questionnaire was completed for each patient, including demographic, clinical, laboratorial, imaging, and treatment data. In case of missing information, a member of the research team contacted the first-degree relatives via phone.

Results

Of 32 pregnant women who tested positive for COVID-19, 15 were enrolled into the study (mean age 30.0 ± 5.0 years). The mean time from first symptoms to death was 12 ± 7.0 days. Pre-existing comorbidities were seen in six patients. The main presentations at admission were fatigue and coughing, but most of the women had a fever below 38 °C. Increased white blood cell count and neutrophils were noticeable. A significant drop of saturation of O 2 with ground glass and consolidation seen in both lungs were prominent. The most common complications were acute respiratory distress syndrome followed by respiratory failure.

Conclusion

Computed tomography findings, O 2 pressure, and regular blood assessment may be considered suitable indicators for the surveillance of patients.

### The comprehensive clinic, laboratory, and instrumental evaluation of children with COVID-19: a 6-months prospective study [^1123Mivm]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To perform a comprehensive clinic, laboratory, and instrumental evaluation of children affected by coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Methods

Children with a positive result of nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) underwent laboratory tests, anal and conjunctival swab, electrocardiography, lung, abdomen, and cardiac ultrasound. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed if abnormal basal blood pressure. Patients were followed-up for 6 months.

Results

Three hundred and sixteen children were evaluated; 15 were finally included. Confirmed family member SARS-CoV-2 infection was present in all. Twenty-seven percent were asymptomatic. Anal and conjunctival swabs tests resulted negative in all. Patients with lower body mass index (BMI) presented significantly higher viral loads. Main laboratory abnormalities were: lactate dehydrogenase increasing (73%), low vitamin D levels (87%), hematuria (33%), proteinuria (26%), renal hyperfiltration (33%), and hypofiltration (13%). Two of the patients with hyperfiltration exhibited high blood pressure levels at diagnosis, and persistence of prehypertension at 6-month follow-up. No abnormalities were seen at ultrasound, excepting for one patient who exhibited B-lines at lung sonography. Immunoglobulin G seroconversion was observed in all at 1-month.

Conclusions

Our study confirm that intra-family transmission is important. The significant higher viral loads recorded among patients with lower BMI, together with low vitamin D levels, support the impact of nutritional status on immune system. Renal involvement is frequent even among children with mild COVID-19, therefore prompt evaluation and identification of patients with reduced renal function reserve would allow a better stratification and management of patients. Seroconversion occurs also in asymptomatic children, with no differences in antibodies titer according to age, sex and clinical manifestations.

### First-in-human phase 1 trial of hemoglobin vesicles as artificial red blood cells developed for use as a transfusion alternative [^115AmBEa]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Except for body temperature, no clinically significant change was found in the vital signs, including systemic systolic blood pressure (Figure 1 D). This finding suggests that, compared with the first generation of HBOCs, HbVs have less potential, if any, for raising risks of myocardial infarction. Some analytes used for hematological and biochemical tests showed values outside of normal ranges (supplemental Table 2). Among them, those that were ± 20% or more of the corrected preload value are presented in Figure 2 A. They reverted to the normal range by day 15 or on the day of the additional follow-up study with no clinical sign or symptom. In cohort 3, slight increases of C-reactive protein were observed in 3 of 3 subjects, with the highest peak of 0.99 mg/dL on day 2 (Figure 2 B). Coupled with the manifestation of fever, this finding suggests that a certain amount of interleukin-6 was secreted. No significant decrease in CH50, C3, or C4 was found in any subject in cohort 3, except for 1 (case number 12), in whom a slight decrease in C3 was observed on day 1. Nevertheless, no AE was reported or observed. The subject who developed the rash with wheal, but also this subject (case number 12), was found to be positive only for anti-PEG IgG antibody: not for IgM antibody (data not shown). From these data, it was difficult to conclude whether the complement system or anti-PEG antibody was involved in the manifestation of rash with wheal.

### About infectious mononucleosis (mono) | EBV and mono… [^113MdZ4T]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Infectious mononucleosis, also called "mono, " is a contagious disease.
- Most people with mono get better in 2 to 4 weeks, but some may feel fatigued for several more weeks.
- There is no vaccine to protect against infectious mononucleosis. What is it Infectious mononucleosis is a contagious disease most commonly caused by Epstein-Barr virus. Other viruses can also cause this disease. Infectious mononucleosis is common among teenagers and young adults, especially college students. At least 1 out of 4 teenagers and young adults who get infected with EBV will develop infectious mononucleosis. Sign and symptoms Symptoms of infectious mononucleosis include:

- Extreme fatigue
- Fever
- Sore throat
- Headaches and body aches
- Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits
- Swollen liver or spleen or both
- Rash Enlarged spleen and a swollen liver are less common symptoms.

For some people, their liver or spleen or both may remain enlarged even after their fatigue ends. While most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks, some may feel fatigued for several more weeks. Occasionally, the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis can last for 6 months or longer. Causes and spread EBV is the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis, but other viruses can cause this disease. Typically, these viruses spread most commonly through bodily fluids, especially saliva. However, these viruses can also spread through blood and semen during sexual contact, blood transfusions, and organ transplantations. Keep ReadingHow EBV Spreads Other causes Other infections that can cause infectious mononucleosis include: Prevention There is no vaccine to protect against infectious mononucleosis. You can help protect yourself by not kissing people who have infectious mononucleosis; or sharing drinks, food, or personal items with them.

Testing and diagnosis Healthcare providers typically diagnose infectious mononucleosis based on symptoms. Laboratory tests are not usually needed to diagnose infectious mononucleosis. However, specific tests may be needed for patients who do not have a typical case of infectious mononucleosis. The blood work of patients who have infectious mononucleosis due to EBV infection may show:

- More white blood cells than normal
- Unusual looking white blood cells
- Fewer than normal neutrophils or platelets
- Abnormal liver function Public HealthLaboratory Testing for Epstein-Barr Virus. Treatment and recovery Most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks.

You can help relieve symptoms of infectious mononucleosis by:

- Drinking fluids to stay hydrated
- Getting plenty of rest
- Taking over-the-counter medications for pain and fever Do not take penicillin antibiotics If you have infectious mononucleosis, you should not take penicillin antibiotics like ampicillin or amoxicillin. Based on the severity of the symptoms, a healthcare provider may recommend treatment of specific organ systems affected by infectious mononucleosis. Avoid contact sports Because your spleen may become enlarged as a result of infectious mononucleosis, you should avoid contact sports until you fully recover. Participating in contact sports can be strenuous and may cause the spleen to rupture.

### Infectious mononucleosis [^116tVWvz]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis, also known as glandular fever, is an infection usually caused by the Epstein–Barr virus. Most people are infected by the virus as children, when the disease produces few or no symptoms. In young adults, the disease often results in fever, sore throat, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, and fatigue. Most people recover in two to four weeks; however, feeling tired may last for months. The liver or spleen may also become swollen, and in less than one percent of cases splenic rupture may occur. Spread may occur by objects such as drinking glasses or toothbrushes, or through a cough or sneeze. Those who are infected can spread the disease weeks before symptoms develop. Mono is primarily diagnosed based on the symptoms and can be confirmed with blood tests for specific antibodies. Another typical finding is increased blood lymphocytes of which more than 10% are reactive.

The monospot test is not recommended for general use due to poor accuracy. There is no vaccine for EBV; however, there is ongoing research. Infection can be prevented by not sharing personal items or saliva with an infected person. Mono generally improves without any specific treatment. Symptoms may be reduced by drinking enough fluids, getting sufficient rest, and taking pain medications such as paracetamol and ibuprofen. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of infectious mononucleosis vary with age. Children Before puberty, the disease typically only produces flu-like symptoms, if any at all. When found, symptoms tend to be similar to those of common throat infections. Adolescents and young adults In adolescence and young adulthood, the disease presents with a characteristic triad:

- Fever – usually lasting 14 days; often mild.
- Sore throat – usually severe for 3–5 days, before resolving in the next 7–10 days.
- Swollen glands – mobile; usually located around the back of the neck and sometimes throughout the body. Another major symptom is feeling tired. Headaches are common, and abdominal pains with nausea or vomiting sometimes also occur. Symptoms most often disappear after about 2–4 weeks. However, fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell may sometimes last for months. Fatigue lasts more than one month in an estimated 28% of cases. Mild fever, swollen neck glands and body aches may also persist beyond 4 weeks. Most people can resume their usual activities within 2–3 months. The most prominent sign of the disease is often pharyngitis, which is frequently accompanied by enlarged tonsils with pus — an exudate similar to that seen in cases of strep throat. In about 50% of cases, small reddish-purple spots called petechiae can be seen on the roof of the mouth.

Palatal enanthem can also occur, but is relatively uncommon. A small minority of people spontaneously present a rash, usually on the arms or trunk, which can be macular or papular. Almost all people given amoxicillin or ampicillin eventually develop a generalized, itchy maculopapular rash, which however does not imply that the person will have adverse reactions to penicillins again in the future. Occasional cases of erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme have been reported. Seizures may also occasionally occur. Older adults Infectious mononucleosis mainly affects younger adults. When older adults do catch the disease, they less often have characteristic signs and symptoms such as the sore throat and lymphadenopathy. Instead, they may primarily experience prolonged fever, fatigue, malaise, and body pains. They are more likely to have liver enlargement and jaundice. People over 40 years of age are more likely to develop serious illness.

### Symptoms of COVID-19… [^113zDD4b]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- People with COVID-19 have a wide range of symptoms ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.
- Symptoms may appear 2–14 days after exposure to the virus.
- Symptoms may start as mild, and some people will progress to more severe symptoms. Signs and Symptoms The following list does not include all possible symptoms. Symptoms may change with new COVID-19 variants and can vary depending on vaccination status. Possible symptoms include:

- Fever or chills
- Cough
- Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
- Sore throat
- Congestion or runny nose
- New loss of taste or smell
- Fatigue
- Muscle or body aches
- Headache
- Nausea or vomiting
- Diarrhea CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19. Feeling Sick. Stay home and away from others if you have symptoms that aren't better explained by another cause.

Seek health care promptly for testing and/or treatment if you have risk factors for severe illness; treatment may help lower your risk of severe illness. When to seek emergency help Look for emergency warning signs for COVID 19:
- Trouble breathing
- Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
- New confusion
- Inability to wake or stay awake
- Depending on skin tone, lips, nail beds and skin may appear pale, gray, or blue. If someone is showing any of these signs, call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility. Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19. This list does not include all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you. Difference between flu and COVID-19 Influenza and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses.

COVID-19 is caused by infection with a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, and flu is caused by infection with one of the influenza viruses. You cannot tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 by symptoms alone because some of the symptoms are the same. Some nucleic acid amplification tests, including PCR tests, can differentiate between flu and COVID-19 at the same time. If one of these tests is not available, many testing locations provide flu and COVID-19 tests separately. Keep Reading: Similarities and Differences between Flu and COVID-19.

### Clinical overview of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children… [^116mxwQN]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- MIS-C may begin weeks after a child is infected with SARS-CoV-2. The child may have been infected from an asymptomatic contact, and, in some cases, the child and their caregivers may not even know they had been infected.
- COVID-19 vaccination is effective at reducing the risk of MIS-C. Signs and symptoms
- Patients with MIS-C usually present with fever and some combination of abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash, and mucocutaneous lesions. In severe cases, children can present with hypotension and shock.
- Patients with MIS-C have elevated laboratory markers of inflammation; many have laboratory markers indicating damage to the heart, and many have low platelet or absolute lymphocyte counts.
- Some patients develop cardiac dysfunction and coronary artery dilatation or aneurysm.
- Gastrointestinal inflammation can manifest as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea; children may have signs and symptoms similar to those of acute appendicitis. Neck pain has also been described, sometimes with development of phlegmon on radiographic imaging. Children with MIS-C can also have neurologic involvement which is usually transient and presents as headache or altered mental status.
- Other severe neurologic manifestations may include encephalopathy, stroke, demyelination, and fulminant cerebral edema, although this is rare.
- Not all children will have the same signs and symptoms, and some children may have symptoms not listed here. MIS-C may begin weeks after a child is infected with SARS-CoV-2. The child may have been infected from an asymptomatic contact, and, in some cases, the child and their caregivers may not even know they had been infected.

Reducing risk MIS-C and vaccination
- Parents of children ages 6 months to 17 years should discuss the benefits of vaccination with a healthcare provider.
- Multiple studies have found that COVID-19 vaccination is effective at reducing the risk of MIS-C, with one CDC study finding that two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine had a greater than 90% estimated effectiveness at preventing MIS-C.
- CDC has also created Considerations for Initiating COVID-19 vaccination in people with a history of MIS-C.
- While MIS-C following vaccination is very rare, CDC and FDA require that MIS-C occurring after COVID-19 vaccination be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. For EveryoneHow to Protect Yourself and Others.

### Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children… [^111F6WDc]. Wikipedia (2020). Medium credibility.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome, or systemic inflammatory syndrome in COVID-19, is a rare systemic illness involving persistent fever and extreme inflammation following exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. All affected children have persistent fever. Other clinical features vary. The first symptoms often include acute abdominal pain with diarrhea or vomiting. Muscle pain and general fatigue are frequent, and low blood pressure is also common. Symptoms can also include pink eye, rashes, enlarged lymph nodes, swollen hands and feet, and "strawberry tongue". This emerging condition has been defined slightly differently, by the World Health Organization, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Although the condition is thought to follow SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, antigen or antibody tests are not always positive. Exclusion of alternative causes, including bacterial and other infections, is essential for differential diagnosis. Some general clinical guidance has been provided by the RCPCH, the National Institutes of Health, the American College of Rheumatology, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Background Symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in children have been relatively uncommon, possibly because they generally experience milder disease. Early infection tends to be associated with mild or no symptoms, while the later pulmonary phase, which can be life-threatening in adults, is usually mild or absent. While cases of children with severe symptoms are exceptional, they can occasionally require intensive care. Fatalities have been rare.

Characteristics MIS-C / PIMS-TS is a systemic disorder involving persistent fever, extreme inflammation, and organ dysfunction, which is temporally associated with exposure to COVID-19. Onset may be delayed or contemporary with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may pass without symptoms. The time the syndrome takes to appear following the initial viral infection is debated, though it may develop between the first and second week. Epidemiological data suggest that recognition of the disease may typically be delayed by 2–6 weeks, and usually by 3–4 weeks. By the time of presentation, children have often developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, but test negative for the virus at RT-PCR. Affected children always present with persistent fever. Other clinical features at presentation vary. In contrast to acute COVID-19, most children have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea, vomiting, and intense abdominal pain.

Muscle pain and feelings of tiredness and general physical weakness are also very common. Their frequency and severity is uncertain. So far, they have been recorded in 7% of reported cases. Long-term prognosis is unclear.

1. Rash or bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis or muco-cutaneous inflammation signs
2. Hypotension or shock 3. Features of myocardial dysfunction, pericarditis, valvulitis, or coronary abnormalities.
4. Evidence of coagulopathy 5. Acute gastrointestinal problems
