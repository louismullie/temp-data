## Question

high serum phosphorus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing high serum phosphorus (hyperphosphatemia). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and its severity. Then, I should verify the underlying pathophysiology and common etiologies. Next, I will assess clinical consequences and risk stratification. After that, I need to outline guideline-based management principles, including diet, binders, dialysis, and PTH control. Finally, I should consider special populations, monitoring cadence, and acknowledge evidence gaps and controversies, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and its severity. I should double-check the laboratory value against age- and sex-specific reference ranges and consider circadian variation, because phosphate has a diurnal rhythm and non-fasting samples can mislead interpretation, and I need to ensure I am not reacting to a spurious result before acting on it [^116aKjt5] [^1144RgFE]. I should also verify kidney function (eGFR) immediately, since hyperphosphatemia becomes common when eGFR falls below roughly 45 mL/min/1.73 m² and is nearly universal in ESRD, and I should review concurrent calcium and PTH to contextualize phosphate within CKD–MBD physiology and avoid isolated decision-making [^112g5wnM] [^115Q3iG5] [^112vVf49].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check for non-CKD causes if kidney function is preserved, including tumor lysis syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, vitamin D intoxication, hypoparathyroidism, and rare genetic disorders such as familial tumoral calcinosis, and I should confirm medication contributors like phosphate-containing enemas or active vitamin D analogs before labeling this as CKD-related hyperphosphatemia [^114m1xe5]. Let me consider the phosphate axis regulators too. Early elevations in FGF-23 and PTH can precede overt hyperphosphatemia and may signal evolving phosphate dysregulation even when serum phosphate appears "normal", so I should keep those in mind if available [^116aKjt5].

> Next, I should review the clinical consequences and risk stratification. Hyperphosphatemia is consistently associated with vascular calcification, cardiovascular events, and mortality across CKD stages, and even phosphate levels in the high-normal range correlate with adverse outcomes in the general population, so I need to ensure I communicate risk clearly while acknowledging that causality remains under active study [^114dRayf] [^112J78n4]. Wait, let me verify dialysis-specific thresholds; in hemodialysis cohorts, mortality risk rises with phosphate above about 5.5 mg/dL, and in peritoneal dialysis, both single and serial phosphate measurements above this range track with higher all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events, reinforcing the need for trend-based assessment rather than one-off values [^112tyUTa] [^115wUax9] [^117BB1mE]. I should also remember that higher phosphate variability itself portends worse outcomes, so stability matters as much as absolute levels in some contexts [^112P3PjJ].

> I will now examine management principles. Guidelines converge on lowering elevated phosphate toward the normal range in CKD G3a–G5D, but decisions should be individualized and based on serial measurements of phosphate, calcium, and PTH rather than a single value, so I need to ensure longitudinal data guide therapy adjustments [^113p4FmG] [^112vVf49]. Let me think about diet first; I should confirm that nutrition counseling targets both the amount and bioavailability of phosphorus, emphasizing avoidance of inorganic phosphate additives and favoring plant-based sources with lower absorption, while guarding against protein–energy wasting, because overly restrictive diets can worsen nutrition without proportional phosphate gains [^112ybjj5] [^113SexHv] [^111rfys2]. But wait, what if the patient is on peritoneal dialysis; given lower clearance, I should be more aggressive with dietary counseling and binder use while monitoring trends closely [^115wUax9].

> Next, I should review phosphate binders. I need to ensure binders are reserved for persistently or progressively elevated phosphate despite dietary measures, and I should prefer non–calcium-based agents when feasible to mitigate positive calcium balance and potential vascular calcification, especially in the presence of adynamic bone disease or high calcium load, while recognizing that all binders lower phosphate similarly and adherence is paramount [^114JEwCC] [^113FcpvQ]. Hold on, I should verify that calcium-based binders are not categorically contraindicated; they remain reasonable in select scenarios with careful monitoring of calcium and the calcium–phosphorus product, but I must avoid routine high-dose calcium loading [^1128MRpz].

> I need to ensure dialysis prescription aligns with phosphate control. In hemodialysis, extending treatment time or frequency improves phosphate removal and can reduce binder needs, and in selected patients, nocturnal or extended schedules can achieve excellent phosphate control, sometimes necessitating dialysate phosphate to prevent hypophosphatemia, so I should tailor frequency and duration rather than relying solely on binders [^113DRALy] [^112Z4xJE]. Let me reconsider the practical ceiling; even with optimized dialysis, many patients still require binders, so I should set expectations and build adherence strategies early [^116PVc8q].

> I should confirm that secondary hyperparathyroidism is addressed in parallel. Uncontrolled PTH drives bone phosphate release and worsens hyperphosphatemia, so optimizing PTH with vitamin D analogs, calcimimetics, or surgical parathyroidectomy when indicated can improve phosphate control, and I need to monitor calcium and phosphate closely during these adjustments to avoid iatrogenic calcification [^113e1ab6] [^114qbnqA]. Wait, let me verify that I am not overcorrecting PTH into adynamic bone; maintaining a balanced mineral profile is essential to avoid trading hyperphosphatemia for low-turnover bone disease and calcification risk [^111JsTso].

> For special populations, I should double-check peritoneal dialysis nuances. Given higher time-averaged phosphate exposure, serial phosphate measurements outperform single values for risk prediction, so I should schedule more frequent monitoring and intensify dietary and binder strategies accordingly [^115wUax9] [^117BB1mE]. In non-CKD populations with high-normal phosphate, I should counsel on reducing processed foods and phosphate additives and consider cardiovascular risk modification, while acknowledging that definitive outcome data for phosphate-lowering interventions in the general population are pending [^114dRayf] [^116SufJr]. For kidney transplant recipients with hypophosphatemia, I should remember that phosphate supplementation may be reasonable in select cases, but that is the opposite problem and underscores the need to interpret phosphate in clinical context [^113U2vfg].

> I should confirm a monitoring cadence aligned with CKD stage. In stages 3–4, checking phosphate every 3–6 months is reasonable, and in stage 5/5D, every 1–3 months alongside calcium and PTH, with shorter intervals when abnormalities are present or changing rapidly, and I must document trends rather than isolated values to guide therapy [^1171wZuZ]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overreacting to a single high value; guidelines explicitly discourage preemptive binders in normophosphatemic patients, so I need to ensure persistent or progressive elevation before escalating therapy [^114JEwCC].

> Finally, I need to acknowledge evidence gaps. While observational data consistently link higher phosphate to worse outcomes, randomized trials have not definitively proven that lowering phosphate improves hard endpoints, and some binder studies raise concerns about calcium load and calcification, so shared decision-making and individualized risk–benefit discussions are essential while we await larger, well-designed trials [^1178YQPg] [^111vaQ7J]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that binder use is futile; that would be too strong — binders reliably lower phosphate and are standard of care, but I should frame expectations around surrogate control and potential cardiovascular benefits rather than guaranteed mortality reduction pending stronger outcome data [^113FcpvQ] [^114dbP6F].

High serum phosphorus (hyperphosphatemia) is defined as serum phosphate > 1.45 mmol/L (4.5 mg/dL) in adults [^114m1xe5] and is most often due to **reduced renal excretion** in CKD [^116aKjt5] or **excess intake** from diet or additives [^111aaAMq]. It is linked to vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease, and mortality, especially in CKD and dialysis [^114dRayf] [^115wUax9]. Management centers on **dietary phosphate restriction** [^112ybjj5], phosphate binders [^113FcpvQ], and dialysis in ESRD [^113DRALy]; **treat underlying causes** (e.g. hypoparathyroidism, tumor lysis) and monitor calcium, PTH, and vitamin D to prevent complications [^112vVf49].

---

## Definition and normal ranges

Adult hyperphosphatemia is serum phosphate > 1.45 mmol/L (4.5 mg/dL) [^114m1xe5]; **pediatric reference ranges** vary by age, with higher normal values in infants and children due to growth.

---

## Physiological regulation of phosphate

Phosphate homeostasis is maintained by coordinated actions of the **kidneys, intestines, bones, parathyroid hormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D** [^1144RgFE]:

- **Renal excretion**: The kidneys regulate phosphate via proximal tubular reabsorption controlled by PTH and FGF-23 [^115ZNJy7].
- **Intestinal absorption**: Dietary phosphate absorption is influenced by vitamin D and FGF-23 [^1144RgFE].
- **Bone reservoir**: Bone releases phosphate during resorption, influenced by PTH and FGF-23 [^116aKjt5].

---

## Causes of hyperphosphatemia

Hyperphosphatemia results from **impaired renal excretion**, **increased phosphate load**, or **shift from intracellular to extracellular compartments**:

| **Category** | **Causes** |
|-|-|
| Reduced renal excretion | - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) [^11622aDv] <br/> - Acute kidney injury (AKI) [^114m1xe5] <br/> - Hypoparathyroidism [^114m1xe5] <br/> - Tumoral calcinosis [^114m1xe5] |
| Increased phosphate load | - Excessive dietary intake (especially additives) [^111aaAMq] <br/> - Phosphate-containing medications (enemas, laxatives) [^notfound] <br/> - Vitamin D intoxication [^114m1xe5] |
| Shift from intracellular to extracellular compartments | - Tumor lysis syndrome [^notfound] <br/> - Rhabdomyolysis [^notfound] <br/> - Severe hemolysis [^notfound] |

## Clinical consequences of hyperphosphatemia

Hyperphosphatemia is associated with **significant morbidity and mortality**, particularly in CKD and dialysis populations:

- **Vascular calcification**: Promotes medial arterial calcification, increasing cardiovascular risk [^114dRayf] [^116pQMB2].
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Linked to increased risk of coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and mortality [^112Rxgxm] [^115wUax9].
- **Bone disease**: Contributes to renal osteodystrophy and fractures [^1147dsMQ].
- **Calciphylaxis**: Severe vascular calcification causing painful skin lesions and high mortality [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Evaluation of hyperphosphatemia should include:

- **Confirm elevated phosphate**: Repeat fasting morning sample to rule out diurnal variation [^116aKjt5].
- **Assess kidney function**: eGFR and urinalysis [^notfound].
- **Evaluate calcium, PTH, vitamin D**: Identify secondary hyperparathyroidism or vitamin D disorders [^112vVf49].
- **Review medications and diet**: Identify exogenous sources of phosphate [^111aaAMq].
- **Additional tests**: FGF-23, urinary phosphate excretion, and imaging for calcification if indicated [^115qnCr6].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause, severity, and patient context**:

### General measures

General measures include **dietary phosphate restriction** — limit processed foods and additives [^111z68UV] [^111aaAMq] — and patient education on phosphorus content and adherence [^111Q6rtD].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **Phosphate binders**: Calcium-based (calcium acetate, calcium carbonate), non-calcium-based (sevelamer, lanthanum), and iron-based binders (ferric citrate, sucroferric oxyhydroxide) [^notfound].
- **Dialysis**: Essential in ESRD to remove phosphate; consider intensified regimens if hyperphosphatemia persists [^113DRALy].
- **Treat underlying causes**: Hypoparathyroidism, tumor lysis syndrome, vitamin D intoxication [^114m1xe5].

---

### Monitoring and targets

Monitoring and targets include **regular monitoring** of serum phosphate, calcium, PTH, and vitamin D [^notfound], with **individualized targets** based on CKD stage and patient-specific factors [^1128MRpz].

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include **pediatric patients**, in whom management must account for growth and developmental needs, and **acute settings**, where rapid intervention is critical in tumor lysis syndrome and rhabdomyolysis [^1144RgFE].

---

High serum phosphorus is a **significant clinical concern**, particularly in CKD, and requires a comprehensive approach including dietary restriction, phosphate binders, dialysis, and treatment of underlying causes.

PHOSPHATE IN DISEASE

Phosphate deficiency as well as Pi overload can be causes of severe disease manifestations. In contrast, the occurrence and role of dietary Pi overload in the general population is rather controversially discussed.

General population

A series of epidemiological studies associated high dietary Pi intake or high-normal Pi plasma levels (within the normal Pi range) with a higher risk for incipient heart disease, vascular calcification, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, progression of kidney disease and bone disease. Major problems with some of these studies are that most data originate from studies conducted in US populations. Moreover, there are uncertainties in accurately assessing dietary Pi intake and Pi bioavailability and the possibility of confounding factors associated with the intake of highly processed food items. On the other hand, a few studies tested the effect of high Pi on endocrine or cardiovascular endpoints under controlled experimental conditions in healthy participants and animals. In these studies, high phosphate intake caused a higher sympathetic nerve outflow, higher systolic blood pressure or bone loss. Moreover, animal studies suggest that high Pi intake can cause left ventricular hypertrophy as well as kidney damage. Clearly, the health risk associated with high dietary phosphate intake must be assessed further. The European Food Safety Authority stated in their 2019 report that the acceptable daily intake is 40 mg/kg body weight/day, or 2.8 g for a 70-kg adult. Notably, this value was set based on a single publication in rats and can be considered as purely hypothetical.

### Relations of serum phosphorus and calcium levels to the incidence of cardiovascular disease in the community… [^114dRayf]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Values of serum phosphorus higher than 3. 5 mg/dL were associated with a 55% increased CVD risk. Furthermore, these associations remained robust in a subgroup of individuals with an eGFR greater than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m² and without proteinuria. Second, higher serum phosphorus levels may directly promote vascular injury. Investigators have reported that higher phosphorus levels increase the propensity of mineral deposition in vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro. 34 This increased predisposition can be partly explained by increased osteopontin expression35, 36 Serum phosphorus may also directly increase vascular calcification, especially when levels of calcium-phosphorus product are high, as observed in patients with CKD8 or in individuals without CKD.

37 Most observational studies of patients with CKD have noted significant associations of vascular calcification with increased levels of serum phosphorus and calcium-phosphorus product. It is not clear, however, if higher serum phosphorus levels within the reference range are associated with increased vascular calcification. Third, higher serum phosphorus levels may indicate subclinical renal dysfunction, with associated cardiovascular sequelae. Although our data lacked information on parathyroid hormone, we performed additional analyses excluding individuals with an eGFR of 90 mL/min per 1. 73 m2 or less and/or proteinuria; the relations of serum phosphorus levels to CVD risk remained robust in these analyses. Fourth, higher serum phosphorus levels increase circulating PTH levels even in healthy individuals. 38 Higher PTH levels may be proinflammatory; PTH has been reported to induce production of IL-6 via bone resorption39 or by increased hepatic synthesis.

40 Higher levels of serum IL-6 and hsCRP have been associated with increased CVD risk. In our study, we adjusted for hsCRP and still observed a significant independent association of serum phosphorus levels and CVD risk. In conclusion, in a large community-based sample of individuals free of baseline CKD and CVD, higher levels of serum phosphorus are associated with an increased risk of incident CVD in a graded fashion. Additional research is warranted to confirm or refute our findings and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the potential link between phosphorus homeostasis and vascular risk.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^113DRALy]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Minimally adequate hemodialysis — serum phosphorus control: In a thrice-weekly framework, increasing Kt/V or making slight increases in treatment time is expected to have only a mild to negligible effect on serum phosphorus levels. With short-daily schedules, control has been disappointing with short (1.5- to 2-hour) treatments despite the initial 30 minutes occurring while levels are high. A nonrandomized study with 3-hour treatments given 6 times per week showed a decrease in serum phosphorus levels, and at least 3 treatments per week appears to be needed to control phosphorus levels in most dialysis patients. Extended weekly time regimens report benefits: in the Tassin experience (8 h/wk × 3 = 24 h) approximately one third of patients no longer required phosphate binders; an every-other-night nocturnal dialysis strategy (~28 h/wk) should give similar results; and nocturnal dialysis given 5 to 6 times per week appears to remove the need for phosphorus binders, control phosphorus levels in almost all patients, and often requires adding phosphate to the dialysate to prevent hypophosphatemia.

### Serum phosphate is associated with increased risk of bone fragility fractures in haemodialysis patients [^1147dsMQ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

Bone fragility fractures are a frequent clinical disorder among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and are associated with high morbidity and mortality.
Bone fragility fracture risk factors in CKD patients are the same as those in the general population but they may also include other specific factors such as serum phosphate, calcium and parathyroid hormone disorders.
Hyperphosphatemia has been suggested as a risk factor for bone fragility fracture. However, to date, there is no solid published evidence of the association between high serum phosphate and bone fractures in haemodialysis patients.

This study adds:

The present large study is the first to describe an association between high serum phosphate and the risk of incident bone fractures in haemodialysis patients.

Potential impact:

Hyperphosphatemia is a prevalent and treatable condition among haemodialysis patients. The identification of the association between elevated serum phosphate and bone fractures emphasizes the importance of prospective studies to identify whether lowering phosphate towards the normal range reduces fracture risk.

### Hyperphosphataemia in 2019: have we made progress? [^1178YQPg]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review describes recent developments in the management of serum phosphate in dialysis patients, with a focus on the development of recent trials which randomize patients to different levels of control.

Recent Findings

We review the uncertainties around clinical benefits of serum phosphate control and alternative approaches to current management, as well as a multinational attempt to conduct randomized controlled trials in this area. We discuss novel methods of limiting oral phosphate absorption.

Summary

Although numerous guidelines and target ranges for serum phosphate management exist, they are largely based on observational data and there is no definitive evidence that good control improves the length or quality of life of dialysis patients. New phosphate binders continue to appear on the market with increasing financial cost but without additional meaningful outcome data. Two recently published trials have demonstrated the feasibility of a large-scale study of differing phosphate levels to test the hypothesis that reduction of serum phosphate is beneficial to dialysis patients. Restriction of oral phosphate intake should not be overlooked.

### Physiopathology of phosphate disorders [^115ZNJy7]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Intracellular phosphate is critical for cellular processes such as signaling, nucleic acid synthesis, and membrane function. Extracellular phosphate (Pi) is an important component of the skeleton. Normal levels of serum phosphate are maintained by the coordinated actions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, parathyroid hormone and fibroblast growth factor-23, which intersect in the proximal tubule to control the reabsorption of phosphate via the sodium-phosphate cotransporters Npt2a and Npt2c. Furthermore, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 participates in the regulation of dietary phosphate absorption in the small intestine. Clinical manifestations associated with abnormal serum phosphate levels are common and occur as a result of genetic or acquired conditions affecting phosphate homeostasis. For example, chronic hypophosphatemia leads to osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children. Acute severe hypophosphatemia can affect multiple organs leading to rhabdomyolysis, respiratory dysfunction, and hemolysis. Patients with impaired kidney function, such as those with advanced CKD, have high prevalence of hyperphosphatemia, with approximately two-thirds of patients on chronic hemodialysis in the United States having serum phosphate levels above the recommended goal of 5.5 mg/dL, a cutoff associated with excess risk of cardiovascular complications. Furthermore, patients with advanced kidney disease and hyperphosphatemia (> 6.5 mg/dL) have almost one-third excess risk of death than those with phosphate levels between 2.4 and 6.5 mg/dL. Given the complex mechanisms that regulate phosphate levels, the interventions to treat the various diseases associated with hypophosphatemia or hyperphosphatemia rely on the understanding of the underlying pathobiological mechanisms governing each patient condition.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^112ybjj5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI CKD nutrition — how to use dietary phosphorus restriction — although dietary phosphorus restriction may be a valid stand-alone strategy in CKD stages 3–4, the reductions achieved solely by limiting intake are described as modest and the strategy is recommended as only one option; aligning with those guidelines, we recommend that decisions to restrict dietary phosphorus be based on the presence of progressively or persistently elevated serum phosphate levels (trends rather than a single value) and after consideration of concomitant calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.

### Hidden sources of phosphorus in the typical American diet: does it matter in nephrology? [^111z68UV]. Seminars in Dialysis (2003). Low credibility.

Elevated serum phosphorus is a major, preventable etiologic factor associated with the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of dialysis patients. An important determinant of serum phosphorus is the dietary intake of this mineral; this makes dietary restriction of phosphorus a cornerstone for the prevention and treatment of hyperphosphatemia. The average daily dietary intake of phosphorus is about 1550 mg for males and 1000 mg for females. In general, foods high in protein are also high in phosphorus. These figures, however, are changing as phosphates are currently being added to a large number of processed foods including meats, cheeses, dressings, beverages, and bakery products. As a result, and depending on the food choices, such additives may increase the phosphorus intake by as a much as 1 g/day. Moreover, nutrient composition tables usually do not include the phosphorus from these additives, resulting in an underestimate of the dietary intake of phosphorus in our patients. Our goal is to convey an understanding of the phosphorus content of the current American diet to better equip nephrologists in their attempt to control hyperphosphatemia.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) [^116FJftM]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia treatment — evidence limitations and discretionary guidance: It has not been examined in placebo-controlled RCTs whether treating hyperphosphatemia to specific treatment goals improves clinical outcomes of patients with CKD. Thus, the work group made a discretionary recommendation for treating hyperphosphatemia, acknowledging that despite the robust risk relationships, observational data do not prove a causal relationship and laboratory experimental data may not be directly applicable to patients.

### Cardiovascular risk factors in chronic kidney disease: does phosphate qualify? [^111mMSqj]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Risk factors for disease states are rigorously defined. This analysis considers the definition of a risk factor as applied to the question of whether the serum phosphorus level is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Observational studies strongly suggest that phosphorus is associated with cardiovascular risk, and definitive prospective animal studies are supportive. A plausible mechanism of action has been discovered demonstrating that phosphorus stimulates osteoblastic transition of cells in the neointima of atherosclerotic plaques, which, if prevented, blocks vascular calcification. However, prospective studies demonstrating that modulation of the putative risk factor affects clinical outcomes are lacking, and phosphorus, as yet, does not qualify as a cardiovascular risk factor. This is a clarion call for additional research.

### Effect of food additives on hyperphosphatemia among patients with end-stage renal disease… [^111aaAMq]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion Educating end-stage renal disease patients to avoid phosphorus-containing food additives resulted in modest improvements in hyperphosphatemia. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT00583570. Individuals with moderate to severe renal disease have an impaired ability to excrete phosphorus. As a result, they tend to develop hyperphosphatemia, especially in settings of high phosphorus intake. Elevated serum phosphorus levels are independently associated with increased mortality and morbidity. For example, serum phosphorus levels greater than the 5. 5-mg/dL level recommended by practice guidelines are independently associated with a 20% to 40% increase in mortality risk among patients with end-stage renal disease. 1–9 In addition, hyperphosphatemia appears to be involved in the development of atherosclerotic heart disease, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone disease among renal patients. 10–12.

Phosphorus-containing additives have been shown to increase serum phosphorus in short-term experimental studies involving small numbers of participants. 22, 23 However, their impact in real-world situations is less clear. To determine if there is a causal relationship between additive consumption and hyperphosphatemia, it would be necessary to demonstrate in a prospective clinical trial that altering additive consumption leads to changes in serum phosphorus levels. We therefore sought to test an educational intervention to reduce the intake of additive-containing processed and fast foods. We focused on patients with severe renal disease because they are likely to be the most sensitive to changes in dietary phosphorus.
24. We found that educating patients with ESRD to avoid phosphorus-containing food additives resulted in modest but clinically significant improvements in serum phosphorus levels. The 0.

6-mg/dL larger decline in average phosphorus level among intervention participants compared with control participants corresponds to a 5% to 15% reduction in relative mortality risk in observational studies. 2–7, 9. Although we were unable to assess actual dietary intake, the increased reading of nutrition facts labels and ingredient lists reported by intervention participants suggests that improvements in serum phosphorus levels were mediated by changes in participant behavior and food choices that were consistent with the intent of the intervention. This makes it likely that a causal link exists between changes in the consumption of such additives and changes in serum phosphorus levels among patients with advanced renal disease. Our findings raise the possibility that typical intakes of processed and fast foods contribute to the persistent hyperphosphatemia, cardiovascular events, and bone disease observed among patients with ESRD. 24, 30.

### Serum phosphorus in people with chronic kidney disease: you are what you eat [^115XpaL2]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

This issue of Kidney International includes two important articles about serum phosphorus and its treatment. The article by Cannata-Andía and colleagues describes a rigorous observational study of the association between serum phosphorus level, phosphate binder use, and clinical outcomes including all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The article by Mehrotra and colleagues addresses the association between serum phosphorus, socioeconomic status, and mortality among participants in the US-based KEEP program.

### Hyperphosphatemia in patients with ESRD: assessing the current evidence linking outcomes with treatment adherence [^114USvJt]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Establishing a threshold level of serum phosphorus load at which the risk of all-cause or CV mortality increases significantly will be critical for optimizing care strategies. The need for control of serum phosphorus concentrations is reflected in the evidence-based Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and KDOQI guidelines. These recommend the use of phosphate binders if serum phosphorus concentrations exceed those within the guideline ranges (toward the normal range for patients with Stage 5D CKD and 3.5–5.5 mg/dL for patients with Stage 5 CKD, respectively). However, it should be noted that no phosphate binder has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients not on dialysis.

Despite publication of these guidelines, there is a gap between the recommendations and serum phosphorus concentrations achieved by the majority of patients in clinical practice. For example, only 44% of patients in DOPPS II achieved serum phosphorus concentrations within the recommended range. Precise reasons for this gap remain unclear and likely contributing factors will be examined further in this review.

Seeking to control hyperphosphatemia and improve outcomes: use of phosphate binders

Treatment of the majority of patients with ESRD often necessitates a multimodal approach, comprising dialysis, dietary restriction of phosphorus intake and use of phosphate binders.

Dietary restriction of phosphorus intake has an important role in the management of serum phosphorus load, as evidenced by the finding that higher levels of dietary phosphorus intake and higher dietary phosphorus to protein ratios correlated with greater 5-year mortality in hemodialysis patients. Educating patients to avoid major sources of natural phosphorus (often protein-rich foods) and phosphorus-containing additives (e.g. those found in soft drinks and processed meat), and to prepare phosphorus-rich foods by boiling to reduce phosphorus content, contributes to their serum phosphorus control. Absorption of phosphorus via the gastrointestinal tract varies with food source, being lower for plant-based materials that include phytate and higher for foods enhanced with inorganic phosphorus-containing preservatives.

### Is there an association between elevated or low serum levels of phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, and calcium and mortality in patients with end stage renal disease? A meta-analysis [^115pazSe]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Among patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD), the deterioration of kidney function is often accompanied by secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) involving disturbances in mineral metabolism, including elevated levels of serum phosphorus, decreased calcium, and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH). Observational studies suggest that biochemical markers of altered mineral metabolism are associated with poor clinical outcomes among patients with ESRD requiring dialysis, although controversy exists regarding the strength of the evidence and the independent nature of these relationships.

In a systematic review published in 2008, Covic et al. identified 22 studies published from 1980–2007 that assessed the association between disturbances in biochemical parameters and all-cause mortality among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including 19 studies of patients on dialysis. The authors noted that the studies were too clinically and methodologically diverse to permit an appropriate meta-analysis. Nevertheless, a qualitative assessment of the studies led them to conclude that elevated values in certain biochemical parameters, specifically the serum levels of PTH, calcium, and phosphorus, as well as very low values of phosphorus, were associated with an increase in mortality risk among patients on dialysis.

### Pharmacology, efficacy and safety of oral phosphate binders [^113FcpvQ]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

The ideal serum level of phosphate in patients on dialysis, and the benefits of controlling levels of phosphate in serum remain unclear despite observational studies that associate phosphate levels with mortality. In the absence of robust data from trials, current guidelines are necessarily based on opinion. Oral phosphate binders are required by the majority of patients on dialysis, and all of these binders can control serum levels of phosphate to similar degrees. Patient preference and adherence to prescribed therapy is at least as important as the efficacy of the prescribed binder. Avoidance of calcium-containing binders has become accepted practice where the alternatives are affordable, but incontrovertible evidence in favor of this approach is lacking. Use of sevelamer and lanthanum avoids calcium loading, but at considerable financial cost and with no reliable patient outcome data to prove their value. Additional approaches to aid control of serum levels of phosphate include blockade of gastrointestinal phosphate absorption and possibly binding of salivary phosphate. Importantly, the role of phosphate control in determining patient outcomes must be quantified, which is likely to require a large randomized, controlled study of two levels of phosphate control. Without such a study we will continue to rely on observational data with all its uncertainties and potential to mislead.

### Hypophosphatemia: an update on its etiology and treatment [^111yLznz]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Phosphate plays a key role in several biological processes. In recent years, new insights have been obtained into the regulation of the phosphate metabolism, including a growing amount of evidence suggesting that factors other than parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D are involved in maintaining the phosphate balance. A new class of phosphate-regulating factors, the so-called "phosphatonins", have been shown to be important in phosphate-wasting diseases. However, the role of the phosphatonins in the normal human homeostasis remains to be established. The incidence of hypophosphatemia in selected patient series can be more than 20%, with clinical sequelae ranging from mild to life threatening. Only when combined with phosphate depletion does hypophosphatemia become clinically significant. The factors that are involved in the phosphate homeostasis, the pathophysiology, the relevance in patient care, the clinical manifestations, and an appropriate management of phosphate depletion are discussed in this review.

### Phosphate metabolism in the setting of chronic kidney disease: significance and recommendations for treatment [^116dH9Dg]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

Phosphorus is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in cell structure and metabolism. In living organisms, phosphorus exists surrounded by four oxygen atoms to form phosphate (PO(4)). Within cells, PO(4) regulates enzymatic activity and serves as an essential component of nucleic acids, adenosine triphosphate, and phospholipid membranes. Outside cells, PO(4) primarily resides in bone and teeth as hydroxyapatite. A small amount of inorganic PO(4) circulates in serum, with levels balanced by gastrointestinal intake, renal excretion, and a set of specific hormones. Under normal conditions, PO(4) is excreted through the kidneys. Among patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving chronic dialysis, circulating PO(4) levels typically rise to levels well above the normal laboratory range. Higher serum PO(4) levels are strongly associated with arterial calcification and mortality in this setting. Among predialysis patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), phosphaturic hormones enhance renal PO(4) excretion to maintain serum PO(4) levels within the high-normal laboratory range. Recently, high-normal serum PO(4) levels have been associated with cardiovascular (CV) events and mortality among individuals who have CKD and among those who have normal kidney function. This review discusses PO(4) metabolism in the context of CKD, examines associations of PO(4) levels with adverse outcomes in the CKD setting, and suggests treatment strategies for moderating serum PO(4) levels.

Regarding medical management for X-linked hypophosphatemia, more specifically with respect to vitamin D and phosphate salts, adults, XLH-IWG 2025 guidelines recommend to do not use fasting serum phosphorus as a target when treating with conventional therapy with active vitamin D with or without phosphate salts. Recognize that achieving normal fasting serum phosphorus levels is unnecessary for treating X-linked hypophosphatemia, and high phosphate loads to achieve this often result in severe hyperparathyroidism.

### An expert perspective on phosphate dysregulation with a focus on chronic hypophosphatemia [^113KLD3b]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Given the physiologic importance of phosphate for optimal health, phosphate homeostasis control is necessary throughout life. Chronic hypophosphatemic diseases are rare, often underrecognized, and may be suboptimally managed. Moreover, serum phosphate is not always routinely measured in primary care practice and may be misinterpreted if not compared against age‐ and sex‐specific normal phosphate reference ranges. These diseases have a multisystem impact that impair quality of life. In some genetic forms of these diseases, inadequate management during childhood or adolescence leads to further complications in adulthood.

Given the considerable clinical impact of chronic hypophosphatemic diseases, we emphasize the need to identify these as early as possible. A universally well‐accepted definition of chronic hypophosphatemia will help raise awareness of these diseases, aid in the identification and management of affected individuals, and facilitate further clinical studies. We propose a definition for chronic hypophosphatemia in this article, although we note that further investigations should be performed in patients without delay if necessary. Finally, we provide our recommendations for assessing renal phosphate wasting and highlight the urgency to restore phosphate homeostasis with the aim to improve patient outcomes.

### An expert perspective on phosphate dysregulation with a focus on chronic hypophosphatemia [^114mPMWV]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Because of their rarity, diseases characterized by chronic hypophosphatemia can be underrecognized and suboptimally managed, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. Moreover, serum phosphate may not be measured routinely in primary care practice. Authors participated in several working sessions to advance the understanding of phosphate homeostasis and the causes, consequences, and clinical implications of chronic hypophosphatemia. Phosphate levels are regulated from birth to adulthood. Dysregulation of phosphate homeostasis can result in hypophosphatemia, which becomes chronic if phosphate levels cannot be normalized. Chronic hypophosphatemia may be underrecognized as serum phosphate measurement is not always part of routine analysis in the primary care setting and results might be misinterpreted, for instance, due to age‐specific differences not being accounted for and circadian variations. Clinical consequences of chronic hypophosphatemia involve disordered endocrine regulation, affect multiple organ systems, and vary depending on patient age and the underlying disorder. Signs and symptoms of chronic hypophosphatemic diseases that manifest during childhood or adolescence persist into adulthood if the disease is inadequately managed, resulting in an accumulation of clinical deficits and a progressive, debilitating impact on quality of life. Early identification and diagnosis of patients with chronic hypophosphatemia is crucial, and clinical management should be started as soon as possible to maximize the likelihood of improving health outcomes. Furthermore, in the absence of a universally accepted description for "chronic hypophosphatemia", a definition is proposed here that aims to raise awareness of these diseases, facilitate diagnosis, and guide optimal phosphate management strategies by improving monitoring and assessment of patient response to treatment. © 2021 The Authors.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) dietary phosphorus restriction — recommendation states we recommend decisions to restrict dietary phosphorus be based on the presence of progressive or persistently elevated serum phosphate (that is, trends rather than a single laboratory value), and after consideration of concomitant calcium and PTH levels; there are no obvious costs in implementing this recommendation.

### Phosphate control in end-stage renal disease: barriers and opportunities [^115Q3iG5]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is a nearly universal complication of end-stage renal disease that is widely recognized as one of the most important and most challenging clinical targets to meet in the care of dialysis patients. Left untreated, it can lead to bone pain, pruritus and worsening secondary hyperparathyroidism. Data from observational studies demonstrate that an elevated serum phosphorus level is an independent risk factor for mortality, and that treatment with phosphate binders is independently associated with improved survival. Experimental studies provide support for the epidemiologic findings: phosphate excess promotes vascular calcification, induces endothelial dysfunction and may contribute to other emerging chronic kidney disease-specific mechanisms of cardiovascular toxicity. On the basis of this evidence, clinical practice guidelines recommend specific targets for serum phosphorus levels in the dialysis population. The purpose of this review is to summarize common challenges in meeting these targets and to identify potential opportunities for improvement.

Hyperphosphatemia

Hyperphosphatemia (defined in adults as serum phosphate > 1.45 mmol/L [4.5 mg/dL]) often occurs in patients with acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypophosphatasia, or vitamin D intoxication. Rare genetic disorders of hyperphosphatemia include familial tumoral calcinosis (associated with reduced intact FGF23 levels) and hypoparathyroidism (associated with reduced PTH production). Higher phosphate levels, even if within the normal range, are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the normal population and can result in overt hyperphosphatemia, particularly in patients with CKD. Serious complications associated with prolonged hyperphosphatemia include vascular calcification and heart failure.

### Translation of nutrient level recommendations to control serum phosphate into food-based advice [^115qwapQ]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

The control of hyperphosphatemia is key to the management of chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder. Dietary restriction of phosphorus is essential to control hyperphosphatemia. Guidelines for chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease generally provide high-level guidance on whether a nutrient should be restricted e.g., restrict dietary phosphorus. Dietitians translate such guidance into nutrient-based strategies and finally into food-based practical dietary advice for patients to follow. The practical aspects of dietary advice are not well described in the literature, neither are the challenges of concurrently altering 1 nutrient e.g., phosphorus while continuing to restrict others e.g., potassium, while maintaining overall nutritional adequacy and quality of life. In this article, we describe how we translated updated nutrient level recommendations into practical dietary advice to be delivered at the bedside.

### Hyperphosphatemia and risks of acute kidney injury, end-stage renal disease, and mortality in hospitalized patients [^112dfSYc]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly recognized as a public health problem and is associated with higher risks of cardiovascular disease and other conditions, including infections and cancer. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a renal complication that occurs in up to 20% of hospital admissions, and which can eventually progression to CKD. Both AKI and CKD thus represent significant health burdens with potentially high morbidity and mortality rates.

Serum phosphorus levels are regulated by multiple organs including the kidney, bone, and digestive systems. Given that the kidney plays a major role in phosphorus regulation, phosphorus homeostasis can be disrupted in patients with kidney disease. Abnormal phosphorus levels may in turn be related to several morbidities, such as vascular calcification, mineral bone disease, and hyperparathyroidism. Furthermore, the risk of death has been shown to increase by approximately 20% for each 1 mg/dl increment in serum phosphorus among patients with CKD. Accordingly, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend monitoring serum phosphorus levels and lowering elevated levels towards the normal range in patients with CKD. Hyperphosphatemia was also recently shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in non-CKD patients. However, most studies of hyperphosphatemia have focused on certain disease subsets rather than considering all hospitalized patients. Furthermore, the relationship between hyperphosphatemia and AKI has not yet been fully established. The present study thus assessed the effects of hyperphosphatemia on the risks of AKI, ESRD, and mortality among a large number of hospitalized patients.

KDIGO CKD-MBD monitoring frequency by CKD stage: In patients with CKD stages 3–5D, it is reasonable to base the frequency of monitoring serum calcium, phosphorus, and PTH on the presence and magnitude of abnormalities and rate of progression of CKD (not graded). Reasonable monitoring intervals would be: In CKD stage 3: For serum calcium and phosphorus, every 6–12 months; and for PTH, based on baseline level and CKD progression; in CKD stage 4: For serum calcium and phosphorus, every 3–6 months; and for PTH, every 6–12 months; in CKD stage 5, including 5D: For serum calcium and phosphorus, every 1–3 months; and for PTH, every 3–6 months; and in CKD stages 4–5D: For alkaline phosphatase activity, every 12 months or more frequently in the presence of increased PTH levels. These recommendations are applicable to the United States.

Phosphate: Role and Regulation

Role and requirements through life

Phosphorus (in the form of organic phosphate) is an essential component of cell membranes, proteins, nucleic acids, bones, and teeth, as well as having roles in the structure and function of smooth and skeletal muscles. Phosphorus‐containing compounds are also involved in the storage and release of metabolic energy (via adenosine triphosphate[ATP]), cell signaling, and normal acid–base balance.

Phosphate requirements vary with age and sex because of changing developmental and physiologic needs (Table 1). The age‐associated decline in serum phosphate levels, more predominantly shown in men after middle age, reflects changes in renal tubular phosphate reabsorption postulated by age‐dependent changes in tubular phosphate handling or levels of hormonal modulators (eg, PTH, phosphatonins, and growth hormone).

Table 1
Reference Ranges for Serum Phosphate

Regulation of phosphate homeostasis

Under normal conditions, phosphate levels are maintained by a balance between dietary phosphate intake with appropriate intestinal absorption, renal phosphate excretion through changes in renal tubular reabsorption, and the transcellular movement of phosphate between intracellular fluid and bones (Fig. 1). These processes are regulated via multiple endocrine negative feedback loops involving FGF23, PTH, and 1,25(OH)₂D (Fig. 2). Briefly, FGF23 is a key regulator of phosphate homeostasis and vitamin D metabolism that controls renal phosphate absorption and excretion. Under physiologic conditions, FGF23 is produced by osteocytes and osteoblasts in response to high phosphate intake, elevated serum phosphate levels, or elevated 1,25(OH)₂D. PTH is released from the parathyroid glands in response to low calcium levels and/or high phosphate in the blood, resulting in the production of 1,25(OH) 2 D and, potentially, FGF23. In contrast, 1,25(OH)₂D increases in response to low plasma phosphate and potentiates the capacity of the gut to absorb dietary phosphate. Maintenance of phosphate homeostasis is important throughout life as phosphate dysregulation can lead to hyperphosphatemia or hypophosphatemia, with potentially fatal complications if untreated.

### The challenge of controlling phosphorus in chronic kidney disease [^112d9gBw]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis and management of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorders (CKD-MBD) has experienced major changes, but the control of serum phosphorus at all stages of CKD still seems to be a key factor to improve clinical outcomes. High serum phosphorus is the most important uremia-related, non-traditional risk factor associated with vascular calcification in CKD patients and in the general population. Phosphorus may also be one of the key elements linking vascular calcification with low bone turnover. The main hormones and factors that contribute to the kidney regulation of phosphorus and calcium include parathyroid hormone, FGF-23, klotho and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)₂D). Serum phosphorus did not start rising until CKD 3b in contrast with the earlier changes observed with fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), Klotho, calcitriol and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Despite FGF-23 and PTH having synergic effects regarding phosphorus removal, they have opposite effects on 1,25(OH)2D3. At the same stages of CKD in which phosphorus retention appears to occur, calcium retention also occurs. As phosphorus accumulation is associated with poor outcomes, an important question without a clear answer is at which level-range should serum phosphorus be maintained at different stages of CKD to improve clinical outcomes. There are four main strategies to manage phosphate homeostasis; phosphorus dietary intake, administration of phosphate binder agents, effective control of hyperparathyroidism and to ensure in the CKD 5D setting, an adequate scheme of dialysis. Despite all the available strategies, and the introduction of new phosphate binder agents in the market, controlling serum phosphorus remains challenging, and hyperphosphatemia continues to be extremely common in CKD 5 patients. Furthermore, despite phosphate binding agents having proved to be effective in reducing serum phosphorus, their ultimate effects on clinical outcomes remain controversial. Thus, we still need well-designed, large-scale, placebo-controlled studies to definitively prove that the reduction of serum phosphorus by phosphate binders improves clinical outcomes.

### Phosphate: the new cholesterol? The role of the phosphate axis in non-uremic vascular disease [^1166JCym]. Atherosclerosis (2012). Low credibility.

Higher serum phosphate levels within the normal range are associated with substantially increased risk of cardiovascular disease events. Whether this reflects a causative relationship is unknown. Phosphate-responsive hormones (fibroblast growth factor-23, parathyroid hormone and calcitriol) are also predictors of cardiovascular mortality in populations without kidney disease or recognised disturbances of bone mineral metabolism. The high bioavailable phosphate content of Western diets may contribute to this apparent discrepancy between 'normal' and optimal phosphate axis parameters. Although uremic hyperphosphatemia is recognised to cause vascular medial calcification, this does not readily explain the association of higher-normal phosphate with common athero-occlusive phenomena. The phosphate axis may in fact play a role in atherogenesis; observational data link higher levels of phosphate and fibroblast growth factor-23 with coronary atheroma burden, whilst dietary phosphate supplementation accelerates atherosclerosis in a mouse model. In vitro studies show adverse effects of phosphate increases on both vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelium, though these observations have not yet been extended to phosphate increments within the normal range. Receptors for phosphate-responsive hormones are present throughout the cardiovascular system and may mediate atherogenic effects. Since interventions are already available to manipulate the phosphate axis, this is an important issue. If an atherogenic role for phosphate exposure is demonstrated then phosphate binders could become the new statins.

### Is serum phosphorus control related to parathyroid hormone control in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism? [^111JsTso]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

The lower serum phosphorus cut off that we explored (≤ 4.5 mg/dL) is in line with new recommendations from KDIGO to aim for near-normal serum phosphorus levels in dialysis patients. Although KDIGO have recommended a lowering of the phosphorus target range, they have also relaxed the PTH target range for a variety of reasons, including the observation that a significant proportion of patients with iPTH in the 150–300 pg/mL range have low-turnover bone disease. A recent cohort study in 22,937 dialysis patients showed that consistent control of markers of bone metabolism and disease within KDOQI targets is a strong predictor of survival in this population. Compared with those who achieved target for three variables (PTH, phosphorus and calcium), the risk of death was 51%, 35–39% and 15–21% higher in patients who achieved none, one and two of these targets. For each marker, maintaining within target for one calendar quarter or less was associated with a higher mortality risk than achieving control for four quarters: 16% higher for calcium and 34% for PTH, rising to 62% higher for phosphorus. Other data published since the KDOQI guidelines have shown improved outcomes in dialysis patients if PTH is controlled. For instance, a case control study based on the US Renal Data System found a 32% reduction in hip fracture risk after parathyroidectomy. Coronary artery calcification score in dialysis patients was also found to be independently associated with iPTH levels in the ADVANCE study. In the CORES study in 16,173 patients, both elevated and low serum levels of calcium, phosphorus and PTH were associated with increased mortality.

### Prevention and treatment of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease [^114dbP6F]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia has consistently been shown to be associated with dismal outcome in a wide variety of populations, particularly in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Compelling evidence from basic and animal studies elucidated a range of mechanisms by which phosphate may exert its pathological effects and motivated interventions to treat hyperphosphatemia. These interventions consisted of dietary modifications and phosphate binders. However, the beneficial effects of these treatment methods on hard clinical outcomes have not been convincingly demonstrated in prospective clinical trials. In addition, exposure to high amounts of dietary phosphate may exert untoward actions even in the absence of overt hyperphosphatemia. Based on this concept, it has been proposed that the same interventions used in CKD patients with normal phosphate concentrations be used in the presence of hyperphosphatemia to prevent rise of phosphate concentration and as an early intervention for cardiovascular risk. This review describes conceptual models of phosphate toxicity, summarizes the evidence base for treatment and prevention of hyperphosphatemia, and identifies important knowledge gaps in the field.

Chapter 4.1: Treatment of CKD-MBD targeted at lowering high serum phosphate and maintaining serum calcium

2009 KDIGO guideline

4.1.1: In patients with CKD stages 3–5, we suggest maintaining serum phosphorus in the normal range (2C). In patients with CKD stage 5D, we suggest lowering elevated phosphorus levels toward the normal range (2C).

2017 KDIGO update

4.1.1: In patients with CKD G3a-G5D, treatments of CKD-MBD should be based on serial assessments of phosphate, calcium, and PTH levels, considered together (Not graded).

4.1.2: In patients with CKD G3a-G5D, we suggest lowering elevated phosphate levels toward the normal range (2C).

Rationale for section 4.1.1

This revised KDIGO 2017 guidance highlights the need to ensure all variables are considered together with acknowledgement of trends, rather than specific values and is a new recommendation for KDIGO. Previous RA guidance (2015) similarly recommended making decisions based on the entire available dataset.

Targets set previously for individual parameters have been derived from observational data showing those levels associated with lowest risk of mortality / morbidity. Phosphate, calcium and PTH each have levels which may be associated with poorer outcomes however treatment strategies to address one of these often affects the others therefore any potential benefit that may be seen could be offset by a change in the other variable.

The combinations of different levels and their effect on outcome has been explored to highlight the complexity of the treatment of CKD-MBD.

### Impact of serum phosphate changes on in-hospital mortality [^112P3PjJ]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Phosphate is an essential element for calcium-phosphate-parathyroid homeostasis, which plays an essential role in many cellular metabolisms. Serum phosphate levels have been identified as strong predictors on clinical outcomes, including hospital mortality. While hypophosphatemia is shown to be independently associated with increased mortality among critically ill patients, malnourished individuals, and patients with sepsis, hyperphosphatemia is associated with poor clinical outcomes including mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD), hemodialysis, acute coronary syndrome, and general patient population.

While previous studies have focused on the impact of serum phosphate disorders (hypophosphatemia and hyperphosphatemia), knowledge about the significance of changes in serum phosphate level and all-cause mortality remains scarce. Among patients on maintenance hemodialysis, a recent study demonstrated that high variability of serum phosphate was independently correlated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, while stable serum phosphate levels and low serum phosphate variability were associated with reduced patient mortality. However, the impacts of serum phosphate changes in hospitalized patients remain unclear.

Therefore, we conducted this cohort study to assess the association between alteration of serum phosphate levels and in-hospital mortality in all hospitalized patients.

### Indications for the evaluation and supplementation of hypophosphatemia: an umbrella systematic review of reviews and guidelines [^1142NGiM]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic literature review, we identified a very heterogeneous data landscape with some well-researched topics, but overall, there is no clear consensus on when to test and when and how to supplement phosphate.

Chronic hypophosphatemia can lead to osteomalacia with debilitating symptoms and is often recognized late, which is why clinicians should be aware of this. We support the recommendation of testing phosphate in patients with ongoing unclear musculoskeletal symptoms. It is also recommended as part of osteoporosis and insufficiency fracture evaluations. There are rare genetic disorders that cause hypophosphatemia, the most studied being X-linked hypophosphatemia, which is most commonly diagnosed in childhood and needs surveillance in adulthood. It is important to note that phosphate levels can be affected by dietary intake and should best be measured as morning fasting phosphate. If the cause of chronic hypophosphatemia cannot be eliminated (surgical removal in the case of tumor-induced osteomalacia or cessation of the causative drug, see below), supplementation is commonly recommended, always in symptomatic cases, Regimens vary with some dose suggestions considering body weight, others with overall doses ranging from 150 to 2000 mg (4.8–64.5 mmol)/day, but prospective studies evaluating the optimal doses are lacking. There is consensus on the need to divide the doses, which vary from 2 to 6/day, as phosphate is absorbed and excreted rapidly. Treatment monitoring, if mentioned, is commonly recommended every 3–6 months, e.g. 3 months after treatment initiation and every 6 months when stable. Treatment goals are not always defined but are most commonly clinical improvements, as laboratory targets do not lead to better symptom control in X-linked hypophosphatemia patients but potentially to more side effects. Common side effects of phosphate supplementation include gastrointestinal symptoms, which can be managed by dose reduction and slow upward titration. Long-term supplementation can further lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism and renal complications, with some authors recommending regular laboratory monitoring and/or lower laboratory or clinical targets, as mentioned above. A new alternative treatment for FGF-23-mediated hypophosphatemia is the antibody burosumab, which is outside the scope of this review. Much more common causes of hypophosphatemia are primary hyperparathyroidism, where phosphate testing is not strictly necessary but is recommended, and vitamin D deficiency, where phosphate testing and supplementation are seen as unnecessary.

### Phosphate binders and targets over decades: Do we have it right now? [^114KCdqv]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

In advanced renal disease, the kidney is unable to maintain phosphate balance due to decreased urinary excretion as well as the imbalance of the bone metabolic axis. It is well established that hyperphosphatemia is associated with increased cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there are no randomized controlled trials that demonstrate a clear benefit on hard outcomes in lowering serum phosphate levels to recommended targets in the CKD or dialysis population. In addition, while calcium-based phosphate binders have traditionally been the standard of care in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia, data regarding the increased risk of vascular mineralization continues to emerge. Clinicians continue to search for new phosphate-lowering therapies as well as investigate novel nutritional perspectives. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes is currently revising the guidelines on phosphate goals in CKD. This review will outline the history of phosphate targets and phosphate binders, and explore innovative phosphate-lowering therapies. Based on current data, clinicians moving forward should continue to treat end-stage renal disease patients with hyperphosphatemia based on individual risk factors for vascular mineralization.

### Clinical assessment of phosphorus status, balance and renal handling in normal individuals and in patients with chronic kidney disease [^115qnCr6]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The concepts of steady state, external balance, total body status and internal distribution are not always appreciated or even considered in clinical practice. The current tests available for clinical assessment of phosphorus physiology and pathophysiology are valid in some aspects, but also have many limitations. The purpose of this review is to clarify the above concepts and discuss the utility of the currently available tests to assess phosphorus disorders.

Recent Findings

Both epidemiologic and preclinical data have shown that disturbances in mineral metabolism contribute significantly to the morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease. There are also emerging data supporting the notion that phosphotoxicity may exist even in individuals with normal renal function. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), hyperphosphatemia is a relative late event and is a suboptimal indicator of phosphorus balance and status. The judicious use of plasma and urine chemistry and hormonal biomarkers such as fibroblast growth factor 23 should be considered.

Summary

There is a dire need to increase awareness of what physiologic parameters should be monitored in terms of phosphorus pathophysiology. Although the current available tests in the clinical armamentarium are not ideal, understanding their implications and limitations will improve patient care and motivate practitioners and investigators to develop better tests.

### Sex, age, and the association of serum phosphorus with all-cause mortality in adults with normal kidney function [^111eY6F8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

High serum phosphorus levels are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in kidney disease. Although serum phosphorus levels possibly influence on mortality in individuals without kidney disease, this is uncertain because of the variable sex- and age-based distribution of serum phosphorus levels.

Study Design

Observational cohort study.

Setting & Participants

Clinical and biochemical data were collected from 138,735 adults undergoing routine health checkups in 3 tertiary hospitals. Individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rates < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and urine dipstick albumin ≥ 1+ were excluded.

Predictor

Sex-specific quartiles of serum phosphorus and sex.

Outcomes

All-cause mortality.

Results

The study included 92,756 individuals. Generally, women showed higher serum phosphorus levels than men. In women, serum phosphorus levels increased with age until 60 years old, then decreased with age. Men with higher serum phosphorus levels were younger and less likely to have hypertension, whereas women with higher serum phosphorus levels were older and more likely to have diabetes and hypertension. During a median follow-up of 75 months, 1,646 participants died. In the overall population, higher serum phosphorus levels were an independent predictor for all-cause mortality after adjustment (adjusted HR for the highest vs. lowest quartile, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.15–1.56; P < 0.001). We observed that this increased risk was present in men but not in women (adjusted HR of 1.43 [95% CI, 1.22–1.68] vs. 1.01 [95% CI, 0.76–1.33]), but interaction by sex was not significant (P = 0.8).

Limitations

A single phosphorus measurement and low power to test for interactions by sex and age.

Conclusions

We demonstrated that higher serum phosphorus levels influenced all-cause mortality in individuals with normal kidney function. Our findings suggest that the association may differ by sex, but future studies with adequate power to test for effect modification are needed to confirm our findings.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^114nncsj]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Clinical consequences of dietary phosphorus control — CKD progression and proteinuria: Three observational studies evaluated dietary phosphate restriction with limited evidence; in one trial of 90 patients over a median of 19 months, combined protein–phosphate restriction or phosphate restriction alone showed no significant effect on creatinine clearance decline versus routine care, and in an MDRD analysis greater 24-hour urinary phosphate excretion was not associated with future ESKD, whereas a Japanese retrospective study in CKD stages 2–5 linked higher baseline phosphorus excretion per creatinine to greater 3-year CKD progression risk and development of ESKD or 50% eGFR reduction. It has been proposed that hyperphosphatemia in nondialysis CKD stages 2–5 may reduce the antiproteinuric effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition; in the REIN trial (n = 331), higher phosphate levels were associated with faster progression and the renoprotective effect of ramipril decreased as phosphate increased (P = 0.008 for interaction). In a post hoc nonrandomized study, 99 proteinuric patients sequentially underwent an LPD (0.6 g/kg per day) and a VLPD (0.3 g/kg per day) for periods longer than 1 year, with 24-hour proteinuria reductions maximal in those achieving the lowest serum and urine phosphate.

Experimental studies suggest that at high serum concentrations, phosphate can induce osteogenic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells and contribute to vascular calcification. However, the precise underlying mechanism leading to cardiovascular injury is not well understood. Here we discuss how elevations in extracellular phosphate levels could potentially affect cells and intracellular reactions and functions in general. We then zoom in on the heart to discuss whether hyperphosphatemia can have direct pathologic actions beyond inducing vascular calcification. Furthermore, we discuss myocardial calcification as a pathologic event that has not been described and studied in greater detail, but that seems to occur in the context of hyperphosphatemia-induced pathologic cardiac remodeling, as observed in dialysis patients.

### Increased serum phosphate and adverse clinical outcomes: unraveling mechanisms of disease [^112Rxgxm]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Higher serum phosphate levels are associated with adverse clinical outcomes across the spectrum of kidney function. Recent epidemiologic studies have focused on identifying potential mechanisms of these associations as well as risk factors for increased serum phosphate in the general population.

Recent Findings

Higher serum phosphate levels were independently associated with coronary artery calcification, vascular stiffness, left ventricular hypertrophy, and carotid artery disease, even among individuals with normal kidney function and serum phosphate levels within the normal range. Interestingly, effect modification was observed by gender in older populations, with the strength of these associations being weaker in women than in men. In addition, socioeconomic status, sex hormone levels, and common genetic variants were found to be independent predictors of serum phosphate levels, suggesting that common demographic and biological factors may predispose to higher serum phosphate in the general population.

Summary

The association of increased serum phosphate with adverse outcomes may be mediated by a link between higher serum phosphate and subclinical vascular disease. Common environmental and biological factors may modulate these relationships, with potentially important implications for designing future interventional studies meant to assess the effect of lowering serum phosphate on long-term outcomes.

Future research — dietary phosphorus management highlights that dietary management of phosphorus is an important strategy for serum phosphate control in CKD, but the amount of evidence on the effectiveness of dietary control is low; the work group recommends future studies to better define the effect of this simple and cost-effective strategy, including to study whether dietary phosphorus restriction is able to normalize serum phosphate levels in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.

### Control of serum phosphorus: implications for coronary artery calcification and calcific uremic arteriolopathy (calciphylaxis) [^116pQMB2]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

There is mounting evidence that elevated serum phosphorus is an important cardiovascular risk factor in patients with end stage renal disease. Recent work has shown that vascular smooth muscle cells have the ability to undergo osteoblastic differentiation and produce an environment conducive to mineralization. Serum phosphorus is an important stimulator of this process and the adverse cardiovascular effects of hyperphosphatemia are most likely mediated via its ability to enhance the development of vascular calcification. Arterial calcification, whether it is intimal or medial in location, is a strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Both coronary artery calcification and calciphylaxis are prototypical examples of arterial calcification that have been associated with poor phosphate control. Furthermore, several investigators have recently suggested that the prescription of large doses of calcium to achieve phosphate control may augment, rather than diminish, the risk of vascular calcification. This is more likely to be true in the presence of low turnover bone disease, a diagnosis difficult to make with routine laboratory testing. A brief review of the molecular biology of vascular calcification supports the concept that warfarin administration may exacerbate the calcific process, particularly in the setting of hyperphosphatemia, as has been reported in patients with calciphylaxis. Recognizing the consequences of poor phosphate control, it is time to adopt strict target levels that aim to normalize serum phosphorus levels. The available evidence supports that this control should not be achieved through the use of supraphysiologic doses of supplemental calcium.

### Phosphate toxicity in CKD: the killer among Us [^111JCzAz]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Maintenance of a normal serum phosphate level depends on absorption in the gut, reabsorption and excretion by the kidney, and the flux between the extracellular and skeletal pools. Phosphate homeostasis is a coordinated, complex system of crosstalk between the bone, intestine, kidney, and parathyroid gland. Dysfunction of this system has serious clinical consequences in healthy individuals and those with conditions, such as CKD, in which hyperphosphatemia is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The last half-century of renal research has helped define the contribution of the parathyroid hormone, calcitriol, fibroblast growth factor 23, and Klotho in the regulation of phosphate. However, despite new discoveries and insights gained during this time, what remains unchanged is the recognition that phosphate retention is the initiating factor for the development of many of the complications observed in CKD, namely secondary hyperparathyroidism and bone and cardiovascular diseases. Controlling phosphate load remains the primary goal in the treatment of CKD. This review discusses the clinical effects of dysregulated phosphate metabolism, particularly in CKD, and its association with cardiovascular disease. The importance of early control of phosphate load in the treatment of CKD is emphasized, and the latest research in the treatment of phosphate retention is discussed.

Hyperphosphatemia risk thresholds and population differences in CKD: In dialysis patients, the threshold above which risk is increased varies across studies and ranges from 5.0 to 7.0 mg/dL, while in CKD stages 3–5 the risk relationship between phosphorus level and poor outcome is not found consistently; however, in some studies high-normal levels are associated with increased risk and are also seen in individuals without CKD.

### Phosphate levels and cardiovascular disease in the general population [^115au4vr]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Phosphate levels are consistently linked with cardiac calcification, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and death in populations with chronic kidney disease. In addition, mechanistic insights suggest that phosphate levels that span the conventional normal range could lead to CVD. Examining these associations in the general population may be relevant because several interventions that may be suitable for primary or secondary prevention trials already exist. This review summarizes findings described from several community-based, prospective, observational studies. Graded associations with cardiac calcification, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiovascular events, and death were evident, and cardiovascular risk seemed to accelerate with phosphate > 3.5 to 4.0 mg/dl. Although the cause of these associations remains to be determined, several existing interventions may allow in-depth examination of the hypothesis that reducing phosphate levels could prevent CVD in the general population. Even as proof-of-concept trials and mechanistic studies are awaited, phosphate levels may be useful for cardiovascular risk stratification in adults without overt kidney disease.

### Is serum phosphorus control related to parathyroid hormone control in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism? [^113e1ab6]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Serum corrected calcium levels were higher in patients who did not achieve the PTH target, both at baseline and EAP. It could be argued that a less suppressible PTH is accompanied by a higher serum calcium set-point and hence a higher serum calcium level. Alternatively, less suppressible PTH might have induced clinicians to use higher doses of vitamin D, with a consequent increase in serum calcium. Patients showed biochemical evidence of high bone turnover at baseline, as indicated by their elevated PTH and alkaline phosphatase values. Alkaline phosphatase activity decreased by a similar amount in the two PTH achievement categories.

As this is a post-hoc analysis, it is difficult to establish causality for the serum phosphorus changes observed in OPTIMA. There were no checks for dietary control and compliance in the study and nutritional markers were not studied. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that improved dietary compliance could have played a part in the serum phosphorus reduction in some patients. Bone biopsies were not performed in OPTIMA and bone turnover markers other than PTH and alkaline phosphatase were not studied. Moreover, as analyses were conducted at local laboratories, assay methods were not standardized.

PTH is known to mobilize calcium and phosphorus from bone and evidence to support the hypothesis that improved PTH control leads to improved serum phosphorus control is accumulating. Substantial decreases in serum phosphorus levels have been observed in patients who undergo parathyroidectomy for advanced SHPT. It is common to see decreases in the early postoperative period, with sustained improvement in phosphorus control thereafter. In addition, it has recently been shown that direct infusion of PTH leads to a significant rise in serum phosphorus in dialysis patients, especially in those with high-turnover bone disease. This increase can be observed after several hours of infusion and during the fasting state, supporting a primary role for PTH-induced bone resorption as the mechanism for the increased phosphorus levels. Moreover, analysis of PTH evolution over time also shows that increases in PTH are associated with an increase in serum phosphorus and vice versa. These findings raise the question as to whether increased serum phosphorus levels are stimulating parathyroid gland function, or whether hyperparathyroidism is leading to worsened phosphorus control via increased bone resorption. It is likely that both of these pathophysiological mechanisms operate in a vicious cycle in end-stage renal disease. Indeed, recent studies have documented the efficacy of cinacalcet in reducing increased total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase.

### How to evaluate phosphate control in patients on dialysis [^116PVc8q]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

IMPORTANCE OF PHOSPHATE REGULATION IN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

Hyperphosphatemia is associated with negative consequences (e.g. vascular calcification), and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease, the primary cause of mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Phosphate control to more normal levels of 4.5 mg/dL correlates with improved survival. Both the magnitude of phosphate elevation above the target range (2.5–4.5 mg/dL) and time spent with above-target phosphate levels corresponds to increased CV morbidity/mortality. Thus, reduction and maintenance of serum phosphate toward more normal levels is an established clinical practice guideline: KDOQI guidelines recommend a target of 3.5–5.5 mg/dL in patients with CKD Stage 5 on dialysis, and KDIGO guidelines recommend targeting phosphate 'towards normal' levels.

Consistently achieving and maintaining phosphate levels < 5.5 mg/dL, let alone more normal levels, is an ongoing clinical challenge, and phosphate control in clinical practice has not improved in almost a decade. Novel approaches that more accurately assess phosphate control may allow clinicians to be more responsive to patients' needs, potentially improving patient outcomes.

### Genetic evidence for a causal role of serum phosphate in coronary artery calcification: the rotterdam study [^116SufJr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

To conclude, we hereby provide both frequentist and Bayesian evidence from the MR approach that normal phosphate is a causative factor in CAC in the general population without hyperphosphatemia, without prevalent CVD and with normal kidney function. We add more evidence to support the concept of phosphotoxicity, and our results call for a review of the current normal serum phosphate range. We agree with the European Food and Safety Agencythat more research is needed to study the relationships between dietary intake of phosphate and serum phosphate levels and adverse health outcomes. Public health policies might be needed to decrease phosphate intake because of the growing evidence of phosphate as a continuous risk factor for adverse outcomes such as atherosclerosis, CVD mortality, and, now, CAC. Further research should focus on unveiling the underlying mechanisms of the detrimental effects of phosphate in human health and to establish a threshold above which phosphate must be considered harmful for men and women, especially because a large fraction of the population appears to be exposed to nonsafe P levels.

### Hyperphosphataemia as a cardiovascular risk factor – how to manage the problem [^117Bggig]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphataemia is a frequent and important cardiovascular risk factor in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). High phosphate levels may influence vascular calcifications by two separate mechanisms: by worsening secondary hyperparathyroidism, which in turn facilitates calcification, and by promoting calcium phosphate deposition in pre-formed endothelial plaques and in the arterial wall. Recent studies have shown that hyperphosphataemia induces the proliferation and differentiation of endothelial vascular cells into osteoblast-like cells, promoting vascular calcification. High phosphate levels also increase the risk of mortality in patients with CKD. To reduce the negative impact of high phosphate, serum phosphate levels should be < 5 mg/dl and serum calcium < 10 mg/dl. This allows the calcium × phosphate product to be maintained at ≤ 50 mg²/dl², reducing the risk of vascular, valvular, and extraskeletal calcification. A multiple-factor approach can be used to reduce serum phosphate: (i). decrease bone resorption by maintaining adequate serum parathyroid hormone levels; (ii). reduce phosphorous intake in the diet, (iii). use phosphate binders efficiently; and (iv). avoid under-dialysis. The patient's diet should be high in nutrition but with the lowest possible phosphorous content. Doses of phosphate binders should be tailored to individual dietary habits and must be taken during meals in a dose proportional to the phosphorous content of the meal. Because of the risk of increased extraskeletal calcification, calcium-containing phosphate-binder intake should not exceed 2–3 g/day. Sevelamer hydrochloride, a non-calcium and non-aluminium phosphate binder with a potency similar to that of calcium salts has shown beneficial effects on lipid profiles. Better control of serum phosphate is achieved in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis than in those on haemodialysis. Removal of phosphate is directly correlated with duration and frequency of dialysis sessions. Thus, it is advisable not to reduce the duration of dialysis sessions to < 4 h three times per week.

Chapter 4.1: Treatment of CKD-MBD targeted at lowering high serum phosphate and maintaining serum calcium

Guidelines 4.1.1–4.1.2

We suggest that the treatment of CKD-MBD in all stages of CKD should be based on serial measurements (trends) of phosphate, calcium and PTH and individualised to patients.

In patients with CKD 3a-5D, a pragmatic and individualised approach to phosphate reduction towards the normal range is appropriate in the UK.

Guideline 4.1.3

In patients with CKD G3a-G5D, we suggest avoidance of hypercalcaemia, maintaining serum calcium below the upper limit of the reference range for the laboratory used. Hypocalcaemia should be managed in an individualised way as over-correction may also lead to patient harm.

Guideline 4.1.4

In patients with CKD G5D, we suggest using a dialysate calcium concentration between 1.25 and 1.5 mmol/l but, as stated in the original KDIGO document, flexibility should be maintained with dialysate calcium concentrations to meet specific, individual patient requirements.

Guideline 4.1.5

We suggest that phosphate binders should not be used pre-emptively in CKD G3a-G5D patients but reserved for those with progressively rising or persistently elevated serum phosphate. Phosphate lowering requires a multi-professional approach to therapy.

Guideline 4.1.6

In patients with CKD stages G3a-5D, we suggest limiting the use of calcium-based phosphate binders. Whilst calcium-based phosphate binders still have a role in the management of hyperphosphataemia in adults with CKD, their place as first line agents in the majority can no longer be recommended, especially as generic, lower cost alternatives for non-calcium containing binders are becoming more widely available.

Guideline 4.1.8

We suggest that limiting phosphate intake in patients with CKD G3a-5D remains integral in the management of hyperphosphataemia. With more information available about phosphate in food and its bioavailability, advice should be evidence-based, personalised and ideally delivered by Specialist Renal Dietitians.

### Renal association commentary on the KDIGO (2017) clinical practice guideline update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and treatment of CKD-MBD [^111vaQ7J]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale for section 4.1.2

KDIGO 2009 suggested that in CKD G3a-G5, efforts should be made to maintain serum phosphate in the normal range compared to actively lowering levels towards normal in those on dialysis G5D; the update unifies the recommendation across groups.

Despite good evidence supporting the association of higher phosphate levels with mortality across all CKD groups, there is still a lack of evidence supporting the benefits of treatment.

Previous KDIGO targets recommended that for CKD G3a-G5, phosphate levels should be maintained in the normal range. In practice, for many, this translated into aiming for levels within the normal range i.e. address hyperphosphataemia with diet and binders – there is a subtle difference.

The new recommendation has arisen as a consequence of new data in people with CKD G3a-G5 not on dialysis. A study looking at the effect of binders (calcium acetate, lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate) vs. placebo in people with eGFR 25–40 ml/min and normal/near normal serum phosphate levels demonstrated a reduction of serum phosphate from mean 4.2 mg/dl to 3.9 mg/dl (1.34 to 1.26 mmol/l) in those treated with phosphate binders compared to unchanged levels in the placebo group. This was supported by reduction in phosphate excretion. Benefits were also seen in PTH levels which remained stable in the phosphate binder group (more so in the calcium acetate group) compared to an increase in levels seen in the placebo group. However, the same study demonstrated increases in calcification scores in the active treatment (phosphate binder) group than with placebo – it was most pronounced in the calcium acetate group but was still present in those taking non-calcium containing binders. It should be noted that those with a zero-calcification score at baseline, regardless of randomisation, remained unchanged as has been seen in previous studies.

### Consequences of hyperphosphatemia and elevated levels of the calcium-phosphorus product in dialysis patients [^115yQQJ1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Control of serum phosphorus levels is a central goal in the management of patients with chronic renal failure. Inadequate control of serum phosphorus leads to elevated levels of the calcium-phosphorus product. This plays a pivotal role in vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease, calciphylaxis, and death. Elevated phosphorus and elevated levels of the calcium-phosphorus product are both significant predictors of cardiovascular mortality, at phosphorus and calcium-phosphorus product levels that were considered safe until recently. A lowering of levels such that phosphorus is maintained between 2.2 and 5.5 mg/dl, calcium-phosphorus product is below 55 mg²/dl², and serum calcium is at 9.2–9.6 mg/dl, respectively, might well be the goal of therapeutic management strategies.

### The role of phosphate in kidney disease [^116aKjt5]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2017). Medium credibility.

The importance of phosphate homeostasis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been recognized for decades, but novel insights - which are frequently relevant to everyday clinical practice - continue to emerge. Epidemiological data consistently indicate an association between hyperphosphataemia and poor clinical outcomes. Moreover, compelling evidence suggests direct toxicity of increased phosphate concentrations. Importantly, serum phosphate concentration has a circadian rhythm that must be considered when interpreting patient phosphate levels. Detailed understanding of dietary sources of phosphate, including food additives, can enable phosphate restriction without risking protein malnutrition. Dietary counselling provides an often underestimated opportunity to target the increasing exposure to dietary phosphate of both the general population and patients with CKD. In patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, bone can be an important source of serum phosphate, and adequate appreciation of this fact should impact treatment. Dietary and pharmotherapeutic interventions are efficacious strategies to lower phosphate intake and serum concentration. However, strong evidence that targeting serum phosphate improves patient outcomes is currently lacking. Future studies are, therefore, required to investigate the effects of modern dietary and pharmacological interventions on clinically meaningful end points.

### Approach to patients with hypophosphataemia [^117LCpxS]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Phosphate metabolism is an evolving area of basic and clinical research. In the past 15 years, knowledge on disturbances of phosphate homoeostasis has expanded, as has the discovery of new targeted therapies. Hypophosphataemia might be the biochemical finding in several diseases, and its clinical evaluation should initially focus on the assessment of pathophysiological mechanisms leading to low serum phosphate concentrations. Clinical consequences of hypophosphataemia can involve multiple organ systems and vary depending on several factors, the most important being the underlying disorder. This Review focuses on the approach to patients with hypophosphataemia and how underlying pathophysiological mechanisms should be understood in the evaluation of differential diagnosis. We define an algorithm for the assessment of hypophosphataemia and review the most up-to-date literature on specific therapies. Continuous research in this area will result in a better understanding and management of patients with hypophosphataemia.

### Balancing nutrition and serum phosphorus in maintenance dialysis [^111rfys2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Elevated serum phosphorus levels are common in patients with chronic kidney disease and are associated with heart and vascular disease, conditions that in turn are associated with increased mortality. Accurately managing phosphorus intake by restricting dietary protein alone can prove challenging because protein from different sources can contain varying amounts of available phosphorus. Additives used in processed foods frequently are high in inorganic phosphorus, which is readily absorbed, compounding this difficulty. Recent evidence suggests that dietary protein restriction in some cases may do more harm than good in some patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis because protein restriction can lead to protein-energy wasting, which is associated with increased mortality. Accordingly, phosphorus binders are important for managing hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients. Managing hyperphosphatemia in patients with late-stage chronic kidney disease requires an individualized approach, involving a combination of adequate dietary advice, phosphate-binder use, and adjustments to dialysis prescription. We speculate that increased use of phosphate binders could allow patients to eat more protein-rich foods and that communicating this to patients might increase their perception of their need for phosphate binders, providing an incentive to improve adherence. The aim of this review is to discuss the challenges involved in maintaining adequate nutrition while controlling phosphorus levels in patients on maintenance hemodialysis therapy.

### Is there an association between elevated or low serum levels of phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, and calcium and mortality in patients with end stage renal disease? A meta-analysis [^114Mzasc]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our literature review shows that most studies found a significant relationship between serum levels of PTH, calcium, and phosphorus and mortality even though a sizeable number naively modeled these variables as linear predictors. Another large group of studies only examined these variables as binary variables, which is a methodologically weak approach. For example, Phelan et al. found no relationship between PTH above and below 300 pg/ml and mortality. Interestingly, they correctly deduced that this result may be because very high PTH values could have "cancelled out" very low PTH values and both extremes may be harmful. However, they did not take corrective actions (eg, more categories, spline functions) in their methods. We also rarely encountered a paper that reported explicit power calculations, which is important given that categorizing a variable reduces power. Thus, it is important to acknowledge that the statistical methods used in the literature may be insufficient and the results should be cautiously interpreted.

In our meta-analysis, higher-than-referent (often "normal") serum levels of PTH, calcium, and phosphorus in dialysis patients were positively associated with increased mortality. For lower-than-referent values, findings were less consistent across the 3 selected parameters; we observed no significant association for phosphorus and PTH and reduced mortality for relatively low values of calcium. The correlation between increased mortality and elevated biochemical parameter values was expected based on the assumption that levels within a "normal" range represent optimal health. The lack of statistical significance for lower values of phosphorus and PTH may be partly attributable to the small numbers of dialysis patients with sub-referent levels, leading to low statistical power. Although low serum calcium is not typically considered "healthy", the association with significantly lower mortality risk is not completely surprising and may be explained by lower vascular calcification and associated mortality.

### Association of single and serial measures of serum phosphorus with adverse outcomes in patients on peritoneal dialysis: results from the international PDOPPS [^117BB1mE]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

While high serum phosphorus levels have been related to adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients, further investigation is warranted in persons receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD).

Methods

Longitudinal data (2014–17) from the Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (PDOPPS), a prospective cohort study, were used to examine associations of serum phosphorus with all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events via Cox regression adjusted for confounders. Serum phosphorus levels were parameterized by four methods: (i) baseline serum phosphorus; (ii) mean 6-month serum phosphorus; (iii) number of months with serum phosphorus > 4.5 mg/dL; and (iv) mean area-under-the-curve of 6-month serum phosphorus control.

Results

The study included 5847 PD patients from seven countries; 9% of patients had baseline serum phosphorus < 3.5 mg/dL, 24% had serum phosphorus ≥ 3.5 to ≤ 4.5 mg/dL, 30% had serum phosphorus > 4.5 to < 5.5 mg/dL, 20% had serum phosphorus ≥ 5.5 to < 6.5 mg/dL, and 17% had serum phosphorus ≥ 6.5 mg/dL. Compared with patients with baseline serum phosphorus ≥ 3.5 to ≤ 4.5 mg/dL, the adjusted all-cause mortality hazard ratio (HR) was 1.19 (0.92,1.53) for patients with baseline serum phosphorus ≥ 5.5 to < 6.5 mg/dL and HR was 1.53 (1.14,2.05) for serum phosphorus ≥ 6.5 mg/dL. Associations between serum phosphorus measurements over 6 months and clinical outcomes were even stronger than for a single measurement.

Conclusions

Serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL was highly prevalent (37%) in PD patients, and higher serum phosphorus levels were a strong predictor of morbidity and death, particularly when considering serial phosphorus measurements. This highlights the need for improved treatment strategies in this population. Serial serum phosphorus measurements should be considered when assessing patients' risks of adverse outcomes.

### Importance of hyperphosphataemia in the cardio-renal axis [^114qWjUD]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphataemia occurs in nearly all patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In the past, the need to manage hyperphosphataemia focused primarily on its role as a contributor to secondary hyperparathyroidism and renal osteodystrophy. There is now widespread recognition that disturbances in phosphorus metabolism and/or the therapeutic measures used to manage it are important risk factors for cardiovascular calcification. This serious complication of chronic kidney disease may contribute to the very high mortality rate from cardiovascular causes in patients undergoing long-term dialysis. New strategies for controlling serum phosphorus levels and for better management of mineral metabolism in general are required to address these issues in patients with ESRD.

### Serum phosphorus and progression of CKD and mortality: a meta-analysis of cohort studies [^112J78n4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have indicated that phosphorus may play an independent pathogenic role in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, but some of those studies were underpowered and yielded inconsistent results.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting & Population

Non-dialysis-dependent patients with CKD (transplant recipients were excluded).

Selection Criteria For Studies

Studies assessing the risk ratio of serum phosphorus level on kidney failure and mortality for non-dialysis-dependent patients with CKD published from January 1950 to June 2014 were included following systematic searching of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library.

Predictor

Serum phosphorus level.

Outcome

Kidney failure, defined as doubled serum creatinine level, 50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, or end-stage kidney disease.

Results

In 12 cohort studies with 25,546 patients, 1,442 (8.8%) developed kidney failure and 3,089 (13.6%) died. Overall, every 1-mg/dL increase in serum phosphorus level was associated independently with increased risk of kidney failure (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.20–1.55) and mortality (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.05–1.37).

Limitations

Existence of potential residual confounding could not be excluded.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis suggests an independent association between serum phosphorus level and kidney failure and mortality among non-dialysis-dependent patients with CKD and suggests that large-scale randomized controlled trials should target disordered phosphorus homeostasis in CKD.

CKD-MBD phosphate-lowering strategies — guideline statement 4.1.5 states that in patients with CKD G3a-G5D, decisions about phosphate-lowering treatment should be based on progressively or persistently elevated serum phosphate (Not Graded).

### Association of single and serial measures of serum phosphorus with adverse outcomes in patients on peritoneal dialysis: results from the international PDOPPS [^115wUax9]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What is already known about this subject?

High serum phosphorus levels are associated with adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients.
Different mechanisms exist for phosphorus elimination in peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis; peritoneal dialysis patients may have lower phosphorus clearance and thus are exposed to higher time-averaged serum phosphorus concentrations.
Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for the care of peritoneal dialysis patients do not mention treatment for hyperphosphatemia in detail, or any mineral and bone disorder–specific actions.

What this study adds?

High serum phosphorus (> 5.5 mg/dL) was highly prevalent (37%) in this large international cohort of peritoneal dialysis patients.
Higher levels of serum phosphorus were strongly associated with clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events.
When considering serial measurements of serum phosphorus rather than a single baseline measure, the associations with adverse events were even stronger.

What impact this may have on practice or policy?

The high prevalence of hyperphosphatemia highlights the need for improved treatment strategies in the peritoneal dialysis population.
Serial measurements, rather than the single most recent value, of serum phosphorus should be considered when assessing peritoneal dialysis patients' risks of adverse outcomes.

The study included 5847 PD patients from seven countries; 9% of patients had baseline serum phosphorus < 3.5 mg/dL, 24% had serum phosphorus ≥ 3.5 to ≤ 4.5 mg/dL, 30% had serum phosphorus > 4.5 to < 5.5 mg/dL, 20% had serum phosphorus ≥ 5.5 to < 6.5 mg/dL, and 17% had serum phosphorus ≥ 6.5 mg/dL. Compared with patients with baseline serum phosphorus ≥ 3.5 to ≤ 4.5 mg/dL, the adjusted all-cause mortality hazard ratio (HR) was 1.19 (0.92,1.53) for patients with baseline serum phosphorus ≥ 5.5 to < 6.5 mg/dL and HR was 1.53 (1.14,2.05) for serum phosphorus ≥ 6.5 mg/dL. Associations between serum phosphorus measurements over 6 months and clinical outcomes were even stronger than for a single measurement.

Conclusions

Serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL was highly prevalent (37%) in PD patients, and higher serum phosphorus levels were a strong predictor of morbidity and death, particularly when considering serial phosphorus measurements. This highlights the need for improved treatment strategies in this population. Serial serum phosphorus measurements should be considered when assessing patients' risks of adverse outcomes.

### Should phosphate management be limited to the KDIGO / KDOQI guidelines? [^115SCejh]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is a common complication of CKD. Prior to development of overt hyperphosphatemia, there are several adaptive mechanisms that occur to maintain normal phosphorus equilibrium in patients with CKD. These include an early and progressive rise in fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF 23), followed by an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) with a decrease in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25 Vit D). Over the last 20 years, a large number of studies have shown that hyperphosphatemia is a strong predictor of adverse clinical outcomes including increased incidence of vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality in both individuals with CKD as well as those with normal kidney function. In addition, elevations of both FGF 23 and PTH are independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, phosphorus lowering therapies are a vital part of the treatment strategy for patients with CKD and include dietary phosphorus restriction, treatment with phosphate binders and removal with dialysis. However, there has been a lack of high quality evidence demonstrating beneficial effects of phosphate lowering therapy on clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we do not have definitive data as to whether effective phosphate control with phosphate binders will prevent elevations in FGF 23, and whether lowering FGF 23 levels will lead to improved patient outcomes. As a result of the presently available data (or lack thereof) clinical guidelines recommend treatment only after hyperphosphatemia develops and in dialysis patients; KDOQI recommends a treatment target of less than 5.5 mg/dL, whereas KDIGO recommends treating "towards normal". We are left with a clinical dilemma, being whether these recommendations are adequate, or should we be more aggressive in phosphate management. In this article, our goal is to discuss some of the studies concerning the adverse consequences of phosphate excess and as well as elevated FGF 23 levels, and present our opinion on what we believe the goal of treatment should be.

### An expert perspective on phosphate dysregulation with a focus on chronic hypophosphatemia [^112toqZb]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Because of their rarity, diseases characterized by chronic hypophosphatemia can be underrecognized and suboptimally managed, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. Moreover, serum phosphate may not be measured routinely in primary care practice. Authors participated in several working sessions to advance the understanding of phosphate homeostasis and the causes, consequences, and clinical implications of chronic hypophosphatemia. Phosphate levels are regulated from birth to adulthood. Dysregulation of phosphate homeostasis can result in hypophosphatemia, which becomes chronic if phosphate levels cannot be normalized. Chronic hypophosphatemia may be underrecognized as serum phosphate measurement is not always part of routine analysis in the primary care setting and results might be misinterpreted, for instance, due to age-specific differences not being accounted for and circadian variations. Clinical consequences of chronic hypophosphatemia involve disordered endocrine regulation, affect multiple organ systems, and vary depending on patient age and the underlying disorder. Signs and symptoms of chronic hypophosphatemic diseases that manifest during childhood or adolescence persist into adulthood if the disease is inadequately managed, resulting in an accumulation of clinical deficits and a progressive, debilitating impact on quality of life. Early identification and diagnosis of patients with chronic hypophosphatemia is crucial, and clinical management should be started as soon as possible to maximize the likelihood of improving health outcomes. Furthermore, in the absence of a universally accepted description for "chronic hypophosphatemia", a definition is proposed here that aims to raise awareness of these diseases, facilitate diagnosis, and guide optimal phosphate management strategies by improving monitoring and assessment of patient response to treatment. © 2021 The Authors.

### Hyperphosphatemia and risks of acute kidney injury, end-stage renal disease, and mortality in hospitalized patients [^111UroGY]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperphosphatemia is associated with vascular calcification and bone mineral disorders and is a major concern among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the relationship between hyperphosphatemia and renal outcome in non-CKD patients has not been studied. Furthermore, the clinical implications of hyperphosphatemia in relation to the risks of acute kidney injury (AKI), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and mortality after hospitalization remain unresolved.

Methods

A total of 20,686 patients (aged ≥ 18 years) admitted to Seoul National University Bundang Hospital from January 2013 to December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into quartiles according to serum phosphorus level at the time of admission. The odds ratios (ORs) for AKI and hazard ratios (HRs) for ESRD and all-cause mortality were calculated after adjustment of multiple covariates.

Results

AKI developed in 2319 patients (11.2%), with higher ORs for patients in the third and fourth quartiles (1.4 [1.24–1.68] and 2.8 [2.44–3.22], respectively) compared with the first quartile group. During a median follow-up period of 4.0 years, 183 patients (0.88%) developed ESRD and 3675 patients (17.8%) died. Patients in the fourth quartile had higher risks of ESRD and mortality than patients in the first quartile (HRs, 2.3 [1.46–3.75] and 1.4 [1.22–1.49], respectively). These trends remained consistent in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate > 60 ml/min/1.73 m².

Conclusions

Hyperphosphatemia is related to the risks of AKI, ESRD, and mortality, and it may therefore be necessary to monitor serum phosphorus level in hospitalized patients, irrespective of kidney function.

### Chronic kidney disease CKD: guideline recommendations and supporting information (2020) [^113U2vfg]. AND (2020). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — phosphorus intake with hypophosphatemia — for posttransplantation adults with hypophosphatemia, it is reasonable to consider prescribing high-phosphorus intake (diet or supplements) in order to replete serum phosphate (OPINION), Rating: Consensus Conditional. The serum phosphate level at which supplementation should be considered in these patients or the dose of replacement to be given is, however, not well studied, and should be decided based on patient needs and clinical judgment. In kidney transplant patients, one small randomized controlled trial examined the effects of 12-week dietary phosphorus supplementation by means of a neutral phosphate salt (disodium phosphate) in patients with early post-transplantation hypophosphatemia, observed that, compared to sodium chloride, supplementation of phosphorus improved hypophosphatemia as well as adenosine triphosphate in the muscles and the acid excretion capacity of the kidney, and noted that no adverse effects on serum calcium and PTH concentrations were noted during intervention.

### Association of single and serial measures of serum phosphorus with adverse outcomes in patients on peritoneal dialysis: results from the international PDOPPS [^114rYRnA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

It is well established that high levels of serum phosphorus are associated with worse outcomes in patients receiving hemodialysis (HD), but evidence is scant among patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy. Guidelines for the care of patients on PD do not mention treatment for hyperphosphatemia in detail, and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) does not mention any mineral and bone disorder (MBD)-specific actions for patients receiving PD.

Despite having higher levels of residual kidney function compared with patients on HD, people receiving PD may have lower phosphorus clearance and thus are exposed to higher time-averaged serum phosphorus concentrations. A recent retrospective cohort study by Wu et al. showed that abnormalities in serum phosphorus levels in 1662 patients commencing PD at a single center in China were associated with increased rates of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. However, this study was limited by potential lack of generalizability to other centers and regions. Moreover, only baseline serum phosphorus levels were evaluated, such that there was no assessment of the relationship between serial phosphorus measurements and clinical outcomes.

Due to the lack of evidence for adverse effects of high phosphorus levels in patients receiving PD and the different mechanisms that exist for phosphorous elimination in PD compared with HD, we evaluated the association between serum phosphorus and adverse clinical outcomes in patients receiving PD, and explored results parameterizing serum phosphorus as a single baseline value compared with serial measures over a 6-month time period.

Conclusion

Hyperphosphatemia is associated to the risks of AKI, ESRD, and mortality among hospitalized patients.

### Hyperphosphatemia in patients with ESRD: assessing the current evidence linking outcomes with treatment adherence [^1131kQ6F]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

In recent years, the imbalance in phosphate homeostasis in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been the subject of much research. It appears that, while hyperphosphatemia may be a tangible indicator of deteriorating kidney function, lack of phosphate homeostasis may also be associated with the increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality that has become a hallmark of ESRD. The need to maintain phosphorus concentrations within a recommended range is reflected in evidence-based guidelines. However, these do not reflect serum phosphorus concentrations achieved by most patients in clinical practice. Given this discrepancy, it is important to consider ways in which dietary restriction of phosphorus intake and, in particular, use of phosphate binders in patients with ESRD can be made more effective. Poor adherence is common in patients with ESRD and has been associated with inadequate control of serum phosphorus concentrations. Studies indicate that, among other factors, major reasons for poor adherence to phosphate binder therapy include high pill burden and patients' lack of understanding of their condition and its treatment. This review examines available evidence, seeking to understand fully the reasons underlying poor adherence in patients with ESRD and consider possible strategies for improving adherence in clinical practice.

### The role of the gastrointestinal tract in phosphate homeostasis in health and chronic kidney disease [^116ahzGQ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

THE ROLE OF PHOSPHATE IN VASCULAR CALCIFICATION IN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

Hyperphosphatemia is a serious consequence of late stage CKD, leading to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients on dialysis. Normalization of serum phosphate levels has, therefore, been a clinical target in patients with CKD. However, as serum phosphate concentration represents a dynamic balance between intestinal phosphate absorption, renal phosphate excretion, and exchange between bone and extracellular storage pools, measurement of serum phosphate may not always be indicative of phosphate imbalance or total body phosphate load. Indeed, a recent short-term study of calcium and phosphate balance in patients with stage 3/4 CKD found no evidence for a significant net positive balance in phosphate (or calcium). That serum phosphate levels alone are not a good index of altered phosphate homeostasis is also highlighted by the finding that vascular calcification can occur in early CKD when phosphate levels are normal or near normal, and by the finding that fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) and Klotho may change even earlier in CKD, possibly independent of phosphate, and are potential predictors of vascular calcification and mortality in their own right. In addition, a recent study has demonstrated that even when serum phosphate levels are within the normal range, high serum FGF-23 concentrations combined with a low urinary fractional phosphate excretion are strongly associated with higher mortality and cardiovascular events, and that simultaneous measurement of these two parameters may also be predictors of patient outcome.

### Management of secondary hyperparathyroidism: the importance and the challenge of controlling parathyroid hormone levels without elevating calcium, phosphorus, and calcium-phosphorus product [^114qbnqA]. American Journal of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that can lead to clinically significant bone disease. Additional consequences of secondary HPT, such as soft-tissue and vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease, and calcific uremic arteriolopathy, may contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among CKD patients. Secondary HPT arises from disturbances in calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D and parathyroid hormone metabolism, which develop early in the course of CKD and become more prominent as kidney function declines. The standard therapies currently recommended to correct mineral metabolism and bone disease in these patients include calcium supplementation, dietary phosphorus restriction, phosphate-binding agents, and treatment with vitamin D sterols. However, such medications often have significant effects on the serum levels of calcium and phosphorus, which result in exacerbation of the disease and significant extraskeletal morbidity and mortality. Thus, there is a need to identify more effective treatment approaches. This review discusses the pathophysiology of secondary HPT, the challenges faced in the management of this disorder, and the impact of current treatment options on patients' risks of morbidity and mortality. In addition, the development of new, more physiologically relevant therapies, which may lead to successful management of secondary HPT, is reviewed.

### Is serum phosphorus control related to parathyroid hormone control in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism? [^116jcit6]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is accompanied by progressively impaired metabolism of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D, eventually leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), a clinical syndrome of abnormal mineral and bone metabolism and extraskeletal calcifications that is associated with an increased risk of bone fractures, cardiovascular morbidity and death.

As elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), phosphorus and calcium have all been linked with increased morbidity and mortality in dialysis (CKD stage 5D) patients, the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-K/DOQI™ [KDOQI TM) in 2003 recommended stringent targets for intact PTH (iPTH; 150–300 pg/mL), calcium (8.4–9.5 mg/dL) and phosphorus (3.5–5.5 mg/dL) for this population of patients. With increasing awareness of the key contribution of elevated serum phosphorus to vascular calcification and cardiovascular morbidity, more recent guidelines from the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group have highlighted the importance of tight control of serum phosphorus and calcium. KDIGO suggest that levels as close to normal as possible should be aimed for in dialysis patients and that the choice of pharmacological treatment should be influenced by these parameters.

### Is there an association between elevated or low serum levels of phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, and calcium and mortality in patients with end stage renal disease? A meta-analysis [^1135uSRe]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Finally, the historical approach to altered mineral metabolism has been somewhat reductionist as studies tend to evaluate individual biochemical parameters in isolation and assume independence across those parameters. Unfortunately, a more comprehensive approach that explores the interactions between biochemical parameters for mortality effects has not been well researched. While some studies reported data on calcium-phosphorus product, not all investigated the extent to which their results showed interaction between calcium and phosphorus, and the main effects of calcium and phosphorus were not always reported, which is a major methodological shortcoming. Therefore, our meta-analysis did not consider interactions. The lack of investigation of interactions further hinders direct applicability of the results of observational studies to determine the quantitative targets of practice guidelines.

### Phosphate in cardiovascular disease: from new insights into molecular mechanisms to clinical implications [^113ko7yp]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is a common feature in patients with impaired kidney function and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. This phenomenon extends to the general population, whereby elevations of serum phosphate within the normal range increase risk; however, the mechanism by which this occurs is multifaceted, and many aspects are poorly understood. Less than 1% of total body phosphate is found in the circulation and extracellular space, and its regulation involves multiple organ cross talk and hormones to coordinate absorption from the small intestine and excretion by the kidneys. For phosphate to be regulated, it must be sensed. While mostly enigmatic, various phosphate sensors have been elucidated in recent years. Phosphate in the circulation can be buffered, either through regulated exchange between extracellular and cellular spaces or through chelation by circulating proteins (ie, fetuin-A) to form calciprotein particles, which in themselves serve a function for bulk mineral transport and signaling. Either through direct signaling or through mediators like hormones, calciprotein particles, or calcifying extracellular vesicles, phosphate can induce various cardiovascular disease pathologies: most notably, ectopic cardiovascular calcification but also left ventricular hypertrophy, as well as bone and kidney diseases, which then propagate phosphate dysregulation further. Therapies targeting phosphate have mostly focused on intestinal binding, of which appreciation and understanding of paracellular transport has greatly advanced the field. However, pharmacotherapies that target cardiovascular consequences of phosphate directly, such as vascular calcification, are still an area of great unmet medical need.

### Phosphate homeostasis in CKD: report of a scientific symposium sponsored by the National Kidney Foundation [^1174nLva]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder is associated with diverse metabolic and endocrine disturbances that ultimately may contribute to further loss of kidney function, bone demineralization, and fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events. Recent insights into the pathophysiology of the events that unfold during the development of this disorder suggest that disturbances in phosphate metabolism are pivotal. The consequences of abnormal phosphate homeostasis are evident at estimated glomerular filtration rates < 70 mL/min/1.73 m(2), long before serum phosphate levels increase. Healthy individuals with blood phosphate levels in the top quartile of the normal range have an increased risk of developing CKD, reaching end-stage renal disease, and experiencing cardiovascular events. Substantial public health consequences may be related to increased dietary phosphorus exposure from additives that contain phosphate in the food supply and from modest increases in serum phosphate levels; however, it remains to be established whether interventions aimed at these targets can impact on the development of adverse clinical outcomes. Current approaches involving dietary intervention and intestinal phosphate binders are based on principles and assumptions that need to be examined more rigorously. Compelling animal, observational, and clinical data indicate that interventions directed at lowering phosphate exposure and serum phosphate levels should be subject to rigorous clinical trials that use appropriate placebo comparators and focus on key clinical outcomes, such as cardiovascular events, progression of CKD, fractures, quality of life, and mortality.

### New developments in the management of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease [^11622aDv]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is a characteristic complication of significant chronic kidney disease. Elevated serum phosphorous is associated with reduced survival. Hyperphosphatemia has long been recognized as predisposing to uremic bone disease and disorders of parathyroid function. Furthermore, elevated serum phosphate has been implicated particularly in the development of cardiovascular structural and functional abnormalities. Given the limitations of restricting phosphate in the diet and the inadequate removal by conventional dialysis regimes, nephrologists rely on the use of additional medications to control serum levels (currently oral phosphate binders). This review focuses on new agents and therapeutic approaches dealing with hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease, that are not currently licensed and available in routine clinical practise. This article attempts to review therapies under development and considers additional effects that the next generation of agents may bring over and above those already within the therapeutic armamentarium.
