## Question

Cardiac contusion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cardiac contusion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and the spectrum of blunt cardiac injury. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why the right ventricle is disproportionately affected. Next, I will review clinical presentation and risk stratification. After that, I need to appraise diagnostic tests, including ECG, troponins, echocardiography, CT, and MRI, and reconcile guideline differences. Then, I will outline management principles, including monitoring, hemodynamic support, and when to operate. Finally, I should consider special populations, prognostic factors, and synthesize a practical algorithm with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the definition and spectrum so I don't mislabel entities. Cardiac contusion is best understood as a myocardial bruise within the broader category of blunt cardiac injury, which spans from clinically silent contusion to lethal chamber rupture, valvular injury, coronary injury, and arrhythmias; importantly, there is no universally accepted gold standard for diagnosis beyond autopsy, which complicates both research and clinical decision-making [^1795816c] [^64f20d68] [^65be948b].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. The right ventricle is most vulnerable because of its anterior location and proximity to the sternum, making it prone to direct compression between sternum and spine, shearing during deceleration, and pressure-wave injury; histologically, contusion shows hemorrhage, edema, and necrosis that can impair contractility and electrical conduction, explaining arrhythmias and wall motion abnormalities [^64f20d68] [^c4944e89] [^38bed34c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about presentation. Many patients are asymptomatic or have nonspecific chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations obscured by other injuries; serious arrhythmias and conduction blocks, including RBBB, can occur, and hemodynamic instability may reflect myocardial dysfunction or mechanical complications like tamponade or rupture, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion even when external chest findings are minimal [^f46dee5d] [^c4944e89] [^4556b824].

> Next, I should review risk stratification. Mechanisms such as high-speed motor vehicle collision, falls from height, direct precordial blows, and blast injury increase risk; associated thoracic injuries like sternal or multiple rib fractures, hemothorax, flail chest, and pulmonary contusion correlate with higher likelihood of cardiac contusion; patient factors such as age over 65 and preexisting cardiac disease also worsen outcomes, so I need to integrate mechanism and associated injuries when deciding on testing and monitoring [^ee7c2988] [^64f20d68] [^65be948b].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach, starting with ECG and troponins, because I should confirm the most efficient screening strategy. EAST recommends obtaining an admission ECG and troponin I in all patients with suspected blunt cardiac injury, and if both are normal, BCI can be excluded; however, I should double-check the sensitivity and timing, as meta-analyses show ECG sensitivity around 55–71% and troponin sensitivity around 64–68%, with specificity generally above 80%, and a normal ECG plus normal troponin yields about 85% sensitivity for ruling out injury, so repeating troponin at 4–6 hours improves sensitivity, especially with high-sensitivity assays [^e0939d76] [^28a7d6bd] [^4556b824] [^29a48c8e] [^ac8aab4f].

> Wait, let me verify the role of echocardiography because I recall conflicting guidance. EAST advises that echocardiography is not useful as a screening tool and should be reserved for hypotension or arrhythmias, whereas ACR recommends transthoracic echocardiography in both stable and unstable patients with suspected cardiac injury; reconciling this, TTE is most impactful when hemodynamics are unstable or when complications like tamponade, wall motion abnormality, or valvular injury are suspected, and TEE improves diagnostic yield when windows are poor or suspicion remains high despite nondiagnostic TTE [^e0939d76] [^5b77917d] [^9c764a58] [^38f81db5].

> Let me consider advanced imaging carefully. CT is primarily for excluding other thoracic injuries and may show indirect signs of BCI, but direct CT evidence of myocardial contusion such as hypoenhancement is insensitive, so a normal CT does not exclude contusion; cardiac MRI can delineate edema and delayed enhancement to confirm contusion and differentiate from ischemia, but access and patient stability limit use, so I should reserve MRI for persistent diagnostic uncertainty or suspected ischemia after initial workup [^2061ebf3] [^631d8a12] [^92366b56].

> I should confirm the role of CK-MB. Multiple sources and guidelines indicate CK-MB has poor diagnostic performance in trauma due to skeletal muscle contamination and lack of correlation with clinically significant BCI, so I should avoid CK-MB and rely on high-sensitivity troponin instead [^e0939d76] [^29a48c8e] [^d9b337f5].

> Next, I should review management principles. For stable patients with normal ECG and troponin, discharge after brief observation is reasonable; for patients with abnormal ECG or elevated troponin, admit for continuous cardiac monitoring for 24–48 hours, repeat troponin, and obtain echocardiography if instability or arrhythmias occur; treat arrhythmias per ACLS, support hemodynamics with fluids and inotropes as indicated, and avoid routine anticoagulation unless there is another indication, given bleeding risk; mechanical complications such as tamponade, rupture, or severe valvular injury require emergent surgical consultation and operative management [^e0939d76] [^936d9c89] [^21d354c7] [^d36167ee].

> But wait, what if the patient is in traumatic cardiac arrest or profound shock. I need to ensure I don't miss reversible causes: perform FAST to assess for pericardial effusion and tamponade, decompress tension pneumothorax, and consider emergency thoracotomy for penetrating trauma or suspected tamponade; in blunt traumatic arrest, evidence does not support routine emergency thoracotomy, so I should prioritize correcting reversible causes and expedite definitive hemorrhage control and resuscitation [^3c084cc9] [^04252e50].

> I should double-check special populations. In pediatrics, blunt cardiac injury is uncommon but often presents as myocardial contusion; mechanisms include MVC, direct blows, and even low-impact sports, and delayed arrhythmias can occur despite initially negative workups, so a lower threshold for observation and follow-up echocardiography is prudent; in older adults, age over 65 independently predicts both contusion and mortality, so I should maintain a lower threshold for monitoring and imaging [^c164a563] [^13a84a59] [^ee7c2988].

> Let me reconsider prognostic factors so I don't overcall benign disease. Most contusions resolve without sequelae, but serious arrhythmias, wall motion abnormalities, and mechanical complications portend worse outcomes; mortality in BCI cohorts averages around 7–8% but varies widely with injury severity and comorbidities, and most deaths are due to noncardiac causes, underscoring the need to address multisystem trauma concurrently [^201bbffd] [^94cde9cf] [^ee7c2988].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical algorithm while acknowledging uncertainties. Screen all patients with significant blunt chest trauma with ECG and high-sensitivity troponin; if both are normal, BCI is effectively excluded and the patient can be discharged with precautions; if either is abnormal, admit for 24–48 hours of monitoring, repeat troponin, and obtain TTE for instability, arrhythmias, or persistent symptoms; escalate to TEE, CT angiography, or cardiac MRI if diagnostic uncertainty remains or complications are suspected; throughout, integrate mechanism, associated injuries, and patient risk factors to guide intensity of evaluation and follow-up [^e0939d76] [^5b77917d] [^631d8a12].

---

Cardiac contusion is a **blunt trauma injury** to the myocardium with a spectrum from silent injury to fatal arrhythmias or rupture [^64f20d68]. Diagnosis relies on **ECG and troponin** [^e0939d76]; echocardiography is reserved for hemodynamic instability or suspected complications [^e0939d76]. Most patients are managed with **monitoring and supportive care**, but arrhythmias or mechanical complications may need specific therapy or surgery [^f4aa6d3f]. Prognosis is **generally favorable** with early recognition, though serious complications can occur [^1a52d0ec].

---

## Pathophysiology

Cardiac contusion results from **direct impact** or **indirect forces** (deceleration, compression, blast) that cause myocardial bruising, hemorrhage, edema, and necrosis [^64f20d68]. The right ventricle is most often affected due to its anterior location [^c4944e89]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Direct impact**: Sternum or ribs compress the heart against the spine [^64f20d68].
- **Indirect forces**: Deceleration or blast waves cause shearing and pressure changes [^64f20d68].
- **Coronary injury**: Blunt trauma can cause coronary artery dissection or thrombosis, leading to ischemia [^6111098f].

---

## Clinical presentation

Presentation varies from **asymptomatic** to **life-threatening**; symptoms are often nonspecific and may be masked by other injuries [^f46dee5d]:

- **Chest pain**: Typically non-pleuritic and may mimic myocardial ischemia [^notfound].
- **Dyspnea**: From myocardial dysfunction or associated pulmonary contusion [^notfound].
- **Arrhythmias**: Common, including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and conduction blocks [^201bbffd].
- **Hemodynamic instability**: Hypotension, shock, or cardiac arrest from myocardial dysfunction or rupture [^64f20d68].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

There is **no gold standard**; diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion plus ECG, troponin, and echocardiography as indicated [^e0939d76]:

| **Modality** | **Role and accuracy** |
|-|-|
| ECG | - Sensitivity ~55–71% <br/> - Specificity ~75–85% <br/> - Abnormalities include arrhythmias, conduction blocks, and ischemic changes [^4556b824] [^68f7eefb] |
| Troponin I/T | - Sensitivity ~64–68% <br/> - Specificity ~84–85% <br/> - Elevations indicate myocardial injury but are not specific to contusion [^29a48c8e] [^15134ee1] |
| Echocardiography (TTE/TEE) | - Detects wall motion abnormalities, valvular injury, pericardial effusion, and tamponade <br/> - TEE has higher sensitivity in unstable patients [^c4944e89] [^94cde9cf] |
| CT/MRI | - CT: indirect signs (pericardial effusion, sternal/rib fractures) <br/> - MRI: gold standard for myocardial edema/fibrosis but limited by availability [^2061ebf3] [^631d8a12] |

---

## Management

Management is **supportive and complication-directed**:

- **Monitoring**: Continuous ECG and hemodynamic monitoring for 24–48 hours in moderate-to-severe cases [^e0939d76].
- **Supportive care**: Oxygen, analgesia, and treatment of associated injuries [^notfound].
- **Arrhythmias**: Antiarrhythmics, pacing, or cardioversion as indicated [^92366b56].
- **Mechanical complications**: Tamponade requires pericardiocentesis or surgical drainage; rupture or valvular injury needs urgent surgical repair [^d36167ee].
- **Coronary injury**: Angiography and PCI if coronary dissection or thrombosis is present [^6111098f].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with early recognition and management, but complications can be severe:

- **Arrhythmias**: Common and may be delayed; most resolve within 24–48 hours [^1a52d0ec].
- **Myocardial dysfunction**: Transient or persistent wall motion abnormalities [^c4944e89].
- **Rupture**: Rare but fatal; more often right atrial/ventricular [^64f20d68].
- **Pericardial effusion/tamponade**: Requires prompt intervention [^9c764a58].
- **Long-term sequelae**: Rare; occasional valvular insufficiency or aneurysm formation [^1a52d0ec].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Higher incidence of arrhythmias and delayed presentations; monitor closely [^c164a563].
- **Elderly patients**: Higher risk of complications and mortality; lower threshold for monitoring [^ee7c2988].
- **Sports-related trauma**: Commotio cordis can cause sudden death; immediate defibrillation is critical [^2443bb6d].

---

Cardiac contusion is a **myocardial injury** from blunt trauma with variable presentation; **early ECG and troponin** are key, with echocardiography for instability or suspected complications. Most patients recover with supportive care, but arrhythmias and mechanical complications require timely intervention.

Introduction

Albeit described since 1763, cardiac contusions is still an under-recognised clinical condition in the acute care setting. This evidence-based review aims to provide an overview of the topic by focusing on etiopathogenesis, classification and clinical presentation of patients with cardiac contusions, as well as on the diagnostic work-up and therapy options available for this subset population in the acute care setting.

Methods

A targeted research strategy was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Central databases up to June 2022. The literature search was conducted using the following keywords (in Title and/or Abstract): ("cardiac" OR "heart" OR "myocardial") AND ("contusion"). All available high-quality resources written in English and containing information on epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, clinical findings, diagnosis and management of cardiac contusions were included in our research.

Results

Biochemical samples of cardiac troponins together with a 12‑lead ECG appear to be sufficient screening tools in hemodynamically stable subjects, while cardiac ultrasound provides a further diagnostic clue for patients with hemodynamic instability or those more likely to have a significant cardiac contusion.

Conclusions

The management of patients with suspected cardiac contusion remains a challenge in clinical practice. For this kind of patients a comprehensive diagnostic approach and a prompt emergency response are required, taking into consideration the degree of severity and clinical impairment of associated traumatic injuries.

Abstract

Blunt cardiac injury (BCI) encompasses a wide spectrum, from occult and inconsequential contusion to rapidly fatal cardiac rupture. A small percentage of patients present with abnormal electrocardiogram or shock, but most are initially asymptomatic. The potential for sudden dysrhythmia or cardiac pump failure mandates consideration of the presence of BCI, including appropriate monitoring and management. In this review, we will present what you need to know to diagnose and manage BCI.

### Myocardial contusion: emergency investigation and diagnosis [^bce31c30]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiac contusion is an infrequent but occasionally serious complication of deceleration injury. According to ATLS teaching, the true diagnosis of contusion can only be established by direct inspection of the myocardium. The clinically important sequelae of myocardial contusion are hypotension and arrhythmia. Despite recent advances in investigative techniques, myocardial trauma remains an important diagnostic and management challenge. This paper presents an evidence-based review of the topic.

### Managing blunt cardiac injury [^0c74adc0]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Blunt cardiac injury (BCI) encompasses a spectrum of pathologies ranging from clinically silent, transient arrhythmias to deadly cardiac wall rupture. Of diagnosed BCIs, cardiac contusion is most common. Suggestive symptoms may be unrelated to BCI, while some injuries may be clinically asymptomatic. Cardiac rupture is the most devastating complication of BCI. Most patients who sustain rupture of a heart chamber do not reach the emergency department alive. The incidence of BCI following blunt thoracic trauma remains variable and no gold standard exists to either diagnose cardiac injury or provide management. Diagnostic tests should be limited to identifying those patients who are at risk of developing cardiac complications as a result of cardiac in jury. Therapeutic interventions should be directed to treat the complications of cardiac injury. Prompt, appropriate and well-orchestrated surgical treatment is invaluable in the management of the unstable patients.

Cardiac contusion

Cardiac contusions are the most common injuries to the heart resulting from blunt trauma. Mild cardiac contusions often recover without lasting consequences while severe injuries more often result in lasting consequences and mortality.

Histologically, it is characterized by a contused myocardium with haemorrhagic infiltrate, localised necrosis, and oedema.

Signs and symptoms of cardiac contusions include chest pain, shortness of breath, and the development of arrhythmias. Cardiac contusions are often difficult to accurately diagnose due to the lack of standardised approaches to their evaluation.

Since cardiac contusion defines a wide range of injuries, patients may have a variety of presentations. Patients presenting with cardiac contusions range from being completely asymptomatic to experiencing mild chest soreness, presenting with electrocardiographic abnormalities, contractile abnormalities, and having signs of heart failure.

Right bundle branch block (RBBB) is a common result of cardiac contusions, whilst left bundle branch block (LBBB) has rarely been reported. The right ventricle is nearest to the sternum, subjecting it to the high risk of cardiac contusions.

As there is often variability in severity and presentation of cardiac contusions, various diagnostic modalities have been utilised to aid the evaluation and treatment process. Cardiac contusions are characterised by injury to the myocardium. Cardiac enzymes such as creatinine kinase and troponin, enzymes that are released after an injury to the heart, and have traditionally been used in evaluating patients for MI. They have also been utilised in the evaluation of cardiac trauma as both can be increased due to injury of the heart.

Imaging can be utilised to identify structural damage to the heart after BCI. Echocardiography provides functional and structural assessments of the heart and is important for ruling out other injuries to the heart including valvular dysfunction, septal or free wall rupture, cardiac tamponade, and muscle function. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an alternative option for the diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities with the ability to provide information regarding the extent of myocardial contusion and regional infarcts.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests in cardiac injury after blunt chest trauma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1795816c]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

In the literature, the terms BCI and cardiac contusion are often used loosely. To clarify and correct this issue, a consensus statement published in the Journal of Trauma, by Mattox et al. stated that the term cardiac contusion should cease to be used as a diagnosis for admission or scoring of injury severity. They proposed a nomenclature of BCI for all cardiac injuries and accepted that the term "cardiac contusion" can also be used in more benign cases. Therefore, the term BCI covers blunt cardiac injury with septal rupture, free wall rupture, coronary artery thrombosis, cardiac failure, minor ECG or enzyme abnormalities alongside cardiac arrhythmias, with the last three also being termed "myocardial contusion".

In the emergency department, BCI presents in three clinical groups:
In the presence of septal rupture, and/or free wall rupture, and/or coronary artery thrombosis, the patient usually dies on site. In the emergency department, the patient is physiologically unstable, and a swift diagnosis will be made — followed by transfer to the operating theatre or admission to an intensive care unit.
In the "myocardial contusion" group, a high threshold of suspicion coupled with investigations is often required, as the clinical picture can be obscured by concomitant injuries.
Patients involved in accidents with severe blunt injury to the chest may have sustained BCI without any significant clinical symptoms or signs [5] [6].

Therefore, every patient with severe blunt trauma to the chest will have to be investigated for the presence of BCI, so a decision can then be taken to discharge or admit them to the hospital.

The most frequently used investigations are electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography (Echo), cardiac biomarkers and radioisotope scanning. If the initial 12–lead ECG is normal, it is recommended to take the 4–6 h ECG, while parallel measurement of cardiac biomarkers such as troponin and creatine kinase (CK) is recommended. Follow-up measurements of cardiac biomarkers and additional Echo or radioisotope scans depend on clinical findings, the ECG and the measurement of cardiac biomarkers.

However, the management of these patients is highly variable and depends on hospital protocols.

The diagnostic procedure for BCI and its associated complications in trauma patients remains challenging. This meta-analysis aims to provide an evidence-based starting point in reaching a consensus for diagnosing BCI in the setting of the emergency department.

### Blunt cardiac injury [^f4aa6d3f]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Blunt cardiac injury encompasses multiple different injuries, including contusion, chamber rupture, and acute valvular disorders. Blunt cardiac injury is common and may cause significant morbidity and mortality; a high index of suspicion is needed for accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic work-up should always include electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes, and may include echocardiography if specific disorders (ie, tamponade or valvular disorders) are suspected. Patients with myocardial contusion should be observed for 24 to 48 hours for arrhythmias. Many other significant forms of blunt cardiac injury require surgical intervention.

### Diagnosing cardiac contusion: old wisdom and new insights [^4a96a1d2]. Heart (2003). Low credibility.

Cardiac contusion is usually caused by blunt chest trauma and therefore is frequently suspected in patients involved in car or motorcycle accidents. The diagnosis of a myocardial contusion is difficult because of non-specific symptoms and the lack of an ideal test to detect myocardial damage. Cardiac contusion can cause life threatening arrhythmias and cardiac failure. Many diagnostic methods, such as ECG, biochemical cardiac markers, transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography, and radionuclide imaging studies, have been investigated to determine their use in predicting such complications. Recently, cardiac troponin I and T were found to be highly sensitive for myocardial injury. Troponin I and T have also proved to be useful in the stratification of patients at risk for complications. Nevertheless, diagnosis of a cardiac contusion and identification of patients at risk remain a challenge. In this review the current diagnostic tests will be discussed. Also, based on these diagnostic tests, a screening strategy containing data from the latest studies is presented, with the intention of detecting patients at risk.

Who should perform the transthoracic echocardiography TTE and the transesophageal echocardiography TEE?

A TTE should be typically done by a cardiologist or a trained emergency physician. A TEE on the other side should be performed by a cardiologist. The exam should be interpreted by a physician trained in reading echocardiograms; ideally, that should be the cardiologist.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests in cardiac injury after blunt chest trauma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^94cde9cf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The diagnosis of cardiac contusion, caused by blunt chest trauma, remains a challenge due to the non-specific symptoms it causes and the lack of ideal tests to diagnose myocardial damage. A cardiac contusion can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Several diagnostic tests have been used to evaluate the risk of cardiac complications, but the challenge of identifying patients with contusions nevertheless remains.

Aim of the study

To evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic tests for detecting blunt cardiac injury (BCI) and its complications, in patients with severe chest injuries, who are assessed in an emergency department or by any front-line emergency physician.

Methods

A targeted search strategy was performed using Ovid MEDLINE and Embase databases from 1993 up to October 2022. Data on at least one of the following diagnostic tests: electrocardiogram (ECG), serum creatinine phosphokinase-MB level (CPK-MB), echocardiography (Echo), Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) or Cardiac troponin T (cTnT). Diagnostic tests for cardiac contusion were evaluated for their accuracy in meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 and the QUADAS-2 tool was used to assess bias of the studies.

Results

This systematic review yielded 51 studies (n = 5,359). The weighted mean incidence of myocardial injuries after sustaining a blunt force trauma stood at 18.3% of cases. Overall weighted mean mortality among patients with blunt cardiac injury was 7.6% (1.4–36.4%). Initial ECG, cTnI, cTnT and transthoracic echocardiography TTE all showed high specificity (> 80%), but lower sensitivity (< 70%). TEE had a specificity of 72.1% (range 35.8–98.2%) and sensitivity of 86.7% (range 40–99.2%) in diagnosing cardiac contusion. CK-MB had the lowest diagnostic odds ratio of 3.598 (95% CI: 1.832–7.068). Normal ECG accompanied by normal cTnI showed a high sensitivity of 85% in ruling out cardiac injuries.

Conclusion

Emergency physicians face great challenges in diagnosing cardiac injuries in patients following blunt trauma. In the majority of cases, joint use of ECG and cTnI was a pragmatic and cost-effective approach to rule out cardiac injuries. In addition, TEE may be highly accurate in identifying cardiac injuries in suspected cases.

### Managing blunt cardiac injury [^64f20d68]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Blunt cardiac injury (BCI) encompasses a spectrum of pathologies ranging from clinically silent, transient arrhythmias to deadly cardiac wall rupture. Therefore, the real incidence of BCI is difficult to estimate and can vary widely. Of diagnosed BCIs, cardiac contusion is most common. The absence of clear diagnostic criteria and reliable diagnostic tests makes reporting difficult. Suggestive symptoms may be unrelated to BCI, while some injuries may be clinically asymptomatic. Cardiac rupture is the most devastating complication of BCI. Most patients who sustain rupture of a heart chamber do not reach the emergency department alive.

BCI occurs most often from motor vehicle collisions (MVCs). Rapid deceleration is the mechanism responsible for most BCIs. A direct blow to the precordium also accounts for a sizable number of cases. Any patient involved in an MVC with sudden deceleration, or who sustains significant chest trauma or severe multiple trauma is at risk.

Several forces may be involved in BCI, including compression of the heart between the spine and sternum, abrupt pressure fluctuations in the chest and abdomen, shearing from rapid deceleration, and blast injury. In addition, fragments from rib fractures can directly traumatize the heart without a penetrating injury. The right heart is the most commonly injured, likely due to its position closest to the anterior chest wall. High pressure ventricular injuries appear to be as common as low pressure atrial injuries. Other pathological findings include valvular tears or rupture, septal tears and coronary artery thrombosis or laceration, however these are less common.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® blunt chest trauma-suspected cardiac injury [^1fa88a7b]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Blunt cardiac injuries range from myocardial concussion (commotio cordis) leading to fatal ventricular arrhythmias to myocardial contusion, cardiac chamber rupture, septal rupture, pericardial rupture, and valvular injuries. Blunt injuries account for one-fourth of the traumatic deaths in the United States. Chest radiography, transthoracic echocardiography, CT chest with and without contrast, and CT angiography are usually appropriate as the initial examination in patients with suspected blunt cardiac injury who are both hemodynamically stable and unstable. Transesophageal echocardiography and CT heart may be appropriate as examination in patients with suspected blunt cardiac injuries. This publication of blunt chest trauma-suspected cardiac injuries summarizes the literature and makes recommendations for imaging based on the available data and expert opinion. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Blunt and penetrating cardiac trauma [^2a78737f]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with traumatic cardiac injuries can present with wide variability in their severity of illness. The most severe will present in cardiac arrest, whereas the most benign may be altogether asymptomatic; most will fall somewhere in between. Management of cardiac injuries largely depends on mechanism of injury and patient physiology. Understanding the spectrum of injuries and their associated manifestations can help providers react more quickly and initiate potentially life-saving therapies more efficiently when time is critical. This article discusses the workup and management of both blunt and penetrating cardiac injuries.

### Predictors of mortality in blunt cardiac injury: a Nationwide analysis [^ee7c2988]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blunt thoracic injury (BTI) is one of the most common causes of trauma admission in the United States and is uncommonly associated with cardiac injuries. Blunt cardiac injury (BCI) after blunt thoracic trauma is infrequent but carries a substantial risk of morbidity and sudden mortality. Our study aims to identify predictors of concomitant cardiac contusion among BTI patients and the predictors of mortality among patients presenting with BCI on a national level.

Materials and Methods

We performed a 1-y (2017) analysis of the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program. We included all adults (aged ≥ 18 y) with the diagnosis of BTI. We excluded patients who were transferred, had a penetrating mechanism of injury, and who were dead on arrival. Our primary outcomes were the independent predictors of concomitant cardiac contusions among BTI patients and the predictors of mortality among BCI patients. Our secondary outcome measures were in-hospital complications, differences in injury patterns, and injury severity between the survivors and nonsurvivors of BCI.

Results

A total of 125,696 patients with BTI were identified, of which 2368 patients had BCI. Mean age was 52 ± 20 y, 67% were male, and median injury severity score was 14 [9–21]. The most common type of cardiac injury was cardiac contusion (43%). Age ≥ 65 y, higher 4-h packed red blood cell requirements, motor vehicle collision mechanism of injury, and concomitant thoracic injuries (hemothorax, flail chest, lung contusion, sternal fracture, diaphragmatic injury, and thoracic aortic injuries) were independently associated with concomitant cardiac contusion among BTI patients (P value < 0.05). Age ≥ 65 y, thoracic aortic injury, diaphragmatic injury, hemothorax, and a history of congestive heart failure were independently associated with mortality in BCI patients (P value < 0.05).

Conclusions

Predictors of concomitant cardiac contusion among BTI patients and mortality among BCI patients were identified. Guidelines on the management of BCI should incorporate these predictors for timely identification of high-risk patients.

### Dual-source computed tomography may define cardiac contusion in patients with blunt chest trauma in ED [^0372313b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

We report a 20-year-old woman with blunt chest trauma because of a motor vehicle injury who has traumatic asphyxia and hypotension. The diagnosis of blunt cardiac injury was put by using dual-energy computed tomography in the emergency department because other laboratory and imaging modalities were useless. After hospitalization in intensive care unit, she was treated with supportive and antiedema therapy. The patient was extubated on the fifth day and discharged on the ninth day without any sequel. Coexistence of traumatic asphyxia with blunt cardiac injury is rare. Several imaging techniques such as transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, contrast-enhanced multislice thorax computed tomography or initial electrocardiogram, and troponin I levels are used to detect the myocardial damage, but diagnostic capability is low. Dual-energy computed tomography is a promising new technology with the ability of defining blunt cardiac injuries and may have an indication in the emergency setting in patients with hemodynamic instability to rule in traumatic cardiac complications especially when electrocardiogram and transthoracic echocardiography are useless in the emergency department.

PRISMA flowchart

Primary objectives

The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of electrocardiogram (ECG), serum creatinine phosphokinase-MB level (CPK-MB), transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in the diagnosis of blunt cardiac injury, and its complications.

Secondary objectives

The secondary objective of this study was to establish a propagated algorithm for the initial assessment of cardiac contusion, in patients with a blunt chest injury.

Databases and search strategy

Two independent reviewers searched Ovid MEDLINE and Embase databases to identify relevant articles from 1993 to October 12, 2022. The search was restricted to articles published in English. Articles were then screened by reading the title, abstract and full text. The detailed search strategy is listed in Additional file 1: Table S1.

### Right bundle-branch block… [^67d08d7a]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

RIGHT bundle-branch block is an unusual complication of non-penetrating trauma to the chest. Rankin and Patterson1 in 1952 and Parmley et al2 in 1958 described transient intraventricular conduction defects that they concluded were due to myocardial contusion. We report a case of transient RBBB that developed following nonpenetrating chest trauma without myocardial injury as evidenced by serial ECGs, technetium Tc 99m pyrophosphate scan, and cardiac enzyme values. Report of a Case A 55-year-old man who had been previously healthy was seen in the emergency room of the Houston Veterans Administration Hospital following an automobile accident in which he had sustained blunt trauma to the anterior chest wall. His only complaint was of nonradiating pleuritic chest pain. The patient was in mild distress. The cardiac apical impulse was in the sixth intercostal space of the midclavicular line. His pain increased following firm palpation of the anterior chest wall. Otherwise.

### Cardiac trauma during teenage years [^2443bb6d]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The spectrum of blunt cardiac trauma ranges from asymptomatic myocardial contusion to fatal cardiac arrhythmias and/or cardiac rupture. Although cardiac rupture is common in fatal traffic accidents, these patients rarely reach hospital care. Insignificant blunt cardiac injury during sports may cause fatal arrhythmia in teens. Penetrating cardiac trauma is fairly common in the United States, encountered frequently in major urban centers. Most cases are dead at the scene and never reach hospital. The incidence of cardiac sequelae in survivors is high, and these patients should be evaluated with early and late echocardiography to detect anatomic or functional cardiac involvement.

### True-true, unrelated: a case report [^5ad75c84]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Sudden cardiac deaths in previously healthy children are frequently due to undiagnosed cardiovascular diseases, either congenital or acquired. In an uncommon clinical entity known as commotio cordis, sudden death from cardiac arrest can occur in young athletes after a blunt blow to the chest, in the absence of preexisting cardiovascular disease. We present a case in which the clinician's high index of suspicion leads to the diagnosis of acute myocarditis in a patient whose sudden cardiac deterioration was initially attributed to the result of recent blunt chest trauma.

Methods

A case report and review of literature via MEDLINE (1996–2004) search using the key words "myocarditis", "commotio cordis", and "myocardial contusion".

Results

A 12-year-old boy was admitted with elevated cardiac enzymes and respiratory distress after being hit in the chest with a dodgeball. Shortly after admission, the patient developed refractory ventricular arrhythmia, which was thought to be the result of blunt chest trauma. Further evaluation with endomyocardial biopsy, however, demonstrated acute myocarditis as the true etiology, for which the patient received immunosuppressive treatment. Unfortunately, the patient eventually required cardiac transplantation because of progressive irreversible cardiac dysfunction due to myocarditis.

Conclusions

Although acute myocarditis, commotio cordis, and myocardial contusion can all present with malignant ventricular arrhythmia, other clinical features and approaches to management of each disease are very different. This case illustrates the importance of having a broad differential diagnosis in mind when presented with a previously healthy child in sudden cardiogenic shock.

### Part 8: pediatric advanced life support: 2025 American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^3c084cc9]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Traumatic cardiac arrest — pediatric synopsis and rationale note that unintentional injuries are the most common cause of death among children and adolescents and that the management of traumatic cardiac arrest is often inconsistent; cardiac arrest due to major blunt or penetrating injury in children has a very high mortality rate. Suspect thoracic injury in all thoraco-abdominal trauma because tension pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, or pericardial tamponade may impair hemodynamics, oxygenation, and ventilation. This topic was last reviewed in the 2020 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC and these recommendations have not been updated for this edition of the Guidelines. Early correction of reversible causes by reducing delays in the delivery of trauma-specific interventions may increase survival following penetrating traumatic cardiac arrest; systematic reviews, multicenter retrospective studies, and single-center retrospective studies recommend emergency thoracotomy for pediatric patients who present pulseless after penetrating thoracic injury; however, there is no evidence to support emergent thoracotomy for infants and children with blunt injury presenting in cardiac arrest.

### Electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation in the trauma patient: acute myocardial infarction vs myocardial contusion [^3a4fb580]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of myocardial contusion in the setting of blunt trauma engenders much discussion and controversy-partly because of the lack of a gold standard for its identification other than histologic findings at autopsy. Furthermore, blunt cardiac trauma represents a spectrum of disorders ranging from transient electrocardiographic change to sudden death from myocardial rupture; hence, no single terminology exists to define such a wide range of scenarios. Here, we present 2 cases of electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation after high-speed motor vehicle crashes resulting in numerous injuries, including blunt chest trauma. Both patients demonstrated electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation, resulting from myocardial contusion and acute myocardial infarction.

### Echocardiography and management for cardiac trauma [^38f81db5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Trauma is the number one cause of death among Americans between the ages of 1 and 46, costing > $670 billion a year. Blunt and penetrating trauma can lead to cardiac and aortic injuries, with the incidence of death varying upon the location of the damage. Among those who reach the hospital alive, many may survive if the hemorrhage and cardiovascular injuries are diagnosed and treated adequately in a timely fashion. Although echocardiography often is underused in the setting of cardiac trauma, it offers significant diagnosis and treatment potential because it is accessible in most settings, safe, relatively noninvasive, and can provide rapid and accurate trauma assessment in the hands of trained providers. This review article aims to analyze the pathophysiology of cardiac injuries in patients with trauma and the role of echocardiography for the accurate diagnosis of cardiac injury in trauma. This review, additionally, will offer a patient-centered, team-based, early management plan with a treatment algorithm to help improve the quality of care among these patients with cardiac trauma.

Discussion

Evaluation of suspected cardiac injuries

The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) has published a practice management guideline for patients with suspected BCI. A review of the literature supporting these recommendations can be found in table 1. Each patient with suspected cardiac injury should have an EKG upon arrival (Level I). Abnormal admission EKG should likely be followed with cardiac monitoring for 24 hours or until hemodynamically stable. Patients with normal EKG and no symptoms or other injuries can be discharged after a brief period of observation. This recommendation is supported by a review by Christiansen that showed over 80% of patients who developed a clinically significant arrhythmia had EKG changes on the initial study, suggesting that intake EKG can be considered a reasonably discriminating screening exam.

Table 1
Review of Myocardial Contusion Evaluation in Blunt Thoracic Trauma

Echocardiography should be reserved for patients who are hypotensive either on admission or during the initial observation period. It can be helpful in diagnosing apical thrombi, pericardial effusion and tamponade. Echocardiograms added little clinical information for patients who were normotensive. Radionuclide imaging studies are too sensitive and lack specificity in the setting of trauma, so are not helpful in the evaluation of blunt cardiac trauma.

The EAST guidelines recommend against following cardiac enzymes because they are not helpful in predicting complications from BCI. A review by Biffl, et al evaluated the management of suspected cardiac injury at a Level-One trauma center in Denver. Screening creatinine phosphokinase or troponin levels were frequently elevated post-injury and did not correlate with clinically significant BCI. They identified clinical risk factors for complications in BCI including age greater than 55, an abnormal EKG at admission, the absence of chest pain, a widened mediastinum on imaging, a head injury with a Glasgow coma score less than 8, and pelvic fractures. In both univariate and multivariate analysis, these factors were more predictive of complications from BCI than cardiac enzymes.

Guidelines are helpful in directing the evaluation when thoracic injuries are suspected. The recommendations from EAST support a limited evaluation for negative screening tests and asymptomatic patients. If the initial screening evaluation is positive the algorithm is redirected to evaluate more specific injury patterns. In our case, there was evidence of malperfusion of the myocardial tissue in the anterior distribution, so we integrated cardiac enzymes and angiography to diagnose the potential causes of ST segment changes on the initial EKG. Efficiently proceeding from a screening evaluation to a diagnostic evaluation allowed for rapid detection and treatment of the coronary dissection.

### Focused cardiac ultrasound in the emergent setting: a consensus statement of the American Society of Echocardiography and American College of Emergency Physicians [^3f57ab04]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Medium credibility.

Focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS) in trauma — FOCUS has been an integral part of evaluating blunt and penetrating trauma for more than 20 years and is incorporated into American Trauma Life Support as part of the Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) exam. The FAST exam aims to identify active hemorrhage by evaluating for fluid around the heart, in the thoracic cavity, and in the peritoneum; FOCUS within FAST is used to evaluate for pericardial effusion and to assess the presence or absence of organized ventricular contractility. Emergent FOCUS as part of FAST has improved outcomes by decreasing time to diagnose and treat traumatic cardiac and thoracic injury, and trials have shown decreased morbidity with a mortality benefit in penetrating trauma; its use has become standard of care in trauma centers. Beyond pericardial effusion, cardiac contusions can be identified by depressed wall motion and decreased myocardial contractility, though assessment can be challenging and follow-up comprehensive echocardiograms are often used to quantify and monitor contractile dysfunction over time.

### Blunt cardiac trauma [^8e4f5aa3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The incidence of cardiac injury after blunt chest trauma is difficult to determine and ranges from 8% to 76%. Moreover, the clinical presentation varies tremendously without a real gold standard to exclude or document cardiac involvement. Electrocardiogram as a single test is not sensitive or specific for diagnosing cardiac contusion. Furthermore, creatine kinase MB is non-reliable in the setting of severe trauma involving the liver, intestines or diaphragm. Although troponins T and I are highly specific for cardiac injury, their sensitivity in the setting of trauma is poor. The echocardiogram is very useful in the evaluation of trauma patients with suspected cardiac involvement. However, poor windows in the setting of chest and lung injuries and in intubated patients might be a major problem limiting the accuracy of transthoracic echocardiogram. On the other hand, transesophageal echocardiogram seems to be more sensitive and specific in trauma patients and should be the test of choice in patients with high clinical suspicion for blunt cardiac trauma.

### Karate kick-induced myocardial contusion [^87128987]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Myocardial contusion should be suspected in a selected patient group with blunt thoracic trauma, who have elevated troponin, ECG changes and/or haemodynamical instability. Echocardiography is useful for direct visualisation of possible complications. In stable conditions, MRI allows for good visualisation of the heart and can confirm a suspected myocardial contusion as well as demonstrate the extent of myocardial damage. Based on the present literature, the authors developed a diagram for the diagnostic approach of a patient with suspected myocardial contusion.

### Karate kick-induced myocardial contusion [^91dfc2ad]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Background

Patients presenting with blunt thoracic trauma are common in the emergency department. In these patients, the question often arises whether myocardial contusion is present. This question remains quite challenging since there is no universal definition of myocardial contusion and no single test to determine the diagnosis in the emergency department.

### Guidelines for the appropriate use of bedside general and cardiac ultrasonography in the evaluation of critically ill patients-part II: cardiac ultrasonography [^437457d5]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Blunt cardiac injury — bedside cardiac ultrasonography (BCU) use is limited: BCU lacks accuracy for cardiac contusion diagnosis and should be reserved for patients with hemodynamic instability of unclear etiology, an abnormal ECG, or cardiac arrhythmias with documented risk of blunt cardiac injury; a literature analysis of 35 studies showed electrocardiogram (ECG) and troponin to be of greater utility than BCU, although even the significance of elevated enzymes or an abnormal ECG is unclear, and imaging asymptomatic blunt injured patients has not been shown to improve outcome and would potentially increase cost.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Acute surgical conditions — trauma and burns: In trauma and burn patients, atrial fibrillation (AF) incidence is reported at 4.3–14.8% in patients with trauma admitted to an intensive care unit and 3.2% of burn patients, and in one study over 80% of new-onset AF reverted spontaneously, most within 1 day. Of the novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), only dabigatran has a specific monoclonal antibody antidote, and reversal agents for Factor Xa inhibitors are under development; until their availability, administration of prothrombin complex concentrates may be considered. Ventricular arrhythmias after a blunt chest deceleration trauma should prompt investigation for myocardial contusion; blunt thoracic trauma carries a 20% risk of blunt cardiac injury and severe thoracic trauma a 76% risk. It is recommended that patients with abnormal ECG or positive troponin after blunt chest trauma be monitored for arrhythmia and heart block. A 12-lead ECG is recommended and cardiac monitoring in ICU is recommended for at least 24 h in case of documented arrhythmias, ECG abnormalities or increase in cardiac troponin, and the length of monitoring is not well established, but the trend of cardiac troponin may be a reasonable guide.

### Sternal fracture in the age of pan-scan [^597a2394]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Widespread chest CT use in trauma evaluation may increase the diagnosis of minor sternal fracture (SF), making former teaching about SF obsolete. We sought to determine: (1) the frequency with which SF patients are diagnosed by CXR versus chest CT under current imaging protocols, (2) the frequency of surgical procedures related to SF diagnosis, (3) SF patient mortality and hospital length of stay comparing patients with isolated sternal fracture (ISF) and sternal fracture with other thoracic injury (SFOTI), and (4) the frequency and yield of cardiac contusion (CC) workups in SF patients.

Methods

We analyzed charts and data of all SF patients enrolled from January 2009 to May 2013 in the NEXUS Chest and NEXUS Chest CT studies, two multi-centre observational cohorts of blunt trauma patients who received chest imaging for trauma evaluation.

Results

Of the 14,553 patients in the NEXUS Chest and Chest CT cohorts, 292 (2.0%) were diagnosed with SF, and 94% of SF were visible on chest CT only. Only one patient (0.4%) had a surgical procedure related to SF diagnosis. Cardiac contusion was diagnosed in 7 (2.4%) of SF patients. SF patient mortality was low (3.8%) and not significantly different than the mortality of patients without SF (3.1%) [mean difference 0.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.0 to 3.5%]. Only 2 SF patient deaths (0.7%) were attributed to a cardiac cause. SFOTI patients had longer hospital stays but similar mortality to patients with ISF (mean difference 0.8%; 95% CI -4.7% to 12.0).

Conclusions

Most SF are seen on CT only and the vast majority are clinically insignificant with no change in treatment and low associated mortality. Workup for CC in SF patients is a low-yield practice. SF diagnostic and management guidelines should be updated to reflect modern CT-driven trauma evaluation protocols.

### Traumatic blunt cardiac injuries: an updated narrative review [^65be948b]. International Journal of Critical Illness and Injury Science (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on blunt cardiac injury:

- **Definition**: BCI refers to an injury sustained due to blunt trauma to the heart, the spectrum of which ranges from a minor bruise to specific post-contusion cardiac conditions such as free-wall rupture.
- **Pathophysiology**: BCI is mostly caused by motor vehicle accidents, falls from heights, direct blow to the chest wall by airbag deployment, crushing incidents, contact sports injuries, acts of violence, or blast trauma.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include arrhythmias, myocardial contusion, wall motion abnormalities, myocardial wall rupture, and valve damage. The spectrum of injuries includes commotio cordis, cardiac rupture, coronary artery dissection, indirect cardiac injury, cardiac herniation, pericardial effusion and tamponade, traumatic cardiac arrest, and blunt aortic injury.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BCI is associated with an overall mortality rate of 13.9%.

### Dissection of the left main coronary artery after blunt thoracic trauma: case report and literature review [^9cb77b08]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Blunt chest trauma is commonly encountered by trauma surgeons and has a variable clinical course. The spectrum of cardiac injuries ranges from mild cardiac contusion to cardiac failure or death. The diagnosis of blunt cardiac injury (BCI) can be challenging because chemical markers, nuclear studies and echocardiogram rarely correlate with the severity of injury. This article reviews a case of coronary artery dissection leading to acute ischemia, the diagnostic recommendations for evaluating patients at risk for BCI, and the therapeutic options for traumatic coronary artery dissection.

### Karate kick-induced myocardial contusion [^92366b56]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Little is known about the use of MRI in patients with myocardial contusion. However, in stabilised patients, the MRI is an excellent method to separate traumatic from ischaemic myocardial injury and demonstrate the extent of myocardial injury. In stable cases with a high suspicion of myocardial contusion and a normal chest CT, MRI could be used to rule out myocardial contusion, especially if echocardiographic windows are limited.

Treatment of myocardial contusion depends on the severity of injury. In case of severe trauma to the (intra)cardiac structures or great arteries, haemodynamic stabilisation and thoracic surgery is necessary. Arrhythmogenic complications such as ventricular and supraventricular tachycardias can usually be treated medicallyor with anelectrical cardioversion. In case of myocardial contusion without (severe) complications, patients should be monitored for 24–48 hours after the trauma, since most cardiac complications occur in this period of time.

Learning points

Myocardial contusion should be suspected in a selected patient group with blunt thoracic trauma, who have elevated troponin, ECG changes and/or haemodynamical instability.
Echocardiography is an essential tool in the emergency room to rule out severe mechanical complications.
This case report demonstrates a possible role for MRI to confirm the diagnosis and visualise the extent of myocardial injury.
An in-hospital observation period of 24–48 hours is recommended in myocardial contusion without complications, with a follow-up echo after 6–12 months.

### Screening for blunt cardiac injury: an Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guideline [^e0939d76]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosing blunt cardiac injury (BCI) can be difficult. Many patients with mechanism for BCI are admitted to the critical care setting based on associated injuries; however, debate surrounds those patients who are hemodynamically stable and do not otherwise require a higher level of care. To allow safe discharge home or admission to a nonmonitored setting, BCI should be definitively ruled out in those at risk.

Methods

This Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) practice management guideline (PMG) updates the original from 1998. English-language citations were queried for BCI from March 1997 through December 2011, using the PubMed Entrez interface. Of 599 articles identified, prospective or retrospective studies examining BCI were selected. Each article was reviewed by two members of the EAST BCI PMG workgroup. Data were collated, and a consensus was obtained for the recommendations.

Results

We identified 35 institutional studies evaluating the diagnosis of adult patients with suspected BCI. This PMG has 10 total recommendations, including two Level 2 updates, two upgrades from Level 3 to Level 2, and three new recommendations.

Conclusion

Electrocardiogram (ECG) alone is not sufficient to rule out BCI. Based on four studies showing that the addition of troponin I to ECG improved the negative predictive value to 100%, we recommend obtaining an admission ECG and troponin I from all patients in whom BCI is suspected. BCI can be ruled out only if both ECG result and troponin I level are normal, a significant change from the previous guideline. Patients with new ECG changes and/or elevated troponin I should be admitted for monitoring. Echocardiogram is not beneficial as a screening tool for BCI and should be reserved for patients with hypotension and/or arrhythmias. The presence of a sternal fracture alone does not predict BCI. Cardiac computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging can be used to differentiate acute myocardial infarction from BCI in trauma patients.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^dc820b6d]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Animal studies that investigated uncontrolled haemorrhage have suggested that NE infusion reduces the amount of fluid resuscitation required to achieve a given arterial pressure target, is associated with lower blood loss and significantly improved survival. However, the effects of NE have not been rigorously investigated in humans during haemorrhagic shock. An interim analysis performed during an ongoing multicentre prospective cohort study suggested that the early use of vasopressors for haemodynamic support after haemorrhagic shock may be deleterious in comparison to aggressive volume resuscitation and should be used cautiously. This study has several limitations, however. First, this was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study and was not designed to answer the specific hypothesis tested, and second, the group receiving vasopressors had a higher rate of thoracotomy. Thus, a prospective study to define the effect of vasopressors on patients during haemorrhagic shock is clearly needed.

A double-blind randomised trial to assess the safety and efficacy of adding vasopressin to resuscitative fluid has been performed. Patients were given fluid alone or fluid plus vasopressin (bolus 4 IU) and i.v. infusion of 200 ml/h (vasopressin 2.4 IU/h) for 5 h. The fluid plus vasopressin group needed a significantly lower total resuscitation fluid volume over 5 days than the control group (P = 0.04). The rates of adverse events, organ dysfunction and 30-day mortality were similar.

Vasopressors may be useful if used transiently to sustain arterial pressure and maintain tissue perfusion in the face of life-threatening hypotension. If used, it is essential to respect the recommended objectives for SAP (80–90 mmHg) in patients without TBI.

Because vasopressors may increase cardiac afterload if the infusion rate is excessive or left ventricular function is already impaired, an assessment of cardiac function during the initial ultrasound examination is essential. Cardiac dysfunction could be altered in the trauma patient following cardiac contusion, pericardial effusion or secondary to brain injury with intracranial hypertension. The presence of myocardial dysfunction requires treatment with an inotropic agent such as dobutamine or epinephrine. In the absence of an evaluation of cardiac function or cardiac output monitoring, as is often the case in the early phase of haemorrhagic shock management, cardiac dysfunction must be suspected in the presence of a poor response to fluid expansion and NE.

### Part 11: post-cardiac arrest care: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^8b69b1e8]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Full body computed tomography (CT) after cardiac arrest — A full body CT scan (head to pelvis) can diagnose causes of arrest including intracerebral hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, aortic dissection, and pneumothorax, with diagnostic yield for clinically significant diagnoses and injuries that ranges from 8% to 54%, with several studies indicating an approximate yield of 30%. CT can also identify complications of arrest or resuscitation such as fractures, aspiration, pulmonary contusions, pneumothorax, and hemorrhage; however, CT imaging carries risks such as contrast-associated nephropathy, and transporting critically ill patients risks hemodynamic instability, dislodging medical equipment, and delaying other interventions.

### Guidelines for the appropriate use of bedside general and cardiac ultrasonography in the evaluation of critically ill patients-part II: cardiac ultrasonography [^9c764a58]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Blunt chest trauma — We suggest bedside transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to exclude the presence of a significant pericardial effusion in hemodynamically unstable patients with blunt chest trauma (Grade 2C). The use of BCU in hemodynamically unstable blunt trauma is directed at the diagnosis of aortic transection, valvular disruption, cardiac laceration, and significant concussive cardiac injury, and timely discovery and intervention may be lifesaving. Cardiac laceration or rupture after blunt chest trauma is rare, may result in pericardial effusion and tamponade that cause hemodynamic instability, is readily apparent on BCU, and BCU in such patients may lead to a decrease in unnecessary procedures such as emergency thoracotomy. BCU is of limited value to diagnose blunt cardiac injury (previously referred to as cardiac contusion) (Grade 2C).

### Great vessel and cardiac trauma: diagnostic and management strategies [^324d958a]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Blunt and penetrating trauma to the chest can result in great vessel or cardiac injury. Both the diagnosis and management of these thoracic injuries have evolved from more invasive to less invasive strategies paralleling the advent of sophisticated imaging tools and the development of endovascular therapies. Despite these advances, conventional open repair and reconstruction techniques remain important and are often the definitive means toward effective management of these severely injured patients. The following review outlines the historical perspective, diagnosis, and management of blunt thoracic aortic, blunt cardiac, and penetrating cardiac injuries.

### Race-over time: a critical case of acute myocardial infarction and ventricular tachycardia following blunt chest trauma [^c6f8d1b4]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Coronary angiography and subsequent intervention remain essential components in the management of trauma-induced AMI, serving both diagnostic and therapeutic objectives. Angiographic evaluation in this case demonstrated complete left main coronary occlusion, which was addressed through angioplasty. However, identification and management of the primary lesion are insufficient to prevent mortality.

This clinical presentation emphasizes the necessity for enhanced vigilance in patients with blunt chest trauma. Cardiac injury may be masked by more apparent traumatic manifestations, such as pulmonary contusions or skeletal fractures. Consequently, maintaining a high index of suspicion for cardiac complications and initiating prompt cardiac enzyme analysis and electrocardiographic evaluation are essential for optimal therapeutic timing.

### Narrative review: alternative causes for elevated cardiac troponin levels when acute coronary syndromes are excluded [^3aaf4912]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Current guidelines for the diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction are largely based on an elevated troponin level. While this rapid and sensitive blood test is certainly valuable in the appropriate setting, its widespread use in a variety of clinical scenarios may lead to the detection of troponin elevation in the absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndromes. Many diseases, such as sepsis, hypovolemia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, myocardial contusion, and renal failure, can be associated with an increase in troponin level. These elevations may arise from various causes other than thrombotic coronary artery occlusion. Given the lack of any supportive data at present, patients with nonthrombotic troponin elevation should not be treated with antithrombotic and antiplatelet agents. Rather, the underlying cause of the troponin elevation should be targeted. However, troponin elevation in the absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndromes still retains prognostic value. Thus, cardiac troponin elevations are common in numerous disease states and do not necessarily indicate the presence of a thrombotic acute coronary syndrome. While troponin is a sensitive biomarker to "rule out" non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, it is less useful to "rule in" this event because it may lack specificity for acute coronary syndromes.

ECG and Echo changes

The weighted mean risk of serious arrhythmias (AF, PVC, VT, SVT) in patients with blunt cardiac injury stood at 20.7% (14.6–24.3%). The weighted mean risk of experiencing benign arrhythmias stood at 26.3% (25–33.3%). The weighted mean conduction abnormalities, amongst patients with cardiac injury, stood at 24.6% (14.3–75%). A weighted mean of 33.3% of patients had repolarisation abnormalities. A weighted mean of 45.9% (12.5–100%) of patients experienced ST, T or Q wave changes and these included both specific and non-specific changes. A weighted mean of 30.7% (15.7–100%) of patients with cardiac injury had dyskinesis, insufficiency or structural changes. A weighted mean of 15.2% (12.5–100%) of the patients had effusion or a thrombus. Cardiac tamponade was detected in 1.4%.

Mortality in patients with cardiac injury

The weighted mean mortality rate amongst patients who sustained a cardiac injury stood at 7.6% (1.4–36.4%). A weighted mean of 8.6% (8–10%) of deceased patients exhibited cardiac rupture. A weighted mean of 6.9% (4–25%) of deceased patients exhibited haemorrhage, effusion, or contusion. Dyskinesia was noted in 10% of the deceased. A weighted mean of 84.6% (4–25%) of patients with cardiac contusion died from non-cardiac-related causes. Cardiac failure was noted in 100% of deaths.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^15134ee1]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Cardiac troponin elevation — reasons for myocardial injury include ischemic and nonischemic mechanisms. Ischemic injury encompasses atherosclerotic plaque disruption with thrombosis and oxygen supply/demand imbalance due to reduced myocardial perfusion (coronary artery spasm, microvascular dysfunction, coronary embolism, coronary artery dissection, sustained bradyarrhythmia, hypotension or shock, respiratory failure, severe anemia) or increased myocardial oxygen demand (sustained tachyarrhythmia, severe hypertension with or without left ventricular hypertrophy). Other causes include cardiac conditions (heart failure, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy [any type], Takotsubo syndrome, coronary revascularization procedure, cardiac procedure other than revascularization, catheter ablation, defibrillator shocks, cardiac contusion) and systemic conditions (sepsis or infectious disease, chronic kidney disease, stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension, infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, chemotherapeutic agents, critically ill patients, strenuous exercise).

### Blunt trauma to the heart: a review of pathophysiology and current management [^5075aa99]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Blunt cardiac injury (BCI), defined as an injury to the heart from blunt force trauma, ranges from minor to life-threatening. The majority of BCIs are due to motor vehicle accidents; however, injuries caused by falls, blasts, and sports-related injuries also can be sources of BCI. A significant proportion of patients with BCI do not survive long enough to receive medical care, succumbing to their injuries at the scene of the accident. Additionally, patients with blunt trauma often have coexisting injuries (brain, spine, orthopedic) that can obscure the clinical picture; therefore, a high degree of suspicion often is required to diagnose BCI. Traditionally, hemodynamically stable injuries suspicious for BCI have been evaluated with electrocardiograms and chest radiographs, whereas hemodynamically unstable BCIs have received operative intervention. More recently, computed tomography and echocardiography increasingly have been utilized to identify injuries more rapidly in hemodynamically unstable patients. Transesophageal echocardiography can play an important role in the diagnosis and management of several BCIs that require operative repair. Close communication with the surgical team and access to blood products for potentially massive transfusion also play key roles in maintaining hemodynamic stability. With proper surgical and anesthetic care, survival in cases involving urgent cardiac repair can reach 66%-to-75%. This narrative review focuses on the types of cardiac injuries that are caused by blunt chest trauma, the modalities and techniques currently used to diagnose BCI, and the perioperative management of injuries that require surgical correction.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests in cardiac injury after blunt chest trauma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4556b824]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

This study has shown that the ECG may be normal after a blunt chest injury or may show specific or non-specific abnormalities. Non-specific changes are also seen in trauma patients, some caused by anaemia, hypoxia, electrolyte abnormality and sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. This is in accordance with many other studies. ECG changes tend to reflect the activity of the left ventricle, as this is larger than the right ventricle and close to the sternum. Thus, contusions affecting the left ventricle can present as significant ST-changes and serious arrhythmias on the ECG, whilst, on the other hand, right ventricle contusion can easily be missed. This study showed that the ECG has a sensitivity of 55.1% and a relatively good specificity of 84.5%. For instance, ST, T, or Q wave changes were present in 45.9% of patients with blunt cardiac injury. Furthermore, 20.7% of the patients with blunt cardiac injury presented with serious arrhythmias. This might be due to electrical instability, as these patients are usually more haemodynamically compromised and this finding is often associated with sudden death. If we consider patients diagnosed with a blunt cardiac injury, 24.6% presented with conduction abnormalities. According to the latest literature, a right bundle branch block resembles a severely injured right ventricle. Other types of conduction abnormalities have also been reported in patients with cardiac contusion.

### Elevated troponin and myocardial infarction in the intensive care unit: a prospective study [^fe4d0e10]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac troponin is specific to the myocardium, and levels in the serum rise 3–4 hours after the occurrence of cardiac symptoms in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). Because of its high sensitivity and specificity, elevated levels of troponin indicate myocardial damage but not the mechanism of damage. The diagnosis of MI has thus evolved following the introduction of routine troponin testing, resulting in the redefinition of MI by the joint European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) in 2000. Based on this consensus document, any amount of myocardial damage, as detected by serum troponin and associated with evidence of ischemia, should be considered an MI.

It is increasingly recognized that elevated troponin levels occur in many patients who do not have evidence of flow-limiting coronary artery disease. In addition to nonthrombotic cardiac conditions (myocardial contusion, infiltrative myocardial diseases), nonthrombotic noncardiac diagnoses (sepsis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, renal failure) are also associated with elevated levels of troponin. Given this observation, it is generally considered inappropriate to use elevated troponin levels as the only diagnostic criterion for MI. The ESC/ACC consensus document defines MI not only based on a typical rise and fall in biomarkers but also requires the presence of one of the following: ischemic symptoms, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with myocardial ischemia, or need for a coronary artery intervention.

Severe chest trauma, blunt or penetrating, is responsible for up to 25% of traumatic deaths in North America. Respiratory compromise is the most frequent dramatic presentation in blunt trauma, while injuries to the heart and great vessels pose the greatest risk of immediate death following penetrating trauma. More than 80% of patients will be managed with interventions that can be performed in the emergency department. This article reviews the presentation, diagnosis, and management of the most important thoracic injuries. A structured approach to the acutely unstable patient is proposed to guide resuscitation decisions.

### Diagnosing myocardial contusion… [^ef83beab]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — I read with interest the article by Ross et al1 in the April 1989 issue of the Archives. I think that their point about the safety of operating on patients with cardiac contusion as opposed to those patients who have suffered myocardial infarction is a very important one in dealing with patients with multiple trauma, who certainly can undergo operation for other problems with appropriate cardiovascular monitoring. This is an especially significant consideration in view of the benefits of early operative fixation of multiple fractures. However, I do have some concerns with the article. It is noted in their "Patients and Methods" section that they use elevation of the creatine kinase MB fraction over 2. 5% to constitute a positive diagnostic criterion for cardiac contusion. Ross et al also used abnormalities in the electrocardiogram, including arrhythmias, ectopy, conduction defects, and ischemic changes, for their other diagnostic. SMITH JS.

### Karate kick-induced myocardial contusion [^68f7eefb]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

The ECG is abnormal in 40%–83% of the patients with myocardial contusion. A recent systematic review described a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 75% for identifying myocardial contusion. The ECG may show pericarditis-like ST-segment changes, prolonged QT time, right bundle branch block (RBTB) or arrhythmias as described above. If ECG changes are present, we recommend (telemetric) cardiac observation and further analyses for the presence of myocardial contusion (figure 3).

High-sensitivity troponin-T (Hs-TnT) directly reflects myocardial injury, and a negative troponin, therefore, is a strong predictor for the absence of myocardial contusion. The reported sensitivity (77%) and specificity (85%) for Hs-TnT is high. The ideal timing for the measurement of troponin is unclear, but measurement after 3 hours has been proposed, comparable to myocardial infarction. In case of elevated troponin levels, cardiac observation is recommended and a rising troponin level should prompt further cardiac evaluation. Patients with a normal ECG and troponins can safely be discharged home.

Echocardiography in myocardial contusion allows for direct visualisation of possible complications. However, TTE is limited by access, which can be a problem in patients with severe thoracic trauma. In case of insufficient access, trans-oesophageal echocardiography can be a viable alternative in the emergency room. However, injury to the larynx, oesophagus and spine needs to be excluded. We recommend performing a TTE in all are haemodynamically unstable patients with blunt thoracic trauma, in patients with rising troponin levels and/or persisting ECG changes or arrhythmias.

### Karate kick-induced myocardial contusion [^38bed34c]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Myocardial contusion is a complication of blunt thoracic trauma and is suspected to be an important cause of fatal traumatic accidents. The reported incidence of myocardial contusion in blunt thoracic trauma ranges from 3% to 76%, reflecting the wide range of diagnostic criteria used. Because myocardial contusion can be a challenging diagnosis, we will provide an overview of the current literature on the diagnostic approach of a patient with blunt thoracic trauma.

Myocardial contusion is defined by the presence of injury to myocardial cells. The primary cause is motor vehicle accidents and it may already occur while driving 30 km/hour. Other causes of myocardial contusion include falls from more than 6 m, chest compressions and as shown in our case, direct impact to the chest. The myocardium can be injured by direct forces on the heart, by impact of the heart on adjacent structures or by increased intrathoracic pressure.

On a cellular level, the impact on the myocardium results in an intramyocardial haematoma along with oedema and necrosis, which is quite similar to a myocardial infarction. Damage to the myocardial tissue can produce electrical instability, potentially resulting in atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Because of its anterior location in the chest, the RV is most susceptible to direct impact and injury can result in dysfunction or wall rupture. The mitral and aortic valves are more prone to lesions due to the higher pressure in the left ventricle. In addition, thrombosis and laceration of the coronaries can occur as well as pericardial effusion, hemopericardium and damage to the great veins.

Myocardial contusion should be suspected in patients with blunt thoracic trauma, presenting with sternum and rib fractures, chest pain not reacting to analgesics, patients who are haemodynamically unstable or present with arrhythmias. However, patients can also present without visible signs of trauma and symptoms can be obscured by other injuries. A high level of suspicion, therefore is paramount.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests in cardiac injury after blunt chest trauma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d9b337f5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

It is worth noting that severe cardiac injuries can easily be detected, as they usually present with haemodynamic instability. However, less severe injuries can easily be masked in trauma patients, due to other severe vascular, pulmonary, or neurological injuries. The biggest challenge revolves around diagnosing trauma patients with no clinical signs of myocardial injuries, as some present with only mild symptoms, such as palpitations or precordial pain, which are often related to the associated musculoskeletal injury. For instance, we reported that 20.7%, of the patients with blunt cardiac injury presented with serious arrhythmias (AF, PVC, VT, SVT). This leaves 79.3% of patients with a cardiac injury who presented with benign, less serious, arrhythmias.

The hypothesis states that cardiac injury, in patients with blunt chest trauma, is caused by deceleration forces affecting the viscoelastic properties of the chest wall leading to either direct pressure on the myocardium or an indirect pressure through increased intrathoracic pressure leading to shearing stresses. The histological findings seen in blunt cardiac injuries are similar to those seen in myocardial infarction, and these are intramyocardial haemorrhage, oedema and necrosis of cardiac cells. Thus, cardiac enzymes, such as troponin and creatinine kinase MB, were the first screening tools to detect cardiac injury. We reported that the sensitivity of CPK-MB was 55.2% and the specificity 75.8%. CPK-MB tends to have higher specificity in detecting acute myocardial infarction — but not in trauma patients with associated skeletal injuries. Thus, creatinine kinase is useful in detecting cardiac contusion in patients with none or only minor non-cardiac injuries. However, it is also worth noting that some authors have reported reduced sensitivity and specificity in patients with mild injuries.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests in cardiac injury after blunt chest trauma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^797b042f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blunt chest injuries (BCI) account for 15% of admissions to emergency departments worldwide and they are associated with significant morbidity and mortality (1–3). They may occur following road collision accidents, falls from heights, physical assaults or athletic injuries. The injury sustained to the heart is thought to be due to decelerating forces on the anterior aspect of the chest wall, which challenges the viscoelastic properties of the heart. After the impact, the heart can move freely within the thoracic cavity on the anterior–posterior axis and may then either be solely compressed against the posterior aspect of the sternum or — after a more energetic impact — be "squashed" between the sternum and the anterior aspect of the thoracic spine.

As blunt chest injuries encompass an entire spectrum of different mechanisms and intensities, it is evident that the clinical presentation of these patients varies greatly. Presentations range from a silent clinical picture to differing degrees of physiological instability, but may in certain cases be "catastrophic" if important structures have been injured — such as the pericardium, the valves, the papillary muscle, chordae tendinae, the ventricular septum, or coronary artery.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^21d354c7]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the effects of vasopressors have not yet been rigorously investigated in humans during haemorrhagic shock and prospective studies to define the effect of vasopressors on patients during haemorrhagic shock are warranted. Current evidence suggests that vasopressors may be useful if used transiently to sustain arterial pressure and maintain tissue perfusion in the face of life-threatening hypotension. However, if used, it is essential to respect the recommended objectives for systolic arterial pressure (80–90 mmHg) in patients without TBI. Because vasopressors may increase cardiac afterload if the infusion rate is excessive or left ventricular function is already impaired, an assessment of cardiac function during the initial ultrasound examination is essential. Cardiac dysfunction could be altered in the trauma patient following cardiac contusion, pericardial effusion or secondary to brain injury with intracranial hypertension. The presence of myocardial dysfunction requires treatment with an inotropic agent such as dobutamine or epinephrine. In the absence of an evaluation of cardiac function or cardiac output monitoring, as is often the case in the early phase of haemorrhagic shock management, cardiac dysfunction must be suspected if there is a poor response to fluid expansion and norepinephrine.

Recommendation 15

We recommend that fluid therapy using isotonic crystalloid solutions be initiated in the hypotensive bleeding trauma patient. (Grade 1A)

We recommend the use of balanced electrolyte solutions and the avoidance of saline solutions. (Grade 1B)

We recommend that hypotonic solutions such as Ringer's lactate be avoided in patients with severe head trauma. (Grade 1B)

We recommend that the use of colloids be restricted due to the adverse effects on haemostasis. (Grade 1C)

### Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation for cardiogenic shock due to cardiac contusion in an elderly trauma patient [^9407dae1]. Resuscitation (2002). Low credibility.

Blunt thoracic trauma may cause cardiac contusion and cardiogenic shock resistant to inotropic support. The use of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABCP) as a mechanical means of augmenting cardiac function following cardiac contusion is rare with case reports largely limited to its use in young trauma patients. We describe the case of a frail, 80-year-old woman who suffered cardiac contusion in a motor vehicle crash. She developed cardiogenic shock with electrocardiograph changes, elevated troponin T and severe global dysfunction on echocardiography. She was successfully managed with invasive monitoring, inotropic support and IABCP. This case provides support for aggressive resuscitation even in the very elderly as recovery from severe cardiac contusion may be possible.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests in cardiac injury after blunt chest trauma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^29a48c8e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study has shown that cTnT has a sensitivity and specificity of 68.4% and 85.5%, respectively. The numbers for cTnI were 64.4% and 84.1%, respectively. The increased sensitivity and specificity compared to CPK-MB can be explained by the fact that both serum cardiac troponins are regulatory contractile proteins that are only present in heart muscle cells and not in skeletal muscles. In case of heart muscle damage resulting in loss of cell membrane integrity cardiac troponins are released into the serum. That makes troponin invaluable in diagnosing heart damage. This meta-analysis has also shown that cTnT has a negative likelihood ratio of 0.217% and a positive likelihood ratio of 4.368%. The values for cTnI were 0.329% and 3.792%, respectively. This led to the conclusion that positive serum cardiac troponins are accurate in the diagnosis of cardiac contusion. Furthermore, negative serum troponin is a strong indicator of the absence of the disease. The results are consistent with previous studies. The optimal time of sampling for serum troponin after trauma has not been established. However, it is proposed that if an initial serum troponin is negative, a second measurement should be performed after 4–6 h. High troponin levels tend to persist for 4–6 days, and this can aid with the diagnosis of blunt cardiac injury in late presentations.

### Imaging in blunt cardiac injury: computed tomographic findings in cardiac contusion and associated injuries [^2061ebf3]. Injury (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Blunt cardiac injury (BCI) may manifest as cardiac contusion or, more rarely, as pericardial or myocardial rupture. Computed tomography (CT) is performed in the vast majority of blunt trauma patients, but the imaging features of cardiac contusion are not well described.

Purpose

To evaluate CT findings and associated injuries in patients with clinically diagnosed BCI.

Materials and Methods

We identified 42 patients with blunt cardiac injury from our institution's electronic medical record. Clinical parameters, echocardiography results, and laboratory tests were recorded. Two blinded reviewers analyzed chest CTs performed in these patients for myocardial hypoenhancement and associated injuries.

Results

CT findings of severe thoracic trauma are commonly present in patients with severe BCI; 82% of patients with ECG, cardiac enzyme, and echocardiographic evidence of BCI had abnormalities of the heart or pericardium on CT; 73% had anterior rib fractures, and 64% had pulmonary contusions. Sternal fractures were only seen in 36% of such patients. However, myocardial hypoenhancement on CT is poorly sensitive for those patients with cardiac contusion: 0% of right ventricular contusions and 22% of left ventricular contusions seen on echocardiography were identified on CT.

Conclusion

CT signs of severe thoracic trauma are frequently present in patients with severe BCI and should be regarded as indirect evidence of potential BCI. Direct CT findings of myocardial contusion, i.e. myocardial hypoenhancement, are poorly sensitive and should not be used as a screening tool. However, some left ventricular contusions can be seen on CT, and these patients could undergo echocardiography or cardiac MRI to evaluate for wall motion abnormalities.

In addition to the atypical mechanism and delayed presentation, it is interesting that the current recommended diagnostic modalities for detecting blunt cardiac injury did not reveal pathology in this case. Specifically, our patient had an abnormal admission ECG but unremarkable TTE and cardiac enzymes. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) has generated guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of myocardial contusion (box 1). These guidelines as well as several other techniques commonly used to screen for blunt cardiac injury will now be discussed.

Box 1
Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma guidelines for evaluation and treatment of myocardial contusion 10

Level I

Admission ECG should be obtained in all patients where there is suspected Blunt Cardiac Injury.

Level II

1. If admission ECG is abnormal, the patient should be admitted for continuous ECG monitoring for 24–48 hours. If admission ECG is normal, further pursuit of diagnosis should be abandoned.

2. If the patient is haemodynamically unstable, an imaging study such as transthoracic echocardiogram or transesophageal echocardiogramshould be obtained.

3. Nuclear medicine scans add little compared with echocardiography and are not useful if echocardiography has been performed.

Level III

1. Elderly patients with known cardiac disease, unstable patients and those with abnormal admission ECGs can be safely operated on provided that they are closely monitored.

2. The presence of a sternal fracture does not predict the presence of BCI and does not necessarily indicate that monitoring should be performed.

3. Neither creatine phosphokinase analysis nor measurement of circulating cardiac troponin T are useful in predicting which patients have or will have complication related to BCI.

Chest radiography, although not included in the EAST guidelines, is an inexpensive and rapid diagnostic modality that is obtained in most trauma situations. However, cardiac injury can only be inferred using this modality (unless obvious foreign bodies are seen) from evidence of significant intrathoracic trauma by the presence of haemothorax, rib fractures, intrathoracic free air or enlarged cardiac silhouette (although non-specific). Our patient's portable frontal upright chest radiograph (figure 1) revealed no acute cardiopulmonary disease.

### Paediatric chest wall trauma causing delayed presentation of ventricular arrhythmia [^c164a563]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Trauma is the leading cause of death in individuals under 18 years of age. Although thoracic trauma only accounts for a small percentage of admissions to a trauma centre, it is second only to head injury as the most common cause of death in this age group. Blunt myocardial injuries range from asymptomatic myocardial contusion to catastrophic myocardial rupture. Myocardial contusion is the most common and most easily overlooked injury. This is in part due to the lack of consistent correlation with cardiac biomarkers, ECG, echocardiograms and other diagnostic imaging modalities. The most common causes of blunt myocardial injury are: motor vehicle accidents, pedestrian struck, falls from a height of greater than 20 feet, crush injuries and abuse. This case demonstrates several important learning points including the mechanism of injury, clinical presentation and diagnostic methods for blunt cardiac injury.

Cardiac contusion is often overlooked because it is difficult to detect with standard diagnostic techniques and because it is overwhelmingly benign and often goes unnoticed by the patient. It is likely that cardiac contusion is a far more common injury than data suggest simply due to the fact that if the injury is not sustained in the setting of a high-impact multisystem trauma, the patient may never present for workup at all. Given the anatomic location of the heart, it is generally well protected behind the sternum and rib cage. Therefore, the more common scenario of symptomatic blunt cardiac injury is one of significant forces delivered to the thorax resulting in immediate myocardial rupture with instant death or immediately apparent pathology. Data on the epidemiology of paediatric blunt cardiac injury are limited. However in one large epidemiological study of paediatric cardiac trauma reported on 184 cases of blunt cardiac injury in children at 16 participating centres. In this study, the median age was 7.4 years and 73% were male. Myocardial contusions accounted for 95% of the diagnoses with the leading mechanism of injury being motor vehicle collision versus pedestrian (39.7%) or passenger (31.0%). The significant majority (95%) had suffered multisystem trauma (60% with evidence of external trauma) with pulmonary contusions (50.5%) and rib fractures (23.0%) being the most common associated internal injuries. Our case is extremely rare because the mechanism of injury was low impact and unassociated with external evidence of thoracic trauma or trauma to other systems, and the patient presented a day after the injury but with very serious cardiac pathology.

Cardiac trauma carries high mortality rates and should be considered in all patients presenting with chest trauma. These patients can have a wide range of clinical presentations, from being asymptomatic to being in hemodynamic collapse. Currently, multidetector computed tomography is the gold-standard diagnostic imaging modality for all patients with abnormal electrocardiogram and/or Troponin I levels following chest trauma. In this article, we discuss pathophysiology of cardiac trauma, review the role of medical imaging, and present the spectrum of abnormal findings in traumatic cardiac injuries.

Figure 3
Cardiac MRI. Evidence of myocardial contusion involving the right ventricular free wall with focal areas of delayed enhancement, evidence of oedema (figure 3C), significant regional wall motion abnormalities involving the right ventricular outflow tract and right ventricular free wall (figure 3B). Normal left ventricular size and function, LVEF of 69%; small pericardial effusion with possible pericardial stranding/haematoma (figure 3A); normal right ventricular size with mildly depressed global function and regional wall motion abnormalities as described above. RVEF is 41%. LVEF, Left ventricular ejection fraction; RVEF, right ventricular ejection fraction. Figure 3A, 3B and 3C follow in order.

To conclude, it is crucial to have a high index of suspicion for serious cardiac pathology even in low impact mechanisms with delayed presentations. Though cardiac MRI may not be feasible in many practice settings, it may represent a more accurate diagnostic modality when a negative cardiac workup is complicated by persistent episodic cardiac-rhythm abnormalities. It is reasonable to pursue cardiac MRI if there is high clinical suspicion of a significant underlying injury due to evidence of grossly abnormal electrical activity with otherwise negative workup (TTE and cardiac enzymes) as seen in our patient. It is possible that the current screening guidelines may be inadequate for detecting myocardial contusions. It is unclear however if more minor contusions go undiagnosed if it will significantly impact the patient's outcome and long-term health status. In the Dowd and Krug study, out of the 184 cases, 159 patients survived (86.4%) and only 8 (5% of survivors) had significant cardiac sequelae, most commonly mitral or tricuspid insufficiency or ventricular septal defect. During our literature review, we have not found any evidence of an initial arrhythmia secondary to blunt cardiac trauma progressing to ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia arrest, the chance of Vfib/Vtach arrest if not induced in the immediate setting is exceedingly rare. Specifically, in the Bock study, it was found that among 65 patients who were haemodynamically stable with normal screening ECG on arrival to the ED, there was not a single malignant arrhythmia or case of pump failure observed. Among the patients who developed myocardial contusion or segmental wall motion abnormalities, the majority of arrhythmia or hypokinesia resolved within 24 hours. Therefore, cardiac sequelae 1 year after cardiac contusion in haemodynamically stable patients are rare. In patients with a negative troponin I and minimal electrical disturbance prognosis is good. However, in more pronounced electrical disturbance, such as what our patient had, this indicates more severe underlying injury. There are case reports of blunt myocardial injury with no overlying chest wall trauma leading to death because the haemopericardium progressed to tamponade, so there is indeed a risk of death with this.

### Sudden death from contusion of the right atrium after blunt chest trauma: case report and review of the literature [^d1c3b4ca]. Injury (2005). Low credibility.

Occult cardiac injury following blunt trauma is more common than generally suspected. Myocardial lesions range from myocardial contusion to cardiac rupture. Myocardial contusion is not uncommon, it is usually a benign disorder which often remains undiagnosed. We report the case of a previously healthy 29-year-old man who was involved in a fight and suffered from blunt heart injury leading to contusion of the right atrium. The patient died soon after the injury and before admission to the Hospital. The diagnosis was made at autopsy. The present case is of special interest because of the unusual eliciting event and the rarity of the contusion site (right atrium). It is reported in order to raise the index of suspicion in physicians treating patients involved in a fight and aid in prompt diagnosis of myocardial contusion.

### Incidence and significance of cardiac troponin I release in severe trauma patients [^29b93955]. Anesthesiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence and significance of troponin I release and its mechanism are unknown in severe trauma patients. The characteristics of this release were prospectively studied in such patients and correlated with presence of shock, existence of myocardial contusion, and outcome.

Methods

During a 24-month period, serial electrocardiogram recordings and troponin I measurements were performed in all trauma patients admitted at a surgical intensive care unit. The diagnosis of a significant myocardial contusion was made on electrocardiographic criteria. According to the time course of troponin I, three groups of patients were defined a priori: very transient (≤ 12 h) and limited release (troponin I < 2 microg/l), transient (≤ 36 h) and significant release (troponin I ≥ 2 microg/l), and sustained (> 36 h) and significant release (troponin I > 2 microg/l). In the last group, coronary artery angiography was performed.

Results

The incidence of troponin I release was 12% (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.6–14.4%) in 728 patients. A significant myocardial contusion was found in 35 patients (5%; 95% CI, 3.4–6.6%) and may occur in the absence of chest trauma and without troponin I release. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of troponin I for the diagnosis of myocardial contusion were 63, 98, 40, and 98%, respectively. Troponin I release was observed in 54 early (> 48 h) survivors (7%; 95% CI, 5.6–9.6%) without preexisting coronary artery disease. A sustained and significant release of troponin I (17 patients) was frequently associated with chest trauma (82%) and constantly with electrocardiographic abnormalities. A coronary artery injury was found in 7 patients (2 major and 5 minor vascular injuries) (1% of the whole group; 95% CI, 0.4–2.0%). Mortality was similar in early survivors with (15%; 95% CI, 7–27%) or without (12%; 95% CI, 9–14%) troponin I release. The odds ratio for late mortality was 1.32 (95% CI, 0.61–2.85) in patients with troponin I release.

Conclusions

Serial electrocardiogram recordings and troponin I assessments may be proposed for initial screening in high-risk trauma patients to detect anatomical cardiac injuries through the time course of circulating protein. Troponin I release does not have a prognosis value in trauma patients.

Traumatic cardiac injuries are an uncommon diagnosis in the pediatric population. Of the traumatic cardiac injuries, more than 95% are contusions. Traumatic ventricular aneurysms are exceptionally rare, and most are detected during long-term follow-up. They are usually successfully managed medically but can require emergent surgical intervention. We report the case of a 6-year-old boy who was in a motor vehicle collision. He was found to have profound sinus bradycardia during initial resuscitation with hypotension. An electrocardiogram showed complete heart block. A cardiologist was consulted, and an echocardiogram was performed, which revealed a ventricular septal aneurysm. The case is followed by a review of the literature on traumatic cardiac injuries and ventricular septal aneurysms in the pediatric population.

### Family practice international… [^c8d80e03]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Traumatic Coronary Artery Damage Acute compression of the heart between the sternum and spine during a motor vehicle crash or following a blow to the chest wall may damage the coronary arteries. While the left descending artery is most vulnerable, shearing forces may damage the right coronary artery at its origin. The patient may appear more profoundly hypotensive than expected from the injury. Abnormal findings on electrocardiography include changes in ST and T waves, and ventricular arrhythmias and conduction delay. Elevations of cardiac enzymes are common because of direct arterial damage and contusion of the myocardium. Echocardiography is recommended for any patient with ECG changes following chest trauma, and early angiography should be considered. Patients who appear to do well initially may develop serious complications later from arterial damage or associated cardiac ischemia.

Walking exacerbates the pain and tingling. The differential diagnosis of Morton's neuroma includes stress fracture, synovitis, proximal nerve entrapment or metatarsalgia. The patient may limp and have increased pain when raising the calf. Local tenderness can be elicited over the neuroma, and the mass may be appreciated on examination by a "click" as it moves between the metatarsal heads. A plain radiograph can rule out fracture, tumor and infection, but ultrasound may be the best investigation to visualize the neuroma. Symptoms often can be controlled with conservative therapy based on avoidance of pressures on the foot and the use of pads to separate the metatarsal heads. Pain can be alleviated with localized injection of steroids. Surgery is indicated only if conservative therapy fails. A chest radiograph is essential if pneumothorax is suspected and can provide useful information about other conditions.

When selecting and prioritizing other investigations, the severity of the patient's condition and the most probable diagnosis should be considered. Indicators of severe or life-threatening dyspnea include a respiratory rate of more than 25 breaths per minute, tachycardia greater than 110 beats per minute or bradycardia, a peak expiratory flow of less than 40 percent of predicted value, lower partial pressure of oxygen and elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide, confusion or exhaustion, and difficulty in completing sentences.

Introduction: Blunt cardiac injury (BCI) is a challenging diagnosis in polytrauma patients. Given the high energy transfer required at a specific given time, such as early systole when mitral valve is closed while aortic valve is opening, isolated valve injuries are mostly secondary to motor vehicle collisions (MVC). These injuries are under-reported in trauma due to lethal concomitant injuries producing high out-of-hospital mortality. This case demonstrates the challenging management of valve injury in the setting of multisystem injuries.

Methods: We present a case report of mitral and tricuspid valve injury in a 46-year-old male who presented following a MVC on 9/1/2024. We reviewed the patient's clinical course including laboratory, imaging studies, procedures and surgeries.

Results: The patient presented with bradycardia and hypotension. Diagnostics demonstrated bilateral rib fractures, pulmonary contusions, sternal fracture and an acetabular fracture. Relevant laboratory values included lactate of 4 mmol/L, troponin of 10 ng/L. Arterial blood gases showed worsening hypercapnic, hypoxemic acidosis. ECG demonstrated type II heart block, and echocardiogram revealed findings consistent with valvular injury (Figure). Due to hypoxia and hypercarbia, the patient was placed on a veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) then transitioned to veno-arterial ECMO for cardiac support. After stabilization, he underwent a mitral valve replacement and commisuroplasty of tricuspid valve on hospital day 7. Despite a successful operation, the patient suffered an ECMO circuit complication leading to anoxia.

Conclusions: Our case highlights the difficulty in early detection and diagnosis of BCI with imaging findings and treatment algorithm for a rare diagnosis of valve injury following a blunt chest trauma. To date, there is a paucity of reported successful management of valvular injury in the critical care trauma literature.

Causes of elevated or lower natriuretic peptide levels — Other than a primary diagnosis of HF, cardiovascular causes include acute coronary syndrome, MI; pulmonary embolism; myocarditis; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; valvular heart disease; congenital heart disease; atrial or ventricular arrhythmias; heart contusion, cardiac infiltration or malignancy; cardioversion, ICD shock; pericardial disease; invasive or surgical procedures involving the heart; pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure; and infiltrative cardiomyopathies. Noncardiovascular causes include advanced age, kidney disease, critical illnesses including sepsis syndrome and cytokine syndrome, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, pulmonary disease (pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), liver disease, severe anemia, and severe metabolic and hormone abnormalities (eg, thyrotoxicosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, severe burns). Causes of lower natriuretic peptide levels include obesity or increased BMI and pericardial disease, with the note that in certain patients with pericardial disease and effusion, natriuretic peptides may be lower and increase after pericardiocentesis.

### Great vessel and cardiac trauma [^0bf2af26]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Thoracic great vessel and cardiac trauma are characterized by anatomic location and mechanism of injury: blunt or penetrating. Management strategies are also directed by the extent and mechanism of injury. Advances in imaging and catheter-based technologies have allowed easier and more accurate diagnosis and less-invasive treatments. Although the advantages of endovascular techniques are attractive, open surgical repair remains the definitive treatment for many of these thoracic injuries. Given the increasing sophistication of these technologies and the demonstrated usefulness of a disease-oriented approach toward patient management, trauma centers have adopted a multidisciplinary team model for management of multitrauma victims. In this review, the authors detail the diagnosis and management of blunt aortic, nonaortic great vessel, blunt cardiac, and penetrating cardiac injuries.

### Paediatric chest wall trauma causing delayed presentation of ventricular arrhythmia [^6a76a4b7]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

According to these guidelines based on our patient's abnormal admission ECG, it was appropriate to admit her for continuous cardiac monitoring for 24–48 hours. In addition, since she was briefly considered haemodynamically unstable due to her presyncopal episodes, it was also appropriate to obtain a TTE. Where our case begins to deviate from the current guidelines is that even though the TTE was unrevealing, in the setting of the patient's serious ventricular rhythm abnormality, the decision was made to proceed with cardiac MRI. Cardiac MRI (figure 3A–C) revealed pathology including: precordial haematoma, myocardial contusion involving the right ventricular free wall with focal areas of delayed enhancement, significant regional wall motion abnormalities involving the right ventricular outflow tract and right ventricular free wall, with a small pericardial effusion. It is very rare for a trauma patient with suspected blunt cardiac injury to need an extensive investigation, including cardiac MRI, to make a diagnosis. One might think that since cardiac MRI was necessary to diagnose cardiac contusion in this case that the myocardial injury was minor, however, the MRI revealed gross and serious pathology. If the EAST guidelines had been strictly followed in our patient, it is possible that even a TTE would not have been considered and the workup certainly would not have proceeded to MRI. This may demonstrate the need to consider the adequacy of the current screening guidelines. Furthermore, although TTE has the advantage of being point of care and not requiring patient transportation, Bock and colleagues found that TTE was not as sensitive at predicting major adverse cardiac events as cardiac MRI (CMR), as well as described poor correlation between TTE and CMR.

### Comprehensive management of the patient with traumatic cardiac injury [^d36167ee]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiac injuries are rare but potentially life-threatening, with a significant proportion of victims dying before arrival at the hospital. The in-hospital mortality among patients who arrive in-hospital alive also remains significantly high, despite major advancements in trauma care including the continuous updating of the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program. Stab and gunshot wounds due to assault or self-inflicted injuries are the common causes of penetrating cardiac injuries, while motor vehicular accidents and fall from height are attributable causes of blunt cardiac injury. Rapid transport of victim to trauma care facility, prompt recognition of cardiac trauma by clinical evaluation and focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination, quick decision-making to perform emergency department thoracotomy, and/or shifting the patient expeditiously to the operating room for operative intervention with ongoing resuscitation are the key components for a successful outcome in cardiac injury victims with cardiac tamponade or exsanguinating hemorrhage. Blunt cardiac injury with arrhythmias, myocardial dysfunction, or cardiac failure may need continuous cardiac monitoring or anesthetic care for operative procedure of other associated injuries. This mandates a multidisciplinary approach working in concert with agreed local protocols and shared goals. An anesthesiologist has a pivotal role to play as a team leader or member in the trauma pathway of severely injured patients. They are not only involved in in-hospital care as a perioperative physician but also participate in the organizational aspects of prehospital trauma systems and training of prehospital care providers/paramedics. There is sparse literature available on the anesthetic management of cardiac injury (penetrating as well as blunt) patients. This narrative review discusses the comprehensive management of cardiac injury patients, focusing on the anesthetic concerns and is guided by our experience in managing cardiac injury cases at Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center (JPNATC), All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. JPNATC is the only level 1 trauma center in north India, providing services to a population of approximately 30 million with around 9000 operations being performed annually.

Diagnostic accuracy of different tests for cardiac injury in blunt chest trauma

Table 1 summarises the diagnostic accuracy of different tests for blunt cardiac injury. Initial ECG, cTnI, cTnT, and TTE all exhibited high specificity (> 80%) but lower sensitivity (< 70%). TEE had the highest specificity of 72.1% (range 35.8–98.2%) and sensitivity of 86.7% (range 40–99.2%) in diagnosing cardiac contusion. CK-MB had the lowest diagnostic odds ratio of 3.598 (95% CI: 1.832–7.068). A normal ECG in combination with a normal cTnI was excellent in ruling out blunt cardiac injury (sensitivity of 85%).

### Race-over time: a critical case of acute myocardial infarction and ventricular tachycardia following blunt chest trauma [^6111098f]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case details the presentation of a 42-year-old male patient who developed acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) subsequent to multiple blunt traumas, with significant chest involvement. The patient's clinical course, despite comprehensive therapeutic intervention, underscores the fundamental importance of prompt diagnosis and integrated management in trauma patients with suspected cardiac involvement. The occurrence of AMI following blunt chest trauma represents an infrequent complication. Epidemiological data from postmortem analyses indicate cardiac injury in 20% of blunt chest trauma cases, with coronary vessel involvement documented in less than 2% of cases. Coronary dissection is most common in the left anterior descending(LAD) artery (76%), followed by the right coronary (12%) and circumflex (6%). The LADʼs susceptibility is due to its anterior position, proximity to the sternum, and longer course, making it prone to shear stress from blunt trauma. Notably, while left main coronary artery dissection is exceptionally rare (< 1% of traumatic coronary injuries), its occurrence has been pathologically confirmed through intravascular ultrasound, demonstrating how high-energy trauma can induce longitudinal intimal tears even in proximal coronary segments. The underlying mechanisms of trauma-induced AMI include various pathological processes, including coronary vessel disruption, thrombotic events, atherosclerotic plaque destabilization, aneurysm formation, and arterial dissection. The observed complete occlusion of the left main coronary artery in this case represents a particularly rare manifestation.

The diagnostic process for AMI in the context of blunt chest trauma poses substantial clinical challenges. Primary cardiac manifestations may be obscured by concurrent injuries such as costal fractures or pulmonary contusions, potentially resulting in delayed recognition of cardiac sequelae — a critical determinant of clinical outcomes. In the present case, initial electrocardiographic evaluation revealed ventricular tachycardia, a significant arrhythmia associated with, but not pathognomonic for, AMI. Classical myocardial infarction indicators emerged in the subsequent hours. The patient's AMI presentation was attributed to traumatic coronary artery dissection, necessitating immediate therapeutic intervention and intensive monitoring.

The implementation of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in such cases presents significant therapeutic considerations. While this intervention provides essential hemodynamic support, it carries inherent risks, particularly regarding hemorrhagic complications. The patient may experienced substantial bleeding following heparin administration during PCI, highlighting the necessity for meticulous evaluation of anticoagulation risks and benefits in trauma patients.

### Cardiac damage after polytrauma: the role of systematic transthoracic echocardiography-a pilot study [^e84ad748]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Due to the variety of symptoms, diagnosing cardiac dysfunction or any kind of cardiac damage might be challenging. The diagnostic algorithm of cardiac damage after trauma consists of the systemic measurements of cardiac damage markers like troponin, a 3-channel ECG and if there are any clinically suspicious findings, the conduction of a transthoracic echocardiography. In the present study, we defined cardiac damage as either an increase in troponin concentration or/and impairment of cardiac function, as measured by TTE. After polytrauma, the serum troponin concentrations have been correlated with the Injury Severity Score (ISS) and the mortality due to polytrauma. Although troponin has some limitations as a marker of cardiac damage in severely injured patients — such as its dependence on kidney function — no superior biomarker has been identified so far. Therefore, high sensitivity TnT measurement in the emergency department remains the gold standard for laboratory diagnostics in multiple injured patients. A 3 channel ECG is further part of the diagnostic algorithm of blunt cardiac trauma. Non-specific dysrhythmias like a sinus tachycardia, are common after trauma and have been observed in up to 80% of patients. Chen et al. (2021) reviewed the use of ECG after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and found that, although its utilization rate is very low, it was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality. Therefore, monitoring cardiac electrical activity may improve outcomes for TBI patients. However, conduction of an ECG can also be misleading, as it was shown in a case report of a 37-years-old male patient, after motor vehicle accident: the emergency physician on the scene diagnosed a myocardial infarction by ST-elevation, although the hemodynamic instability of this patients was based on a massive cardiac and pulmonary contusion. In such cases, the TTE or transoesophageal echocardiography should be added to the standard algorithm.
