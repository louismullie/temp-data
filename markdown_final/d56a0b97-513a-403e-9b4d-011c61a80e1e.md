## Question

Does alcohol based hand sanitizer kill c diff

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether alcohol-based hand sanitizer kills Clostridioides difficile and what the implications are for hand hygiene in healthcare settings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the organism's spore biology and why alcohol might fail. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (IDSA/SHEA, CDC, ASCRS) recommend for hand hygiene when caring for patients with CDI. Next, I will examine experimental data comparing alcohol-based hand rubs versus soap and water for spore removal. After that, I should review real-world and epidemiologic evidence on CDI incidence with alcohol-based hand hygiene policies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation and clarify any nuances or exceptions, including the role of gloves and environmental cleaning.

> Let me first confirm the core microbiology. C. difficile exists in two forms: the vegetative, toxin-producing cells that are susceptible to antibiotics and gastric acid, and the highly resilient spores that persist in the environment and are notably resistant to heat, acids, many disinfectants, and alcohol-based agents; this spore resilience is the key reason alcohol-based hand sanitizers are ineffective at killing C. difficile spores [^116bHYon] [^115BEnqH] [^1178Yqou].

> Wait, let me verify the direct answer before moving to practice implications. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers do not kill C. difficile spores; they are ineffective for sporicidal activity, so they cannot be relied upon to eradicate C. difficile contamination on hands when spores are present [^113g9f3A] [^115Mk8Y1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical guidance. I need to check what the major guidelines say. IDSA/SHEA recommends that in routine or endemic settings either soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub can be used for hand hygiene when caring for CDI patients, but in outbreaks or hyperendemic settings, handwashing with soap and water is preferred because it better removes spores; ASCRS explicitly states alcohol rubs do not kill spores and should not be used as a single agent for decontamination in these circumstances [^114U165d] [^112fFo4d] [^113g9f3A].

> I should double-check the mechanistic rationale. Soap and water provide mechanical removal of spores through friction and rinsing, whereas alcohol lacks that physical action and does not inactivate spores. Experimental studies show soap and water achieve meaningful log reductions in spores on hands, whereas alcohol-based rubs achieve little to no reduction and leave spores readily transferable to others [^111wSXio].

> Next, I should review the experimental data quantifying this. In randomized volunteer studies, plain soap and water reduced C. difficile spores by roughly 1.5–2 log10, whereas alcohol-based hand rubs achieved only about a 0.1–0.4 log10 reduction — essentially no better than water alone — and residual spores were easily transferred by handshake after alcohol use. Structured WHO handwashing technique further improves removal compared with unstructured washing [^1139Gx7s] [^115FJmSA] [^114PY5gD].

> But wait, what about real-world outcomes when alcohol-based hand hygiene programs are implemented broadly? I need to check that. Several time-series and observational studies show that while increased alcohol-based hand rub use correlates with reductions in MRSA and VRE, it has not consistently reduced CDI incidence; some hospitals even saw stable or unchanged CDI rates after adopting alcohol-based policies, reinforcing that ABHR does not address spore transmission dynamics [^111dXCkf] [^117TfjUK] [^115SmzQS].

> Let me consider the clinical implications and practical approach. For patients with known or suspected CDI, especially in outbreaks or hyperendemic settings, handwashing with soap and water is preferred. In routine care, ABHR may be used if soap and water are not immediately available, but it should not be the sole method when there is likely spore exposure, and glove use plus soap-and-water handwashing after glove removal is critical. Environmental control with sporicidal disinfectants and structured cleaning protocols complements hand hygiene to reduce transmission risk [^114U165d] [^111vjYMC] [^11161Vp9].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied ABHR increases CDI risk — does it? I should verify. Contemporary guidance notes that while ABHR is ineffective against spores, no clinical studies have demonstrated an increase in CDI attributable to ABHR use; however, relying on ABHR alone in CDI contexts is inadequate, and programs should emphasize soap and water when spore exposure is likely while maintaining ABHR access for other pathogens and general use [^115Mk8Y1] [^116HEsv5] [^116KhRLD].

> I need to ensure I cover special settings. In outpatient dialysis units and NICU contexts, experts similarly recommend soap and water over ABHR for CDI prevention due to spore resilience, with ABHR reserved for non-spore threats and when soap and water are not feasible; this aligns with the broader principle of matching hand hygiene modality to the pathogen's biology and transmission risks [^116FoUss] [^11445Lpf].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer does not kill C. difficile spores and is not sufficient for hand decontamination when C. difficile contamination is likely. Soap and water handwashing is the preferred method to mechanically remove spores, with ABHR acceptable only as an adjunct or when soap and water are unavailable, and always in combination with glove use and appropriate environmental sporicidal cleaning to interrupt transmission [^113g9f3A] [^114U165d] [^111vjYMC].

---

Alcohol-based hand sanitizers **do not kill C. difficile spores** because these spores are highly resistant to alcohol [^115BEnqH]. Soap and water handwashing is the **only effective method** for mechanically removing spores from hands [^1139Gx7s] [^115FJmSA]. In routine care, use soap and water after contact with C. difficile patients; if only alcohol-based sanitizer is available, use it, but **wash with soap and water as soon as possible** [^114U165d] [^116KhRLD]. During outbreaks or hyperendemic settings, soap and water are **strongly preferred** [^1174pQNB] [^113g9f3A].

---

## Resistance of C. difficile spores to alcohol-based hand sanitizers

C. difficile forms hardy spores that persist on surfaces for months and resist heat, chemicals, and antibiotics [^115BEnqH] [^115YT7yM]. Alcohol-based sanitizers are **ineffective against these spores** because alcohol cannot penetrate the spore coat or inactivate key proteins [^1178Yqou] [^113g9f3A].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Multiple studies show alcohol-based sanitizers are **ineffective at removing C. difficile spores** from hands:

- **Jabbar et al. (2010)**: ABHR achieved only ~0.1–0.4 log10 reduction vs plain water, and residual spores were readily transferred after ABHR use [^115FJmSA].

- **Edmonds et al. (2009)**: ABHR was equivalent to no intervention for spore removal; soap and water achieved ~2 log10 reduction [^1139Gx7s].

- **06f59eed**: After hand hygiene, C. difficile persisted on 3/3 with ABHR vs 2/4 with soap and water [^111BKRme].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines align on this point:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| IDSA/SHEA (2018) | - Soap and water preferred in outbreaks/hyperendemic settings <br/> - ABHR acceptable in routine care but less effective for spores [^114U165d] [^1174pQNB] |
| CDC (2022) | - Soap and water preferred after caring for CDI patients <br/> - ABHR acceptable if soap/water unavailable [^116NLd62] [^1161Rdvj] |
| ASCRS (2021) | - ABHR does not kill spores <br/> - Soap and water plus contact precautions recommended [^113g9f3A] |

---

## Mechanism of action: why alcohol-based sanitizers fail

Alcohols denature proteins and disrupt membranes but **cannot penetrate the spore coat** or inactivate essential spore components, so spores remain viable and infectious [^1178Yqou] [^115BEnqH].

---

## Alternative hand hygiene methods

Soap and water are the **most effective alternative**, providing mechanical removal of spores [^1139Gx7s]; structured handwashing (e.g. WHO technique) improves removal [^114PY5gD]. Antiseptic wipes are less effective than soap and water and should not replace them when spores are likely [^1139Gx7s] [^112fFo4d].

---

## Clinical implications and infection control strategies

Because ABHR does not kill spores, **multimodal strategies are essential**:

- **Soap and water**: Preferred after contact with CDI patients or likely spore exposure [^114U165d] [^111hnAML].

- **Contact precautions**: Gowns and gloves for all CDI patient care [^111yMt4L] [^11161Vp9].

- **Environmental cleaning**: Use EPA-registered sporicidal disinfectants (e.g. diluted bleach) [^111vjYMC] [^112DcGYb].

- **Antibiotic stewardship**: Reduce high-risk antibiotics to lower CDI risk [^113q5WRe] [^113aoHYr].

---

## Summary of evidence

Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are **ineffective against C. difficile spores**; soap and water handwashing is the only reliable method for spore removal. Use soap and water after contact with CDI patients; if only ABHR is available, use it temporarily but wash with soap and water as soon as possible [^113g9f3A] [^1161Rdvj].

### What you should know about hand hygiene | Blogs | CDC… [^116NLd62]. blogs.cdc.gov (2016). Low credibility.

1 CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion often receives inquiries from healthcare providers and staff asking for clarification on CDC recommendations and guidelines, including hand hygiene in healthcare facilities. The following are a few of the most commonly asked questions on hand hygiene. What is the preferred method for healthcare providers to clean their hands – soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is the preferred method. Compared to soap and water, alcohol-based sanitizers are more effective and less drying to the hands than frequent use of soap and water. To learn more, check out CDC's Show Me the Science webpage. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer doesn't killHealthcare providers should always use gloves when caring for patients with C. difficile, so how should healthcare providers manage hand hygiene when caring for patients with C. difficile. C. difficile.

In addition, when there's an outbreak of C. difficilein your facility, wash your hands with soap and water after removing gloves. Is there a technique to cleaning hands with alcohol-based hand sanitizer. When using alcohol-based hand sanitizer, put product on your hands and rub hands together. Cover all surfaces until hands feel dry. This should take around 20 seconds, a good indicator that the right amount has been used. Remember to clean your thumbs, finger tips, and in between the fingers – these areas are commonly missed when cleaning hands with alcohol-based hand sanitizer. In healthcare, CDC's guidelines state that hands should be washed for at least 15 seconds, not specifically 15 seconds. Some CDC documents for handwashing outside of healthcare settings say to wash for 20 seconds and recommend singing happy birthday twice, which takes around 20 seconds. Either time is acceptable. Why do I have to clean my hands if I will wear gloves.

Glove use is not a substitute for cleaning hands. Dirty gloves can soil hands. Healthcare providers should clean their hands after removing gloves to help prevent the spread of potentially deadly germs. The bottom line: Clean hands can protect patients and healthcare providers from dangerous and deadly infections, so clean your hands before and after every patient contact. On May 5th, in celebration of World Hand Hygiene Day, CDC rolled out a new campaign called Clean Hands Count that answers these questions and more.

### Back to basics: hand hygiene and isolation [^114hQuun]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

ALCOHOL-BASED HAND RUB EFFICACY AGAINST SPECIFIC PATHOGENS

A number of ABHR preparations have demonstrated virucidal and bactericidal activity. The effectiveness of ABHR against norovirus remains controversial. Although the WHO favours the use of ABHR during norovirus outbreaks, the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) continues to recommend handwashing with soap and water. Paulmann et al. recently demonstrated that two WHO ABHR solutions were effective against murine norovirus (a surrogate for human norovirus) both in vitro and in vivo, although the efficacy of other formulations remains unclear. Further research is required in this area. A variety of ABHR formulations appeared to have equivalent efficacy to soap and water handwashing in reducing hand contamination with H1N1 influenza. A study from Taiwandemonstrated poor activity of existing ABHR formulations against human enterovirus 71, a nonenveloped virus of public health significance in the Asia-Pacific region.

Despite these in-vivo studies, the clinical utility of ABHR for preventing respiratory virus infections in the community remains less certain. Turner et al. conducted a randomized trial in young adult volunteers on the ability of ABHR to prevent rhinovirus infection or rhinovirus-associated illness. Despite the earlier promise in experimental models, they were not able to demonstrate a benefit. Wong et al. performed a meta-analysis on the efficacy of hand hygiene interventions in preventing influenza virus transmission in the community. Although subgroup analysis from developed countries suggested that a combined intervention of hand hygiene with facemasks is a beneficial strategy, the efficacy of hand hygiene alone was not demonstrated.

It has previously been demonstrated that washing with soap and water is more effective than ABHR in removing C. difficile spores from the hands of healthcare workers. Edmonds et al. evaluated 10 different test products in their ability to remove C. difficile spores from the hands of test subjects. The only substances that were able to achieve significantly higher log 10 reductions than tap water were not suitable for routine use in healthcare environments. This reinforces the current recommendation of handwashing with soap and water and contact precautions for care of patients with C. difficile.

One formulation of ABHR (70% isopropanol and 0.5% chlorhexidine) effectively reduced the density of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) contamination by approximately 10⁴ in a detailed assessment of 20 healthcare workers who had their hands heavily contaminated (10⁸ cfu/ml) with two strains of VRE.

Another key feature of C. difficile biology is its ability to form spores, likely in response to stress and nutrient limitation. Sporulation in C. difficile has been tied to its metabolic environment, particularly with emphasis on peptides, carbon catabolite availability, and branched amino acids present in its environment. Genetic regulation of C. difficile sporulation is tightly controlled. Through a complex series of morphological and biochemical changes, sporulating C. difficile cells divide asymmetrically and form an environmentally resistant spore, which is released from the larger mother cell by cell lysis. Spores are highly resistant to environmental stresses such as heat, chemicals, desiccation, oxygen, and ethanol-based sanitizers. These spores allow C. difficile to survive outside the GI tract and transmit to new hosts, where they germinate to form vegetative cells.

CLOSTRIDIOIDES DIFFICILE INFECTION

C. difficile is the most common pathogen to cause HAIs in the United States. Unlike other HAIs, CDI actually slightly decreased during the pandemic. COVID-19 related improvements in hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE) practices, and environmental cleaning may have contributed to this decrease.

Strategies to Prevent C. difficile Infections in Acute Care Hospitals: 2022 Update has recently been published. Unlike the other sections, there are fewer changes, and the level of evidence for most recommendations remains low; however, it is well written and contains very useful information. In the 2014 Compendium under basic practice, the authors write to encourage appropriate use of antimicrobials (MODERATE), and under special approaches, they recommended initiation of an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP). Although any systemic antibiotic may increase risk of CDI, fluoroquinolones, third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, and clindamycin are associated with the highest risk of CDI. Studies have demonstrated implementation of an effective ASP can reduce the risk of CDI. The 2022 document combines as an essential practice to encourage appropriate use of antimicrobials through implementation of an effective ASP (MODERATE). The most significant change under essential practices is the addition to implementing a diagnostic stewardship program for ensuring appropriate use and interpretation of C. difficile testing (LOW). This includes working with the clinical microbiology laboratory to develop preagreed criteria for C. difficile testing, and interpretation of C. difficile testing results particularly if NAATs (nucleic acid amplification testing) are used either as a stand-alone test or part of a multistep testing algorithm. Reduction of unnecessary C. difficile therapy is an important ASP target, given its association with increased prevalence of resistant organisms. The new update also moved to assess adequacy of room cleaning from a special approach to essential practice (LOW). The 2022 update continues to recommend contact precautions for patients with CDI for at least 48 h after diarrhea has resolved.

Regarding preventative measures for Clostridioides difficile infection, more specifically with respect to infection control measures, hand hygiene, IDSA/SHEA 2018 guidelines recommend to practice hand hygiene with soap and water preferentially instead of alcohol-based hand hygiene products before and after caring for a patient with CDI during CDI outbreaks or hyperendemic (sustained high rates) settings, given the increased efficacy of spore removal with soap and water.

Patient bathing and hand hygiene in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) — encourage patients to wash hands and shower to reduce the burden of spores on the skin (good practice recommendation), because the hands of patients can become contaminated with C. difficile and can transmit it to surfaces; among 37 patients with CDI, showering was more effective than bed bathing in decreasing the rate of positive skin cultures, supporting a strategy to reduce skin spore burden.

Prevention and control of hospital infection

Effective isolation measures should be taken for patients suspected of being infected with CDI to prevent community transmission. Patients who are suspected should be kept in independent rooms with at least a dedicated commode. In case of need, CDI patients should be grouped, instead of with those who are colonized or infected with other drug-resistant micro-organisms (such as methicillin-resistant staphylococci). In addition, it is recommended that the isolation should be continued for at least 48 h after the stool has solidified. Gloves and other protective clothing should be worn by medical personnel before coming into contact with a CDI patient. Since alcohol hand sanitizer does not work for C. difficile spores while soap water hand washing has been confirmed the ability of to remove spores effectively (and is the first sanitation measure to prevent CDI transmission), each person who comes into contact with the patient should use soapy water to wash their hand. In addition, chlorine-containing products or other bactericides should be used to clean the ward. IBD patients were mainly infected with CDI through community and outpatient clinics. Therefore, we should carry out health education for patients, formulate prevention manuals, and emphasize hand hygiene to reduce the spread of C. difficile.

### Death caused by ingestion of an ethanol-based hand sanitizer [^11531YAb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The use of hand sanitizer is effective in preventing the transmission of disease. Many hand sanitizers are alcohol-based, and significant intoxications have occurred, often in health care facilities, including the emergency department (ED).

Objectives

We present this case to highlight potential toxicity after the ingestion of an ethanol-based hand sanitizer.

Case Report

A 36-year-old man presented to the ED with ethanol intoxication. Ethanol breath analysis was measured at 278 mg/dL. After 4 h, the patient was less intoxicated and left the ED. Thirty minutes later, he was found apneic and pulseless in the ED waiting room bathroom after having ingested an ethanol-based hand sanitizer. Soon after a brief resuscitation, his serum ethanol was 526 mg/dL. He never regained consciousness and died 7 days later. No other cause of death was found.

Conclusion

The case highlights the potential for significant toxicity after the ingestion of a product found throughout health care facilities. Balancing the benefit of hand sanitizers for preventing disease transmission and their potential misuse remains a challenge.

CDI hand hygiene method and considerations — As the preferred method, perform hand hygiene with soap and water following care of or interacting with the healthcare environment of a patient with CDI. (Quality of evidence: LOW). Facilities should Ensure proper hand hygiene technique when using soap and water and Be aware that hand hygiene adherence may decrease when soap and water is the preferred method. Supporting statements include Gloves are effective at preventing C. difficile contamination of hands, Hand washing may remove < 1-log10 of spores, even with a 60-second hand wash, Alcohol-based hand rub is superior to hand washing for non–spore-forming organisms (eg, MRSA). Using alcohol-based hand rub following soap and water may enhance hand hygiene effectiveness, and Reductions in CDI have not been observed with hand washing only using soap and water.

### Hand sanitizer alert [^1178VZN4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Community-based epidemiologic studies have shown beneficial effects of hand sanitizers. Hand sanitizers were effective in reducing gastrointestinal illnesses in households, in curbing absentee rates in elementary schools, and in reducing illnesses in university dormitories. An Internet search retrieved recommendations for hand hygiene from schools, daycare centers, outdoor guides, and animal shelters.

To reduce infections in healthcare settings, alcohol-based hand sanitizers are recommended as a component of hand hygiene. For alcohol-based hand sanitizers, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends a concentration of 60% to 95% ethanol or isopropanol, the concentration range of greatest germicidal efficacy. While nonhealthcare groups also recommend alcohol-based hand sanitizers, they usually do not specify an appropriate concentration of alcohol.

Some products marketed to the public as antimicrobial hand sanitizers are not effective in reducing bacterial counts on hands. In the course of a classroom demonstration of the comparative efficacy of hospital-grade antimicrobial soap and alcohol-based sanitizers, a product with 40% ethanol as the active ingredient was purchased at a retail discount store. Despite a label claim of reducing "germs and harmful bacteria" by 99.9%, we observed an apparent increase in the concentration of bacteria in handprints impressed on agar plates after cleansing. None of the other hand cleaners showed such an effect.

Subsequently, we conducted more formal handwashing trials to verify the preliminary finding. Our goal was not to test the products by using the FDA tentative final monograph standard but to determine whether a marketed product fails as an antiseptic because of its low alcohol content. To test whether the relatively low concentration of ethanol was the source of treatment failure, we included trials with laboratory-formulated 40% ethanol; we also supplemented the suspect gel with ethanol to a final concentration of 62%. Five hand hygiene treatments were compared: tap water (4 trials), 40% ethanol (5 trials), commercial gels with active ingredients of either 40% or 62% ethanol (9 trials each), and commercial 40% gel supplemented to 62% (5 trials).

### Strategies to preventinfections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^115WRRy2]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

C. difficile infection (CDI) — hand hygiene compliance and glove use are emphasized: Measure compliance with the CDC or WHO hand hygiene and contact precautions recommendations. (Quality of evidence: LOW). Patient-to-patient transmission of C. difficile is thought to occur primarily through transient contamination of the hands of HCP with spores. Glove use when caring for patients with CDI or touching surfaces in their rooms has been shown to be effective at preventing the transmission of C. difficile. Evidence notes that most hand wash products produced a < 1-log10 reduction in spores despite a 60-second hand wash (30-second wash and 30-second rinse), that contamination of hands is less common when gloves are worn for the patient encounter, and that several clinical studies have not found an increase in CDI with alcohol-based hand rub, but several did find reductions in MRSA and/or VRE.

### Front-line education by infection preventionists helps reduce Clostridioides difficile infections [^115ipsBh]. American Journal of Infection Control (2020). Medium credibility.

When implementing the latest innovations to reduce health care-associated infections, it is important not to overlook basic infection prevention principles such as hand hygiene, isolation precautions, use of personal protective equipment, and cleaning and low-level disinfection. Like many facilities, we implemented a multifaceted approach to reduce hospital-onset Clostridioides difficile infections. In this paper, we share simple tools that we found helpful in improving infection prevention practices by addressing knowledge gaps among staff, visitors, and patients.

### Clostridium difficile colitis: a retrospective study of incidence and severity before and after institution of an alcohol-based hand rub policy [^115Em67P]. American Journal of Infection Control (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea is a leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea. We sought to determine whether the institution of a hospital-wide alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) policy was associated with an increase in the incidence and/or severity of health care facility-onset, health care facility-associated C difficile diarrhea (CDAD).

Methods

We used a retrospective chart review analysis to compare incidence rates of CDAD before and after implementation of the ABHR policy. We also compared rates of sepsis, colectomy, and death in patients with CDAD before and after implementation of the ABHR policy.

Results

The incidence rate of CDAD was 3.98 per 10,000 patient-days after implementation of the ABHR policy, compared with 4.96 per 10,000 patient-days before implementation (P = 0.0036). The crude mortality rate in patients diagnosed with CDAD was 10.7% after implementation, compared with 13.3% before implementation (P = 0.275). The rate of sepsis in patients diagnosed with CDAD was 19.6% after implementation, compared with 5.2% before implementation (P < .0001).

Conclusion

Our data provide no evidence of an increased CDAD rate after implementation of an ABHR policy at our institution. The rate of sepsis in patients diagnosed with CDAD did rise, indicating increased severity of illness in patients with C difficile infection.

### Two time-series analyses of the impact of antibiotic consumption and alcohol-based hand disinfection on the incidences of nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection and Clostridium difficile infection [^111dXCkf]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the impact of antibiotic consumption and alcohol-based hand disinfection on the incidences of nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).

Methods

Two multivariate time-series analyses were performed that used as dependent variables the monthly incidences of nosocomial MRSA infection and CDI at the Freiburg University Medical Center during the period January 2003 through October 2007. The volume of alcohol-based hand rub solution used per month was quantified in liters per 1,000 patient-days. Antibiotic consumption was calculated in terms of the number of defined daily doses per 1,000 patient-days per month.

Results

The use of alcohol-based hand rub was found to have a significant impact on the incidence of nosocomial MRSA infection (P < .001). The multivariate analysis (R² = 0.66) showed that a higher volume of use of alcohol-based hand rub was associated with a lower incidence of nosocomial MRSA infection. Conversely, a higher level of consumption of selected antimicrobial agents was associated with a higher incidence of nosocomial MRSA infection. This analysis showed this relationship was the same for the use of second-generation cephalosporins (P = 0.023), third-generation cephalosporins (P = 0.05), fluoroquinolones (P = 0.01), and lincosamides (P = 0.05). The multivariate analysis (R² = 0.55) showed that a higher level of consumption of third-generation cephalosporins (P = 0.008), fluoroquinolones (P = 0.084), and/or macrolides (P = 0.007) was associated with a higher incidence of CDI. A correlation with use of alcohol-based hand rub was not detected.

Conclusion

In 2 multivariate time-series analyses, we were able to show the impact of hand hygiene and antibiotic use on the incidence of nosocomial MRSA infection, but we found no association between hand hygiene and incidence of CDI.

### Role of hospital surfaces in the transmission of emerging health care-associated pathogens: norovirus, Clostridium difficile, and Acinetobacter species [^1145Ehb5]. American Journal of Infection Control (2010). Low credibility.

Health care-associated infections (HAI) remain a major cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Although the main source of nosocomial pathogens is likely the patient's endogenous flora, an estimated 20% to 40% of HAI have been attributed to cross infection via the hands of health care personnel, who have become contaminated from direct contact with the patient or indirectly by touching contaminated environmental surfaces. Multiple studies strongly suggest that environmental contamination plays an important role in the transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. More recently, evidence suggests that environmental contamination also plays a role in the nosocomial transmission of norovirus, Clostridium difficile, and Acinetobacter spp. All 3 pathogens survive for prolonged periods of time in the environment, and infections have been associated with frequent surface contamination in hospital rooms and health care worker hands. In some cases, the extent of patient-to-patient transmission has been found to be directly proportional to the level of environmental contamination. Improved cleaning/disinfection of environmental surfaces and hand hygiene have been shown to reduce the spread of all of these pathogens. Importantly, norovirus and C difficile are relatively resistant to the most common surface disinfectants and waterless alcohol-based antiseptics. Current hand hygiene guidelines and recommendations for surface cleaning/disinfection should be followed in managing outbreaks because of these emerging pathogens.

### Prevention of infection due to Clostridium (Clostridioides) difficile [^114EVHok]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridium (Clostridioides) difficile infection (CDI) causes significant morbidity and mortality in the United States every year. Prevention of CDI is difficult because of spore durability and requires implementation of multipronged strategies. Two categories of prevention strategies are infection control and prevention and risk factor reduction. Hand hygiene, contact precautions, patient isolation, and environmental decontamination are cornerstones of infection control and prevention. Risk factor reduction should focus on antibiotic stewardship to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. If CDI incidence remains higher than the institution's goal despite these measures, then special measures should be considered.

### Effectiveness of alcohol-based hand rubs for removal of Clostridium difficile spores from hands [^115FJmSA]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs) are an effective means of decreasing the transmission of bacterial pathogens. Alcohol is not effective against Clostridium difficile spores. We examined the retention of C. difficile spores on the hands of volunteers after ABHR use and the subsequent transfer of these spores through physical contact.

Methods

Nontoxigenic C. difficile spores were spread on the bare palms of 10 volunteers. Use of 3 ABHRs and chlorhexidine soap-and-water washing were compared with plain water rubbing alone for removal of C. difficile spores. Palmar cultures were performed before and after hand decontamination by means of a plate stamping method. Transferability of C. difficile after application of ABHR was tested by having each volunteer shake hands with an uninoculated volunteer.

Results

Plain water rubbing reduced palmar culture counts by a mean (± standard deviation [SD]) of 1.57 ± 0.11 log10 colony-forming units (CFU) per cm², and this value was set as the zero point for the other products. Compared with water washing, chlorhexidine soap washing reduced spore counts by a mean (± SD) of 0.89 ± 0.34 log10 CFU per cm²; among the ABHRs, Isagel accounted for a reduction of 0.11 ± 0.20 log10 CFU per cm² (P = 0.005), Endure for a reduction of 0.37 ± 0.42 log10 CFU per cm² (P = 0.010), and Purell for a reduction of 0.14 ± 0.33 log10 CFU per cm² (P = 0.005). There were no statistically significant differences between the reductions achieved by the ABHRs; only Endure had a reduction statistically different from that for water control rubbing (P = 0.040). After ABHR use, handshaking transferred a mean of 30% of the residual C. difficile spores to the hands of recipients.

Conclusions

Hand washing with soap and water is significantly more effective at removing C. difficile spores from the hands of volunteers than are ABHRs. Residual spores are readily transferred by a handshake after use of ABHR.

Organisms with less susceptibility to biocides

Spore-forming organisms (eg, C. difficile and B. cereus) and small nonenveloped viruses (eg, norovirus) are difficult to inactivate with surface disinfectants and may not be inactivated by alcohol. Many facilities lack clarity regarding whether alcohol-based hand sanitizer should be used when contact with organisms that are less susceptible to biocides occurs. These organisms may also be difficult to remove through handwashing. Using a nontoxigenic strain of C. difficile to test reductions associated with handwashing technique a 1.3 log 10 reduction was attained with an unstructured handwash and a 1.7 log 10 reduction was attained using a structured handwash (ie, the WHO How to Handrub).

When exposure to potential spore-forming organisms or small nonenveloped viruses is anticipated (ie, patients diagnosed with C. difficile infection or norovirus or those with new acute diarrhea or vomiting), the CDC recommends standard and contact precautions for all contacts with the patient and their surroundings. HCP need clear messaging about hand hygiene in response to these organisms. Those directing hand hygiene programs should do the following: (1) help HCP remain aware of organisms with biocide resistance that are circulating in the facility; (2) emphasize the importance of reducing hand contamination through the use of gloves according to standard and contact precautions; (3) maintain the availability of ABHS in the presence of these organisms; (4) in all settings, regardless of organisms present, always wash hands if visibly soiled, before eating, and after using the bathroom; and (5) emphasize the importance of thorough hand cleaning with the consideration of educating HCP in WHO-structured techniques for handwashing and hand sanitizing.

Accessible hand hygiene supplies

Among 350 HCP surveyed in the United States and Canada, lack of access to supplies was described as the primary barrier to adherence. The physical infrastructure required to implement hand hygiene in all facilities consists of access to ABHS and handwashing stations supplied with water, soap (ie, plain or with an antiseptic), towels, gloves, and hand moisturizers that are compatible with antiseptics and gloves. In perioperative and procedural areas, including ICUs, surgical hand scrub and surgical hand rub should also be accessible to HCP.

### Evaluating the effect of automated hand hygiene technology on compliance and C. difficile rates in a long-term acute care hospital [^113w8Jup]. American Journal of Infection Control (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Compliance with hand hygiene (HH) standards is a critical component to reducing the prevalence of Health Care Acquired Infections (HAIs). The use of HH technologies is increasing and studies examining the success of these technologies on HH compliance and HAIs are important to inform standards of care. COVID-19 has emphasized compliance HH standards.

Methods

This study evaluated HH compliance and Clostridium difficile (C difficile) rates following implementation of an HH technology at a long-term acute care hospital. The HH technology required nursing and other staff with direct patient contact to wear a "badge" that measured alcohol concentration on a health care worker's hands or time washing hands at designated sinks upon exit/entry of patient rooms. No changes were made to environmental cleaning or antibiotic stewardship standards. Compliance and infection rates were compared 12 months pre-post implementation during 2017–2019.

Results

There was an increase in HH compliance (89.82%-97.10%, P < .001)) and a reduction in the incidence of C. difficile (9.541–3.720, P = 0.0032).

Conclusion

The HH technology significantly and quickly increased HH compliance and reduced rates of C difficile. The technology provided ancillary benefits, including data tracing of all patient and staff contacts and cross-contamination events.

### Strategies to preventinfections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^116Z8Ao7]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile environmental control — touchless disinfection technologies: Several touchless disinfection products use ultraviolet light (UV-C) or vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) to disinfect the environment, inactivate C. difficile spores, and reduce cultivable C. difficile from patient rooms, but their use does not preclude the need to manually clean soiled surfaces. Evidence from a meta-analysis of single-center quasi-experimental studies showed variable results by system type, baseline CDI incidence, and accompanying disinfectant; study quality was low, but 4 of 6 studies adding UV-C to bleach cleaning demonstrated decreased CDI incidence. In a cluster-randomized, multicenter, crossover study comparing UV-C/bleach versus bleach alone at CDI patient discharge, the incidence of CDI among subsequent room occupants did not differ, whereas a secondary analysis observed hospital-wide decreases in CDI incidence after implementing UV-C with standard quaternary ammonium (or with bleach for rooms previously occupied by a patient with C. difficile).

Hand hygiene when caring for patients in isolation for CDI (assuming glove use): In routine or endemic settings, perform hand hygiene before and after contact of a patient with CDI and after removing gloves with either soap and water or an alcohol-based hand hygiene product (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In CDI outbreaks or hyperendemic (sustained high rates) settings, perform hand hygiene with soap and water preferentially instead of alcohol-based hand hygiene products before and after caring for a patient with CDI given the increased efficacy of spore removal with soap and water (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

Clinical outcomes

Nineteen studies reported clinical or microbiological outcomes alongside hand hygiene outcomes. Six of these were multicentre studies, and 13 were based in a single hospital. All reported that improvements in hand hygiene were associated with reductions in at least one measure of hospital acquired infection and/or resistance rates. In most case, however, either appropriate analysis was lacking, denominators were not reported, time series data were not shown (making interrupted time series designs vulnerable to pre-existing trends), or numbers were too small to draw firm conclusions.

There were, however, three single centre studies that did not have these limitations. Two of these studies, which lasted about seven years, used time series analysis to study associations between use of alcohol hand rub and clinical outcomes, with adjustment for changing patterns of antibiotic use. Lee and colleagues found strong evidence (P < 0.001) that increased use of alcohol hand rub was associated with reduced incidence of healthcare associated infection and evidence that it was associated with reduced healthcare associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection (P = 0.02). Vernaz and colleagues found strong evidence that increased use of alcohol based hand rub was associated with reduced incidence of MRSA clinical isolates per 100 patient days (P < 0.001), reporting that 1L of hand rub per 100 patient days was associated with a reduction in MRSA of 0.03 isolates per 100 patient days. No association was found between increased use of alcohol based hand rub and clinical isolates of Clostridium difficile. Johnson and colleagues reported that an intervention in an Australian teaching hospital associated with a mean improvement of compliance with hand hygiene from 21% to 42% was also associated with declining trends in clinical MRSA isolates (by 36 months after the intervention clinical isolates per discharge had fallen by 40% compared with the baseline before the intervention), declining trends in MRSA bacteraemias (57% lower than baseline after 36 months), and declining trends in clinical isolates of extended spectrum β lactamases (ESBL) producing E coli and Klebsiella (> 90% below baseline 36 months after intervention), though there was no evidence of changes in patient MRSA colonisation at four or 12 months after the intervention. In addition to hand hygiene, however, the intervention included patient decolonisation and ward cleaning, and the relative importance of these measures cannot be determined.

### Guidelines for safety in the gastrointestinal endoscopy unit [^116mzsbU]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal endoscopy unit — hand hygiene: Proper hand washing is considered to be the cornerstone of preventing the transmission of pathogens. Hand hygiene should be performed before patient contact (even if gloves are to be worn); after patient contact and before exiting the patient care area; after contact with blood, body fluids, or contaminated surfaces (even if gloves are worn); before performing invasive procedures (ie, placement or access of intravascular lines); and after glove removal. The use of soap and water is required when hands are visibly soiled and after caring for patients with known or suspected infectious causes of diarrhea such as C difficile; otherwise, the use of alcohol-based hand agents is adequate.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^111snd7K]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The main risk factors are antibiotic exposure, age more than 65 years, comorbidity or underlying conditions, inflammatory bowel diseases, immunodeficiency (including human immunodeficiency virus infection), malnutrition, and low serum albumin level. Antibiotics play a central role in the pathogenesis of CDI, presumably by disrupting the normal gut flora, thereby providing a perfect setting for C. difficile to proliferate and produce toxins. Although nearly all antibiotics have been associated with CDI, clindamycin, third-generation cephalosporins, penicillins, and fluoroquinolones have usually been considered at greatest risk.

A prompt and precise diagnosis is an important aspect of effective management of CDI. Early identification of CDI allows the establishment of an early treatment and can improve outcomes. Rapid isolation of infected patients is fundamental to limit C. difficile transmission. This is particularly important in reducing environmental contamination as spores can survive for months in the environment, despite regular use of environmental cleaning agents. Patients with CDI should be maintained in contact (enteric) precautions until the resolution of diarrhea (passage of formed stool for at least 48 h). Patients with known or suspected CDI should ideally be placed in a private room with en suite hand washing and toilet facilities. If a private room is not available, as often occurs, known CDI patients may be cohort, nursed in the same area, though the theoretical risk of transfection with different strains exists. Hand hygiene with soap and water and the use of contact precautions along with a good cleaning and disinfection of the environment and patient equipment should be used by all HCWs contacting any patient with known or suspected CDI. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are highly effective against non-spore-forming organisms, but they may not kill C. difficile spores or remove C. difficile from the hands. The most effective way to remove them from the hands is through handwashing with soap and water.

### Prevention of infection due to Clostridium difficile [^112BEqig]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is one of the foremost nosocomial pathogens. Preventing infection is particularly challenging. Effective prevention efforts typically require a multifaceted bundled approach. A variety of infection control procedures may be advantageous, including strict hand decontamination with soap and water, contact precautions, and using chlorine-containing decontamination agents. Additionally, risk factor reduction can help reduce the burden of disease. The risk factor modification is principally accomplished though antibiotic stewardship programs. Unfortunately, most of the current evidence for prevention is in acute care settings. This review focuses on preventative approaches to reduce the incidence of Clostridium difficile infection in healthcare settings.

### Hand hygiene with soap and water is superior to alcohol rub and antiseptic wipes for removal of Clostridium difficile [^1139Gx7s]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate common hand hygiene methods for efficacy in removing Clostridium difficile.

Design

Randomized crossover comparison among 10 volunteers with hands experimentally contaminated by nontoxigenic C. difficile.

Methods

Interventions included warm water with plain soap, cold water with plain soap, warm water with antibacterial soap, antiseptic hand wipes, alcohol-based handrub, and a control involving no intervention. All interventions were evaluated for mean reduction in colony-forming units (CFUs) under 2 contamination protocols: "whole hand" and "palmar surface". Results were analyzed according to a Bayesian approach, by using hierarchical models adjusted for multiple observations.

Results

Under the whole-hand protocol, the greatest adjusted mean reductions were achieved by warm water with plain soap (2.14 log(10) CFU/mL [95% credible interval (CrI), 1.74–2.54 log(10) CFU/mL]), cold water with plain soap (1.88 log(10) CFU/mL [95% CrI, 1.48–2.28 log(10) CFU/mL), and warm water with antibacterial soap (1.51 log(10) CFU/mL [95% CrI, 1.12–1.91 log(10) CFU/mL]), followed by antiseptic hand wipes (0.57 log(10) CFU/mL [95% CrI, 0.17–0.96 log(10) CFU/mL]). Alcohol-based handrub (0.06 log(10) CFU/mL [95% CrI, -0.34 to 0.45 log(10) CFU/mL]) was equivalent to no intervention. Under the palmar surface protocol, warm water with plain soap, cold water with plain soap, and warm water with antibacterial soap again yielded the greatest mean reductions, followed by antiseptic hand wipes (26.6, 26.6, 26.6, and 21.9 CFUs per plate, respectively), when compared with alcohol-based handrub. Hypothenar (odds ratio, 10.98 [95% CrI, 1.96–37.65]) and thenar (odds ratio, 6.99 [95% CrI, 1.25–23.41]) surfaces were more likely than fingertips to remain heavily contaminated after handwashing.

Conclusions

Handwashing with soap and water showed the greatest efficacy in removing C. difficile and should be performed preferentially over the use of alcohol-based handrubs when contact with C. difficile is suspected or likely.

### Reduction in nosocomial transmission of drug-resistant bacteria after introduction of an alcohol-based handrub [^117TfjUK]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess quantitatively the clinical impact of using an alcohol-based handrub (ABHR) in the hospital environment, measuring impact as the incidence of new, nosocomial isolates of drug-resistant organisms.

Design

An observational survey from 1998 to 2003 comparing the first 3 years of no ABHR use with the 3 years following, when an ABHR was provided for hand hygiene.

Setting

An inner-city, tertiary-care medical center.

Intervention

At baseline, an antimicrobial soap with 0.3% triclosan was provided for staff hand hygiene. The intervention was placement in all inpatient and all outpatient clinic rooms of wall-mounted dispensers of an ABHR with 62.5% ethyl alcohol. Data were collected on change in the incidence of three drug-resistant bacteria.

Results

During the 6 years of the survey, all new, nosocomially acquired isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea were recorded. On comparison of the first 3 years with the final 3 years, there was a 21% decrease in new, nosocomially acquired MRSA (90 to 71 isolates per year; p = 0.01) and a 41% decrease in VRE (41 to 24 isolates per year; P < .001). The incidence of new isolates of C. difficile was essentially unchanged.

Conclusion

In the 3 years following implementation of an ABHR, this hospital experienced the value of reductions in the incidence of nosocomially acquired drug-resistant bacteria. These reductions provide clinical validation of the recent CDC recommendation that ABHRs be the primary choice for hand decontamination.

### Clinical practice guidelines for Clostridium difficile infection in adults and children: 2017 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) [^116AZGVB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Hand hygiene for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) prevention — healthcare personnel and product selection — notes that hand hygiene guidelines recommend the use of alcohol-based products unless hands are soiled, while C. difficile spores are highly alcohol resistant; handwashing with soap and water or antimicrobial soap was found to be more effective than alcohol-based products for removing spores, and increased soap procurement was associated with a decline in CDI rates whereas increased alcohol hand rub procurement was associated with reduced MRSA bacteremia. In experimental and healthcare personnel studies, Clostridium difficile was recovered from the hands of 88% of personnel (14 of 16) after plain soap, and washing with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate reduced the rate to 14% (1 of 7 personnel), although another study found no difference between plain soap and chlorhexidine gluconate. Despite a theoretical concern for alcohol-based products increasing CDI, there have not been any clinical studies showing such an association; therefore, before and after caring for a patient with CDI, it is recommended to preferentially use soap and water over alcohol-based products alone in CDI-hyperendemic or outbreak settings, confirm glove compliance, and use alcohol-based products in nonoutbreak or endemic settings.

### Prospective, controlled, cross-over trial of alcohol-based hand gel in critical care units [^112iPwCb]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

There are limited data from prospective studies to indicate whether improvement in hand hygiene associated with the use of alcohol-based hand hygiene products results in improved patient outcomes.

Design

A 2-year, prospective, controlled, cross-over trial of alcohol-based hand gel.

Setting

The study was conducted in 2 medical-surgical ICUs for adults, each with 12 beds, from August 2001 to September 2003 at a university-associated, tertiary care teaching hospital.

Methods

An alcohol-based hand gel was provided in one critical care unit and not provided in the other. After 1 year, the assignment was reversed. The hand hygiene adherence rate and the incidence of nosocomial infection were monitored. Samples for culture were obtained from nurses' hands every 2 months.

Results

During 17,994 minutes of observation, which included 3,678 opportunities for hand hygiene, adherence rates improved dramatically after the introduction of hand gel, increasing from 37% to 68% in one unit and from 38% to 69% in the other unit (P < .001). Improvement was observed among all groups of healthcare workers. Hand hygiene rates were better at higher workloads when hand gel was available in the unit (P = 0.02). No substantial change in the rates of device-associated infection, infection due to multidrug-resistant pathogens, or infection due to Clostridium difficile was observed. Culture of samples from the hands of nursing staff revealed that an increased number of microbes and an increased number of microbe species was associated with longer fingernails (ie, more than 2 mm long), the wearing of rings, and/or lack of access to hand gel.

Conclusions

The introduction of alcohol-based gel resulted in a significant and sustained improvement in the rate of hand hygiene adherence. Fingernail length greater than 2 mm, wearing rings, and lack of access to hand gel were associated with increased microbial carriage on the hands. This improvement in the hand hygiene adherence rate was not associated with detectable changes in the incidence of healthcare-associated infection.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^11286nTc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Prevention — hand hygiene and infection control measures for infectious diarrhea emphasize that hand hygiene should be performed after using the toilet, changing diapers or soiled laundry, and after touching animals or their feces or environments, especially in public settings such as petting zoos (strong, moderate). Infection control measures including use of gloves and gowns, hand hygiene with soap and water, or alcohol-based sanitizers should be followed in the care of people with diarrhea (strong, high). The selection of a hand hygiene product should be based upon a known or suspected pathogen and the environment in which the organism may be transmitted (strong, low). In healthcare settings, alcohol-based hand hygiene is recommended unless there is visible soiling, when hand hygiene with water and soap is necessary, and when Cryptosporidium, norovirus, or a known spore-forming pathogen such as C. difficile is an infecting agent, hand hygiene with soap and water may be more effective than an alcohol-based sanitizer.

### Hand hygiene in the intensive care unit [^116KuLMw]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Healthcare-associated infections affect 1.4 million patients at any time worldwide, as estimated by the World Health Organization. In intensive care units, the burden of healthcare-associated infections is greatly increased, causing additional morbidity and mortality. Multidrug-resistant pathogens are commonly involved in such infections and render effective treatment challenging. Proper hand hygiene is the single most important, simplest, and least expensive means of preventing healthcare-associated infections. In addition, it is equally important to stop transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization guidelines on hand hygiene in health care, alcohol-based handrub should be used as the preferred means for routine hand antisepsis. Alcohols have excellent in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a variety of fungi, and most viruses. Some pathogens, however, such as Clostridium difficile, Bacillus anthracis, and noroviruses, may require special hand hygiene measures. Failure to provide user friendliness of hand hygiene equipment and shortage of staff are predictors for noncompliance, especially in the intensive care unit setting. Therefore, practical approaches to promote hand hygiene in the intensive care unit include provision of a minimal number of handrub dispensers per bed, monitoring of compliance, and choice of the most attractive product. Lack of knowledge of guidelines for hand hygiene, lack of recognition of hand hygiene opportunities during patient care, and lack of awareness of the risk of cross-transmission of pathogens are barriers to good hand hygiene practices. Multidisciplinary programs to promote increased use of alcoholic handrub lead to an increased compliance of healthcare workers with the recommended hand hygiene practices and a reduced prevalence of nosocomial infections.

ACG Clinical Guideline — prevention and prophylaxis for traveler's diarrhea: Patient level counseling on prevention of acute enteric infection is not routinely recommended but may be considered in the individual or close contacts of the individual who is at high risk for complications. Individuals should undergo pretravel counseling regarding high-risk food/beverage avoidance to prevent traveler's diarrhea. Frequent and effective hand washing and alcohol-based hand sanitizers are of limited value in preventing most forms of traveler's diarrhea but may be useful where low-dose pathogens are responsible for the illness as for example during a cruise ship outbreak of norovirus infection, institutional outbreak, or in endemic diarrhea prevention. Bismuth subsalicylates have moderate effectiveness and may be considered for travelers who do not have any contraindications to use and can adhere to the frequent dosing requirements. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics for prevention of TD are not recommended. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis has moderate to good effectiveness and may be considered in high-risk groups for short-term use.

Prevention

Prevention of CDI is an important goal to protect children and limit healthcare costs. In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine, prevention strategies rely on a 2-pronged approach of prevention of spread of C. difficile spores and prevention of factors that promote progression to disease in those with established colonization.

Prevention of Transmission

In healthcare settings, attention to infection control practices and facility cleaning may help to limit the spread of C. difficile. As alcohol-based hand sanitizers do not inactivate spores, exercising meticulous hand hygiene with soap and water after caring for a patient with CDI is recommended. Contact isolation includes the donning of gloves and gowns by healthcare workers, with dedicated use of private patient rooms when available. Gloves have been shown to reduce the risk of hand contamination when caring for patients with CDI. Computer-simulated modeling suggests screening asymptomatic children on admission may decrease hospital onset CDI by 28.5%, but incorporating universal screening as part of a multi-intervention bundle could prove logistically prohibitive for some institutions given the high rates of colonization in some pediatric populations coupled with pediatric bed shortages.

As spores remain hardy in the environment surviving months or longer, environmental cleaning with approved sporicidal disinfectants is advised, as staying in a hospital room previously occupied by a patient with CDI increases risk of the current occupant. Ultraviolet disinfection has become a widely used and promising adjunctive measure.

The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious diseases advises that children with CDI be excluded from child care settings until stools are contained within the diaper or the child is continent and stool frequency is no more than 2 stools above normal frequency.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) prevention — cleaning assessment, alerts, surveillance, and education call for process checks and communication: "Assess the adequacy of room cleaning. (Quality of evidence: LOW)" and "Consider environmental decontamination with an EPA-approved sporicidal agent if room cleaning/disinfection is deemed to be adequate but there is ongoing C. difficile transmission". Programs should "Implement a laboratory-based alert system to provide immediate notification to infection preventionists and clinical personnel about newly diagnosed patients with CDI. (Quality of evidence: LOW)" with steps to "Alert patient care areas of positive test results immediately so that these patients can be placed on contact precautions as soon as possible" and, during transfers, to "communicate the CDI/isolation status when transferring the patient to another healthcare facility so appropriate precautions can be implemented at the accepting facility". Data practices state "Conduct CDI surveillance and analyze and report CDI data. (Quality of evidence: LOW)" and "At a minimum, calculate healthcare facility–onset CDI rates at the organizational level and consider specifically calculating CDI rates by unit or ward". Education recommendations are to "Educate HCP, environmental service personnel, and hospital administration about CDI. (Quality of evidence: LOW)" and to "Include risk factors, routes of transmission, local CDI epidemiology, patient outcomes, and treatment and prevention measures".

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^115AzXuX]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile diarrhea — background and prevention concepts relevant to residential care: Clostridioides difficile (commonly referred to as "C. diff" or "C. difficile") is a bacterium that may be found in the intestines of healthy infants and in a smaller percent of otherwise healthy children and adults, and C. difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most frequent infections that occurs in healthcare and commonly leads to inflammation of the large intestines (colitis), along with fever, abdominal pain and/or cramping, and diarrhea with or without blood. CDI occurs most often in hospitalized patients who got antibiotics, chemotherapy, or surgery, but it also can occur in people who do not have risk factors. C. difficile has the ability to survive for extended periods of time on surfaces and on the hands of the people who come into contact with the spores, uninfected individuals can acquire C. difficile by unknowingly swallowing these spores after coming in contact with them, and preventing transmission involves avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use, placing patients with CDI on contact precautions (patient cared for in a private room and healthcare personal wear gowns and gloves), washing ones hands with soap and water after removing gloves used during care, and thoroughly cleaning the rooms of infected patients.

### SHEA / IDSA / APIC practice recommendation: strategies to prevent healthcare-associated infections through hand hygiene: 2022 update [^116HEsv5]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Essential Practices

This section highlights updated recommendations based on evidence that was not available for consideration in the 2014 Compendium. There are 7 essential practices, and 5 of these are previously recommended practices with updated elements. However, 2 practices are new: glove use and prevention of environmental contamination.

The recommendation for promotion of healthy skin and fingernails is reinforced by high-quality evidence and emphasizes the preferential use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) in most clinical situations, which has been shown to be superior to handwashing in preserving healthcare personnel (HCP) hand skin integrity.
The document states that policies regarding the use of fingernail polish and gel shellac is at the discretion of the infection prevention program, except among HCP who scrub for surgical procedures, for whom fingernail polish and gel shellac should be prohibited.
The document recommends that facilities that are seeking ABHS with ingredients that may enhance efficacy against organisms anticipated to be less susceptible to biocides should consider manufacturers' product-specific data.
The recommendation for placement of ABHS dispensers emphasizes unambiguous and visible accessibility within the workflow of HCP.
The document provides minimum thresholds for dispensers to ensure the accessibility of hand hygiene supplies.
The document contains additional recommendations for appropriate glove use: HCP should receive competency-based training to ensure knowledge and skill in avoiding contamination during doffing. Routine double-gloving is not recommended, except when specifically recommended for certain job roles or in response to certain high-consequence pathogens.
The document contains additional recommendations to reduce environmental contamination associated with handwashing sinks and sink drains.
Methods for monitoring adherence to hand hygiene now include direct overt observation, direct covert observation, automated hand hygiene monitoring systems, remote video observation, indirect measures, and audits of accessibility and functionality of supplies. Strengths and weaknesses of each method are discussed in Section 2 and listed in Table 4.

Additional Approaches

The document maintains the recommendation to wash hands with soap and water during outbreaks of C. difficile and norovirus but specifies that ABHS should not be prohibited when caring for patients with C. difficile or norovirus. During outbreaks of pathogens of premise plumbing, facilities may consider using a US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered disinfectant with disinfectant claims against biofilms.

Unresolved Issues

The recommendation regarding routine use of alcohol-impregnated hand wipes by HCP is unresolved due to the lack of noninferiority data.

Regarding preventative measures for Clostridioides difficile infection, more specifically with respect to infection control measures, contact precautions, IDSA/SHEA 2018 guidelines recommend to cohort patients infected or colonized with the same organisms, if cohorting is required. Do not cohort patients with CDI discordant for other multidrug-resistant organisms, such as MRSA or VRE.

Clostridium difficile terminal room disinfection with a sporicidal agent — Terminal room cleaning with a sporicidal agent should be considered in conjunction with other measures to prevent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) during endemic high rates or outbreaks, or if there is evidence of repeated cases of CDI in the same room (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). Environmental contamination gradients show lowest contamination in rooms of culture-negative patients (< 8% of rooms), intermediate with asymptomatic colonization (8%–30% of rooms), and highest in rooms of patients with CDI (9%–50% of rooms), with hand contamination of healthcare personnel at 0%, 8%, and 26% when environmental contamination is 0–25%, 26%–50%, and > 50%, respectively. Although C. difficile spores resist standard disinfectants and persist for months, only 11% of patients who developed CDI had prior exposure to an intensive care unit (ICU) room that housed a CDI patient, a modeling study estimated environmental contamination likely contributes to only 10% of new CDI cases, and sequencing studies found only 2%–7% attributable to environmental contamination. In outbreak settings, terminal disinfection with a sporicidal agent in conjunction with other interventions has been associated with reductions in CDI, but in nonoutbreak settings it has not been associated with consistent reductions; if implemented, compliance with thoroughness of cleaning and surface wiping (as C. difficile spores are physically removed when surfaces are wiped down) are noted and this approach remains most appropriate as a supplemental intervention for outbreaks, hyperendemic settings, and evidence of repeated cases of CDI in the same room.

### Clostridium difficile infection in patients discharged from US short-stay hospitals, 1996–2003 [^1152BJ3y]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Although our findings are consistent with a recent analysis of CDAD rates in NNIS hospitals, our results highlight 2 new and unique developments in the epidemiology of this disease. Archibald et al. described a gradual increasing trend between 1987 and 2001 in ICU rates from hospitals with > 500 beds and in hospitalwide rates from hospitals with < 250 beds. We found a sharp increase in hospitalwide rates during 2001–2003 following steady rates from 1996 to 2000; this increase was similar in medium and large hospitals. In contrast to early results from NNIS during the spread of MRSA, when rates were highest in hospitals with the greatest number of beds, we found that overall rates of CDAD were similar in medium and large hospitals.

Several possible explanations may account for the increasing national rates of CDAD. One includes potentially new and evolving patterns of antimicrobial drug use, for example, use of the fluoroquinolones that have recently been implicated in outbreaks of CDAD. Another potential contributing factor is the promotion of alcohol-based, waterless, hand sanitizers as the primary means of hand hygiene over soap and water. Because alcohol is not sporicidal, alcohol-based, waterless hand sanitizers may not be as effective as soap and water in removing C. difficile; this factor has led to the recommendation that "during outbreaks of CDAD, washing hands with a nonantimicrobial [agent] or antimicrobial soap and water after removing gloves is prudent".

### 2019 update of the WSES guidelines for management of () infection in surgical patients [^114Af2MR]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

In a health-care setting, transmission of C. difficile spores occurs primarily via the contaminated hands of health-care workers, but contact with a contaminated environment, contaminated utensils or medical devices has also been implicated. Hand hygiene with soap and water and the use of contact precautions along with good cleaning and disinfection of the environment and patient equipment should be used by all health-care workers in contact with any patient with known or suspected CDI. Hand hygiene is a cornerstone of prevention of nosocomial infections, including infection due to C. difficile. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are highly effective against non-spore-forming organisms, but they do not kill C. difficile spores or remove C. difficile from the hands.

Though disposable glove use during care of a patient with CDI may be effective in preventing the transmission of C. difficile, these must be removed at the point of use and the hands should then be thoroughly decontaminated with soap and water.

For environmental cleaning, disinfection with sodium hypochlorite solutions are usually recommended in patient areas where C. difficile transmission is ongoing.

In 2016, a cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital to analyze the impact of location of sinks on hand washing compliance after caring for patients with CDI. Healthcare workers' hand washing compliance was low, and a poor access to sinks was associated with decreased hand washing compliance.

Environmental decontamination of clinical areas, ideally using hypochlorite agents or a sporicidal product, is recommended; however, in practice, compliance with cleaning protocols is often suboptimal.

In 2017, a qualitative systematic review including 46 studies investigated the impact of specific interventions on CDI rates in acute-care hospitals. The most effective interventions, resulting in a 45% to 85% reduction in CDI, included daily to twice daily disinfection of high-touch surfaces (including bed rails) and terminal cleaning of patient rooms with chlorine-based products. Chlorhexidine bathing and intensified hand-hygiene practices were not effective for reducing CDI rates.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of Clostridioides difficile infection [^113g9f3A]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Infection control for hospitalized patients with Clostridioides difficile infection: Infection control measures should be implemented for hospitalized patients with CDI. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Outside the colon, C difficile survives in a spore form that is highly resistant to heat, acid, chemicals, and antibiotics; in hospitals it can readily spread from fomites like clothing or equipment, and contamination can also occur by simple contact with intact skin of infected patients. Alcohol hand rubs do not kill spores and therefore should not be used as a single agent for decontamination purposes under these circumstances; rather, combining contact precautions and hand washing with soap and water is recommended to prevent transmission of CDI in hospital and long-term care facilities.

### Measures to control and prevent Clostridium difficile infection [^114Q442x]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Control of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) outbreaks in health care facilities presents significant challenges to infection control specialists and other health care workers. C. difficile spores survive routine environmental cleaning with detergents and hand hygiene with alcohol-based gels. Enhanced cleaning of all potentially contaminated surfaces with 10% sodium hypochlorite reduces the environmental burden of C. difficile, and use of barrier precautions reduces C. difficile transmission. Thorough handwashing with chlorhexidine or with soap and water has been shown to be effective in removing C. difficile spores from hands. Achieving high-level compliance with these measures is a major challenge for infection control programs. Good antimicrobial stewardship complements infection control efforts and environmental interventions to provide a comprehensive strategy to prevent and control outbreaks of CDI. The efficacy of metronidazole or vancomycin prophylaxis to prevent CDI in patients who are receiving other antimicrobials is unproven, and treatment with these agents is ineffective against C. difficile in asymptomatic carriers.

### ASGE guideline for infection control during GI endoscopy [^114JXWa8]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2018). Medium credibility.

Infection control during GI endoscopy — hand hygiene and Clostridioides difficile precautions specify that hands should be washed before and after each patient interaction, soap and water is required when hands are visibly soiled or after encounters with suspected or known infectious diarrhea, alcohol-based agents are acceptable in other cases, prevention of C difficile transmission should be considered for patients with diarrhea or known C difficile infection, handwashing with soap and water should be undertaken for mechanical removal of spores, and glove use during these encounters is required because it has been shown to decrease the incidence of C difficile-associated diarrhea and the point prevalence of asymptomatic C difficile carriage in inpatients.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) environmental control — automated terminal disinfection using a sporicidal method currently has insufficient supportive evidence for use in CDI prevention; the guideline states, 'There are limited data at this time to recommend use of automated, terminal disinfection using a sporicidal method for CDI prevention (no recommendation)'. Evidence notes that 'Automated, terminal disinfection using a sporicidal method has been associated with reductions in viable C. difficile spores from the environment', but 'No single methodology ("no-touch" or otherwise) appears to be superior in regard to reductions in CDI incidence', and 'Data are currently too limited to draw any conclusions as to whether/when these devices should be a component of a CDI prevention program'.

### Environmental interventions to control Clostridium difficile [^115m7D3H]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The control of Clostridium difficile infection is paramount. C difficile spores are difficult to eradicate and can survive on surfaces for prolonged periods of time. Hand washing with either plain or antimicrobial soap is effective in removing C difficile spores from hands. Patients should be placed in private rooms and under contact precautions to prevent transmission to other patients. Regular hospital germicides are not sporicidal and hypochlorite solutions are required for surface disinfection. In outbreak situations, a multifaceted approach is required.

### Clostridium difficile infection: a review of current and emerging therapies [^117WoiEj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

General principles

The inducing antibiotic(s) or other medications that predispose to CDI should be stopped as soon as possible, is a strong recommendation in the treatment of CDI. Supportive care should include careful fluids and electrolyte management. The use of anti-motility agents for CDI treatment is discouraged. Patients should be placed on contact precautions in all suspected CDI. Hand hygiene with soap and water by healthcare providers, hospital visitors and patients is more potent than alcohol-based hand sanitizers in eliminating C. difficile spores, due to the inherent resistance of C. difficile spores to alcohol. One time use of disposable equipment is recommended to prevent transmission of CDI. Sole use of non-disposable medical equipment in a patient with CDI with thorough cleaning after use is recommended. In the event of a high clinical suspicion for CDI, medical therapy is recommended before laboratory confirmation.

### Prevention of infection due to Clostridium difficile [^11445Lpf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) — hand hygiene: In a nonoutbreak setting, there is no consensus on the optimal approach; based on a hospital's assessment of risk, options could include standard hand hygiene using alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) for room entry and exit; soap and water hand hygiene for room exit only, with ABHR for room entry and when needed between tasks for a single patient unless hands are visibly soiled when soap and water should be used; and soap and water performed before patient care and for room exit where there is a C. difficile outbreak or in hyperendemic settings, with facilities considering sink accessibility. Gloves are effective in preventing contamination of the hands with C. difficile but are not a substitute for effective hand hygiene, and it is reasonable to use ABHR before patient contact and within the patient's area when moving from dirty to clean; although alcohol is not sporicidal, handwashing may remove < 1 log10 of C. difficile spores, so hospitals should make recommendations according to their assessment of risk and available infrastructure.

### Strategies to preventinfections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^11161Vp9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

C. difficile infection (CDI) — contact precautions and discontinuation are specified as follows: Use contact precautions for infected patients, single-patient room preferred (Quality of evidence: LOW for hand hygiene; MODERATE for gloves; LOW for gowns; LOW for single-patient room). Perform hand hygiene based on CDC or World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines before and after entering the room, and using soap and water prior to the use of alcohol-based hand rubs is recommended as an additional strategy. Place patients in private rooms when available, don gown and gloves upon entry to the patient's room, and remove gown and gloves prior to exiting the room and then perform hand hygiene. Cohorting of patients with CDI is acceptable when single private rooms are not available, but do not cohort patients who are discordant for other epidemiologically important organisms. Ensure that adequate supplies for contact precautions are readily available. For discontinuation, the CDC currently recommends contact precautions for patients with CDI for at least 48 hours after diarrhea has resolved; contact precautions can potentially be prolonged up to the duration of hospitalization, and this is considered an additional approach, whereas extended contact precautions until discharge of the patient are not recommended.

Preventing exposure to enteric infections in people with HIV highlights that people with HIV with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm³ or a history of AIDS-defining illness are at the greatest risk, and excess risk may persist with lesser immune impairment, including individuals treated with ART. Individuals in the community should be advised to wash their hands regularly with soap and water or alcohol-based cleansers to reduce the risk of enteric infection (AIII), but to prevent enteric infections, soap and water are preferred over alcohol-based cleansers, which do not kill C. difficile spores and are active only partially against norovirus and Cryptosporidium (AIII). People with HIV should be advised to wash their hands with soap and water after potential contact with human feces, after handling pets or other animals, after gardening or other contact with soil, and before preparing food and eating (AIII). In addition to handwashing, use of barriers (e.g., condoms, dental dams, and gloves) can reduce exposure to feces when engaging in sex practices such as anal sex and oral-anal contact (AIII); avoiding sex while any partner has diarrhea may further reduce risk of transmission, and travelers to relevant locations may be counseled on food and water hygiene.

Additional approaches to prevent HAIs through hand hygiene during outbreaks

Consider educating HCP using a structured approach (eg, WHO steps) for handwashing or hand sanitizing. Evaluate HCP adherence to technique. (Quality of evidence: LOW)
For waterborne pathogens in the plumbing of the facility, consider disinfection of sink drains using an EPA-registered disinfectant with claims against biofilms. Consult with state or local public health for assistance in determining appropriate protocols for use and other actions needed to ensure safe supply. (Quality of evidence: LOW)
For C. difficile and norovirus, in addition to contact precautions, encourage hand washing with soap and water after the care of patients with known or suspected infections. (Quality of evidence: LOW)

Approaches that should not be considered part of routine hand hygiene

Do not supply individual pocket-sized ABHS dispensers in lieu of minimum thresholds for accessible wall-mounted dispensers.
Do not refill or "top-off" soap dispensers, moisturizer dispensers, or ABHS dispensers intended for single use.
Do not use antimicrobial soaps formulated with triclosan as an active ingredient.
Do not routinely double-glove except when specifically recommended for certain job roles or in response to certain high-consequence pathogens. Certain scrubbed surgical team members must wear double gloves because of the risk for glove perforations that may contaminate sterility or expose the HCP to infectious materials. Anesthesia personnel may wear double gloves during airway management. Personnel compounding medications according to the US Pharmacopeia 797 may be required to wear double gloves.
Do not routinely disinfect gloves during care except when specifically recommended in response to certain high-consequence pathogens.
Do not remove access to ABHS for HCP responding to organisms that are anticipated to be less susceptible to biocides (eg, C. difficile, norovirus).
Do not attempt to remediate potential biofilms in sink drains with disinfectants lacking EPA registration for this use.

Unresolved issues

HCP use of alcohol-impregnated hand wipes is unresolved due to the lack of noninferiority data.

### Prevention of endemic healthcare-associated Clostridium difficile infection: reviewing the evidence [^111pnJh6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Clostridium difficile is the most common infectious cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea. Because of the increasing incidence and severity of endemic C. difficile infection (CDI), interventions to prevent healthcare-associated CDI are essential. We undertook a systematic review of interventions to reduce healthcare-associated CDI.

Methods

We searched multiple computerized databases, and manually searched for relevant articles to determine which interventions are useful in preventing CDI. Studies were required to be controlled in design and to report the incidence of endemic CDI as an outcome. Data on the patient population, intervention, study design, and outcomes were abstracted and reviewed using established criteria.

Results

Few randomized controlled trials exist in the area of CDI prevention. The interventions with the greatest evidence for the prevention of CDI include antimicrobial stewardship, glove use, and disposable thermometers. Environmental decontamination also may decrease CDI rates, although the level of evidence is not as strong as for the other proven interventions. Treatment of asymptomatic carriage of C. difficile is not recommended. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of probiotics. In cases of known or suspected CDI, hand hygiene with soap and water is preferred over use of waterless alcohol hand rub. Many nonrandomized trials included in our analysis used multiple interventions concurrently, making the independent role of each preventive strategy difficult to determine. We chose to include only studies that focused on endemic CDI because studies of outbreaks have used multiple strategies, making it difficult to measure the relative efficacy of each strategy. Environmental disinfection and probiotics need to be studied further to evaluate their roles in the prevention of CDI. Although there have been no studies assessing the utility of isolation and cohorting for the prevention of endemic CDI specifically, it is a widely used intervention for containment of this and other similar multidrug-resistant pathogens.

Conclusions

Antimicrobial stewardship, glove use, hand hygiene, and disposable thermometers should be routinely used for the prevention of CDI. Environmental disinfection and probiotics should be studied further for their role in reducing CDI.

### Efficacy of the World Health Organization-recommended handwashing technique and a modified washing technique to remove Clostridium difficile from hands [^114PY5gD]. American Journal of Infection Control (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended handwashing technique against Clostridium difficile is uncertain, and whether it could be improved remains unknown. Also, the benefit of using a structured technique instead of an unstructured technique remains unclear.

Methods

This study was a prospective comparison of 3 techniques (unstructured, WHO, and a novel technique dubbed WHO shortened repeated [WHO-SR] technique) to remove C difficile. Ten participants were enrolled and performed each technique. Hands were contaminated with 3×10⁶ colony forming units (CFU) of a nontoxigenic strain containing 90% spores. Efficacy was assessed using the whole-hand method. The relative efficacy of each technique and of a structured (either WHO or WHO-SR) vs an unstructured technique were assessed by Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

Results

The median effectiveness of the unstructured, WHO, and WHO-SR techniques in log 10 CFU reduction was 1.30 (interquartile range [IQR], 1.27–1.43), 1.71 (IQR, 1.34–1.91), and 1.70 (IQR, 1.54–2.42), respectively. The WHO-SR technique was significantly more efficacious than the unstructured technique (P = 0.01). Washing hands with a structured technique was more effective than washing with an unstructured technique (median, 1.70 vs 1.30 log 10 CFU reduction, respectively; p = 0.007).

Conclusions

A structured washing technique is more effective than an unstructured technique against C difficile.

### Infection control measures to limit the spread of Clostridium difficile [^1172vTra]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) presents mainly as a nosocomial infection, usually after antimicrobial therapy. Many outbreaks have been attributed to C. difficile, some due to a new hyper-virulent strain that may cause more severe disease and a worse patient outcome. As a result of CDAD, large numbers of C. difficile spores may be excreted by affected patients. Spores then survive for months in the environment; they cannot be destroyed by standard alcohol-based hand disinfection, and persist despite usual environmental cleaning agents. All these factors increase the risk of C. difficile transmission. Once CDAD is diagnosed in a patient, immediate implementation of appropriate infection control measures is mandatory in order to prevent further spread within the hospital. The quality and quantity of antibiotic prescribing should be reviewed to minimise the selective pressure for CDAD. This article provides a review of the literature that can be used for evidence-based guidelines to limit the spread of C. difficile. These include early diagnosis of CDAD, surveillance of CDAD cases, education of staff, appropriate use of isolation precautions, hand hygiene, protective clothing, environmental cleaning and cleaning of medical equipment, good antibiotic stewardship, and specific measures during outbreaks. Existing local protocols and practices for the control of C. difficile should be carefully reviewed and modified if necessary.

Daily sporicidal environmental cleaning in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) settings — daily cleaning with a sporicidal agent should be considered in conjunction with other measures to prevent CDI during outbreaks or in hyperendemic (sustained high rates) settings, or if there is evidence of repeated cases of CDI in the same room (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

The antimicrobial treatment used on the ST can effectively kill all bacteria, fungi, and protozoa; however, it only kills viruses that are encapsulated. It is likely that the microfiber material used in the ST will remove diarrhea-causing nonencapsulated viruses (such as norovirus and rotavirus) and bacterial spores (such as those produced by different strains of Clostridium) from hands and transfer them to the ST without killing them (although this would need to be substantiated through further laboratory testing). This inability to kill nonencapsulated viruses is not unique to the ST. For example, norovirus, rotavirus, and Clostridium difficile have been found to be resistant to typical infection control measures (such as alcohol-based sanitizers) and persist in the environment and on hands and surfaces for a long time. –

The future uptake of the ST will rely on its acceptability among crisis-affected populations. To encourage a population who are used to handwashing with soap to use a ST will require a substantial behavioral shift. It is envisaged that the form and branding of the product may have to be improved to facilitate the product's intuitive use. This is something that will require field-based testing and input from crisis-affected communities. A field study with STs in a refugee camp in the Tigray region of Ethiopia is already scheduled as a next step in this project and will be the subject of a further scientific study.

Intensify the assessment of compliance with process measures. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Contact precautions: gowns and gloves should be worn by all HCP who enter the rooms of patients on contact precautions. Hand hygiene: hand hygiene should be performed at least on entry and exit from patient rooms. When hand washing is performed, determine whether proper technique is being used. If hand hygiene compliance or technique are not adequate, conduct interventions to improve hand hygiene compliance and technique. Assess opportunities for improved antibiotic and/or diagnostic test utilization with improved compliance with and/or using additional antibiotic or diagnostic stewardship approaches (see Section 4: Essential practices, parts 1 and 2).
As the preferred method, perform hand hygiene with soap and water following care of or interacting with the healthcare environment of a patient with CDI. (Quality of evidence: LOW) When considering a CDI-specific hand hygiene measure, the priority should be to ensure adherence to donning gloves and proper technique when doffing to minimize the risk for self-contamination. Ideally, after removing gloves, hand hygiene is performed before exiting the patient room when feasible. Ensure proper hand hygiene technique when using soap and water. Be aware that hand hygiene adherence may decrease when soap and water is the preferred method. Gloves are effective at preventing C. difficile contamination of hands. Hand washing may remove < 1-log 10 of spores, even with a 60-second hand wash. Alcohol-based hand rub is superior to hand washing for non–spore-forming organisms (eg, MRSA). Using alcohol-based hand rub following soap and water may enhance hand hygiene effectiveness. Reductions in CDI have not been observed with hand washing only using soap and water. -
Place patients with diarrhea on contact precautions while C. difficile testing is pending. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Patients with new-onset diarrhea that is unexplained should be placed on contact precautions when diarrhea is recognized. Employ measures, particularly the use of gowns and gloves and disinfection of shared medical equipment (see Section 4: Essential practices, part 3). Contact precautions should be initiated as soon as diarrhea symptoms are recognized because this is the period of greatest C. difficile shedding and contamination. Availability of private rooms or ability to cohort patients in nonprivate rooms before a CDI diagnosis is made may be a challenge for some hospitals. Because only a small minority of individuals with diarrhea in a hospital will have C. difficile, initiation of full contact precautions in a private or cohort room prior to test results may lead to unnecessary cohort restrictions or patient transfers to private rooms. The decision to place a patient on contact precautions in a private or cohort room while testing is pending can be based on several factors, including likelihood that the patient will transmit C. difficile, turnaround time of CDI test results, and impact of contact precautions on hospital bed management. The pretest probability of CDI is increased by certain clinical factors, such as recent history of CDI, high-risk antibiotics (see Section 4: Essential practices, part 1), and/or signs or symptoms of fulminant CDI, such as toxic megacolon. Other factors such as high-volume stool output, stool incontinence, and/or presence of an ostomy may increase the likelihood of CDI transmission. These factors can be considered when deciding on pre-emptive contact precautions while C. difficile testing is pending. Movement to a private or cohorted room while awaiting test results is recommended at centers where C. difficile test turnaround time is > 12–24 hours. If C. difficile testing is negative, and another infectious etiology that requires contact precautions is not suspected, contact precautions can be discontinued based on test type and clinical suspicion for CDI. Because of its high negative predictive value, patients with a negative NAAT can be removed from contact precautions. Some hospitals diagnose CDI using only toxin EIAs, for which concerns persist regarding suboptimal sensitivity compared with NAATs. When only toxin EIAs are used, clinical suspicion for CDI should outweigh a negative test result. If there is high pretest probability of CDI, the patient should remain on contact precautions.
Prolong the duration of contact precautions after the patient becomes asymptomatic until hospital discharge. (Quality of evidence: LOW) For patients with CDI, CDC currently recommendscontact precautions for at least 48 hours after diarrhea resolves. However, some hospitals may choose to extend contact precautions for the duration of hospitalization even if symptoms have resolved. This is the recommendation for patients who have diarrhea and are positive by NAAT, irrespective of EIA result (ie, even if patient is C. difficile positive but is suspected to be colonized and to have an alternate cause of diarrhea). Facilities must balance potential reduction in C. difficile transmission with individual patient risk of isolation related to contact precautions, which may include falls and socioemotional stress that can lead to symptoms such as behavior changes, anxiety, depression, and anger.
Use an EPA-approved sporicidal disinfectant, such as diluted (1:10) sodium hypochlorite, for environmental cleaning and disinfection. Implement a system to coordinate with environmental services if it is determined that sodium hypochlorite is needed for environmental disinfection. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Sporicidal disinfectants registered with the EPA, including sodium hypochlorite, can be found in EPA List K. Data have not been consistent regarding the ability of sporicidal disinfectants, including diluted sodium hypochlorite, to control CDI through environmental decontamination. However, a beneficial effect has been reported when bleach has been used in outbreak or hyperendemic settings, typically in conjunction with other enhanced CDI control measures. - When an EPA-approved sporicidal disinfectant is instituted for environmental decontamination, it is necessary to coordinate activities with environmental services. Clinical staff, infection prevention and control staff, and environmental service staff need to determine the location, type, and frequency of sporicidal disinfectant use. Room type: Use for all patient rooms, only rooms of patients with CDI, and/or outside of patient rooms and in common spaces. Cleaning timing and frequency: Use for daily cleaning and/or terminal cleaning only when the patient is discharged or transferred. Daily disinfection of touchable surfaces in rooms of patients with CDI and MRSA has been shown to reduce acquisition of the pathogens on investigators' hands after contact with surfaces and to decrease contamination of the hands of the HCP caring for the patients. When diluted (1:10) sodium hypochlorite is used, it is important to address the following issues: Avoid toxicity to patients and staff and damage to equipment and the environment from bleach use. Sodium hypochlorite can be corrosive and irritating to patients, environmental service personnel, and other HCP. Prior to application of diluted sodium hypochlorite, surfaces need to be cleaned to remove organic matter. Either use a freshly prepared diluted sodium hypochlorite solution or store appropriately. When a sporicidal method will be used only in rooms of patients with CDI, a system will need to be created to identify these patients to environmental service staff. Touchless disinfection technologies remains an unresolved issue (see Section 4: Unresolved issues, part 2).

### Prevalence and trends ofinfection among persons requiring maintenance hemodialysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116FoUss]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The Nephrologists Transforming Dialysis Safety work group, an initiative funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in collaboration with the American Society of Nephrology, recently published recommendations for the prevention of C. difficile spread in outpatient dialysis facilities. The strategies outlined parallel those for multidrug-resistant organisms; the transmission dynamics of C. difficile are very similar. One major difference, however, is that C. difficile produces spores that survive on inanimate surfaces for many months. These spores are resistant to a variety of routinely used environmental disinfectants and require specific C. difficile sporicidal agents registered by the Environmental Protective Agency. Hand hygiene measures also differ. Soap and water substantially reduces C. difficile spores, in contrast to alcohol-based sanitizers. Thus, soap and water is the preferred hand hygiene measure to prevent C. difficile spread in outpatient dialysis units. However, given the greater compliance with alcohol-based sanitizers, this hand hygiene measure is an alternative, except when there is visible hand soiling, during CDI outbreaks, or when there is concern for spread of CDI within the dialysis facility.

Compliance with the Nephrologists Transforming Dialysis Safety strategies aimed at preventing the spread of C. difficile should be monitored in outpatient dialysis facilities to prevent de novo acquisition and C. difficile outbreaks. Several outbreaks in outpatient dialysis facilities have been reported; they have affected a substantial number of patients within the dialysis unit in addition to dialysis healthcare workers. Implementation of C. difficile –specific infection prevention strategies has led to the end of CDI outbreaks.

Many of the risk factors for CDI are modifiable, especially antimicrobial exposure. Up to 30% of antimicrobial doses administered in the outpatient dialysis facility are not indicated according to national guidelines. Implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs in dialysis facilities has been shown to significantly reduce antimicrobial prescribing. These programs have yielded substantial decreases in infections and mortality caused by C. difficile and multidrug-resistant organisms without negative outcomes such as increased hospitalizations or bloodstream infections.

This is supported by a retrospective cohort of 2859 patients by Chang et al. Patients who were roommates or neighbors of a patient with CDI were at risk of nosocomial acquisition of CDI (RR, 3.94; 95% CI, 1.27–12.24).

36) Hand hygiene with soap and water is a cornerstone of the prevention of C. difficile. Hand hygiene, contact precautions and good cleaning and disinfection of the environment and patient care equipment, should be used by all health-care workers contacting any patient with known or suspected CDI (Recommendation 1 B).

Hand hygiene with soap and water and the use of contact precautions along with good cleaning and disinfection of the environment and patient equipment, should be used by all health-care workers contacting any patient with known or suspected CDI. Hand hygiene is a cornerstone of prevention of nosocomial infections, including C. difficile. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are highly effective against non–spore-forming organisms, but they may not kill C. difficile spores or remove C. difficile from the hands.

The most effective way to remove them from hands is through hand washing with soap and water.

For environmental cleaning, hypochlorite disinfection such as sodium hypochlorite solutions are suggested for regular use in patient areas where C. difficile transmission is ongoing.

Though disposable glove use during care of a patient with CDI may be effective in preventing the transmission of C. difficile, these must be removed at the point of use and hands thoroughly decontaminated afterwards through soap and water hand washing.

Regarding preventative measures for Clostridioides difficile infection, more specifically with respect to infection control measures, hand hygiene, IDSA/SHEA 2018 guidelines recommend to practice hand hygiene before and after contact with a patient with CDI and after removing gloves with either soap and water or an alcohol-based hand hygiene product, both in routine and endemic settings.

### Guiding Clostridioides difficile infection prevention efforts in a hospital setting with AI [^115zNoX2]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified Clostridioides difficile as an urgent antibiotic resistance threat in the US. Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), one of the most common health care–associated infections, is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and increased hospital costs. Susceptible patients develop CDI when exposed to the pathogen, either from health care personnel who have touched contaminated surfaces, or from the community before admission. Given that Clostridioides difficile forms spores and is resistant to alcohol-based hand sanitizers, effective CDI prevention often includes soap-and-water handwashing. Moreover, receipt of certain antimicrobials, including clindamycin, ampicillin, and carbapenems, is associated with increased susceptibility. Thus, antimicrobial stewardship is also key to preventing CDI.,

However, applying these practices at scale is challenging because the number needed to treat to prevent 1 CDI case can be unfavorably high given resource constraints at most hospitals. Targeting prevention efforts on patients most likely to acquire CDI could prove more effective. To this end, numerous artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed to predict CDI risk in hospitalized patients with the goal of identifying high-risk patients who may potentially benefit from targeted infection prevention resources. Although these models have shown promise in prospective validation, and in identifying patients prior to colonization, their association with patient outcomes in clinical care remains unknown.

In this article, we report the results of a 28-month quality improvement program in which we used an institution-specific AI model to guide CDI prevention efforts at a large academic medical center. Using data from electronic health records (EHRs), we compared patient outcomes before and after AI implementation, including CDI rates and antimicrobial stewardship performance measures.

Pathophysiology of CDI and overview of treatments

In order to best understand the antimicrobial approach to treatment of CDI, it is important to review the basic pathophysiology of this infection. C. difficile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic rod. As such, there are two main phases: the spore phase and the vegetative phase. The vegetative phase, which is susceptible to gastric acid and alcohol-based hand sanitizers, releases two main toxins that stimulate the diarrheal syndrome most commonly associated with CDI: toxin A and toxin B. – Since this bacterium is anaerobic, its vegetative phase is unable to survive outside of the host. This is the phase of infection that antimicrobials target. The spore phase, alternatively, is much heartier in that it is resistant to gastric acid and alcohol-based hand sanitizers. It can remain viable for many months on dry surfaces. – The spore phase can germinate and in effect convert itself to the vegetative phase when in an optimal environment for this process. This restarts the active infection either in a new host as part of a de novo infection or in the same host in the form of a recurrence.

There are several treatment options for CDI. These include therapies that target the vegetative phase, including the antimicrobials metronidazole, vancomycin, and fidaxomicin. Other supplementary treatments boost the immune system. Bezlotoxumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that is specific to toxin B. This treatment enhances the blood-borne immune system targeting and blocking toxin B, minimizing some of the inflammatory effects of this toxin.

Microbiota replacement therapy (MRT) enhances colonization resistance. MRT will be discussed in more detail in other sections of the special issue but will be alluded to within this manuscript simply to reference to how guidelines chose to include this treatment as part of their algorithm.

Treatment of CDI requires two things: eradication of the vegetative phase with antimicrobials and subsequent elimination of the spore phase via the patient's microbiota. Therefore, if the microbiota is not able to eradicate the spore phase, it is likely to convert to the vegetative phase, resulting in a recurrence. Recurrence is a major challenge as it is estimated that approximately 25% of patients treated initially for this infection will recur and, of those, approximately 40% will go on to recur after that, with 50–60% thereafter. – Breaking this cycle of recurrence is of the utmost importance in effectively treating this infection. Given this, guidelines frequently focus on reduction of recurrence.

Summary of existing guidelines and recommendations

Limitations of existing guidance. Published guidelines on the management of CDI have expanded in recent years, but only some address CDI prevention. Most published studies of CDI prevention are single-center studies with a quasi-experimental (ie, before-and-after or pre- and postintervention) or other observational nonexperimental study design, often performed in response to outbreaks or elevated CDI rates. Often, several concomitant interventions are performed, making it difficult to determine the relative importance of one intervention compared to another. Before-and-after studies are also limited by time-related biases that are difficult to adjust for in the absence of a control group or properly conducted analyses such as interrupted time-series analysis. However, several studies have utilized these techniques, in some cases leading to meta-analyses.
Unique microbiologic characteristics of C. difficile. C. difficile shares many common epidemiologic characteristics with other antimicrobial-resistant gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Both the skin and the environment of colonized patients become contaminated, and HCP hands may become contaminated by touching the environment or the patient. - The major difference among these 3 organisms is that only C. difficile forms spores. The formation of spores poses unique challenges for hand hygiene and environmental disinfection practices because C. difficile spores are resistant to the bactericidal effects of alcohol and commonly used hospital disinfectants (eg, phenolics and quaternary ammonium compounds).
Strategies focused on unique microbiologic characteristics inconsistently result in CDI prevention. Although alcohol-based hand rub is ineffective at removing or disinfecting C. difficile spores in controlled laboratory experiments, no clinical study has demonstrated an increase in CDI with the use of these products or a decrease in CDI with soap and water. - Conversely, several of the studies did identify decreases in MRSA -, or VREassociated with the use of alcohol-based hand rub. Similarly, use of sporicidal methods to disinfect the environment outside outbreak settings has not consistently demonstrated a reduction in CDI with these methods. - These data indicate that although the environment can be an important source of C. difficile, indirect transmission by HCP may be the predominant route by which patients acquire C. difficile.
Strategies to prevent CDI (discussed in Section 4) in acute-care settings are generally categorized as follows: Approaches to minimize C. difficile exposure and colonization through transmission by HCP (eg, hand hygiene and contact precautions) Approaches to minimize C. difficile exposure and colonization through transmission from the environment (eg, cleaning and disinfection of environment and shared medical devices) Approaches to reduce the risk of C. difficile colonization and CDI if the organism is encountered by the patient (eg, antimicrobial stewardship).

### Experimental glycopeptide antibiotic EVG7 prevents recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection by sparing members of the lachnospiraceae family [^115YT7yM]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile is a Gram-positive anaerobic pathogen that is the leading cause of healthcare- and antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the United States and Europe –. Clinical symptoms of C. difficile infection (CDI) range from mild diarrhea to life-threatening colitis and death. Each year an estimated 0.5 million patients are affected by CDI in the U.S. of which 30,000 infections are lethal. CDI also contributes to a significant demand on healthcare resources with associated costs between $71,980 (no recurrence) and $207,733 (≥ 3 recurrences) per patient, amounting to an annual economic burden of around $5.4 billion. Aside from recent antibiotic exposure, patient-specific risk factors for severe CDI are hospitalization and advanced age. Infection with C. difficile typically happens by transmission of heat-, acid-, oxygen- and antibiotic-resistant spores. These spores are not killed by routine cleaning with alcohol-based sanitizers and can survive on surfaces for several months, which is of particular concern in hospitals and care facilities where such spores are ubiquitously present. Intestinal colonization can be asymptomatic, but active CDI will develop when the dormant spores germinate into anaerobic, toxin-producing vegetative cells in the presence of host-derived bile salt germinants and amino acids. Antibiotics remain a major risk factor for CDI as they disrupt the composition and function of the gut microbiome, thus generating a favorable environment for C. difficile germination, outgrowth, and toxin production.

Infection control is the most essential component of an effective overall management strategy for prevention of nosocomial Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The cornerstones of CDI prevention are appropriate contact precautions and strict hand hygiene. Other important tactics are effective environmental cleaning, identification and removal of environmental sources of C. difficile, and antibiotic stewardship. Hospitalists, as coordinators of care for each patient and advocates for quality care, can spearhead these efforts.

Clostridioides difficile in the NICU — environmental cleaning and incubators: In endemic settings, standard daily cleaning is appropriate, and bleach or another product with an Environmental Protection Agency–approved claim for C. difficile sporicidal activity should be considered for disinfecting the environment during CDI outbreaks or in hyperendemic settings. For patients whose CDI has resolved but whose continued hospitalization is required, consider moving the patient to a new room once diarrhea has resolved, and incubators may be thought of similarly to the patient's room, with standard cleaning and processing before it is used for the next patient in endemic settings and consideration of moving the patient to a clean incubator when diarrhea has resolved.

### The role of the gut microbiome in colonization resistance and recurrentinfection [^115BEnqH]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection

C. difficile is an anaerobic, Gram-positive bacterium that exists in both vegetative and spore forms. Spores are ubiquitous in the environment and are the infectious form of C. difficile. Spores are highly resistant to some antibiotics and environmental factors including oxygen, disinfectants (including ethanol-based hand sanitizers), high temperature, and ultraviolet light. They can contaminate the environment around patients and can persist for years. Once ingested by the host, under the right conditions, normally dormant spores can germinate in the gut into replicating, metabolically active vegetative cells. – If the strain of C. difficile contains genes for toxin production (i.e. is toxigenic), vegetative cells will produce toxins in the colon that ultimately lead to disease, defined by symptoms ranging from diarrhea and gastrointestinal distress, to more severe forms including toxic megacolon, pseudomembranous colitis, and even death. The toxins responsible for disease include Toxin A (TcdA) and Toxin B (TcdB), with some strains producing a binary toxin (or C. difficile transferase) which enhances its virulence (Figure 3). The internalization of TcdA by intestinal epithelial cells triggers cytoskeletal changes that lead to the disruption of tight junctions and loosening of the epithelial barrier, cell death, and/or the production of inflammatory factors that attract neutrophils. The disruption of the tight junctions allows for the translocation of TcdA and TcdB across the epithelium, where they can further induce inflammatory cytokine production in phagocytes and mast cells. This leads to escalation of the inflammatory response due to neutrophil and lymphocyte influx, which results in further damage to the intestinal lining and the potential formation of a pseudomembrane.

### Hand sanitizer facts | Clean hands… [^1161Rdvj]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know CDC recommends washing hands with soap and water whenever possible because handwashing reduces the amounts of all types of germs and chemicals on hands. If soap and water are not available, using a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol can help you avoid getting sick and spreading germs to others. The recommendations for effective hand sanitizer use in community settings was developed based on data from a number of studies. The basics Sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can quickly reduce the number of microbes on hands in some situations, but sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs. Why. Soap and water are more effective than hand sanitizers at removing certain kinds of germs, like Cryptosporidium, norovirus, and Clostridium difficile.

Although alcohol-based hand sanitizers can inactivate many types of microbes very effectively when used correctly, people may not use a large enough volume of the sanitizers or may wipe it off before it has dried. Keep Reading: Hand Sanitizer Guidelines and Recommendations Use a sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol Many studies have found that sanitizers with an alcohol concentration between 60–95% are more effective at killing germs than those with a lower alcohol concentration or non-alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Hand sanitizers without 60–95% alcohol 1) may not work equally well for many types of germs; and 2) merely reduce the growth of germs rather than kill them outright. Swallowing alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause alcohol poisoning Ethyl alcohol -based hand sanitizers are safe when used as directed, but they can cause alcohol poisoning if a person swallows more than a couple of mouthfuls.

Hand sanitizers might not remove harmful chemicals like pesticides and heavy metals Although few studies have been conducted, hand sanitizers probably cannot remove or inactivate many types of harmful chemicals from hands. In one study, people who reported using hand sanitizer to clean hands had increased levels of pesticides in their bodies. If hands have touched harmful chemicals, wash carefully with soap and water.

Clostridium difficile diagnostics, pre–anti-TNFα screening, and infection control — when nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is used, "1 diarrheal stool specimen with a negative PCR result excludes C difficile–associated diarrhea infection with a sensitivity of 93% to 100% and a specificity of 100%". "Optimally, a combination of a sensitive test (NAAT) with a specific test (cell cytotoxin immunoassay) may provide more accurate information", and "A NAAT should not be performed for the test of cure" because positivity can persist after resolution. For biologic initiation, "No data to support routine laboratory screening". For prevention, "Standard plus contact precautions with bleach cleaning of surfaces must be followed", and because alcohol-based products "do not inactivate C difficile spores", "the use of soap and water for hand hygiene is recommended by most experts", although "there are no data that demonstrate a reduction in transmission" versus waterless alcohol-based products.
