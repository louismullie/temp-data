## Question

causes of headache and blurry vision

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what can cause headache and blurry vision. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and red flags that signal neurological or ophthalmological emergencies. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential diagnosis organized by mechanism. Next, I will outline the bedside exam and targeted testing strategy. Finally, I need to integrate medication review, imaging pathways, and initial management contingencies with citations to back each step up.

> Let me first confirm the emergency triage anchors: temporal profile and red flags drive early decisions because thunderclap onset with "worst headache" or meningismus pushes me toward subarachnoid hemorrhage until proven otherwise, and any papilledema means I must image before lumbar puncture to avoid herniation risk [^116t31zc] [^115f3rxm]. I need to check for seizures, altered mental status, or visual loss with severe hypertension to consider posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, as timely blood pressure control can reverse visual deficits, so I shouldn't delay escalation if suspected [^114WR6B7]. But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or postpartum? Then eclampsia/preeclampsia is on the table, and magnesium plus blood pressure control become urgent considerations [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — ocular pain with halos, a mid-dilated fixed pupil, and very high intraocular pressure point away from primary migraine and toward acute angle-closure glaucoma, which is an ophthalmic emergency that needs immediate IOP-lowering therapy and urgent ophthalmology consultation, so I should screen for that at the bedside with tonometry if available [^116cDzjq]. I need to ensure that papilledema, if present, triggers urgent neuroimaging before considering LP, given the risk profile and the frequency with which IIH and mass lesions can masquerade early [^115f3rxm] [^113BDzZK].

> Next, I will organize the differential by pathophysiology, starting with vascular and neurovascular emergencies: subarachnoid hemorrhage with thunderclap headache and photophobia or diplopia; PRES with headache, seizures, and acute visual loss in the setting of hypertension or cytotoxic therapy; idiopathic intracranial hypertension with headache, transient visual obscurations, and papilledema; and transient monocular vision loss from retinal ischemia that carries a high short-term stroke risk and mandates rapid stroke-prevention workflow even when the eye exam is normal [^116t31zc] [^114WR6B7] [^113BDzZK] [^1172LqAT].

> Let me consider the primary headache disorders carefully. Migraine with aura produces evolving positive visual phenomena over 5–60 minutes and is tightly linked to cortical spreading depression and trigeminovascular activation, whereas persistent negative visual loss or a static defect should push me to look for secondary causes instead of labeling it as aura too quickly [^1142x3cz] [^112w56ZH]. Migraine without aura can still present with photophobia and blurred vision during the pain phase, and there is growing evidence linking migraine to ocular surface changes and corneal nerve alterations that might contribute to blur and discomfort, so I should double-check for coexisting dry eye symptoms during attacks [^112w56ZH] [^11436Swc] [^116LZZWo].

> Hmm, wait a minute — so-called ophthalmoplegic "migraine" really behaves like a recurrent cranial neuropathy of the oculomotor pathways more than a classic migraine variant, often with nerve enhancement on MRI and potential steroid responsiveness; I should confirm cranial nerve function and consider contrast MRI if diplopia accompanies the headache to avoid misclassification [^112Fn8d1].

> I will now examine ocular and optic nerve pathologies that commonly produce headache plus blurred vision: optic neuritis causes pain with eye movement, color desaturation, RAPD, and central scotoma and needs orbital MRI; acute angle-closure glaucoma, as noted, is painful with halos and mid-dilated pupil and needs immediate pressure-lowering therapy; uveitis and Behçet's disease can cause blurred vision with inflammatory signs and, in Behçet's, even venous sinus thrombosis with papilledema, so I should check for oral/genital ulcers and neuro-Behçet features when the history fits [^113zADiS] [^111LXJq3] [^116cDzjq] [^115wevAu].

> I should confirm systemic and inflammatory contributors. Eclampsia/preeclampsia presents with headache, blurred vision, scotomata, and hypertension with proteinuria; rapid maternal stabilization and delivery planning are the core treatments, so pregnancy status and urine protein are mandatory checks when clinically relevant [^notfound]. Infectious and thrombotic entities like meningitis, COVID-19–related ocular surface or neuro-ophthalmic complications, and cerebral venous thrombosis remain on the list when fever, hypercoagulability, or focal deficits are present, which means I need to review exposure risks and prothrombotic factors carefully [^113zADiS] [^112tsLw9] [^111YFxQe].

> Let me review medication-induced causes because missing these delays definitive care. Pregabalin commonly causes blurred vision that often resolves with continued dosing; lamotrigine and carbamazepine frequently cause blurred vision and diplopia; amantadine can cause bilateral corneal edema with persistent blur, sometimes requiring corneal grafts; and topiramate can precipitate bilateral acute angle-closure glaucoma that presents like a "worse-than-usual migraine", so a meticulous drug history with timing relative to symptom onset is essential [^114yhzjJ] [^116cQYmj] [^116n58ds] [^116wUhpX] [^111osk2n] [^112ybsrj] [^1125UZja] [^116A9LPH] [^116cDzjq]. I should also double-check oncology and targeted agents such as trametinib and anti-GD2 antibodies that list visual adverse events and mandate dose interruption if eye disorders occur, because these iatrogenic signals can be subtle early on [^117KrG8U] [^116zvYCv].

> But wait, what if there is a compressive or neoplastic process? Pituitary apoplexy can cause acute headache with visual field loss, and posterior fossa or occipital lesions may mimic aura or produce field defects, so progressive or atypical courses obligate MRI with attention to chiasmal and posterior pathways; rare entities like medulla oblongata germinoma or dural-sinus hemangiopericytoma can present with headache and blurred vision as well, reminding me to escalate imaging when red flags or exam-localizing signs appear [^113zADiS] [^116dE2jC] [^113J6ntw].

> I need to ensure I cover trauma and post-procedural contexts. Concussion frequently causes blurred vision, photophobia, dizziness, and headache, and requires careful neurologic monitoring, while post-dural puncture headache is orthostatic and can include diplopia and visual disturbances; if severe, an epidural blood patch is indicated after conservative measures, so the temporal link to LP or epidural must be elicited [^113tzw2x] [^116WiMG4].

> Next, I should review the bedside evaluation in phases. Vitals first for hypertensive emergency or fever; then a focused neurologic exam for focal deficits, meningeal signs, or seizures; then a targeted ophthalmic exam including visual acuity, pupils for RAPD, confrontational fields, extraocular movements, slit lamp when feasible, funduscopy for papilledema or disc edema, and tonometry if glaucoma is suspected, because these data rapidly separate optic neuropathy, raised ICP, and intraocular emergencies at the point of care [^115f3rxm] [^113zADiS] [^116cDzjq]. Let me first confirm that any papilledema or focal deficit mandates neuroimaging before LP to avoid precipitating herniation, and if optic nerve sheath ultrasound is available, it can support raised ICP in IIH, although it does not replace the need for formal imaging and LP for diagnosis and management [^115f3rxm] [^113BDzZK] [^112BgbbZ].

> For laboratories, I should double-check ESR and CRP in any patient over 50 with new headache or TMVL to screen for giant cell arteritis, and add platelets given their supportive diagnostic value; in pregnancy, urine protein and liver enzymes guide the eclampsia spectrum; and when infection is plausible, targeted infectious studies can be layered in, guided by the clinical picture and imaging [^1172LqAT] [^114GCpce] [^113zADiS]. I need to review medications comprehensively against known ocular and neuro-ophthalmic adverse effects to avoid unnecessary imaging when a clear drug etiology exists, but I should not anchor on this if emergency features are present [^114yhzjJ] [^116cQYmj] [^116wUhpX] [^116A9LPH].

> For imaging, I should confirm the algorithm: with red flags, obtain a STAT non-contrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage or mass effect; if CT is negative but SAH suspicion remains high, proceed to LP for xanthochromia; if PRES is suspected, MRI is the modality of choice for posterior white matter edema; and with papilledema or suspected IIH, brain MRI/MRV precedes LP to exclude a mass or venous sinus thrombosis and to measure opening pressure [^115f3rxm] [^116t31zc] [^114WR6B7] [^113BDzZK].

> Finally, initial management must match the diagnosis. I need to ensure IOP-lowering therapy and urgent ophthalmology for acute angle-closure glaucoma; aggressive blood pressure control and ICU-level care for PRES; stroke-prevention pathways for retinal ischemia/TMVL even with a normal ocular exam; magnesium and blood pressure control with obstetric involvement for eclampsia; and expedited neurosurgical and endovascular consultation for SAH, with imaging-led decisions about LP and aneurysm management, because delays in these conditions threaten vision and life [^116cDzjq] [^114WR6B7] [^1172LqAT] [^114GCpce] [^116t31zc]. Let me reconsider one potential pitfall: labeling atypical visual symptoms as migraine aura without confirming evolution and positivity risks missing structural or vascular causes; I should double-check that the aura is dynamic and time-limited before assigning a primary headache diagnosis, and escalate promptly if the story deviates from ICHD-3 patterns [^112w56ZH] [^1142x3cz].

Headache with blurry vision can signal serious disease [^115f3rxm]. The most common causes are **migraine with aura** and **idiopathic intracranial hypertension**. Other causes include **acute angle-closure glaucoma** [^113zADiS], **giant cell arteritis** [^1172LqAT], **optic neuritis** [^111LXJq3], **posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome** [^114WR6B7], and **subarachnoid hemorrhage** [^116t31zc]. Red flags include sudden severe headache, vision loss, focal deficits, or papilledema [^115f3rxm]; urgent evaluation is required.

---

## Primary headache disorders

### Migraine with aura

Migraine with aura presents with a unilateral, pulsating headache and a visual aura — such as scintillating scotomas, fortification spectra, or transient visual loss [^112w56ZH]. The pathophysiology involves cortical spreading depression with trigeminovascular activation [^1142x3cz]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, with neuroimaging considered for atypical features or when red flags are present.

---

### Tension-type headache

Tension-type headache causes bilateral, pressing pain and may include mild blurred vision or photophobia [^111qXuTU]. The pathophysiology involves muscle tension and central sensitization. Diagnosis is **clinical**, with neuroimaging reserved for atypical presentations or when red flags are present [^115f3rxm].

---

## Secondary headache disorders

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension presents with headache, transient visual obscurations, papilledema, and pulsatile tinnitus [^113BDzZK]. It is characterized by **elevated intracranial pressure** without a mass lesion [^112BgbbZ]. Diagnosis relies on MRI/MRV to exclude secondary causes and a lumbar puncture demonstrating an elevated opening pressure [^112BgbbZ].

---

### Acute angle-closure glaucoma

Acute angle-closure glaucoma causes severe headache, eye pain, blurred vision with halos, nausea, and vomiting [^113zADiS]. The mechanism is **a sudden rise in intraocular pressure** due to angle closure. Diagnosis is made by tonometry, gonioscopy, and a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination.

---

### Giant cell arteritis (GCA)

Giant cell arteritis manifests with temporal headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, and visual loss [^1172LqAT]. It is a large-vessel vasculitis that causes tissue ischemia. Diagnosis is supported by elevated ESR/CRP and confirmed by temporal artery biopsy, with **urgent ophthalmology involvement** [^116SLQEF].

---

### Optic neuritis

Optic neuritis presents with headache, eye pain worsened by movement, blurred vision, and color desaturation [^111LXJq3]. The cause is **demyelination** or inflammation of the optic nerve. Diagnosis is guided by MRI of the orbits/brain, visual evoked potentials, and, when indicated, a lumbar puncture.

---

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome presents with headache, blurred vision, seizures, and altered mental status [^114WR6B7]. It reflects vasogenic edema triggered by **severe hypertension** or cytotoxic drugs. Diagnosis is established by MRI demonstrating posterior-predominant white matter edema.

---

### Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)

Subarachnoid hemorrhage presents with a sudden, severe "thunderclap" headache, blurred vision, photophobia, and neck stiffness [^116t31zc]. It results from rupture of an intracranial aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation. Diagnosis involves a **noncontrast CT head**, lumbar puncture when CT is nondiagnostic, and cerebral angiography.

---

## Systemic conditions

### Hypertensive crisis

Hypertensive crisis features severe headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status. It results from an acute elevation in blood pressure causing **end-organ damage** [^114WR6B7]. Diagnosis is based on blood pressure measurement, funduscopic examination, and laboratory evaluation.

---

### Eclampsia

Eclampsia presents with headache, blurred vision, seizures, hypertension, and proteinuria [^114GCpce]. It is a **pregnancy-related hypertensive disorder**. The diagnosis is clinical, supported by blood pressure assessment and urinalysis.

---

## Medication-induced causes

Several **medications can cause** headache with blurred vision, including:

- **Pregabalin (Lyrica)**: Blurred vision, headache [^114yhzjJ].
- **Lamotrigine**: Blurred vision, headache [^116wUhpX].
- **Carbamazepine**: Blurred vision, headache [^112ybsrj].
- **Topiramate**: Acute angle-closure glaucoma [^116cDzjq].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation

- Sudden severe headache ("thunderclap") [^116t31zc]
- Sudden vision loss or visual field defect [^113zADiS]
- Papilledema or optic disc swelling [^115f3rxm]
- Focal neurologic deficits [^115f3rxm]
- Altered mental status or seizures [^114WR6B7]
- Fever, neck stiffness, or immunocompromised state [^115f3rxm]
- Recent trauma or anticoagulant use [^115f3rxm]

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **History**: Onset, duration, severity, associated symptoms, medication use, systemic conditions [^115f3rxm].
- **Physical examination**: Neurologic exam, funduscopy, visual acuity, intraocular pressure [^112CEfYV].
- **Imaging**: MRI/CT head, MRV/CT venography, lumbar puncture, ophthalmologic evaluation [^115f3rxm].

---

Headache with blurred vision spans primary and secondary disorders; **prompt recognition of red flags** and a structured diagnostic approach are critical to prevent vision loss or neurologic injury [^113zADiS].

### Recurrent posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in a pediatric patient with end-stage renal disease [^114WR6B7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a condition manifested by altered mental status, seizures, headaches, and visual loss. Specific abnormalities are seen by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Awareness of this syndrome is important for emergency physicians because visual loss can be reversible with prompt treatment of the underlying cause.

We present a case of recurrent PRES in a 14-year-old female who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) for headache and photosensitivity. A patient with a history of end-stage renal disease of unknown etiology was brought in by her mother for headache and photosensitivity. The patient developed blurry vision, seized in the ED, and required intubation. She was discharged two weeks later with a complete return of vision. The same patient presented to the ED many times during the subsequent months for hypertensive emergencies, with three subsequent episodes that involved either seizures, vision loss, or both. Each of the episodes resolved with aggressive control of blood pressure in the pediatric intensive care unit.

PRES should be considered in all patients presenting to the ED with visual loss, seizures, or headache, and can be recurrent in some individuals. Prompt treatment can help prevent permanent vision loss.

### Rapidly progressive vision loss due to fulminant idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A diagnostic and management dilemma [^113BDzZK]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 44-year-old obese woman presented with a decrease in vision in the right eye (RE) for 3 days. She reported a simultaneous onset of a holocranial headache that worsened on bending forward. She denied eye pain, pain on eye movements, and other ocular or neurological complaints. On examination, her distance best-corrected visual acuity was counting fingers at 1 meter in the RE and 20/20 in the left eye (LE). Color vision was subnormal in both eyes (BE). There was a grade II relative afferent pupillary defect in the RE. Fundus examination showed disc edema in BE. Visual fields in the LE showed central scotoma extending nasally.

A provisional diagnosis of papillitis was considered. However, contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain and orbits showed evidence of elevated intracranial pressure. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure was 42 cm H2O, while the rest of the CSF analysis was normal. Diagnosis was revised to fulminant idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Management with medical therapy and urgent thecoperiteoneal shunt improved visual function in BE.

### Transient monocular visual loss: When is it an emergency [^1172LqAT]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Patients who experience transient monocular vision loss (TMVL) commonly present to the emergency department for evaluation. Although multiple etiologies can cause TMVL, it is most important to identify patients with retinal ischemia and those with vasculitis (giant cell arteritis) as the cause of TMVL. Patients with transient retinal ischemia have the same risk of cardiovascular events and death as patients who experience transient brain ischemia. Additionally, patients with giant cell arteritis are at imminent risk of visual loss.

- **Case report**: A 65-year-old man noticed three separate episodes of sudden onset blurry vision in one eye. Ophthalmologic examination was normal, but as his symptoms were compatible with transient retinal ischemic attack, urgent investigations were initiated. He had normal inflammatory markers; however, a computed tomography angiogram of the brain and neck demonstrated a large plaque in the ipsilateral internal carotid artery. Double anti-platelet therapy was started, and stenting of the involved carotid artery was performed. The patient was symptom-free at the last follow-up.

- **Significance for emergency physicians**: Patients with retinal ischemia as the etiology of TMVL are at high risk of cardiovascular events and death. Their risk of cerebrovascular accidents is highest within 48 hours from the episode of TMVL. Thus, they should have an urgent ophthalmologic examination. If it is unrevealing, inflammatory markers should be checked, and an urgent stroke prevention protocol should be initiated. Appropriate management with medical or surgical interventions is crucial.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^112w56ZH]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

In the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3), migraine is classified into three main types: migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and chronic migraine. The clinical characteristics of each must be considered to ensure an accurate diagnosis.

- **Migraine without aura**: Migraine without aura is characterized by headache attacks that last 4–72 hours. Typical features of an attack include a unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, and aggravation by routine physical activity. However, bilateral pain is not uncommon; population-based data indicate that approximately 40% of individuals with migraine report bilateral pain during attacks. The most common associated symptoms are photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Before the onset of pain, prodromal symptoms can include a depressed mood, yawning, fatigue, and cravings for specific foods. After resolution of the headache, postdromal symptoms can last up to 48 hours and often include tiredness, concentration difficulties, and neck stiffness.

- **Migraine with aura**: Approximately one third of individuals with migraine experience aura, either with every attack or with some attacks. Aura is defined as transient focal neurological symptoms that usually precede, but sometimes accompany, the headache phase of a migraine attack. In more than 90% of affected individuals, aura manifests visually, classically as fortification spectra. Sensory symptoms occur in approximately 31% of affected individuals and are usually experienced as predominantly unilateral.

### Bilateral optic neuritis in a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a case report [^111LXJq3]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Both idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and optic neuritis can present with visual loss, headache, and optic disc edema. Therefore, a differential diagnosis of IIH and optic neuritis is needed for patients with bilateral optic disc swelling. Ophthalmologists should carefully analyze the patient's history, imaging data, and demyelinating disease antibody tests. Orbital MRI can provide useful clues in differentiating the diagnosis, as optic nerve sheath enhancement has been shown to be a unique feature of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) and is not commonly observed in IIH- or multiple sclerosis (MS)-related optic neuritis.

In this case, the patient was a middle-aged female with progressive bilateral vision loss and optic disc congestion and swelling. Orbital MRI enhancement revealed bilateral optic nerve thickening and enhancement. Initially, optic neuritis (ON) was considered. However, given her high BMI (29.1 kg/m²), MRI findings of optic nerve sheath widening and fluid accumulation, along with the presence of recent headaches and tinnitus, and a lumbar puncture (LP) showing an intracranial pressure (ICP) of 270 mmH₂O, IIH was also considered. After further progression of vision loss and worsening optic disc swelling, it was concluded that optic neuritis, not increased ICP, was the primary cause of her condition. This conclusion was supported by the improvement in her condition, as optic disc swelling from IIH is often symmetrical, with a more gradual onset. Additionally, the patient's vision improved significantly after optic neuritis treatment trial (ONTT) treatment, supporting the diagnosis of optic neuritis.

Although it is believed that optic neuritis was the main cause of her bilateral vision loss and optic disc…

### Subarachnoid hemorrhage [^116t31zc]. Neurology (2013). High credibility.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage can be associated with a variety of symptoms and conditions, including:

- **Neurological symptoms**: loss of consciousness, hemiparesis, blurred vision, diplopia, photophobia, thunderclap headache, limb paresis, headache, seizure, cranial nerve palsy, focal neurologic deficits, altered mental status

- **Physical signs**: nausea, low back pain, subarachnoid blood, meningismus, xanthochromia, neck stiffness, vomiting

- **Medical conditions**: head injury, intracranial aneurysm, polycystic kidney disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypertension

- **Lifestyle factors**: tobacco use, alcohol consumption

- **Laboratory findings**: increased cerebrospinal fluid red blood cells (↑ CSF RBCs)

### Acute vision loss [^113zADiS]. Primary Care (2015). High credibility.

Acute vision loss can be caused by a variety of conditions, including posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, and giant cell arteritis. Other causes include migraine, vitreous hemorrhage, pituitary apoplexy, hyphema, and central retinal vein occlusion. Additional conditions such as central retinal artery occlusion, retinal detachment, acute angle-closure glaucoma, uveitis, and corneal foreign body may also lead to vision loss.

Further potential causes are endophthalmitis, papillitis, keratitis, corneal opacity, and amaurosis fugax. Acute ischemic stroke, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, methanol poisoning, acute macular neuroretinopathy, and acute zonal occult outer retinopathy are additional considerations. Lastly, functional visual loss, ocular migraine, retinal migraine, toxic optic neuropathy, and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy should also be evaluated.

### Eclampsia characteristics and outcomes: A comparison of two eras [^114GCpce]. Journal of Pregnancy (2013). High credibility.

The disease eclampsia can be associated with blurred vision, hypertension, visual disturbances, loss of consciousness, photophobia, increased urine protein, preeclampsia, diplopia, peripheral edema, agitation, headache, weight gain, diabetes mellitus, and seizure.

### Sulindac [^117Y6oGg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Special senses**: Blurred vision, visual disturbances, decreased hearing, metallic or bitter taste.

- **Respiratory**: Epistaxis.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, urticaria, bronchial spasm, dyspnea, hypersensitivity vasculitis. A potentially fatal apparent hypersensitivity syndrome has been reported, and it may include constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, diaphoresis, and flushing; cutaneous findings like rash or other dermatologic reactions (see above); conjunctivitis; and involvement of major organs. This includes changes in liver function, hepatic failure, jaundice, pancreatitis, pneumonitis with or without pleural effusion, leukopenia, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, anemia, and renal impairment including renal failure. Other less specific findings like adenitis, arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, fatigue, malaise, hypotension, chest pain, and tachycardia may also occur.

- **Causal relationship unknown**: A rare occurrence of fulminant necrotizing fasciitis, particularly in association with Group A β-hemolytic streptococcus, has been described in persons treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, sometimes with fatal outcomes (see also PRECAUTIONS, General). Other reactions have been reported in clinical trials or since the drug was marketed, but occurred under circumstances where a causal relationship could not be established. However, in these rarely reported events, the possibility cannot be excluded. Therefore, these observations are listed to serve as alerting information to physicians.

- **Cardiovascular**: Arrhythmia.

- **Metabolic**: No specific reactions reported.

### A 32-year-old man with a severe headache, visual loss, and nodular pulmonary opacities [^114WREk1]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

A 32-year-old man presented with severe headache, vomiting, and painless loss of vision of 5 days' duration. He had no seizures, other neurologic deficits, or fever. Two months prior to presentation, he experienced an episode of hemoptysis, ranging from 30 to 50 mL, which resolved spontaneously with no recurrence. He reported one to two episodes of epistaxis each month that resolved spontaneously since childhood. He had no known comorbid illnesses, prior surgeries, dental procedures, or blood transfusions. Furthermore, he denied any history of substance abuse. He observed that his father and brother also had self-limited episodes of epistaxis.

### Visual cortex hyperexcitability in migraine in response to sound-induced flash illusions [^113RZ47X]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Sound-induced flash illusions depend on visual cortical excitability. In this study, we explored whether sound-induced flash illusions are perceived differently in migraine, a condition associated with pathologic cortical hyperexcitability.

- **Methods**: Sound-induced flash illusions were examined in 59 migraine patients (mean age = 32 ± 16 years; 36 females), 32 without aura and 27 with aura, and in 24 healthy controls (mean age = 42 ± 17 years; 16 females). Patients were studied during attacks and interictally. Visual stimuli (flashes) accompanied by sounds (beeps) were presented in different combinations: a single flash with multiple beeps was given to induce the perception of multiple flashes ("fission" illusion), and multiple flashes with a single beep were used to reduce the number of perceived flashes ("fusion" illusion).

- **Results**: For migraineurs, the fission illusion was reduced, especially during the attack, and almost abolished when a single flash was combined with 2 beeps (except for those without aura tested interictally). The fusion illusion was less consistently reported in both migraine groups, but not completely disrupted.

- **Conclusions**: Results from this study add novel clues to our understanding of visual cortex hyperexcitability in migraine, especially migraine with aura. Furthermore, these analyses underscore how pathologic changes in cortical excitability affect multisensory interactions. Cross-modal illusions represent a valid tool for exploration of functional connectivity between sensory areas, which likely has an important role in the pathophysiology of migraines.

### SPL drug information for pregabalin [^116n58ds]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of pregabalin PO (also known as Lyrica):

- **Angioedema**: Use caution in patients with a history of angioedema or those taking other drugs associated with angioedema, such as ACE inhibitors.

- **Blurred vision**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as pregabalin may cause blurred vision.

- **Decreased platelet count**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as pregabalin is associated with an increased risk of thrombocytopenia.

- **Increased serum CK**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as pregabalin may cause serum creatine kinase elevations.

- **Peripheral edema**: Use caution in patients with congestive heart failure or those taking thiazolidinediones.

- **Prolonged PR interval**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as pregabalin may cause PR interval prolongation.

- **Respiratory depression**: Use caution in patients with underlying respiratory impairment or those taking CNS depressants such as opioids.

- **Seizure**: Do not discontinue abruptly in patients with a seizure disorder.

- **Somnolence**: Use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.

- **Suicidal ideation**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as pregabalin has been associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior and ideation. Monitor closely for depression, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior.

- **Weight gain**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as pregabalin may cause weight gain.

### Corneal confocal microscopy identifies corneal nerve fiber loss in patients with migraine [^11436Swc]. Cephalalgia (2023). High credibility.

Migraine affects over 1 billion people, yet its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Alterations in the trigeminovascular system play an important role in this condition. In this study, we have compared corneal nerve morphology in patients with migraine to healthy controls.

- **Methods**: Sixty patients with either episodic (n = 32) or chronic (n = 28) migraine and 20 age-matched healthy control subjects were studied cross-sectionally. Their migraine characteristics and signs and symptoms of dry eyes were assessed. Corneal nerves were quantified manually and automatically using corneal confocal microscopy.

- **Results**: Compared to controls, patients with migraine showed lower manual corneal nerve fiber density (P < 0.001), branch density (P = 0.015), and length (P < 0.001). Automated measures also indicated lower corneal nerve fiber density (P < 0.001), branch density (P < 0.001), length (P < 0.001), total branch density (P < 0.001), nerve fiber area (P < 0.001), nerve fiber width (P = 0.045), and fractal dimension (P < 0.001). Patients with episodic migraine and aura exhibited higher automated corneal nerve fiber density (P = 0.010), whereas those with more headache days in the previous three months had a lower fractal dimension (P = 0.029). Automated corneal nerve fiber density significantly predicted the variance in pain intensity (adjusted r² = 0.14, partial r = -0.37, P = 0.004) in migraine patients.

- **Conclusions**: Corneal confocal microscopy reveals corneal nerve loss in patients with migraine, potentially serving as an objective imaging biomarker of neurodegeneration in this condition.

Headaches affect 90% of the population sometime during their life. Most are benign and fleeting, some are serious and life-threatening, and others require ongoing medical consultation and treatment. A careful history and physical examination are necessary to establish a differential diagnosis and to guide the choice of testing to make an accurate diagnosis.

The most common types of headaches are discussed in this review. They are divided into primary and secondary headache disorders as classified by the International Headache Society. Primary headache disorders include migraine without and with aura, cluster headaches and tension-type headaches. Secondary headaches occur as a result of some other disorder and include brain tumors, rhinosinusitis, diseases of intracranial and extracranial vasculature, and temporomandibular joint disease.

### Lyrica [^114yhzjJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

In controlled studies involving adult patients, a higher proportion of those treated with Lyrica reported blurred vision (7%) compared to patients receiving a placebo (2%). The blurred vision resolved in the majority of cases with continued dosing. Less than 1% of patients discontinued Lyrica due to vision-related events, primarily blurred vision.

Prospectively planned ophthalmologic testing, including visual acuity assessments, formal visual field testing, and dilated funduscopic examinations, was conducted in over 3,600 patients. Visual acuity was reduced in 7% of Lyrica-treated patients and in 5% of placebo-treated patients. Visual field changes were detected in 13% of patients treated with Lyrica and in 12% of those given a placebo. Funduscopic changes were observed in 2% of both Lyrica-treated and placebo-treated patients.

Although the clinical significance of these ophthalmologic findings is unknown, patients should be advised to notify their physician if any changes in vision occur. If visual disturbances persist, consider further assessment. More frequent assessments should be considered for patients who are already routinely monitored for ocular conditions [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

- **Creatine kinase elevations**: Lyrica treatment was associated with elevations in creatine kinase levels. The mean change in creatine kinase from baseline to the maximum value was 60 U/L for Lyrica-treated patients and 28 U/L for placebo patients. In all controlled trials in adult patients across multiple patient populations, 1.5% of patients on Lyrica and 0.7% of placebo patients experienced this effect.

### Danyelza [^116zvYCv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Neurological disorders of the eye, including unequal pupils, blurred vision, accommodation disorder, mydriasis, visual impairment, and photophobia, occurred in 24% of patients in Study 201 and 19% of patients in Study 12–230. These disorders lasted a median of 17 days (range 0 to 84 days) in Study 201, with two patients (8%) experiencing events that had not resolved at the time of data cutoff. In Study 12–230, the median duration was 1 day (range less than one day to 21 days). Permanently discontinue DANYELZA based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Prolonged urinary retention**: Urinary retention occurred in 1 (4%) patient in Study 201 and in 3 patients (4%) in Study 12–230. All events in both studies occurred on the day of a DANYELZA infusion and lasted between 0 and 24 days. Permanently discontinue DANYELZA in patients with urinary retention that does not resolve following discontinuation of opioids [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Myocarditis**: Myocarditis has occurred in adolescent patients receiving DANYELZA in clinical trials and expanded access programs. It occurred within days of receiving DANYELZA, requiring drug interruption. Monitor for signs and symptoms of myocarditis during treatment. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue DANYELZA based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Behçet: The syndrome [^115wevAu]. Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Behçet's syndrome is a complex disease that can manifest in various ways. It is associated with cerebral venous thrombosis, headache, and genital ulcers. Ophthalmic symptoms include episcleritis, scleritis, blurred vision, cranial nerve palsy, photophobia, red eyes, eye pain, and uveitis. Patients may display oral ulcers, aphthous ulcers, erythema nodosum, and acneiform lesions.

- **Neurological manifestations**: These include dysarthria, hemiparesis, ataxia, meningitis, and optic neuritis. Behavioral or personality changes and increased intracranial pressure (↑ ICP) may also occur.

- **Gastrointestinal and dermatological symptoms**: The syndrome may present with gastrointestinal fistulas, abdominal pain, and intestinal perforation. Patients might also have skin pustules, cutaneous lesions, skin papules, pyoderma gangrenosum, and superficial thrombophlebitis.

- **Systemic involvement**: Common systemic symptoms are Budd-Chiari syndrome, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), arthritis, nausea, diarrhea, and polyarticular synovitis. Laboratory tests often show increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (↑ ESR) and serum C-reactive protein (↑ serum CRP). The presence of the HLA-B51 marker is notable.

The diagnosis can be supported by the results of a positive pathergy test and a positive Lhermitte's phenomenon.

### Ophthalmoplegic migraine: Migraine or oculomotor neuropathy [^116qcKAF]. Cephalalgia (2012). Low credibility.

Ophthalmoplegic migraine (OM) is a rare condition characterized by the association of headaches and oculomotor nerve palsy. The third cranial nerve is commonly involved in reattacks, whereas involvement of the sixth and fourth nerves is uncommon. It is still debated whether an uncontrolled migraine or an oculomotor neuropathy may be the primary cause of ophthalmoplegic migraine.

- **Cases**: We report two patients affected by OM with normal magnetic resonance imaging findings and a history of uncontrolled migraine before an attack of OM.

- **Conclusion**: The cases reported allow us to hypothesize that OM may be considered a form of migraine rather than a cranial neuralgia. It is possible that different factors, such as inflammatory or structural factors, may represent a vulnerability of the nerve during a severe migraine attack causing ophthalmoplegia.

### Improved modeling of human vision by incorporating robustness to blur in convolutional neural networks [^112MDP7j]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

There is a general bias to consider blurry vision as suboptimal, problematic, and in need of correction. However, such assumptions may overlook the potential contributions of blur for real-world vision and object recognition. For example, humans can leverage blurry contextual information to support more accurate object recognition, and both face and object recognition remain quite robust to substantial levels of blur. Recent work has further revealed that defocus blur provides an important cue for depth perception. Neurophysiological studies have also found that shape-selective neurons in the visual cortex can be tuned to varying degrees of blur, with some neurons preferring blurry over clear depictions of 2D object shapes. Thus, blur appears to be an important feature that is encoded by the visual system.

Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that the omission of blurry training inputs may cause convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to rely excessively on high spatial frequency information for object recognition, thereby causing systematic deviations from biological vision. To address this question, we compared the performance of standard CNNs trained exclusively on clear images with CNNs trained on a combination of clear and blurry images. By testing standard versus blur-trained CNNs on a diverse set of neural, visual, and behavioral benchmarks, we show that blur-trained CNN models significantly outperform standard CNNs at predicting neural responses to object images across a variety of viewing conditions, including those that were never used for training.

Unlike standard CNNs, blur-trained CNNs favor…

### What to look out for, what to do, and when: 3 key messages for safely treating neck pain, headache, and/or orofacial symptoms in musculoskeletal rehabilitation settings [^112ZbWw7]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Neck pain, headache, and/or orofacial symptoms are potentially the first (nonischemic) symptoms of an underlying vascular pathology or blood flow limitation. If an underlying vascular pathology or blood flow limitation is not recognized by the musculoskeletal rehabilitation clinician, it can subsequently be aggravated by treatment, raising the risk of serious adverse events. Clinicians can make an important, and potentially lifesaving, difference by providing specific information and advice. This is especially the case in patients with an intermediate level of concern, for example, patients who display only a few concerning features regarding a possible underlying serious condition and for whom an initial vasculogenic hypothesis was rejected during the clinical reasoning process.

We provide background information to help the reader understand the context of the problem. Additionally, we offer suggestions on how clinicians can deliver appropriate information and advice to patients presenting with neck pain, headache, and/or orofacial symptoms.

### Mekinist [^113ghh4v]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension: Advise patients that Mekinist can cause hypertension. They need to undergo blood pressure monitoring and contact their healthcare provider if they develop symptoms of hypertension such as severe headache, blurry vision, or dizziness [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Diarrhea: Advise patients that Mekinist often causes diarrhea, which may be severe in some cases. Inform patients of the need to contact their healthcare provider if severe diarrhea occurs during treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Embryo-fetal toxicity: Advise pregnant women and males of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. Advise females to contact their healthcare provider if a known or suspected pregnancy occurs. Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with Mekinist and for four months after the last dose. Male patients with female partners of reproductive potential should use condoms during treatment with Mekinist and for four months after the last dose.

Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Mekinist and for four months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

### Topical difluprednate for the treatment of Harada's disease [^1113toAW]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

A 40-year-old Middle Eastern female presented with progressive blurriness (OS, OD) associated with central photopsias. She also noted mild headaches with binocular diplopia. VA measured 20/30–2 OD and 20/200 OS, with IOP of 19 OD and 20 OS. A review of systems was negative, and she denied any prior ocular or family history.

A dilated funduscopic exam revealed trace white blood cells in the anterior vitreous and bilateral serous macular detachments. OCT studies confirmed the serous macular detachment OS with cystoid macular edema (CME) OU (Figure 3A). FA studies revealed punctate leakage in the macula and disk leakage OU late in the study (Figure 4A and B).

- **Treatment plan and progress**: Topical difluprednate was prescribed with an initial loading dose of one drop q1h OU while awake. By day 7, VA improved to 20/40 OD and 20/80 OS with resolution of her headaches. IOP was noted to be 22 OD and 20 OS. Given the mild steroid response, the patient was started on dorzolamide 2%/timolol 0.5% once daily (qd) OU. OCT and FA studies showed a marked improvement with decreased SRF OS and reduced leakage, respectively (Figures 3B and 4C).

By day 14, the patient recovered to 20/25–1 OD and 20/30 OS with pinhole to 20/25 OS. OCT studies showed resolution of the serous detachment OS and decreased activity on FA studies (Figures 3C and 4D). Given the improvement, difluprednate was tapered to q3h for 1 week, QID for 1 week, TID for 1 week, BID for 2 weeks, and qd thereafter for 2 months. The patient ultimately recovered to 20/20–2 OD and 20/30–2 OS with IOP of 21 OU. Given the mild residual CME OS, the patient continued…

### The review of ophthalmic symptoms in COVID-19 [^111YFxQe]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 had a significant impact on the health of the global human population, affecting almost every human organ, including the organ of vision. Research has focused on understanding the pathophysiology, identifying symptoms, and complications of the disease. Eye-related pathologies are important foci of research due to the potential for the direct impact of the virus. Ophthalmologists around the world are reporting various symptoms of eye infections and ocular pathologies associated with SARS-CoV-2.

The review of ophthalmic symptoms was conducted to help physicians of various specialties recognize possible ophthalmic manifestations of this viral disease. A literature review was conducted from January 2020 to July 2023 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, Science Direct, Scopus, Scielo, and Google Scholar databases. The review of the literature showed that conjunctivitis is the most common ophthalmic symptom observed during the course of COVID-19 and can occur at any stage of the disease. Changes in the eye may result from the direct effect of the virus, immune response, prothrombotic states, comorbidities, and medications used.

- **Symptoms related to the organ of vision**: These can be divided into changes affecting the protective apparatus of the eye, the anterior eye segment, the posterior eye segment, neuro-ophthalmic changes, and orbital changes. Ocular symptoms may suggest COVID-19 infection or appear several weeks after recovery. Following COVID-19 vaccinations, a diverse range of ophthalmic symptoms was observed in various locations and at different times, mirroring the ocu.

### A young woman with blurred vision and distal paresthesias [^117H5feZ]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

A 29-year-old woman presented with blurred vision and distal paresthesias. Her initial evaluation revealed severe bilateral optic disc edema, distal lower-extremity sensory and motor deficits, and electrodiagnostic evidence of a length-dependent mixed demyelinating and axonal polyneuropathy. The results of routine diagnostic testing, including laboratory tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture, were nondiagnostic. A targeted biopsy was ultimately required for diagnosis. In this article, we discuss the differential diagnosis and outline the clinical evaluation indicated for a patient presenting with demyelinating polyneuropathy and papilledema.

### Typical migraine or ophthalmologic emergency [^116cDzjq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a 47-year-old woman who came to the emergency department (ED) complaining of a worse than typical migraine headache and blurry vision after recently doubling the dose of topiramate earlier that day. After a complete neurologic and ophthalmologic evaluation, she was found to have elevated intraocular pressures and was diagnosed with topiramate-induced bilateral acute angle-closure glaucoma, which is a rare side effect of this commonly prescribed medication. She was treated with timolol, brimonide, and prednisolone drops to reduce intraocular pressure, as well as cessation of topiramate, and was discharged home. This report briefly discusses the clinical history, appropriate evaluation, differential diagnosis, and approach to secondary acute angle-closure glaucoma in the ED.

### Diagnostic and classification tools for chronic headache disorders: A systematic review [^116eghoQ]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of chronic headache disorders can be challenging for non-expert clinicians. Depending on the clinical or research need, there are a number of adequate tools available that could be used in specific contexts. Nevertheless, there are currently no tools validated in primary care that can be used by non-expert clinicians to classify chronic headache disorders that also allow the user to screen for primary headaches other than migraine and tension-type headache (TTH). The availability of such a tool could support primary care clinicians in diagnosing and managing chronic headache disorders within primary care and allow more targeted referrals to headache specialists.

### Mild blurry vision as the initial presentation of central nervous system relapses of acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a case report [^116VFgMH]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

In this case, the diagnosis of CNS relapse of ALL was made quickly based on the results of a lumbar puncture, so we cancelled some additional examinations, such as visual field and brain MRI examination originally scheduled. This led to an inability to clearly identify whether the optic nerve edema of this leukemia patient was due to increased ICP or direct infiltration of the optic nerve. The fact that the opening pressure was elevated on lumbar puncture suggests high ICP. Papilledema induced by increased ICP usually does not cause a decrease in visual acuity unless there is optic atrophy, ischemic changes, or subretinal fluid tracking into the fovea.

However, the visual acuity of this patient was decreased, and the typical symptoms of high ICP (such as headache) were absent, which seems to be more consistent with direct infiltration. Direct infiltration of leukemic blasts within the eye is rare. When it does occur, it is related to the accumulation of circulating leukemic cells in the uvea. It can appear as leukemic pseudo-hypopyon or optic disc infiltration, such as papilledema with peripapillary hemorrhages or white-grayish subretinal lesions due to choroidal infiltration, which was absent from our case. However, without supportive testing, it is still hard to definitively differentiate the cause of optic nerve edema.

In summary, our case emphasizes the importance of continued fundus examination of patients with a history of ALL and HSCT for signs of leukemic infiltration of the retina and optic nerve.

### Intraocular pressure and ocular biometric parameters changes in migraine [^112WUYrK]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

The mechanisms underlying headache, aura, and photophobia in migraine are still not fully understood, despite migraine being the most prevalent neurological disorder and much research being conducted in this field. The most common known event in migraine pathogenesis is vascular dysregulation (vasospastic diathesis), with the neurovascular system being the most affected. The new theory, cortical spreading depression (CSD), is associated with dramatic changes in the caliber of blood vessels and the electrophysiological activation of trigeminovascular neurons during a migraine attack. It may trigger the headache and aura phase of migraine attacks by activating and sensitizing the trigeminovascular system, initiating a series of neural, vascular, and inflammatory events that result in pain. Several lines of evidence for vascular dysfunction have been identified in migraineurs, and there is increasing evidence suggesting that the vascular system is impaired not only within the brain but also in the central retinal artery and posterior ciliary artery.

Migraine attacks have been reported to relate to decreased blood flow in the optic nerve, retina, and choroid. There is increasing evidence that changes in ocular blood flow are involved in both the pathogenesis of glaucoma and the progression of glaucomatous damage. Dadaci et al. and Karalezli et al. noted that increased choroidal thickness during the migraine attack period could reflect an alteration of ocular circulation. However, Dervisogullari et al. and Zengin et al. reported a reduction in ocular circulation.

### The role of bedside ultrasound in pretherapeutic and posttherapeutic lumbar puncture in patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^112BgbbZ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is often a debilitating condition characterized by headaches, blurry vision, nausea, and vomiting. Lumbar puncture (LP) is an essential component of the diagnostic and therapeutic approach; however, the procedure itself can cause a postlumbar puncture headache. In addition to the clinical presentation, the use of bedside ultrasound to measure the optic nerve sheath diameter may aid in differentiating the two conditions. We hereby report a case of a 33-year-old woman with known IIH who presented with a headache after the initial therapeutic LP.

### Hemangiopericytoma of the confluence of sinuses and the transverse sinuses. Case report [^113J6ntw]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

The authors describe the case of a 38-year-old man with progressive headache and blurred vision related to a hemangiopericytoma located exclusively in the confluence of sinuses (CoS) and in the transverse sinuses bilaterally. They believe this is the first report in which a hemangiopericytoma of the dural sinuses has been described without any intradural component. Although the diagnosis was not suspected preoperatively, a gross-total resection of the tumor with restoration of sinus patency was achieved to relieve the symptoms. This diagnosis should be included in the preoperative differential diagnosis of a tumor of the CoS. Successful resection can be achieved in these cases.

### Lyrica [^116cQYmj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In controlled studies involving adult patients, a higher proportion of patients treated with Lyrica reported blurred vision (7%) compared to those receiving a placebo (2%). This issue resolved in the majority of cases with continued dosing. Less than 1% of patients discontinued Lyrica treatment due to vision-related events, primarily blurred vision.

To further investigate, prospectively planned ophthalmologic testing — including visual acuity testing, formal visual field testing, and dilated funduscopic examination — was conducted with over 3,600 patients. Visual acuity was reduced in 7% of patients treated with Lyrica and in 5% of placebo‑treated patients. Visual field changes were observed in 13% of Lyrica-treated patients compared to 12% of the placebo group. Funduscopic changes were noted in 2% of both Lyrica-treated and placebo-treated groups.

- **Clinical significance**: Although the clinical significance of these ophthalmologic findings is unknown, it is important to inform patients to notify their physician if they experience changes in vision. If visual disturbances persist, further assessment should be considered. More frequent assessment may be advisable for patients regularly monitored for ocular conditions [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

- **Creatine kinase elevations**: Lyrica treatment has been associated with creatine kinase elevations. Mean changes in creatine kinase from baseline to the maximum value were 60 U/L for Lyrica-treated patients and 28 U/L for placebo-treated patients. Across all controlled trials in adult patients, 1.5% of patients on Lyrica and 0.7% of those on placebo experienced elevations in creatine kinase.

### Orbital fractures and risk factors for ocular injury [^1118Lz6K]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

Patients were differentiated based on the presence or absence of symptoms. "Symptomatic" patients had at least one of the following symptoms: blurry vision, a sensation of pressure, ocular pain, facial pain, facial numbness, pain specifically with extraocular movements, diplopia, nausea, floaters, or photopsias. Blurry vision, ocular pain, pain specifically with extraocular muscle movements, facial pain, headache, and diplopia were additionally studied as stand-alone symptoms. "Asymptomatic" patients lacked any of these complaints.

Visual acuity (VA) was measured at near with a Rosenbaum pocket vision screener. Consistent with prior studies, VA of 20/40 or worse was defined as poor vision. If the VA could not be obtained from the patient — due to intubation, lack of cooperation, or altered mental status — it was recorded as "no documented vision". "Abnormal pupillary reaction" was defined as the presence of an afferent pupillary defect (APD), a questionable APD on exam, or an unreactive pupil. If pupils were obscured, or the presence of an APD could not be determined, such patients were excluded from analysis.

Orbital wall fractures were categorized by the location of the fracture ("floor", "medial wall", "lateral wall", or "roof"), and by the number of walls fractured.

### Amantadine [^116A9LPH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Patients with a history of epilepsy or other seizures should be observed closely for possible increased seizure activity.

Patients receiving amantadine hydrochloride tablets who note central nervous system effects or allergic reactions, including blurring of vision, should be cautioned against driving or working in situations where alertness and adequate motor coordination are important.

Patients with a history of congestive heart failure or peripheral edema should be monitored closely, as some have developed congestive heart failure while receiving amantadine hydrochloride tablets. Those with Parkinson's disease showing improvement with the tablets should resume normal activities gradually and cautiously, considering other medical conditions, such as osteoporosis or phlebothrombosis.

Amantadine hydrochloride tablets have anticholinergic effects and may cause mydriasis, so they should not be given to patients with untreated angle-closure glaucoma.

Corneal edema has been reported in patients taking amantadine. Symptoms can include blurry vision, eye pain, and vision loss, typically occurring bilaterally. The onset can range from a few weeks to several years after starting amantadine. Symptoms may resolve within weeks after cessation of amantadine; however, corneal grafts have been required for some patients. Ask patients if their vision has changed and consider obtaining baseline and periodic ophthalmologic examinations after initiating therapy with amantadine.

### Distinctive anatomical and physiological features of migraine aura revealed by 18 years of recording [^1128Yj4j]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

The mechanisms underlying the initiation and propagation of the migraine aura, and the visual percept that it produces, remain uncertain. The objective of this study was to characterize and quantify a large number of visual auras recorded by a single individual over nearly two decades to gain insight into basic aura mechanisms. An individual made detailed drawings of his visual percept of migraine aura in real-time during more than 1000 attacks of migraine aura without headache over 18 years. Drawings were made in a consistent fashion documenting the shape and location of the aura wavefront or scotoma in the visual field at one-minute intervals. These drawings were digitized, and the spatial and temporal features of auras were quantified and analyzed.

Consistent patterns of aura initiation, propagation, and termination were observed in both right and left visual fields. Most aura attacks originated centrally (within 10° eccentricity), but there were also other distinct sites of initiation in the visual field. Auras beginning centrally preferentially propagated first through the lower nasal field (69–77% of all auras) before traveling to upper and temporal fields, on both sides. Some auras propagated from peripheral to central regions of the visual field — these typically followed the reverse path of those traveling in the opposite direction.

The mean velocity of the perceived visual phenomenon did not differ between attacks starting peripherally and centrally. The estimated speed of the underlying cortical event (2–3 mm/min) was in the same range as has been previously reported.

### Increased frequency of headache and change in visual aura due to occipital cysticercus granuloma [^113y8FjZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Migraine is a common clinical disorder that is quite disabling and affects the quality of life in the majority of patients. Among all types of aura, the visual aura is the most common. Various types of migraine aura described in the literature include photopsia, fortification spectra, scotoma, visual distortion, hemianopia, and metamorphopsia. The epileptic visual aura differs from the aura associated with migraine in certain features: it is short-lasting for 2–3 minutes, occurs in clusters, and is multicolored and circular in shape. According to some reports, the ictal manifestations of occipital lobe lesions can mimic episodes of migraine with visual aura. In this case report, we highlight the aggravation and increased frequency of headache attacks and changed pattern of aura induced by occipital lobe cysticercus granuloma in a patient diagnosed with migraine with aura. The importance of neuroimaging of the brain in states of unexpected increased frequency of headache episodes is emphasized.

### Clinical reasoning: A 27-year-old man with progressive bilateral vision loss resistant to steroid therapy [^113AnZ4Q]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

This case involves a 27-year-old man who presented with progressive bilateral visual impairment that initially improved with steroid therapy but subsequently worsened. The clinical problem centers on diagnosing optic nerve damage with meningeal involvement unresponsive to standard interventions. The patient's vision loss began insidiously in the right eye and later affected the left, with fundoscopy showing bilateral optic nerve atrophy. Although steroids provided temporary relief, the condition deteriorated, necessitating further investigation.

MRI revealed dural thickening and enhancement near the optic canals, suggesting an infiltrative or compressive process. The diagnostic approach required considering inflammatory, compressive, and infiltrative etiologies, with a biopsy ultimately proving critical when initial treatments failed. This case underscores the importance of a stepwise diagnostic strategy and highlights the need to consider rare conditions in atypical presentations, guiding readers through the differential diagnosis.

### Dry eyes and migraines: Is there really a correlation [^116LZZWo]. Cornea (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tear film functions and clinical symptoms of patients with migraines.

- **Methods**: This observational comparative study consisted of 33 migraine patients (26 women and 7 men) referred from neurology clinics, and 33 control subjects (22 women and 11 men) referred from ophthalmology outpatient clinics. The control subjects had neither systemic nor ocular disease nor any type of headache. All 66 patients underwent a complete ophthalmic examination and diagnostic tests for dry eye, including tear break-up time, Schirmer test with topical anesthesia, lissamine green staining, and an ocular surface disease score. Patients with migraine were classified as migraine with aura, migraine without aura, and basilar migraine; a pain score from 1 to 4 was determined for each patient based on the American Headache Society's Migraine Disability Assessment Test.

- **Results**: Of the 33 patients who participated in the migraine group, 17 (51%) suffered from migraine with aura, 11 (33%) from migraine without aura, and 5 (15%) from basilar migraine. Significant differences in dry eye scores were found between the patients with migraines and the control subjects. In the migraine group, the mean tear break-up time was 7.75 ± 2.37 seconds, whereas in the control group it was 9.15 ± 1.93 seconds. For the Schirmer test, the migraine group had a mean value of 12.09 ± 4.95 mm/5 minutes, whereas the control group had a mean value of 14.90 ± 4.26 mm/5 minutes. Testing with lissamine green staining resulted in a mean value of 1.00 ± 0.16 in the migraine group.

### Prolonged complete response in a pediatric patient with primary peripheral T-cell lymphoma of the central nervous system [^1114EKYX]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

We describe a child with a 2-week history of progressive headaches, blurry vision, and intermittent vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a deep left hemispheric lesion with extension into the corpus callosum. Histology and immunophenotyping of the lesion were consistent with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified. Chemotherapy was initiated, and a complete remission was achieved. This case illustrates that a chemotherapeutic regimen used in adults with central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma can achieve durable remissions in pediatric patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified of the CNS.

### Ophthalmoplegic "migraine" or recurrent ophthalmoplegic cranial neuropathy: New cases and a systematic review [^112Fn8d1]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Ophthalmoplegic migraine is a poorly understood neurologic syndrome characterized by recurrent bouts of head pain and ophthalmoplegia. By reviewing cases presenting to our centers in whom the phenotype has been carefully dissected, and systematically reviewing all published cases of ophthalmoplegic migraine in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) era, this review sets out to clearly define the syndrome and discuss possible etiologies. We found that in up to one-third of patients, the headache was not migrainous or associated with migrainous symptoms. In three-quarters of the cases involving the third nerve, there was focal nerve thickening and contrast enhancement on MRI. Observational data suggest systemic corticosteroids may be beneficial acutely. The etiology remains unclear but may involve recurrent bouts of demyelination of the oculomotor nerve. "Ophthalmoplegic migraine" is a misnomer in that it is probably not a variant of migraine but rather a recurrent cranial neuralgia. A more appropriate name might be "ophthalmoplegic cranial neuropathy".

### Clinical reasoning: A 67-year-old woman with progressive headache, visual hallucinations, and seizures [^11469QYR]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

A 67-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital after experiencing three months of new-onset headaches and meningismus, which progressed to focal neurologic deficits. Her initial symptoms included episodes of flashing lights and black blotches obscuring her vision for minutes. She began to experience visual hallucinations, seeing formed letters and words projected onto nearby walls. Additionally, she developed gait unsteadiness and had difficulty using her phone and reading a clock.

She was evaluated by the neuro-ophthalmology department and was found to have a left homonymous hemianopsia. Subsequently, she was admitted for further evaluation. Physical examination revealed normal vital signs, left homonymous hemianopsia, simultagnosia, agraphesthesia, and asymmetric reflexes with an upgoing toe on the left. A brain MRI showed asymmetric, bilateral fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal abnormalities and extensive leptomeningeal enhancement.

During her hospital stay, the patient suffered a seizure and was started on an anticonvulsant. Initial testing for infectious, inflammatory, and malignant conditions did not reveal a cause. Ultimately, a brain biopsy was performed, and a diagnosis was made.

- **Differential diagnosis and symptom localization**: We discuss the differential diagnosis of progressive new headache and meningismus, as well as the localization of symptoms and examination findings.

- **Initial workup and biopsy**: We outline the initial workup pursued in advance of the biopsy, including the eventual pathologic diagnosis.

- **Treatment and management**: We discuss the treatment and management strategies following the diagnosis and highlight the atypical features of this case compared with prior literature.

This case provides a pathologic diagnosis and offers correlation with the patient's clinical-radiological profile.

### Visual evoked potential changes in migraine. Influence of migraine attack and aura [^111aKA2w]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2001). Low credibility.

To assess the visual evoked potential (VEP) changes in migraines with and without aura, a clinical study compared the VEP results of 45 migraineurs (study group) and 22 healthy volunteers (control group). Among the migraineurs, 29 had migraine with aura (MA) and 16 had migraine without aura (MOA). They were examined both during and between migraine attacks.

The patients and healthy controls underwent VEP assessment. During VEP recording, mono-ocular stimulation was performed using the pattern reversal checkboard. The latencies of N1, P1, and N2, as well as the N1 — P1 amplitude, were recorded. Comparisons were made between N1, P1, and N2 latencies and N1 — P1 amplitudes among the migraine and control groups, during and between attacks in patients with MA and MOA.

The VEP results indicated that the migraineurs and healthy controls had similar outcomes (P > 0.05). Results during MA attacks, during and between MOA attacks, and in the control group also showed similarity (P > 0.05). However, N2 latency was significantly prolonged in patients with MA during the attack-free period compared to during the attack (P = 0.01) and was also longer than in the control group (P = 0.01).

These findings suggest involvement of the visual pathway in MA, rather than in MOA, and indicate that differentiation between these migraine subtypes may be based on VEP findings, specifically the prolongation of the N2 wave latency. Further studies are necessary to confirm this contention.

### Intraocular pressure and ocular biometric parameters changes in migraine [^114DDezd]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Migraine is a common disease that presents with a chronic, episodic, and disabling primary headache capable of causing significant dysfunction and coincides with neurological, gastrointestinal, and autonomic changes. Various vascular, neurovascular, hypoxic, cellular, hormonal, and genetic hypotheses have been debated in migraine pathogenesis, yet the pathophysiology of migraine is still not fully understood.

Cortical spreading depression (CSD), a wave of activity that propagates slowly across the brain surface, has been presumed since its original description in the 1940s to be the physiological substrate of the migraine aura. Although this has been discussed for many decades as the underlying mechanism of the aura in migraine, it is still not clear how CSD is related to headache. In recent studies, CSD has been found to be associated with dramatic changes in the calibre of blood vessels and the electrophysiological activation of trigeminovascular neurons during a migraine attack. Sensorial innervations of the eye commonly originate from the trigeminal ganglion and are also supplied by the trigeminal nerve. Long and short ciliary nerve branches of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve innervate different parts of the eye, such as the iris, ciliary body, choroid, and trabecular meshwork.

Although several previous studies have reported decreased blood flow in the retina and optic nerve in migrainous patients and have demonstrated changes in the retinal and choroidal layer, no study has investigated the effect of migraine on changes in the intraocular pressure and ocular biometric parameters.

### Concussions and their consequences: Current diagnosis, management and prevention [^113tzw2x]. CMAJ (2013). High credibility.

Concussions, a common head injury, can lead to numerous symptoms and complications. The disease is associated with a broad spectrum of issues including:

- **Physical symptoms**: Retinal hemorrhage, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, gait disturbance, headache, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, diplopia, numbness, dizziness, insomnia, fatigue, photophobia, and tinnitus.

- **Behavioral changes**: Anxiety, agitation, impulsivity, aggressive behavior, emotional lability, irritability, depression, and difficulty concentrating.

- **Neurological and cognitive effects**: Memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, and insomnia.

- **Other factors**: Alcohol consumption, sports participation, and cervical spine injury.

Concussions are prevalent in both children and adolescents who may experience these symptoms and complications, necessitating careful diagnosis and management to prevent long-term effects.

### Unituxin [^117KrG8U]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Neurological disorders of the eye were experienced by two or more patients treated with Unituxin in Studies 1, 2, or 3 and included blurred vision, photophobia, mydriasis, fixed or unequal pupils, optic nerve disorder, eyelid ptosis, and papilledema.

In Study 1, three (2%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group experienced blurred vision compared to no patients in the RA group. Diplopia, mydriasis, and unequal pupillary size occurred in one patient each in the Unituxin/RA group, while no cases were reported in the RA group. The duration of eye disorders occurring in Study 1 was not documented. In Study 3, eye disorders occurred in 16 (15%) patients, and in three (3%) patients, the resolution of the eye disorder was not documented. Among the cases with documented resolution, the median duration of eye disorders was four days (range: 0 to 221 days).

Interrupt Unituxin in patients experiencing dilated pupils with sluggish light reflex or other visual disturbances that do not cause visual loss. Upon resolution, and if continued treatment with Unituxin is warranted, decrease the Unituxin dose by 50%. Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with recurring signs or symptoms of an eye disorder following dose reduction and in patients who experience loss of vision [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Urinary retention that persists for weeks to months following the discontinuation of opioids has occurred in patients treated with Unituxin. Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with urinary retention that does not resolve following discontinuation.

### Update on the evaluation of transient vision loss [^116SLQEF]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Transient vision loss may indicate underlying vascular disease, including carotid occlusion and thromboembolism, or it may have a more benign etiology, such as migraine or vasospasm. This review focuses on the differential diagnosis and workup of patients presenting with transient vision loss, focusing on several key areas: the relationship to thromboembolic vascular disease, hypercoagulable testing, retinal migraine, and bilateral vision loss. The objective is to provide the ophthalmologist with information on how to best manage these patients.

Thromboembolic etiologies for transient vision loss are sometimes managed with medications, but when carotid surgery is indicated, earlier intervention may prevent future stroke. This need for early treatment places the ophthalmologist in the important role of expediting the management process. Hospital admission is recommended in patients presenting with transient symptoms within 72 hours who meet certain high-risk criteria.

When the cause is giant cell arteritis, ocular ischemic syndrome, or a cardioembolic source, early management of the underlying condition is equally important. For nonthromboembolic causes of transient vision loss, such as retinal migraine or retinal vasospasm, the ophthalmologist can provide reassurance as well as potentially give medications to decrease the frequency of vision loss episodes.

### Detection and discrimination of flicker contrast in migraine [^116St4dk]. Cephalalgia (2011). Low credibility.

The present results confirm that visual flicker at high temporal frequencies is not only aversive to individuals with migraine but also affects their visual systems differently in other measurable ways. While most of the vision research related to migraine has focused on cortical mechanisms, due in large part to the very strong evidence that visual auras originate cortically, we suggest that the heightened sensitivity of migraineurs may lie at many levels of the visual pathway. This possibly begins as early as the retina, and the stimuli that cause migraineurs the most discomfort are those that are likely to give us the greatest insight into the nature of visual abnormalities in migraine.

### Familial retinal migraines [^115FqH2Z]. Pediatric Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Approximately 25% of sufferers of retinal migraine are thought to have a positive family history. Retinal migraines can cause both transient, and rarely permanent, unilateral monocular visual loss. This report of familial retinal migraines furthers our understanding of this particular migraine subtype. Two families with retinal migraines are reported, suggesting an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern with variable expression and penetrance.

### Ocular pulse amplitude and retina nerve fiber layer thickness in migraine patients without aura [^1115xPJZ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Migraine is a form of headache that has been regarded as a neurovascular disorder. The theories about its mechanism do not provide satisfactory clarification, and the underlying pathophysiology remains unclear. Recent studies have declared that neural events trigger vascular dilatation, which aggravates the pain and results in further nerve activation. Migraine has several ocular manifestations, including visual disturbances during attacks, visual field defects, reduction in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, and normal tension glaucoma. Central retinal artery occlusion and ischemic optic neuropathy have also been reported, indicating possible ocular vascular involvement as well as involvement of the central vascular system in migraine. Vasospastic events and ocular involvement were reported mostly in migraine patients with aura.

Ocular pulse amplitude (OPA), described as the difference between systolic and diastolic intraocular pressure (IOP), is accepted as an indirect indicator of choroidal perfusion. It is measured by dynamic contour tonometry, a contact tonometry that provides intraocular pressure and OPA simultaneously and has been suggested as a diagnostic tool for diseases in which choroidal perfusion changes might occur.

The posterior pole asymmetry analysis (PPAA) is a new method for determining the hemisphere asymmetry of the macula by comparing the thickness of the two hemispheres on a map, which is divided into equal cells. It is reported that PPAA could show early glaucomatous damage before it could be documented by the optic disc analysis.

### Photophobia in headache disorders: Characteristics and potential mechanisms [^116ha6Dy]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Photophobia is present in multiple types of headache disorders. The coexistence of photophobia and headache suggests potential reciprocal interactions between visual and pain pathways. In this review, we summarize the photophobic characteristics in different types of headache disorders in the context of three diagnostic categories:

- **Primary headaches**: Migraine, tension-type headache, and trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias.
- **Secondary headaches**: Headaches attributed to traumatic brain injury, meningitis, non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, and disorders of the eyes.
- **Painful cranial neuropathies**: Trigeminal neuralgia and painful optic neuritis.

We then discuss potential mechanisms for the coexistence of photophobia and headache. In conclusion, the characteristics of photophobia differ among these headache disorders. The coexistence of photophobia and headache is associated with interactions between the visual and pain pathways at the retina, midbrain, thalamus, hypothalamus, and visual cortex. Communication between these pathways may depend on calcitonin gene-related peptide and pituitary cyclase-activating polypeptide transmission. Moreover, cortical spreading depression, an upstream trigger of headache, also plays an important role in photophobia by increasing nociceptive input to the thalamus.

### Headache with aura: A case report of ocular melanoma [^114DQFLg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Headaches and visual complaints are common conditions encountered in the emergency department. While a patient's age, risk factors, and comorbidities often aid in risk stratification and guide emergency department evaluation, atypical presentations of serious disease may still occur in young, otherwise healthy patients. In this vignette, we discuss a case of ocular (choroidal) melanoma in a 21-year-old female patient who presented with photopsia and headaches.

- **Discussion**: Ocular melanoma is the most common non-skin melanoma and should be considered by the emergency physician for patients with visual deficits. Likely presentations and risk factors for ocular melanoma will be discussed, as well as emergency department and specialty management.

### A phase-by-phase review of migraine pathophysiology [^1142x3cz]. Headache (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on migraine:

- **Definition**: Migraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by moderate-to-severe headaches, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and/or sensitivity to light and sound.

- **Pathophysiology**: Migraine is due to a complex brain network disorder involving the cortex, hypothalamus, thalamus, and brainstem in genetically predisposed individuals.

- **Epidemiology**: The overall prevalence of migraine over a 3-month period in the US adult population is 15.3%, affecting approximately 20.7% of females and 9.7% of males. The global lifetime prevalence of migraines is estimated at 14%.

- **Disease course**: The complex interplay between the cortex, hypothalamus, thalamus, and brainstem involved in modulation of nociceptive signaling results in trigeminovascular system activation and a cortical-spreading depression-like event. This involves a slowly propagating wave of neuronal and glial cell depolarization and hyperpolarization, causing unilateral, pulsating, moderate to severe intensity headache with or without aura.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute migraine therapies (triptans, ergotamines, NSAIDs) are ineffective and account for over 50% recurrence of migraine. Approximately 2.2–3.1% of people with episodic migraine progress to chronic migraine at 1-year follow-up.
