## Question

Resolving sinus pressure pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about resolving sinus pressure pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical scenario and establishing the differential diagnosis. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria that separate viral, bacterial, and chronic rhinosinusitis from non-sinogenic causes like migraine. Next, I will examine first-line therapies for each category, including saline irrigation, intranasal corticosteroids, and analgesics, and I should double-check the strength of evidence. After that, I need to consider advanced options for refractory cases, including oral steroids, antibiotics when indicated, and surgery. Finally, I should address special populations, red flags, and a practical decision algorithm, while continuously checking for pitfalls and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and why "sinus pressure pain" is often misattributed. Many patients with facial pain or pressure are actually experiencing primary headache disorders, particularly migraine, rather than true rhinosinusitis; misdiagnosis rates of 50–80% are reported, and migraine frequently co-occurs with nasal symptoms, which can mislead clinicians and patients alike [^113CWCdx] [^113zc5qh]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify objective findings before labeling a case as sinus disease, because facial pain without purulent discharge or obstruction is insufficient for a rhinosinusitis diagnosis and should prompt consideration of neurologic etiologies [^11428qSm] [^111jPD58].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic criteria to anchor decisions. For acute rhinosinusitis, the cardinal symptom cluster is purulent nasal drainage with nasal obstruction and/or facial pain-pressure-fullness, with duration up to 4 weeks; viral disease is likely if symptoms are under 10 days and not worsening, whereas bacterial disease is suspected with persistence beyond 10 days or a "double-worsening" pattern, and facial pain alone without purulent discharge does not meet criteria [^11428qSm] [^111jPD58]. For chronic rhinosinusitis, I need to ensure at least 12 weeks of two or more symptoms (obstruction, discharge, facial pain/pressure, hyposmia) plus objective evidence on endoscopy or CT, recognizing that CRS with polyps and CRS without polyps have overlapping symptoms but different treatment implications [^116kSDDx] [^1114oiic]. Wait, let me verify the non-sinogenic predictors; female sex, no prior sinonasal surgery, low nasal symptom burden, and high ear/facial symptom burden increase the likelihood of non-rhinogenic facial pain, which should redirect care toward headache evaluation rather than sinus-directed therapy [^115AvSta].

> I will now examine first-line therapy for viral rhinosinusitis, since most cases are viral and self-limited. Supportive care with analgesics and saline irrigation is reasonable; topical intranasal steroids may offer modest symptomatic benefit, though evidence quality varies and benefits are modest, so shared decision-making is key [^114EDGH2] [^113tMAcp]. Hold on, I should verify the role of decongestants; topical oxymetazoline can be used short-term for congestion, but rebound is a concern beyond 3 days, and oral decongestants have limited benefit and measurable cardiovascular effects, so I need to counsel carefully and avoid chronic use [^116yhLrd] [^116hYLF3]. Let me reconsider antibiotics; they are not indicated for viral disease and should be avoided to prevent harm and resistance, reinforcing a watchful waiting approach when criteria for bacterial disease are not met [^116yhLrd].

> For acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, I should confirm that antibiotics are indicated when symptoms persist beyond 10 days or worsen after initial improvement, and then choose an agent with narrow coverage. Amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate remains first-line in most adults, with doxycycline as an alternative in penicillin allergy, and I should avoid unnecessary broad-spectrum agents or prolonged courses [^113CWCdx]. Wait, I initially thought a 10–14 day course was standard, but I should double-check; many contemporary guidelines endorse 5–7 days for uncomplicated ABRS, balancing efficacy and stewardship, so I will correct to a 5–7 day course unless there are complicating factors [^116kSDDx]. I need to ensure symptomatic relief is addressed in parallel with analgesics, saline irrigation, and optional intranasal steroids, and I should arrange follow-up to reassess at 3–5 days if not improving [^113aH3P7] [^112K1rtP].

> For chronic rhinosinusitis, I should confirm that saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids are foundational first-line therapy, with strong guideline support and favorable benefit–harm profiles, and I should tailor the steroid delivery to patient preference and anatomy, including sprays, drops, or irrigation-based delivery for better penetration [^111zmp8L] [^117NG9eu]. Let me verify the magnitude of benefit; meta-analytic data show meaningful improvements in facial pain/pressure and overall quality of life with both non-biologic and biologic therapies in CRS, underscoring that medical therapy is effective even in more severe phenotypes when appropriately selected [^1137Mrpe]. I should also consider budesonide added to saline irrigation, which has randomized trial support for incremental benefit over saline alone, though effect sizes vary and shared decision-making is prudent [^111NqCFk].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite optimized first-line therapy? I need to check for refractory disease and phenotype. In CRS with nasal polyps, short-course oral steroids can induce short-term improvement in symptom severity and polyp burden, but benefits wane and adverse effects limit repeated use, so I should reserve them for selected flares and coordinate close follow-up [^111qLLCe] [^116q2s18]. For difficult-to-treat CRSwNP, biologic therapy targeting type 2 inflammation is appropriate and has demonstrated reductions in facial pain/pressure and overall disease burden, aligning with contemporary guidelines and real-world data on disease control [^116UjouH] [^111MSEyg]. Hold on, I should verify that surgery is not first-line; endoscopic sinus surgery is reserved for patients who fail maximal medical therapy, with the best outcomes when combined with ongoing medical management and patient education about postoperative care and recurrence risk [^116kSDDx] [^114QnDt3].

> I should double-check the role of antibiotics in CRS, because many patients request them. Routine antibiotic use is not recommended for CRS without an acute bacterial exacerbation; evidence for chronic macrolide therapy is mixed and should be individualized, and topical or nebulized antibiotics are reserved for select post-surgical or refractory cases with culture-directed rationale, not for routine CRS management [^115NsxWK] [^113tS3An]. Let me verify that I am not overlooking a superimposed ABRS; if there is a sudden worsening with purulence and compatible symptoms, a short course of antibiotics may be reasonable, but otherwise I should avoid them to minimize harm and resistance [^115s1f84].

> Next, I should review non-sinogenic facial pain, because mislabeling migraine as "sinus headache" delays effective care. In patients with normal endoscopy and CT, empiric migraine-directed therapy, including triptans, can be both diagnostic and therapeutic, with response rates around 80% in carefully selected cohorts, supporting a neurologic rather than rhinologic etiology in many cases [^112KApzh]. I need to ensure I screen for migraine features and autonomic symptoms, and if present, initiate standard migraine prevention and acute treatment pathways rather than sinus-directed interventions [^115XRjBX].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In older adults, I should avoid first-generation antihistamines and use acetaminophen preferentially for analgesia when bleeding risk is a concern, and I should be cautious with NSAIDs and decongestants due to cardiovascular and renal effects, tailoring choices to comorbidities and medication interactions [^116yhLrd] [^117VZvpq]. In patients with barometric pressure exposure, such as air travel or diving, I should counsel on risk mitigation, including delaying travel if acutely congested and using short-term decongestants if absolutely necessary, given the risk of barotrauma with pressure differentials [^116ZkiY1]. For postoperative patients after ESS, I should confirm that nonopioid multimodal analgesia is preferred, with NSAIDs generally acceptable and opioids reserved for breakthrough pain, alongside structured irrigation and debridement protocols to optimize healing and reduce recurrence [^1138BguF] [^1125BZb6].

> I need to ensure I address red flags and complications. Severe unilateral pain with ophthalmoplegia, visual changes, or altered mental status suggests orbital or intracranial extension and mandates urgent imaging and specialty referral, as delays can lead to significant morbidity [^116kSDDx]. Persistent, severe facial pain with normal sinus imaging should trigger evaluation for alternative etiologies such as trigeminal neuralgia, temporomandibular joint disorders, or atypical migraines, preventing unnecessary sinus procedures [^116urdqX]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not anchoring on sinus disease when the clinical course is atypical; interdisciplinary care improves diagnostic accuracy and outcomes in complex facial pain presentations [^111zmp8L].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision pathway. If symptoms are under 10 days without worsening, manage as viral with analgesics, saline irrigation, and optional intranasal steroids, and avoid antibiotics; if symptoms persist beyond 10 days or worsen, evaluate for ABRS and treat with a 5–7 day course of appropriate antibiotics plus supportive care; if symptoms are chronic beyond 12 weeks, confirm CRS with objective findings and initiate saline irrigation and intranasal steroids, escalating to oral steroids, biologics, or surgery based on phenotype, severity, and response; and if objective sinus evaluation is normal, pivot to a headache evaluation and consider migraine-directed therapy, documenting response to guide ongoing care [^11428qSm] [^111zmp8L] [^112KApzh]. I should double-check that shared decision-making is emphasized at each step, aligning choices with patient values, comorbidities, and access to care, and I should arrange follow-up to reassess control and adjust therapy over time [^111zmp8L].

---

Sinus pressure pain is best managed with a **stepwise approach** that starts with saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids, adds analgesics as needed, and escalates to antibiotics only if bacterial infection is confirmed or strongly suspected. Most cases resolve with **conservative care**, but persistent or severe symptoms warrant ENT evaluation for possible surgery or alternative diagnoses like migraine [^111zmp8L] [^112bmBgQ]. Avoid **routine antibiotics** for viral or noninfectious cases, and use decongestants cautiously to prevent rebound congestion [^116yhLrd] [^112BBSUM].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis guides therapy; **differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and chronic rhinosinusitis** from non-sinogenic causes [^113CWCdx].

- **Acute viral rhinosinusitis (VRS)**: ≤ 4 weeks of cloudy nasal drainage with nasal obstruction, facial pain/pressure/fullness, or both; typically resolves in 10–14 days [^116yhLrd].

- **Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS)**: symptoms persist ≥ 10 days without improvement, or worsen after initial improvement ("double worsening") [^113CWCdx].

- **Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)**: ≥ 12 weeks of two or more symptoms (nasal obstruction, discharge, facial pain/pressure, hyposmia) with objective inflammation on endoscopy or CT [^116kSDDx].

- **Non-sinogenic causes**: migraine, tension headache, TMJ, dental disease, or other primary headaches; common when nasal symptoms are absent or minimal [^116urdqX] [^112bmBgQ].

---

## Conservative management

Most cases respond to **conservative measures**; reserve escalation for refractory symptoms.

---

### Saline nasal irrigation

Saline irrigation is **first-line** for both acute and chronic disease, improving mucociliary clearance and reducing symptom burden [^117NG9eu] [^114ouv7E]. Evidence supports daily large-volume (≥ 150 mL) hypertonic or isotonic saline for symptom relief and quality-of-life gains, with low adverse-effect risk [^116h2s3D] [^116yhLrd].

---

### Intranasal corticosteroids

Intranasal corticosteroids reduce mucosal inflammation and are **recommended for CRS** and as an option for symptomatic relief in acute disease [^111zmp8L] [^114EDGH2]. They improve nasal obstruction, discharge, and facial pain/pressure, with a modest effect size and favorable safety profile when used properly [^111GLs1U].

---

### Analgesics

Acetaminophen or NSAIDs relieve facial pain and headache; **use NSAIDs cautiously** in patients with bleeding risk or GI intolerance [^111nEyNa] [^117VZvpq].

---

### Hydration and humidification

Adequate hydration and humidified air help maintain mucosal moisture and reduce discomfort, though **evidence is indirect** [^111gze7S].

---

## Pharmacologic interventions

Use **targeted pharmacotherapy** based on etiology and severity.

---

### Decongestants

Short-term topical decongestants (e.g. oxymetazoline) can relieve nasal obstruction, but **limit use to ≤ 3 days** to avoid rebound congestion [^116yhLrd]. Oral decongestants (e.g. pseudoephedrine) may help some patients but can cause insomnia, hypertension, and nervousness; use cautiously, especially in older adults [^116hYLF3].

---

### Antihistamines

Antihistamines are **not routinely recommended** for non-allergic rhinosinusitis; they may thicken secretions and impair drainage. Consider only if allergic rhinitis is present [^116yhLrd].

---

### Mucolytics

Guaifenesin is sometimes used to thin secretions, but **evidence for symptom relief in rhinosinusitis is limited**; use selectively [^112uvt5n].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are **not indicated for viral rhinosinusitis** and should be reserved for confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial infection [^116yhLrd].

- **ABRS**: consider antibiotics if symptoms persist ≥ 10 days without improvement, worsen after initial improvement, or are severe (e.g. fever ≥ 39°C, severe pain). First-line options include amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate for 5–7 days [^113CWCdx] [^1139Rp1h].

- **CRS**: antibiotics are not first-line; reserve for acute bacterial exacerbations or specific phenotypes (e.g. cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency) [^115s1f84].

- **Adverse effects**: gastrointestinal upset, antibiotic resistance, and rare hypersensitivity; counsel patients accordingly [^115NsxWK].

---

## Surgical interventions

Reserve surgery for **refractory cases** or specific anatomic issues.

- **Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS)**: indicated for CRS unresponsive to maximal medical therapy, significant anatomic obstruction, or complications (e.g. orbital or intracranial extension) [^116kSDDx] [^112fdrUo].

- **Balloon sinuplasty**: minimally invasive option for select patients with localized ostial obstruction [^notfound].

- **Outcomes**: most patients experience significant symptom improvement, though recurrence is possible without ongoing medical management [^115ZHUvk] [^111MSEyg].

---

## Alternative and adjunctive therapies

Some patients benefit from **adjunctive measures**, though evidence varies.

- **Capsaicin nasal spray**: may reduce nasal congestion and pain in non-allergic rhinitis; consider in refractory cases [^115fonhi] [^112fzxGQ].

- **Acupuncture**: limited evidence suggests potential benefit for sinus-related pain; use selectively [^113vDxa1].

- **Probiotics**: insufficient evidence to recommend for rhinosinusitis symptom relief [^notfound].

---

## Lifestyle modifications and preventive measures

Preventive strategies reduce recurrence and symptom severity. Identify and avoid **allergens** and irritants (smoke, strong odors, pollutants) [^notfound]. Hand hygiene and avoiding close contact with ill individuals reduce **URI risk**. Maintain adequate hydration, sleep, and stress management to support **immune function**.

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Education improves adherence and outcomes; reinforce **correct use of irrigation, sprays, and decongestants**, and explain the risks of **unnecessary antibiotics** [^114QnDt3]. Arrange follow-up to track response, adjust therapy, and identify complications or alternative diagnoses [^112K1rtP].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Saline irrigation | All patients |
| 2 | Intranasal corticosteroids | CRS; option for acute symptoms |
| 3 | Analgesics | Pain control |
| 4 | Decongestants | Short-term use for obstruction |
| 5 | Antibiotics | Confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial infection |
| 6 | Surgery | Refractory CRS or complications |

---

Sinus pressure pain is **managed stepwise**, starting with saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids, adding analgesics, and reserving antibiotics for bacterial cases. Most patients improve with conservative care, but persistent or severe symptoms require ENT evaluation for surgery or alternative diagnoses.

### Novel devices for sinus headache [^113MmDfW]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Novel medical devices are emerging as low-risk treatment options for patients suffering from sinus headaches. Early trends for the treatment of sinus headaches using medical devices are following the more established primary headache literature. There are two categories of devices with early data supporting use, which may serve as useful adjuncts to conventional pharmacotherapy in the management of sinus headaches not caused by sinusitis: transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation and acoustic vibration with oscillating expiratory pressure. There is currently a paucity of high-level evidence and further studies are needed. Initial reports suggest these interventions are low risk, but longer follow-up is necessary.

### Comprehensive management of patients presenting to the otolaryngologist for sinus pressure, pain, or headache [^116L8NBE]. The Laryngoscope (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To study differential diagnosis and efficacy of management strategies in patients presenting to an otolaryngologist for sinus pressure, pain, or headache.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis at an academic medical center.

Methods

Patients were seen in the clinic (2010–2012) for sinus-related headache, pressure, pain or fullness (study symptoms) by a rhinologist. A retrospective chart review of patients with study symptoms was conducted.

Results

Of 211 patients with study symptoms, 70.62% met American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery criteria for sinusitis or had rhinologic disease. Otolaryngic therapy alone (medical or surgical) relieved study symptoms in 51.66%; combined neurology intervention helped another 15.17%. Nearly half of the patients (48.82%) were diagnosed with primary headache disorders. Comorbid rhinologic-neurologic disease was present in 27.96% and odontogenic disease in 7%. Initial otolaryngology referral was likely unnecessary for 36.49% of the study patients. Sinus computed tomography (CT) was available for 91% of 211 patients, and 80% of scans were positive. Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) was used in only 80/211 patients (37.69%) and was effective in 66/211 (31.28%). ESS was most successful in patients receiving concurrent neurological intervention. The Lund-Mackay CT score did not predict outcomes from ESS. Interdisciplinary otolaryngology-neurology efforts resulted in a positive outcome for 92.4% of patients.

Conclusions

We present the first series detailing management of patients with sinus-headache pain in an otolaryngology practice. Such symptoms have multifactorial etiologies. Positive sinus CT results require cautious interpretation. ESS should be judiciously used. Interdisciplinary care is critical for success: approximately 50% of patients benefited from otolaryngic management, 50% needed neurological treatment, and 7% required dental disease management.

### Update on the diagnostic considerations for neurogenic nasal and sinus symptoms: a current review suggests adding a possible diagnosis of migraine [^115XRjBX]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of rhinosinusitis (RS) is one of the leading reasons for prescriptions of antibiotics, although they often fail to provide symptomatic relief. Appropriately diagnosing and treating patients presenting with RS for whom antibiotic therapy has failed or who have normal CT findings is a controversial topic. One explanation is that what these patients are experiencing is misinformation from the trigeminal nerve and autonomic nervous system. Midfacial pain and pressure with rhinorrhea and nasal congestion do not represent an infectious, or even inflammatory, condition within the sinus or nasal cavities, but a mirage that is best treated as a migraine variant. Observations Although there is not enough research to definitively prove this alternate etiology, we are reaching a tipping point where the clinical implications, real-world experience, and evolving literature support this possible alternate etiology. Four key factors support a midfacial migraine that mimics RS: 1) Pathophysiology: current pathophysiology literature offers a model of how migraine attacks could replicate clinical presentations of RS; 2) Clinical presentation: patients with infectious RS and midfacial migraine have similar symptomatic presentation, similar demographics, but poorly correlated radiological information; 3) Diagnosis: clinical studies support the proposition that there are alternative diagnostic tools for distinguishing patients with midfacial migraine; and 4) Prognosis: Select RS patients show significant improvement with migraine treatment.

Conclusions

We encourage medical professionals to consider migraine disease as a form of sensory misinformation and as a possible etiology of RS complaints. Clinicians can ask validated questions to determine if possible migraine could be an underlying cause, and there are standard preventative treatments for migraine that could alleviate patient symptoms. Dysfunctional vasomotor activity may be the root of the disturbances, particularly when antibiotic therapy fails and CT findings are discordant with symptoms. Until there is a diagnostic test for migraine, clinicians need to question a patient's self-diagnosis of rhinosinusitis. More research is needed to definitively answer this important question.

### Sinogenic facial pain: diagnosis and management [^116urdqX]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Most patients who present to an otorhinolaryngology clinic with facial pain and headaches believe they have sinusitis. There is an increasing awareness that neurologic causes are responsible for a large proportion of patients with headache and facial pain. If facial pain and pressure is the primary symptom, it is unlikely to be caused by sinus disease in the absence of any nasal symptoms or signs. Patients with facial pain who have no objective evidence of sinus disease are unlikely to be helped by surgery. Most patients with pain caused by sinusitis respond to medical therapy.

### Sinus headache or migraine? Considerations in making a differential diagnosis [^113zc5qh]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Sinus headache is commonly diagnosed, and patients with headache often cite sinus pain and pressure as a cause of their headaches. A high frequency of diagnosis of sinus headache, which specialists consider to be relatively rare, among patients meeting International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria for migraine raises the possibility that migraine and perhaps other headache types are sometimes mistaken for sinus headache. This article considers clinical, epidemiologic, and pathophysiologic relationships between sinus headache and migraine and discusses the implications for clinical management of headache. Both historic and new data show that nasal symptoms frequently accompany migraine, although these symptoms are not part of the IHS diagnostic criteria for migraine. Parasympathetic activation, as well as the hypothesized mechanism of neurogenic or immunogenic switching (i.e., crossover interactions of neurogenic and immunogenic inflammation), may account for both the frequent occurrence of nasal symptoms in migraine and the possibility that sinus inflammation can sometimes act as a migraine trigger. Considered in aggregate, the data show that the occurrence of nasal symptoms associated with a headache should neither trigger a diagnosis of sinus disease nor exclude a diagnosis of migraine. It should, in fact, prompt diagnostic consideration of both conditions.

### Medical management of headache and facial pain in CRS: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1137Mrpe]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aims to characterize the effect of medical therapy on headache and facial pain/pressure among patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

Data Sources

CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus.

Methods

CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus were searched from inception through April 10th, 2024, for English language articles reporting headache or facial pain/pressure outcomes in CRS patients. Inclusion was restricted to studies reporting results of the medical treatment of CRS in nonsurgical cohorts. Primary outcome measures included the sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT) and the visual analogue scale (VAS). Meta-analyses of continuous measures (mean), mean difference (Δ), and proportions (%) were conducted.

Results

The initial search yielded 2429 unique articles. After a full-text review of 272 articles, 17 studies reporting outcomes for 2269 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The mean patient age was 48.6years (range 18.0–86.0; 95% CI: 46.5 to 50.6), among which 55.4% (95% CI: 51.5 to 59.4) were male and 82.9% (95% CI: 68.8 to 93.4) had nasal polyposis. SNOT facial pain/pressure scores improved by 1.1 points (95% CI: -1.7 to -0.5; relative reduction 40.4%) with non-biologic therapies and 1.0 point (95% CI: -1.4 to -0.6; relative reduction 54.6%) with biologic therapies. On an 11-point scale, VAS headaches scores improved by 1.8units (95% CI: -3.3 to -0.3; 42.1% relative reduction) in CRSwNP patients and 1.0 unit (95% CI: -1.7 to -0.3; 54.0% relative reduction) in CRSsNP patients.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest medical therapy significantly reduces facial pain and pressure in the CRS population. Laryngoscope, 134:4458–4465, 2024.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^113CWCdx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — Statement 1a (differential diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis) states that clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions. A clinician should diagnose ABRS when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis (purulent nasal drainage accompanied by nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both) persist without evidence of improvement for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). This is a strong recommendation based on diagnostic studies with minor limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile notes a quality improvement opportunity to avoid inappropriate use of antibiotics for presumed viral infections, aggregate evidence quality Grade B and Level of Confidence in Evidence Medium, a benefits-harm assessment of preponderance of benefit over harm, and harms including the risk of misclassifying acute bacterial rhinosinusitis as viral, or vice-versa, with intentional vagueness and role of patient preferences listed as none.

### Perioperative analgesia for sinus and skull-base surgery [^113s9HkQ]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Perioperative analgesic management is multifaceted, and an individualized approach should be taken with each patient. Preoperative discussion of the plan for pain control and the patient's postoperative expectations is a necessary facet for optimal outcomes of analgesia. There is the potential for significant abuse and development of dependence on opioids. Nonopioids, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, and gabapentinoids, provide reliable alternatives for analgesic management following sinus and skull-base surgery. There is a paucity of literature regarding perioperative pain regimens for sinus and skull-base surgery, and the authors hope that this review serves as a valuable tool for otolaryngologists.

### Systemic and topical antibiotics for chronic rhinosinusitis [^115NsxWK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one of six looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterised by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Systemic and topical antibiotics are used with the aim of eliminating infection in the short term (and some to reduce inflammation in the long term), in order to normalise nasal mucus and improve symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics in people with chronic rhinosinusitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL (2015, Issue 8); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 29 September 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing systemic or topical antibiotic treatment to (a) placebo or (b) no treatment or (c) other pharmacological interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity and the commonest adverse event - gastrointestinal disturbance. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of suspected allergic reaction (rash or skin irritation) and anaphylaxis or other very serious reactions. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included five RCTs (293 participants), all of which compared systemic antibiotics with placebo or another pharmacological intervention. The varying study characteristics made comparison difficult. Four studies recruited only adults and one only children. Three used macrolide, one tetracycline and one a cephalosporin-type antibiotic. Three recruited only patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, one recruited patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and one had a mixed population. Three followed up patients for 10 to 12 weeks after treatment had finished. Systemic antibiotics versus placebo Three studies compared antibiotics with placebo (176 participants). One study (64 participants, without polyps) reported disease-specific HRQL using the SNOT-20 (0 to 5, 0 = best quality of life). At the end of treatment (three months) the SNOT-20 score was lower in the group receiving macrolide antibiotics than the placebo group (mean difference (MD) -0.54 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.98 to -0.10), corresponding to a moderate effect size favouring antibiotics (moderate quality evidence). Three months after treatment, it is uncertain if there was a difference between groups. One study (33 participants, with polyps) provided information on gastrointestinal disturbances and suspected allergic reaction (rash or skin irritation) after a short course of tetracycline antibiotic compared with placebo. We are very uncertain if antibiotics were associated with an increase in gastrointestinal disturbances (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% CI 0.22 to 8.50) or skin irritation (RR 6.67, 95% CI 0.34 to 128.86) (very low quality evidence). Systemic antibiotics plus saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo plus saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids One study (60 participants, some with and some without polyps) compared a three-month course of macrolide antibiotic with placebo; all participants also used saline irrigation and 70% used intranasal corticosteroids. Disease-specific HRQL was reported using SNOT-22 (0 to 110, 0 = best quality of life). Data were difficult to interpret (highly skewed and baseline imbalances) and it is unclear if there was an important difference at any time point (low quality evidence). To assess patient-reported disease severity participants rated the effect of treatment on a five-point scale (-2 for "desperately worse" to 2 for "cured") at the end of treatment (three months). For improvement in symptoms there was no difference between the antibiotics and placebo groups; the RR was 1.50 (95% CI 0.81 to 2.79; very low quality evidence), although there were also slightly more people who felt worse after treatment in the antibiotics group. There was no demonstrable difference in the rate of gastrointestinal disturbances between the groups (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.16 to 7.10). General HRQL was measured using the SF-36. The authors stated that there was no difference between groups at the end of treatment (12 weeks) or two weeks later. Systemic antibiotics versus intranasal corticosteroids One study (43 participants, without polyps) compared a three-month course of macrolide antibiotic with intranasal corticosteroids. Patient-reported disease severity was assessed using a composite symptom score (0 to 40; 0 = no symptoms). It is very uncertain if there was a difference as patient-reported disease severity was similar between groups (MD -0.32, 95% CI -2.11 to 1.47; low quality evidence). Systemic antibiotics versus oral corticosteroids One study (28 participants, with polyps) compared a short course of tetracycline antibiotic (unclear duration, ˜20 days) with a 20-day course of oral corticosteroids. We were unable to extract data on any of the primary efficacy outcomes. It is uncertain if there was a difference ingastrointestinal disturbances (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.16 to 6.14) or skin irritation (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 19.62) as the results for these outcomes were similar between groups (very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found very little evidence that systemic antibiotics are effective in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. We did find moderate quality evidence of a modest improvement in disease-specific quality of life in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps receiving three months of a macrolide antibiotic. The size of improvement was moderate (0.5 points on a five-point scale) and only seen at the end of the three-month treatment; by three months later no difference was found. Despite a general understanding that antibiotics can be associated with adverse effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances, the results in this review were very uncertain because the studies were small and few events were reported. No RCTs of topical antibiotics met the inclusion criteria. More research in this area, particularly evaluating longer-term outcomes and adverse effects, is required.

### Saline irrigation for chronic rhinosinusitis [^116h2s3D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one of six looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterised by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Nasal saline irrigation is commonly used to improve patient symptoms.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of saline irrigation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 30 October 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing saline delivered to the nose by any means (douche, irrigation, drops, spray or nebuliser) with (a) placebo, (b) no treatment or (c) other pharmacological interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity and the commonest adverse event - epistaxis. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of local irritation and discomfort. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included two RCTs (116 adult participants). One compared large-volume (150 ml) hypertonic (2%) saline irrigation with usual treatment over a six-month period; the other compared 5 mL nebulised saline twice a day with intranasal corticosteroids, treating participants for three months and evaluating them on completion of treatment and three months later. Large-volume, hypertonic nasal saline versus usual care One trial included 76 adult participants (52 intervention, 24 control) with or without polyps. Disease-specific HRQL was reported using the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index (RSDI; 0 to 100, 100 = best quality of life). At the end of three months of treatment, patients in the saline group were better than those in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) 6.3 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 11.71) and at six months there was a greater effect (MD 13.5 points, 95% CI 9.63 to 17.37). We assessed the evidence to be of low quality for the three months follow-up and very low quality for the six months follow-up. Patient-reported disease severity was evaluated using a "single-item sinus symptom severity assessment" but the range of scores is not stated, making it impossible for us to determine the meaning of the data presented. No adverse effects data were collected in the control group but 23% of participants in the saline group experienced side effects including epistaxis. General HRQL was measured using SF-12 (0 to 100, 100 = best quality of life). No difference was found after three months of treatment (low quality evidence) but at six months there was a small difference favouring the saline group, which may not be of clinical significance and has high uncertainty (MD 10.5 points, 95% CI 0.66 to 20.34) (very low quality evidence). Low-volume, nebulised saline versus intranasal corticosteroids One trial included 40 adult participants with polyps. Our primary outcome of disease-specific HRQL was not reported. At the end of treatment (three months) the patients who had intranasal corticosteroids had less severe symptoms (MD -13.50, 95% CI -14.44 to -12.56); this corresponds to a large effect size. We assessed the evidence to be of very low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

The two studies were very different in terms of included populations, interventions and comparisons and so it is therefore difficult to draw conclusions for practice. The evidence suggests that there is no benefit of a low-volume (5 ml) nebulised saline spray over intranasal steroids. There is some benefit of daily, large-volume (150 ml) saline irrigation with a hypertonic solution when compared with placebo, but the quality of the evidence is low for three months and very low for six months of treatment.

### Rhinogenic and sinus headache-literature review [^112bmBgQ]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Headache is a common, yet challenging symptom to evaluate given its wide range of clinical presentations and different etiologies. For centuries, conceptual understanding of headache causation has been attributed to anatomic abnormalities of the nose and paranasal sinuses.

Methods

Structured literature review.

Results

The number of cases, categorized as migraines or other primary headaches, misdiagnosed as a "sinus headache" is high in the literature, ranging from 50 to 80%. The potential mechanisms for rhinogenic headaches were classically described as pain secondary to prolonged mucosal contact points, hypoxia in the paranasal sinuses secondary to poor ventilation, or pressure caused by the growth of nasal polyps. Additionally, other mechanisms were described and are still being studied. Corrective surgery for mucosal contact points in the nasal cavity is deemed necessary for relieving the headache, although patient outcomes are variable.

Conclusion

Delay in proper diagnosis and treatment negatively impact patient quality of life. Most cases of "sinus headache" or "rhinogenic headache" seen in clinical practice are in fact misdiagnosed as either primary headaches or migraines. Because of increased misdiagnoses, Otolaryngologists should establish a direct and precise diagnosis congruent with a chief complaint being a headache. Vital information such as a good clinical history, well-performed nasal endoscopy, and occasional CT scan may decrease misdiagnosis probability.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115hCaj7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Table 5 — Patient information sheet on diagnosis of acute sinusitis — defines key diagnostic features and distinguishes viral from bacterial illness for adults. Sinusitis, also called rhinosinusitis, affects about 1 in 8 adults annually. Acute sinusitis is present with up to 4 weeks of cloudy or colored nasal drainage plus one or both of the following: a stuffy, congested, or blocked nose, and pain, pressure or fullness in the face, head, or around the eyes. Acute viral sinusitis is likely if illness has been present less than 10 days without worsening, whereas acute bacterial sinusitis is likely when there is no improvement within 10 days of getting sick or when symptoms worsen within 10 days after beginning to get better. Because treatment differs by cause, acute viral sinusitis does not benefit from antibiotics, but some patients with acute bacterial sinusitis may get better faster with an antibiotic.

### Treatment of sinus headache as migraine: the diagnostic utility of triptans [^112KApzh]. The Laryngoscope (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the response rate to triptans in alleviating "sinus headache" in patients with endoscopy- and computed tomography (CT)-negative sinus examinations.

Study Design

Prospective clinical trial.

Methods

Patients who presented to a tertiary care center Otolaryngology Department with primary complaints of facial pain, pressure, or headache localized over the area of the sinuses, and a self- or physician-diagnosis of "sinus headache" were enrolled. Patients underwent directed history, physical examination, rigid nasal endoscopy, a sinus CT scan, and completed a headache questionnaire. Those patients that had negative findings were treated empirically with triptans. Patients completed a headache diary for each headache, using a visual analogue scale to rate the headache before and after triptan use. Response was considered as significant improvement (greater than 50% reduction of pain), partial (25–50% reduction), and no response.

Results

Fifty-four patients were enrolled. Thirty-eight (69%) completed follow-up, 63% were women. The mean age was 41 years (23–70). Thirty-one patients (82%) had significant reduction of headache pain with triptan use. Thirty-five patients (92%) had a significant reduction in headache pain in response to migraine-directed therapy. Seventeen patients (31%) withdrew or failed to follow-up, often reluctant to accept a diagnosis of migraine.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated that the demographics of patients with self-described "sinus headaches" who did not have findings of sinusitis on endoscopy and CT scan closely reflected the demographics of patients afflicted with migraines. It also showed that 82% of these patients had a significant response to empiric treatment for sinus headaches with triptans. These findings support that "sinus headaches" may represent migraines, and response to triptans may aid in diagnosis.

### Adult rhinosinusitis: diagnosis and management… [^111gze7S]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

The general goals of therapy for patients with bacterial rhinosinusitis are to control infection, diminish tissue edema and reverse sinus ostial obstruction so the mucopus can drain. 1, 10, 17, 19–21 Maintaining patient hydration by adequate oral fluid intake, supplemented by the use of saline nasal sprays as desired, is recommended. Although study results are only suggestive, some studies 8, 17, 19, 20 used a mucolytic, and most favored the use of an oral decongestant, for patients with severe nasal/sinus obstruction. This can be supplemented with the addition of a topical decongestant for three to five days. Oral antibiotics are recommended for seven to 14 days in patients with acute, recurrent acute or subacute bacterial rhinosinusitis 1, 2, 10, 17, 22.

The federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality recently analyzed the world's literature and concluded that amoxicillin or folate inhibitors are appropriate choices as initial therapy in an otherwise healthy adult population with uncomplicated, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. Some experts favor a short course of oral steroid therapy in patients with acute rhinosinusitis to diminish tissue edema around the sinus ostia and to provide symptomatic relief. 1, 2, 10 This is controversial, given the potential for immunosuppression prolonging the underlying disease process.

Topical steroids are commonly used in symptomatic patients with subacute or chronic rhinosinusitis and who have or are suspected of having inhalant sensitivities; however, these preparations are relatively ineffective in patients with acute rhinosinusitis because they poorly penetrate the associated rhinorrhea. Oral antihistamines have not been documented to exhibit a positive effect in patients with rhinosinusitis and are usually avoided because of the concern that the mucous thickening effects of all but the latest generation of antihistamines could impede mucopus drainage from the sinuses. At least 93 percent of patients who develop chronic bacterial suprainfection from a bout of influenza and who have no other predisposing factors for sinus disease achieve alleviation of symptoms with a single surgical intervention.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^111nEyNa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Supporting text — analgesic therapy for ABRS: none of these products have been specifically approved by the FDA for use in acute rhinosinusitis (as of March 2024). Facial pain is a cardinal symptom for diagnosing ABRS, and over-the-counter analgesics, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen, are usually sufficient to relieve facial pain associated with ABRS, but their use may be cautioned in older adults.

### Intranasal steroids versus placebo or no intervention for chronic rhinosinusitis [^111GLs1U]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one of six looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterised by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses leading to nasal blockage, rhinorrhoea, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. The use of topical (intranasal) corticosteroids has been widely advocated for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis given the belief that inflammation is a major component of this condition.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intranasal corticosteroids in people with chronic rhinosinusitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 8); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 11 August 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing intranasal corticosteroids (e.g. beclomethasone dipropionate, triamcinolone acetonide, flunisolide, budesonide) against placebo or no treatment in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity and the commonest adverse event - epistaxis. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of local irritation or other systemic adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included 18 RCTs with a total of 2738 participants. Fourteen studies had participants with nasal polyps and four studies had participants without nasal polyps. Only one study was conducted in children. Intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo or no intervention Only one study (20 adult participants without polyps) measured our primary outcome disease-specific HRQL using the Rhinosinusitis Outcome Measures-31 (RSOM-31). They reported no significant difference (numerical data not available) (very low quality evidence). Our second primary outcome, disease severity, was measured using the Chronic Sinusitis Survey in a second study (134 participants without polyps), which found no important difference (mean difference (MD) 2.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.02 to 10.70; scale 0 to 100). Another study (chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps) reported an increased chance of improvement in the intranasal corticosteroids group (RR 2.78, 95% CI 1.76 to 4.40; 109 participants). The quality of the evidence was low. Six studies provided data on at least two of the individual symptoms used in the EPOS 2012 criteria to define chronic rhinosinusitis (nasal blockage, rhinorrhoea, loss of sense of smell and facial pain/pressure). When all four symptoms in the EPOS criteria were available on a scale of 0 to 3 (higher = more severe symptoms), the average MD in change from baseline was -0.26 (95% CI -0.37 to -0.15; 243 participants; two studies; low quality evidence). Although there were more studies and participants when only nasal blockage and rhinorrhoea were considered (MD -0.31, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.24; 1702 participants; six studies), the MD was almost identical to when loss of sense of smell was also considered (1345 participants, four studies; moderate quality evidence). When considering the results for the individual symptoms, benefit was shown in the intranasal corticosteroids group. The effect size was larger for nasal blockage (MD -0.40, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.29; 1702 participants; six studies) than for rhinorrhoea (MD -0.25, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.17; 1702 participants; six studies) or loss of sense of smell (MD -0.19, 95% CI -0.28 to -0.11; 1345 participants; four studies). There was heterogeneity in the analysis for facial pain/pressure (MD -0.27, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.02; 243 participants; two studies). The quality of the evidence was moderate for nasal blockage, rhinorrhoea and loss of sense of smell, but low for facial pain/pressure. There was an increased risk of epistaxis with intranasal corticosteroids (risk ratio (RR) 2.74, 95% CI 1.88 to 4.00; 2508 participants; 13 studies; high quality evidence). Considering our secondary outcome, general HRQL, one study (134 participants without polyps) measured this using the SF-36 and reported a statistically significant benefit only on the general health subscale. The quality of the evidence was very low. It is unclear whether there is a difference in the risk of local irritation (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.64; 2124 participants; 11 studies) (low quality evidence). None of the studies treated or followed up patients long enough to provide meaningful data on the risk of osteoporosis or stunted growth (children). Other comparisons We identified no other studies that compared intranasal corticosteroids plus co-intervention A versus placebo plus co-intervention A.

Authors' Conclusions

Most of the evidence available was from studies in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. There is little information about quality of life (very low quality evidence). For disease severity, there seems to be improvement for all symptoms (low quality evidence), a moderate-sized benefit for nasal blockage and a small benefit for rhinorrhoea (moderate quality evidence). The risk of epistaxis is increased (high quality evidence), but these data included all levels of severity; small streaks of blood may not be a major concern for patients. It is unclear whether there is a difference in the risk of local irritation (low quality evidence).

### Different types of intranasal steroids for chronic rhinosinusitis [^111hi4hx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one of six looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterised by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Topical (intranasal) corticosteroids are used with the aim of reducing inflammation in the sinonasal mucosa in order to improve patient symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different types of intranasal steroids in people with chronic rhinosinusitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 7); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 11 August 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing first-generation intranasal corticosteroids (e.g. beclomethasone dipropionate, triamcinolone acetonide, flunisolide, budesonide) with second-generation intranasal corticosteroids (e.g. ciclesonide, fluticasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate, betamethasone sodium phosphate), or sprays versus drops, or low-dose versus high-dose intranasal corticosteroids.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity and the commonest adverse event - epistaxis (nosebleed). Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse event of local irritation. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included nine RCTs (911 participants), including four different comparisons. None of the studies evaluated our first primary outcome measure, disease-specific HRQL. Fluticasone propionate versus beclomethasone dipropionate We identified two small studies (56 participants with polyps) that evaluated disease severity and looked at the primary adverse effect: epistaxis, but no other outcomes. We cannot report any numerical data but the study authors reported no difference between the two steroids. The evidence was of very low quality. Fluticasone propionate versus mometasone furoate We identified only one study (100 participants with polyps) that evaluated disease severity (nasal symptoms scores), which reported no difference (no numerical data available). The evidence was of very low quality. High-dose versus low-dose steroidsWe included five studies (663 participants with nasal polyps), three using mometasone furoate (400 µg versus 200 µg in adults and older children, 200 µg versus 100 µg in younger children) and two using fluticasone propionate drops (800 µg versus 400 µg). We found low quality evidence relating to disease severity and nasal polyps size, with results from the high-dose and low-dose groups being similar. Although all studies reported more improvement in polyp score in the high-dose group, the significance of this is unclear due to the small size of the improvements. The primary adverse effect, epistaxis, was more common when higher doses were used (risk ratio (RR) 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20 to 3.54, 637 participants, moderate quality evidence). Most of the studies that contributed data to this outcome used a broad definition of epistaxis, which ranged from frank bleeding to bloody nasal discharge to flecks of blood in the mucus. Aqueous nasal spray versus aerosol spray We identified only one poorly reported study (unclear number of participants for comparison of interest, 91 between three treatment arms), in which there were significant baseline differences between the participants in the two groups. We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the data.

Authors' Conclusions

We found insufficient evidence to suggest that one type of intranasal steroid is more effective than another in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, nor that the effectiveness of a spray differs from an aerosol. We identified no studies that compared drops with spray. It is unclear if higher doses result in better symptom improvements (low quality evidence), but there was moderate quality evidence of an increased risk of epistaxis as an adverse effect of treatment when higher doses were used. This included all levels of severity of epistaxis and it is likely that the proportion of events that required patients to discontinue usage is low due to the low numbers of withdrawals attributed to it. If epistaxis is limited to streaks of blood in the mucus it may be tolerated by the patient and it may be safe to continue treatment. However, it may be a factor that affects compliance. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that the different types of corticosteroid molecule or spray versus aerosol have different effects. Lower doses have similar effectiveness but fewer side effects. Clearly more research in this area is needed, with specific attention given to trial design, disease-specific health-related quality of life outcomes and evaluation of longer-term outcomes and adverse effects.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis [^115s1f84]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis is an inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses that occurs in 1% to 5% of the U.S.

Population

It may significantly decrease quality of life. Chronic rhinosinusitis is defined by the presence of at least two out of four cardinal symptoms (i.e., facial pain/pressure, hyposmia/anosmia, nasal drainage, and nasal obstruction) for at least 12 consecutive weeks, in addition to objective evidence. Objective evidence of chronic rhinosinusitis may be obtained on physical examination (anterior rhinoscopy, endoscopy) or radiography, preferably from sinus computed tomography. Treatment is directed at enhancing mucociliary clearance, improving sinus drainage/outflow, eradicating local infection and inflammation, and improving access for topical medications. First-line treatment is nasal saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroid sprays. There may be a role for antibiotics in patients with evidence of an active, superimposed acute sinus infection. If medical management fails, endoscopic sinus surgery may be effective. Patients not responding to first-line medical therapy should be referred to an otolaryngologist, and selected patients with a history suggestive of other comorbidities (e.g., vasculitides, granulomatous diseases, cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency) may also benefit from referral to an allergist or pulmonologist.

### Short-course oral steroids as an adjunct therapy for chronic rhinosinusitis [^116q2s18]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one of a suite of six Cochrane reviews looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common condition involving inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses. It is characterised by nasal blockage and nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Oral corticosteroids are used to control the inflammatory response and improve symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a short course of oral corticosteroids as an adjunct ('add-on') therapy in people with chronic rhinosinusitis who are already on standard treatments.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 7); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 11 August 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a short course (up to 21 days) of oral corticosteroids to placebo or no treatment, where all patients were also receiving pharmacological treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity, and the adverse event of mood or behavioural disturbances. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score, and the adverse events of insomnia, gastrointestinal disturbances and osteoporosis. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

Two trials with a total of 78 participants met the inclusion criteria. Both the populations and the 'standard' treatments differed in the two studies. Oral steroids as an adjunct to intranasal corticosteroids One trial in adults with nasal polyps included 30 participants. All participants used intranasal corticosteroids and were randomised to either short-course oral steroids (oral methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg and reduced progressively over a 21-day treatment course) or no additional treatment. None of the primary outcome measures of interest in this review were reported by the study. There may have been an important reduction in the size of the polyps (measured by the nasal polyps score, a secondary outcome measure) in patients receiving oral steroids and intranasal corticosteroids, compared to intranasal corticosteroids alone (mean difference (MD) -0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.87 to -0.05; 30 participants; scale 1 to 4) at the end of treatment (21 days). This corresponds to a large effect size, but we are very uncertain about this estimate as we judged the study to be at high risk of bias. Moreover, longer-term data were not available and the other outcomes of interest were not reported. Oral steroids as an adjunct to antibiotics One trial in children (mean age of eight years) without nasal polyps included 48 participants. The trial compared oral corticosteroids (oral methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg and reduced progressively over a 15-day treatment course) with placebo in participants who also received a 30-day course of antibiotics. This study addressed one of the primary outcome measures (disease severity) and one secondary outcome (CT score). For disease severity the four key symptoms used to define chronic rhinosinusitis in children (nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure, cough) were combined into one score. There was a greater improvement in symptom severity 30 days after the start of treatment in patients who received oral steroids and antibiotics compared with placebo and antibiotics (MD -7.10, 95% CI -9.59 to -4.61; 45 participants; scale 0 to 40). The observed mean difference corresponds to a large effect size. At the same time point there was a difference in CT scan score (MD -2.90, 95% CI -4.91 to -0.89; 45 participants; scale 0 to 24). We assessed the quality of the evidence to be low. There were no data available for the longer term (three months).

Authors' Conclusions

There might be an improvement in symptom severity, polyps size and condition of the sinuses when assessed using CT scans in patients taking oral corticosteroids when these are used as an adjunct therapy to antibiotics or intranasal corticosteroids, but the quality of the evidence supporting this is low or very low (we are uncertain about the effect estimate; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect). It is unclear whether the benefits of oral corticosteroids as an adjunct therapy are sustained beyond the short follow-up period reported (up to 30 days), as no longer-term data were available. There were no data in this review about the adverse effects associated with short courses of oral corticosteroids as an adjunct therapy. More research in this area, particularly research evaluating longer-term outcomes and adverse effects, is required.

### Short-course oral steroids alone for chronic rhinosinusitis [^111qLLCe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one of a suite of six Cochrane reviews looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common condition involving inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses. It is characterised by nasal blockage and nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Oral corticosteroids are used to control the inflammatory response and improve symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral corticosteroids compared with placebo/no intervention or other pharmacological interventions (intranasal corticosteroids, antibiotics, antifungals) for chronic rhinosinusitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 7); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 11 August 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a short course (up to 21 days) of oral corticosteroids with placebo or no treatment or compared with other pharmacological interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity, and the adverse event of mood or behavioural disturbances. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of insomnia, gastrointestinal disturbances and osteoporosis. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs (474 randomised participants), which compared oral corticosteroids with placebo or no intervention. All trials only recruited adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. All trials reported outcomes at two to three weeks, at the end of the short-course oral steroid treatment period. Three trials additionally reported outcomes at three to six months. Two of these studies prescribed intranasal steroids to patients in both arms of the trial at the end of the oral steroid treatment period. Oral steroids versus placebo or no intervention Disease-specific health-related quality of life was reported by one study. This study reported improved quality of life after treatment (two to three weeks) in the group receiving oral steroids compared with the group who received placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.92 to -0.56, 40 participants, modified RSOM-31), which corresponds to a large effect size. We assessed the evidence to be low quality (we are uncertain about the effect estimate; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect). Disease severity as measured by patient-reported symptom scores was reported by two studies, which allowed the four key symptoms used to define chronic rhinosinusitis (nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure, hyposmia) to be combined into one score. The results at the end of treatment (two to three weeks) showed an improvement in patients receiving oral steroids compared to placebo, both when presented as a mean final value (SMD -2.84, 95% CI -4.09 to -1.59, 22 participants) and as a change from baseline (SMD -2.28, 95% CI -2.76 to -1.80, 114 participants). These correspond to large effect sizes but we assessed the evidence to be low quality. One study (114 participants) followed patients for 10 weeks after the two-week treatment period. All patients in both arms received intranasal steroids at the end of the oral steroid treatment period. The results showed that the initial results after treatment were not sustained (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.15, 114 participants, percentage improvement from baseline). This corresponds to a small effect size and we assessed the evidence to be low quality. There was an increase in adverse events in people receiving orals steroids compared with placebo for gastrointestinal disturbances (risk ratio (RR) 3.45, 95% CI 1.11 to 10.78; 187 participants; three studies) and insomnia (RR 3.63, 95% CI 1.10 to 11.95; 187 participants; three studies). There was no significant impact of oral steroids on mood disturbances at the dosage used in the included study (risk ratio (RR) 2.50, 95% CI 0.55 to 11.41; 40 participants; one study). We assessed the evidence to be low quality due to the lack of definitions of the adverse events and the small number of events or sample size, or both). Other comparisons No studies that compared short-course oral steroids with other treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis met the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

At the end of the treatment course (two to three weeks) there is an improvement in health-related quality of life and symptom severity in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps taking oral corticosteroids compared with placebo or no treatment. The quality of the evidence supporting this finding is low. At three to six months after the end of the oral steroid treatment period, there is little or no improvement in health-related quality of life or symptom severity for patients taking an initial course of oral steroids compared with placebo or no treatment. The data on the adverse effects associated with short courses of oral corticosteroids indicate that there may be an increase in insomnia and gastrointestinal disturbances but it is not clear whether there is an increase in mood disturbances. All of the adverse events results are based on low quality evidence. More research in this area, particularly research evaluating patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, longer-term outcomes and adverse effects, is required. There is no evidence for oral steroids compared with other treatments.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^11428qSm]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) — clinical diagnosis requires duration and symptom pattern: ARS is a clinical diagnosis made when a patient presents with more than 10 days and up to 4 weeks of a combination of 3 cardinal symptoms: purulent (not clear) nasal drainage accompanied by nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both. Nasal obstruction without purulent nasal drainage is inconsistent with ARS, and similarly facial pain without purulent nasal drainage is inconsistent with ARS; the rationale for these 3 cardinal symptoms includes considering persistence for 10 days or longer or symptoms worsening after 5 days.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^111jPD58]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) definitions — diagnostic thresholds and subtypes are specified as follows: ARS involves up to 4 weeks of purulent nasal drainage with nasal obstruction, facial pain–pressure–fullness, or both, with discharge described as cloudy or colored and typical features of obstruction and facial pain detailed. A clinician should diagnose viral rhinosinusitis (VRS) when symptoms or signs are present less than 10 days and are not worsening. A clinician should diagnose acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) when symptoms or signs fail to improve within 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). Facial pain–pressure–fullness without purulent nasal discharge is insufficient to establish ARS.

### A randomized, double-blind, parallel trial comparing capsaicin nasal spray with placebo in subjects with a significant component of nonallergic rhinitis [^115fonhi]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of ICX72 or Sinus Buster, a proprietary homeopathic preparation of Capsicum annum and Eucalyptol, versus placebo administered continuously over 2 weeks in subjects with a significant component of nonallergic rhinitis (NAR).

Methods

Forty-two consented subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized to ICX72 (n = 20) or control (n = 22) administered twice daily over 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in total nasal symptom scores (TNSS) from baseline to end of study. Secondary endpoints included changes in individual symptom scores (ISS) over 2 weeks and average time to first relief. Mean TNSS and ISS were recorded after single dosing at different intervals over 60 minutes. Rhinitis quality-of-life, rescue medication, and safety endpoints were analyzed.

Results

ICX72 versus placebo subjects exhibited significant differences in changes from baseline to end of study for TNSS and each ISS (P < .01), had an average time to first relief of 52.6 seconds (P < .01), and improvement in nasal congestion, sinus pain, sinus pressure, and headache at 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes, persisting at 60 minutes for nasal congestion and sinus pain (P < .05). No difference between groups in adverse events or rescue medication was observed. ICX72 versus placebo subjects experienced no rebound congestion or impaired olfaction at the end of the study.

Conclusion

This is the first controlled trial demonstrating intranasal capsaicin, when used continuously over 2 weeks, rapidly and safely improves symptoms in rhinitis subjects with a significant NAR component.

### The joint task force on practice parameters GRADE guidelines for the medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis [^116UjouH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) — definition, burden, comorbidity, and guideline methodology — is characterized as an inflammatory disease of the nasal mucosa and sinuses that lasts at least 12 weeks and affects about 2% to 4% of people with symptoms such as smell loss, nasal obstruction, thick nasal drainage, and facial pressure; some patients also have comorbid asthma and develop acute respiratory reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and this clinical triad is classified as aspirin (or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug)-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). CRSwNP is important because it negatively impacts quality of life. These guidelines are based on updated and original systematic reviews of evidence conducted and reported separately, and the panel followed best practices for guideline development and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty in the evidence and formulate recommendations.

Barotrauma during air travel — barotrauma can occur when pressure inside an air‑filled, enclosed body space is not the same as the air pressure inside the aircraft cabin, most commonly because of rapid changes in environmental pressure during ascent when cabin pressure falls rapidly and during descent when cabin pressure quickly rises. Middle ear barotrauma is usually not severe or dangerous, though rarely it can cause complications including dizziness, hearing loss, a perforated tympanic membrane, and permanent tinnitus; to help reduce risk, travelers with ear, nose, and sinus infections or severe congestion might choose to postpone flying to prevent pain or injury or use oral or nasal decongestants to help alleviate symptoms.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis [^1114oiic]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory disease of the nose and paranasal sinuses, with a prevalence of approximately 1% to 7%. It is defined by the presence of at least two cardinal symptoms (nasal blockage, obstruction, or congestion; anterior or posterior nasal drainage; facial pain or pressure; and hyposmia) for at least three consecutive months, with objective findings on imaging or nasal endoscopy. CRS can result in significant patient costs and lower quality of life due to severe fatigue, depression, and sometimes reduced cognitive function. The condition is categorized as primary or secondary and with or without nasal polyps. Treatment is directed at reducing symptoms, improving mucus clearance, reducing inflammation, enhancing ciliary function, and removing bacteria and biofilms from the nasal mucosa. First-line treatment comprises nasal saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids. Acute exacerbation of CRS is common and is defined as a transient worsening of symptoms. The role of oral antibiotics and oral corticosteroids for acute exacerbations is unclear. Optimal maintenance therapy can help alleviate exacerbations. Patients with refractory CRS that is not responsive to first-line treatment and patients with alarm symptoms should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation and consideration of surgical management. Identifying patients who have CRS with nasal polyps or comorbid conditions such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, or eosinophilic esophagitis is especially important to ensure they are referred to a specialist for consideration of biologic therapy.

### Surgery for severe rhinosinusitis [^112fdrUo]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Sinusitis is one of the most common reasons patients visit their primary care physician. The etiology of sinusitis is multifactorial in most cases. However, the final common pathway of disruption is usually made with a thorough history. The physical examination is often unremarkable. Complaints of nasal obstruction, mucopuluent nasal drainage, and facial pain/pressure are most diagnostic chronic sinusitis. Isolated headache is an uncommon presenting symptom. Computed tomography scans are the gold standard for diagnostic imaging. They can be used both for diagnosis and surgical treatment. All chronic sinusitis patients, being considered for endoscopic sinus surgery, should have failed a trial of maximal medical therapy. This includes a 4–6 wk course of oral antibiotics, nasal steroids, topical nasal decongestants, and oral prednisone if possible. Patients who fail maximal medical therapy have persistent symptoms that significantly effect their daily activities, have chronic abnormalities on computed tomography scan, and are candidates for endoscopic sinus surgery. Appropriate patient selection and preoperative counseling are key factors in patient satisfaction. Most patients with symptoms that significantly impact their daily activities will receive marked improvement in symptoms after sinus surgery. Endoscopic sinus surgery has undergone radical changes in the last 15 yr. Minimally invasive techniques, combined with advances in instrumentation and computers have reduced postoperative discomfort and improved patient satisfaction.

### Use of nebulized antibiotics for acute infections in chronic sinusitis [^1148Upqn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Infections in patients with chronic sinusitis after surgery can be difficult to treat. Nebulized antimicrobial therapy was studied as a treatment option.

Study Design

Patients with chronic sinusitis, previous sinus surgery, and an acute infection were offered nebulized antibiotics or standard therapy. Cultures were taken and sensitivity testing was performed. Retrospective chart reviews were also performed.

Results

Forty-two patients were included. The most common side effects were sore throat and cough. Symptomatic and endoscopic data before and after nebulized therapy showed a longer infection-free period (average, 17 weeks) compared with standard therapy (average, 6 weeks). Improvements in posterior nasal discharge, facial pain/pressure, and emotional consequences were noted.

Conclusion

Nebulized therapy was safe and effective in this cohort. Endoscopy and outcome measure changes showed consistent improvements.

Significance

A novel therapy for acute sinus infections in patients with chronic sinusitis and previous endoscopic sinus surgery is presented.

### Sinusitis (acute) [^113eDFe2]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute sinusitis is defined pathologically, by transient inflammation of the mucosal lining of the paranasal sinuses lasting less than 4 weeks. Clinically, it is characterised by nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, facial pain, hyposmia, sneezing, and, if more severe, additional malaise and fever. It affects 1% to 5% of the adult population each year in Europe.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in people with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, and in people with radiologically or bacteriologically confirmed acute sinusitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 19 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid [co-amoxiclav], doxycycline, cephalosporins, macrolides; different doses, long-course regimens), antihistamines, decongestants (xylometazoline, phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine), saline nasal washes, steam inhalation, and topical corticosteroids (intranasal).

### Topical and systemic antifungal therapy for chronic rhinosinusitis [^116FMGV6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This review adds to a series of reviews looking at primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and characterised by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Antifungals have been suggested as a treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic and topical antifungal agents in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, including those with allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) and, if possible, AFRS exclusively.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 17 November 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a two-week follow-up period comparing topical or systemic antifungals with (a) placebo, (b) no treatment, (c) other pharmacological interventions or (d) a different antifungal agent. We did not include post-surgical antifungal use.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity and the significant adverse effects of hepatic toxicity (systemic antifungals). Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse effects of gastrointestinal disturbance (systemic antifungals) and epistaxis, headache or local discomfort (topical antifungals). We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included eight studies (490 adult participants). The presence of nasal polyps on examination was an inclusion criterion in three studies, an exclusion criterion in one study and the remaining studies included a mixed population. No studies specifically investigated the effect of antifungals in patients with AFRS. Topical antifungal treatment versus placebo or no interventionWe included seven studies (437 participants) that used amphotericin B (six studies; 383 participants) and one that used fluconazole (54 participants). Different delivery methods, volumes and concentrations were used. Four studies reported disease-specific health-related quality of life using a range of instruments. We did not meta-analyse the results due to differences in the instruments used, and measurement and reporting methods. At the end of treatment (one to six months) none of the studies reported statistically significant differences between the groups (low-quality evidence - we are uncertain about the result). Two studies reported disease severity using patient-reported symptom scores. Meta-analysis was not possible. At the end of treatment (8 to 13 weeks) one study showed no difference and the second found that patients in the placebo group had less severe symptoms (very low-quality evidence - we are very uncertain about the result). In terms of adverse effects, topical antifungals may lead to more local irritation compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 2.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 8.62; 312 participants; 5 studies; low-quality evidence) but little or no difference in epistaxis (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.63; 225 participants; 4 studies, low-quality evidence) or headache (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.63; 195 participants; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence). None of the studies found a difference in generic health-related quality of life (one study) or endoscopic score (five studies) between the treatment groups. Three studies investigated CT scan; two found no difference between the groups and one found a significant decrease in the mean percentage of air space occluded, favouring the antifungal group. Systemic antifungal treatment versus placebo or no treatmentOne study (53 participants) comparing terbinafine tablets against placebo reported that there may be little or no difference between the groups in disease-specific health-related quality of life or disease severity score (both low-quality evidence). Systemic antifungals may lead to more hepatic toxicity events (RR 3.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 78.60) but fewer gastrointestinal disturbances (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.36), compared to placebo, although the evidence was of low quality. This study did not find a difference in CT scan score between the groups. Generic health-related quality of life and endoscopic score were not measured. Other comparisonsWe found no studies that compared antifungal agents against other treatments for chronic rhinosinusitis.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the very low quality of the evidence, it is uncertain whether or not the use of topical or systemic antifungals has an impact on patient outcomes in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis compared with placebo or no treatment. Studies including specific subgroups (i.e. AFRS) are lacking.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115NRCVW]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Statement 3: Symptomatic relief of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — clinicians may recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of ABRS. This is an option based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneous populations, diagnostic criteria, and outcome measures with a balance of benefit and harm. The action profile urges promotion of analgesics, saline irrigation, and topical intranasal steroids and discourages interventions with questionable, unknown or unproven efficacy such as systemic steroids, decongestants, antihistamines, and guaifenesin. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A for topical nasal steroids, Grade B for saline irrigation and systemic steroids, and grade D for analgesics, decongestants, antihistamines (in non-atopic patients) and guaifenesin. Benefits include relief of facial pain with analgesics, a modest increase in symptom relief from topical nasal steroids (number needed to treat 11), and possible symptom relief from saline irrigations; risks include local and systemic adverse reactions and medication costs. Level of confidence in evidence is Medium.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^116kSDDx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Definitions related to chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) delineate diagnostic durations and surgical terms: Chronic rhinosinusitis requires Twelve weeks or longer of two or more of specified symptoms or signs with inflammation documented by one or more objective findings. Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is Up to 4 weeks of discolored nasal drainage accompanied by nasal obstruction, facial pain, pressure, or fullness. Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis is Four or more episodes per year of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) without signs or symptoms between episodes. Complicated rhinosinusitis denotes Extraparanasal sinus extension beyond the confines of the sinuses, for example, orbital or intracranial spread. Surgical terminology defines surgical management as preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative decisions and surgical interventions, primary surgery as the initial operative intervention for CRS, and revision surgery as surgery for CRS occurring subsequent to the initial operation, for example for recurrence of disease.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^1123TerT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) disease states that warrant consideration for expedited sinus surgery include nasal polyps, bone erosion, osteitis, allergic mucin, and fungal ball. In chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), polyps shrink in response to oral or topical steroids but frequently regrow once the steroid is stopped, and sinus surgery for CRSwNP involves the immediate removal of polyps and removes the physical obstruction of the sinuses. For bone erosion, bone erosion does not change in response to oral or topical steroids or antibiotics, and sinus surgery immediately removes the source of the pressure atrophy and prevents progression of bone erosion. For osteitis, no medical treatment exists for paranasal sinus osteitis at this time, and surgery can remove the osteitic bone that contributes to sinonasal obstruction and can also immediately decrease the progression of disease to help facilitate topical medical treatments. In allergic mucin, medical therapy carries significant risks and is insufficient at enabling effective mucociliary clearance of the thick sticky mucin, whereas surgical intervention is considered first-line treatment and is recommended in multiple consensus statements. For a fungal ball, no medical therapy to completely eradicate fungal ball and bacterial superinfection currently exists, and surgical intervention is gold-standard treatment to remove the fungal debris and reestablish sinus drainage pathway.

### Use of acupuncture to alleviate side effects in radiation oncology: current evidence and future directions [^113vDxa1]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Is there a way to fully assess the effect of acupuncture? A close look at the studies (Table 1) reveals small patient numbers and heterogeneous patient collectives. Moreover, if an effect on radiation-related symptoms is the focus, dose constraints to the responsible organs as well as the implementation of modern RT techniques are important prerequisites. Indeed, the different studies are not easy to compare with each other because of variable selected control groups. Endpoints should include patient-reported subjective reporting, but also objective measurements. For xerostomia assessment, unstimulated and stimulated saliva flow measurements are certainly helpful; however, dose constraints to salivary glands and selective dose sparing of salivary glands, if oncologically feasible, would be an important complement. To boost evidence, we have to offer acupuncture in a larger population-based approach. Sham acupuncture control arms seem to be a valid comparator, and the Shanghai group has shown that this can work effectively in a prospective randomized trial. Other groups have also supported this evidence, but not necessarily with cancer patients but with postmastectomy pain, sinusitis, or osteoarthritis. In this analyses, not only patient-reported outcome measures showed improvement, but also standardized measures (eg, lung function in the study on postmastectomy pain). As a comparator, sham acupuncture was implemented. In those arms, every patient also received an acupuncture treatment, but the needles were not inserted as deeply as in real acupuncture and the acupoints did not lay on the traditional given "pathways".

14.2 Chronic Rhinosinusitis without Nasal Polyps

The efficacy of XHANCE for Chronic Rhinosinusitis without Nasal Polyps (CRSsNP) was evaluated in two 24-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled trials in 555 adults 18 years and older (Trial 3 [NCT03960580] and Trial 4 [NCT03781804]). Trial 3 included 223 patients with CRSsNP and Trial 4 included 332 patients with either CRSsNP (N = 124) or CRSwNP (N = 208). While Trial 4 included CRSwNP patients, efficacy results from Trials 3 and 4 are presented for CRSsNP patients only.

In both trials, patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive XHANCE 186 mcg twice daily, XHANCE 372 mcg twice daily, or placebo, all administered nasally for 24 weeks. All patients enrolled in Trial 3 and Trial 4 had at least 2 active nasal symptoms (congestion/obstruction, discharge, facial pain or pressure, reduction or loss of smell) with a minimum nasal congestion score ≥ 1.5 out of 3 and a baseline CT scan showing ≥ 25% opacification of both ethmoid and at least 1 maxillary sinus. Refer to Table 4 for the demographic and baseline characteristics of all randomized CRSsNP patients in Trials 3 and 4.

### Nebulized antibiotics for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis [^113tS3An]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2002). Low credibility.

We studied the effectiveness of aerosol delivery of antibiotics to the sinuses via a nebulizer in 41 patients who had chronic, recurrent sinusitis that had persisted despite endoscopic sinus surgery and that had not responded to multiple courses of oral antibiotics. We compared pre- and post-treatment symptom scores in five categories: nasal obstruction, facial pain, pressure, mucopurulent rhinorrhea, and malaise. Following 3 to 6 weeks of treatment, 34 patients (82.9%) experienced either an excellent or good response to treatment. Side effects were infrequent, mild, and transient. We conclude that nebulized antibiotics should be considered for all patients with chronic sinusitis who have undergone functional endoscopic sinus surgery and who have failed to respond to oral antibiotics or who do not tolerate them.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^115ZHUvk]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) definition and endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) utilization — CRS affects 11.6% of adults and prompts 4.1 million annual ambulatory visits. ESS is performed with a telescope, video system, and instruments, which can be used to access the paranasal sinuses without an external incision. By 2006, ESS constituted 43% of nasal surgery performed, second only to septoplasty (57%). CRS has been defined in adults as at least 12 weeks of two or more key symptoms (thick and/or discolored nasal drainage [anterior, posterior, or both]; nasal obstruction or congestion; facial pain, pressure, or fullness; and hyposmia or anosmia), along with at least one sign of inflammation (abnormal mucus or edema in the middle meatus or anterior ethmoid region; polyps in the nasal cavity or the middle meatus; and/or radiologic imaging showing inflammation of the paranasal sinuses). Among those with CRS, an estimated 14% may undergo ESS, based on national-level data from 2010 to 2012.

### A 51-year-old woman with acute onset of facial pressure, rhinorrhea, and Tooth pain: review of acute rhinosinusitis [^116dMDhJ]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is a common ailment accounting for millions of office visits annually, including that of Mrs D, a 51-year-old woman presenting with 5 days of upper respiratory illness and facial pain. Her case is used to review the diagnosis and treatment of acute rhinosinusitis. Acute viral rhinosinusitis can be difficult to distinguish from acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, especially during the first 10 days of symptoms. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines developed to guide diagnosis and treatment of acute viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis recommend that the diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis be based on the presence of "cardinal symptoms" of purulent rhinorrhea and either facial pressure or nasal obstruction of less than 4 weeks' duration. Antibiotic treatment generally can be withheld during the first 10 days of symptoms for mild to moderate cases, given the likelihood of acute viral rhinosinusitis or of spontaneously resolving acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. After 10 days, the likelihood of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis increases, and initiation of antibiotic therapy is supported by practice guidelines. Complications of sinusitis, though rare, can be serious and require early recognition and treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^112K1rtP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — management when initial antibiotic therapy fails includes counseling and reassessment. During initial management, patients should be counseled to call and/or schedule a follow up appointment if symptoms are worsening or not improving after 3 to 5 days on appropriate initial antibiotic therapy, and clinicians should confirm the diagnosis of ABRS by applying the diagnostic criteria in Table 4. If the patient does not have the symptom cluster of up to 4 weeks of purulent nasal drainage alongside nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both, alternate diagnoses should be explored; common mimics include migraines, tension headaches, cluster headaches, temporomandibular joint disorders, and noninfectious nasal conditions such as allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, deviated nasal septum, and nasal valve collapse. The presence of purulent or discolored drainage from the middle meatus or sphenoethmoid recess is suggestive of a bacterial process; a culture may help direct appropriate antibiotic therapy if purulent drainage is identified, but blind nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs are not recommended, and such cultures should be taken from the middle meatus or sphenoethmoid recess.

Chronic rhinosinusitis postoperative pain management after ESS — Pain management should be planned, and postoperative pain management varies by surgeon and may include both opioid and nonopioid options. Pain has been shown to peak over the first 3 days following ESS, and the median number of combination acetaminophen and opioid pills taken in patients undergoing ESS, septoplasty, or a combination, was three tablets. Patient factors such as a history of antidepressant use may require more opioids for adequate pain control; opioid use is low even when prescribed, suggesting nonnarcotic options such as acetaminophen can often be effective. Clinicians should discuss strategies in advance to individualize plans, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) is not currently shown to increase bleeding risk after ESS but can decrease pain and opioid usage; plans can include acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and/or a limited number of narcotic tablets based on discussed risks.

### Epidemiology and treatment of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in Germany – A claims data study [^111MSEyg]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease, causing inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity associated with nasal obstruction/blockage accompanied by facial pain and sinus pressure. The two main clinical phenotypes of CRS include CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). Nasal polyps are defined as endoscopically visualized growths in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, ultimately interfering with a patient's nasal passages and sinuses. Nasal polyps are believed to affect up to 4% of the general adult population, and of those suffering from CRS, roughly 25–30% experience CRSwNP.

There are various therapeutical options in place to treat CRSwNP with the goals of reducing inflammation of the paranasal sinuses, draining the nasal cavity and reducing the risk of sinus irritation. These options include topical intranasal corticosteroids (INCS), systemic corticosteroids (SCS), aspirin desensitization and functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) as standard therapy. However, surgical procedures have shown a short‐term efficacy of around 18 months to 4 years with a 10–60% risk for additional surgery due to nasal polyp regrowth and 79% over a 12‐year period.,

However, there are different levels of severity among patients who suffer from CRSwNP and require adapted disease management. According to the European position paper on rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps (EPOS), SCS and FESS are primarily indicated for severe CRSwNP cases. Moreover, patients who have a continued need for secondary therapy despite receiving INCS, SCS or FESS in the last year are considered as difficult to treat. Patients with severe, uncontrolled forms of CRSwNP may be candidates for biological treatment.,

Principles for an optimal adapted disease management refer to broad data on severity grades and categories of disease control. Therefore, there is an important need for gaining population‐based data on the prevalence, incidence, clinical characteristics and medical treatment of CRSwNP patients. This retrospective non‐interventional claims data study aimed to estimate the prevalence and incidence of CRSwNP patients and severe CRSwNP cases with inadequate disease control in Germany and to describe these patients regarding baseline characteristics and treatments.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^116yhLrd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — viral rhinosinusitis (VRS) supportive care and natural history note that acute VRS is estimated to occur from 2 to 5 times per year in the average adult, secondary bacterial infection is believed to complicate only 0.5% to 2.0% of these events, and symptoms typically peak within 3 days then decline and resolve within 10 to 14 days. Management is symptomatic: antibiotics are not recommended for treating VRS as antibiotics are ineffective for viral illness and do not provide direct symptom relief, and palliative medications — non-narcotic analgesics (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, acetaminophen), nasal saline, decongestants, antihistamines, mucolytics, cough suppressants, and topical or oral corticosteroids — may be used alone or in varying combinations for symptom relief. Acetaminophen may help relieve nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea but does not alleviate other viral symptoms, whereas nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents do not improve nasal discharge but improve malaise, sneezing, headache, and otalgia, and should be used with caution in older adults. Nasal saline may be palliative and cleansing with low risk of adverse reactions, with minor improvements in nasal symptom scores reported and a meta-analysis indicating that higher volume irrigations may be superior. For decongestants, in 2023 the FDA advisory committee discouraged the use of oral phenylephrine as a nasal decongestant; use of up to 3 to 5 days of topical oxymetazoline may be beneficial but clinicians should warn patients against paradoxical rebound congestion with use greater than 3 days; pseudoephedrine could be considered beyond this, although recent evidence is lacking and the patient should be counseled regarding contraindications of elevated blood pressure and heart rate. Commonly used antihistamines show no clinically significant effect on nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea or sneezing, and first-generation varieties should be avoided in older adults. While not supported by a large body of evidence, topical corticosteroids in VRS is an option for symptomatic relief, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 13 and greater effect with longer courses and higher doses. Diagnostic caveats include that nasal purulence alone does not indicate a bacterial infection.

### Fluticasone propionate (Xhance) [^114yRKNv]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In both trials, the coprimary efficacy endpoints were 1) change from baseline at Week 4 in the composite symptom score (CSS) as determined by patients using a daily diary and 2) change from baseline at Week 24 in percent opacified sinus volume. CSS was the sum of the individual nasal symptom scores for congestion/obstruction, facial pain/pressure, and nasal discharge, each rated by the patient on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) in the morning immediately prior to the next dose. Sinus opacification was measured by CT scan and scored using a 3-dimensional computer-assisted volumetric assessment using software to quantify the average percent of opacified volume in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses.

Efficacy was demonstrated for both coprimary endpoints (CSS and percent opacified sinus volume) for XHANCE 186 mcg twice daily and XHANCE 372 mcg twice daily. Refer to Table 5 for coprimary endpoint results. Improvements demonstrated in CSS at Week 4 with either dose of XHANCE remained at Weeks 8 and 12.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline in individual symptoms of the CSS (nasal congestion, nasal pain/pressure, and nasal discharge) at Week 4. Refer to Table 6 for individual symptom score results.

Acute Exacerbations

Acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis (AECRS), defined as a worsening of symptoms that required escalation of treatment (e.g., antibiotics, oral steroids, acute care visits), was assessed in the CRSsNP patients from pooled data (Trials 3 and 4) through Week 24. The rate of AECRS was reduced by 53% among patients in each XHANCE treatment group versus placebo. This was derived from incidence rate ratios of 0.47 (95% CI: 0.21, 1.08) and 0.47 (95% CI: 0.20, 1.09) among patients using XHANCE 186 mcg and 372 mcg twice daily versus placebo, respectively; which were not statistically significant.

### Predictors of non-rhinogenic facial pain or pressure in otolaryngology clinic [^115AvSta]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Identify demographic and clinical characteristics that may help differentiate non-rhinogenic facial pain or pressure (NRFP) from sinusitis.

Study Design

Retrospective single-institution study.

Setting

Tertiary Care Center Rhinology Clinic.

Methods

All patients presenting with a complaint of facial pain or pressure over a 3-year period were included. Patients were categorized into either NRFP or sinusitis groups based on computed tomography imaging and nasal endoscopy. Data pertaining to demographics, history, and SNOT-22 questionnaire domains were compared via univariate analysis as well as logistic regression with backwards variable selection.

Results

A total of 296 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 128 had NRFP and 168 had sinusitis. A significantly greater percentage of patients in the NRFP group were women of childbearing age (40.6% vs 28.0%, P = 0.02). Backwards variable selection resulted in a model with four variables predicting a diagnosis of NRFP-female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 2.998, P < .0001), no history of prior sinonasal surgery (OR = 0.340 for history vs no history, P < .01), low nasal domain score (OR = 0.551, P < .0001), and high ear/facial domain score (OR = 1.453, P < .01).

Conclusion

Accurately identifying patients with NRFP at initial presentation based on history would help direct patients to the appropriate care pathway and prevent ineffective treatments such as antibiotics and sinus procedures. Our findings suggest that the suspicion for NRFP should be higher in women of child-bearing age as well as patients with greater ear/facial symptoms or lesser nasal symptoms.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^115ntvXB]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Rhinoplasty pain control — perioperative analgesics and adjuncts note that lidocaine with epinephrine or a long-acting local anesthetic such as bupivacaine can be injected during the procedure and will reduce agitation and expedite discharge without added risk, and topical intranasal anesthetics can also help reduce postoperative pain. Administering a single perioperative dose of dexamethasone decreases edema and ecchymosis formation over the first 2 postoperative days; there is evidence that corticosteroids decrease pain and discomfort, reduce nausea and vomiting in the immediate postoperative period, and there is some evidence that perioperative steroids may prolong postoperative ecchymosis. Several adjunctive measures can be utilized to decrease pain and discomfort and improve outcomes and patient satisfaction, including operative and postoperative use of iced saline-soaked gauze applied to the external nose, postoperative low-pressure, high-volume nasal irrigation with normal saline and fluticasone by the patient after discharge, eliminating routine nasal packing, and using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as a supplement or replacement for narcotic analgesics at home. There is no documentation that managing acute postoperative pain improves overall outcomes and patient satisfaction following rhinoplasty; however, the GDG assumed that interventions to reduce pain would likely improve satisfaction.

α-Adrenergic decongestants — Summary Statement 31: Neither oral nor topical decongestants are beneficial for maintenance treatment of CRS (Opt, B). Long-term use of oral decongestants is generally not recommended for maintenance treatment because of concerns about increasing blood pressure and lack of supportive clinical evidence. Topical decongestants can be considered for short-term and possibly intermittent or episodic therapy of nasal congestion but are inappropriate for regular daily use because of the risk of rhinitis medicamentosa.

### Roads to remission: evolving treatment concepts in type 2 inflammatory diseases [^1124Y1Fk]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps

Around 1–2% of adults have chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). This subgroup of CRS differs from the more common CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) by the presence of polyps (which are determined endoscopically). Although type 2 inflammation is present in most patients with CRSwNP, there is no association with allergies.CRSwNP is often associated with adult-onset eosinophilic asthma, and sometimes with NSAID-exacerbated airway disease (N-ERD) and/or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). Typical symptoms of CRSwNP are nasal obstruction, reduction in (or even loss of) sense of smell, nasal discharge, and sleep disturbances. Disease burden of CRSwNP is high, given the major impairment in quality of life and high recurrence rates despite surgical treatment.

Disease control

Symptom control was the aim of CRSwNP treatment over decades, using intranasal and/or systemic corticosteroids and (often recurrent) endoscopic sinus surgery. Symptoms (such as rhinorrhoea, sneezing, nasal obstruction, reduction in sense of smell, headache, postnasal drip, fatigue, facial pain and pressure) are assessed using VAS scores (scales from 0, indicating total absence of symptoms, to 10, indicating worst symptoms). In addition, the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) is used in clinical practice, a validated 22-item questionnaire measuring disease-specific, health-related quality of life in patients with rhinosinusitis. In 2021, the European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy (EUFOREA) defined severe CRSwNP as bilateral CRSwNP with a nasal polyp score of at least 4 of 8 points and persistent symptoms, including loss of smell and/or taste, nasal obstruction, secretion and/or postnasal drip, and facial pain or pressure, with the need for add-on treatment to supplement intranasal corticosteroids. Uncontrolled CRSwNP was defined as persistent or recurring CRSwNP despite long-term treatment with intranasal corticosteroids and having received at least 1 course of systemic corticosteroids in the preceding 2 years and/or previous sino-nasal surgery(Table 2). A recent international consensus defined CRSwNP control as patient-reported disease control and the absence of clinically relevant sino-nasal symptoms (determined by VAS ≤ 5 cm for overall symptom severity, nasal obstruction, and loss of smell) within the last month.

### Keeping it in the family: use of the grandmother, mother, and child technique to navigate complex anatomy during coronary sinus reducer implantation [^115XmQEL]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

The putative mechanism of anginal relief is that increased venous drainage pressures produced via focal coronary sinus narrowing results in arterial capillary dilatation, coronary collateral recruitment and redistribution of flow from the less‐ischemic epicardium to the ischemic endocardium. A paucity of human data underpins this hypothesis. The ORBITA‐COSMIC study (NCT04892537) is an ongoing randomized placebo‐controlled trial that is assessing MRI myocardial perfusion change with the CSR in patients with refractory angina. This trial is seeking to elucidate the mechanism by which the CSR delivers benefit for patients that previously had few therapeutic avenues.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^114ZwZGb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — strength of action terms and implied obligations are defined for three categories. A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, in the case of a strong negative recommendation, that the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and that the quality of the supporting evidence is high (Grade A or B). In some clearly identified circumstances, strong recommendations may be made based on lesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits strongly outweigh the harms. Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. A recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms (or, in the case of a negative recommendation, that the harms exceed the benefits), but the quality of evidence is not as high (Grade B or C). In some clearly identified circumstances, recommendations may be made based on lesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits outweigh the harms. Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. An option means that either the quality of evidence is suspect (Grade D)* or that well-done studies (Grade A, B, or C)1 show little clear advantage to one approach versus another. Clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Clinical assessment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^116nY1bj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease that affects > 10% of the adult population in Europe and the United States. It has been delineated phenotypically into CRS without nasal polyps and CRS with nasal polyps. Both have a high disease burden and an overlapping spectrum of symptoms such as nasal obstruction, olfactory dysfunction, facial pain, pressure, and nasal discharge. Primary assessment includes evaluation of patient symptoms and impact on quality of life, nasal endoscopic examination, and imaging. Significant progress has been made in the understanding of CRS pathophysiology. There is a move toward describing CRS in terms of the predominant endotype or inflammatory pattern pathomechanism rather than the traditional classification of patients with and without nasal polyps. An increased elucidation of the disease endotypes, as characterized by their inflammatory pathways and mediators, is leading to a tailored more personalized treatment approach to the different disease subtypes.

### The effect of hyProCure® sinus tarsi stent on tarsal tunnel compartment pressures in hyperpronating feet [^115EGLBF]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Tarsal tunnel syndrome is characterized by increased pressure in the tarsal tunnel. In hyperpronation, there is excessive abnormal pronation resulting from partial displacement of the talus on the calcaneus. In this study, we hypothesized that hyperpronation caused by talotarsal instability will lead to increased pressure in the tarsal tunnel and porta pedis. We also hypothesized that the pressure in these compartments will decrease following an extra-osseous talotarsal stabilization procedure using HyProCure(®). Pressures in the tarsal tunnel and porta pedis were measured in 9 fresh-frozen cadaver specimens using an intracompartmental pressure monitor system. Pressures were measured with the foot in neutral and hyperpronated position, before and after stabilization using HyProCure. For the tarsal tunnel, pressure in the neutral position with and without HyProCure was 3 ± 3 mm Hg and 4 ± 3 mm Hg, respectively (P = 0.159). However, for the hyperpronating foot, the pressure decreased from 32 ± 16 mm Hg to 21 ± 10 mm Hg (P < .001) following the placement of HyProCure. In the porta pedis, pressure in the neutral position with and without HyProCure was 2 ± 2 mm Hg and 2 ± 2 mm Hg, respectively (P = 0.168). However, for the hyperpronating foot, the pressure decreased from 29 ± 15 mm Hg to 18 ± 11 mm Hg (P < .001) following the placement of HyProCure. The pain caused by compression of the posterior tibial nerve in the tarsal tunnel and its branches in the porta pedis, owing to hyperpronation, may be alleviated by implantation of HyProCure.

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) for acute migraine — A systematic review (SR) of 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that paracetamol 1,000 mg versus placebo favored paracetamol for percentage of pain-free response at 2 hours (RR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.24–2.62; p = 0.0022). When taken for moderate to severe pain, paracetamol was superior to placebo with pain freedom at 2 hours (NNT = 12), headache relief at 2 hours (NNT = 5), and headache relief at 1 hour (NNT = 5.2). Paracetamol 1,000 mg alone is statistically superior to placebo, but the NNT of 12 for pain-free response at 2 hours is higher than other commonly used analgesics. For safety, the maximum dose of acetaminophen for acute use is 4,000 mg per day, and this dose should include any other acetaminophen-containing products, such as cold, flu, sinus, or allergy combination products.

Nasal packing: FAQs for patients with nosebleed — packing typically "should be in place for no longer than 5 days", and "if your packing is resorbable, it may not need removal and will go away with time and the use of nasal saline sprays". Bleeding can still occur with packing; "apply pressure to the nose with pinching of the soft area, call your clinician, or go to the emergency department for further management". For nonresorbable packing, using it past the recommended time "can result in possible complications", therefore "strict adherence to follow-up directions is important". Reported risks include infection and pressure-related injury: "There is a low risk of infection spreading to the nose and sinuses or, in extremely rare cases, throughout the body", and pressure "may decrease blood flow to areas of the nose and result in injury". To reduce complications, "oral antibiotics will be used if the risk for infection is high", and "keeping the nose and packing moist with nasal saline (salt water) sprays throughout the day can reduce crusting and help resorbable packing melt away"; "strict adherence to follow-up instructions will allow for appropriate removal of packing when necessary and should make complications less frequent". Activity and medication guidance includes: "you should avoid straining, lifting over 10 pounds, bending over, and exercising", and "avoid over-the-counter pain medications that may increase bleeding, including aspirin and ibuprofen"; "Acetaminophen (Tylenol) does not increase bleeding and can be used", and "you should not try to blow your nose… If you feel the need to sneeze, sneeze with mouth open". Seek care urgently if any warning signs occur: "return of blood from nose or mouth, fever over 101°F, increasing pain, vision changes, shortness of breath or labored breathing, loss of color around the skin of the nose, swelling of the face, or a diffuse skin rash". After removal, "you may initially experience a small amount of bleeding… Keeping the nose humid with saline spray and moisturizing agents will prevent dry crusts and facilitate healing"; if nosebleeds recur, "apply pressure… and consider the use of a vasoconstrictor spray", and "if bleeding continues, call your medical provider, or go to the emergency department for further management".

### A review of postoperative care following endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis [^1125BZb6]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study reviews current postoperative care recommendations following endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), with the goal of optimizing recovery, minimizing complications, and reducing the risk of disease recurrence.

Methods

A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify studies on postoperative care following ESS for CRS. Findings were synthesized to develop evidence-based recommendations for optimal postoperative management.

Results

Postoperative care following ESS for CRS requires a multifaceted approach. Pain management should prioritize acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with opioids reserved for severe pain. Nasal irrigation, topical corticosteroids, and debridement are recommended for all patients. Nasal packing and drug-eluting devices may offer additional benefits, but are not universally required. The use of antibiotics and oral corticosteroids should be selective and guided by individual patient factors and risk profiles.

Discussion

While general recommendations are made, patient-specific factors such as comorbidities, financial constraints, and adherence to care must be considered. Further evaluation of these factors is essential to establish a more comprehensive and individualized standard of care for postoperative management.

Conclusions

Effective postoperative care following ESS for CRS should be individualized, multifaceted, and focused on improving recovery, minimizing complications, and ensuring the best possible patient outcomes.

### Thymic stromal lymphopoietin as a therapeutic target in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps [^11474Ad4]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a group of inflammatory disorders of the sinonasal mucosa. Although CRS is mechanistically heterogeneous, having various endotypes and phenotypes, it generally involves immune and epithelial barrier dysfunction combined with genetic, microbial, and environmental factors that drive pathologic inflammatory processes. Symptoms of CRS can include nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea or postnasal drainage, facial pressure or pain, and/or anosmia lasting for longer than 12 weeks. Secondary consequences of CRS include sleep impairment, anxiety, and depression. CRS affects 5%–12% of the general population and both symptoms and secondary consequences can have a significant impact on health-related quality of life.

Approximately 20%–30% of patients in Western countries (including the USA, European countries, and Australia) with CRS have nasal polyps (NPs), inflammatory epithelial extrusions originating from the ethmoid sinus epithelium and projecting into the nasal airway. Patients with CRS and NPs (CRSwNP) have more severe sinonasal symptoms than those without NPs. Common symptoms reported among patients with CRSwNP include nasal congestion, anosmia, sneezing, and headache, with results varying widely between studies and across geographical populations.

### Real-life study showing uncontrolled rhinosinusitis after sinus surgery in a tertiary referral centre [^115WAg12]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined as inflammation of the nose and the paranasal sinuses characterized by two or more symptoms, one of which should be either nasal blockage or nasal discharge in addition to facial pain/pressure and/or reduction of smell, lasting for at least 12 weeks 1. The latter symptoms should be supported by endoscopic findings or computed tomography (CT) scan changes 1. Within the 2012 European Position Paper on Sinusitis (EPOS) document, clinicians are provided with evidence‐based treatment algorithms for CRS. Treatment is advocated according to evidence‐based guidelines, with adaptation of treatment according to the response to treatment. Control of disease is defined as a disease state in which the symptoms are not considered bothersome anymore to the patient 1. The 2012 EPOS expert committee proposed an assessment of clinical control of CRS (Table 1), following the concept of the validated asthma control test 2. The proposed CRS control test takes into account the presence and severity of the four major sinonasal symptoms, sleep disturbance and/or fatigue, nasal endoscopic evaluation and need for oral medication. Based on the presence of none, one or more items of this list, patients are divided into those with well controlled, partly controlled and uncontrolled rhinosinusitis. So far, clinical studies validating this tool are lacking. In this retrospective study, we used the proposed 2012 EPOS criteria to divide patients into the three groups of control and also compared patients with (CRSwNP) and without nasal polyps (CRSsNP).

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined as persistent symptomatic inflammation of the nasal and sinus mucosa. Although insights into the pathophysiology of CRS have largely expanded over the last 2 decades, the exact etiology is still unknown and is likely due to multiple host and environmental factors. Treatments are aimed at reducing mucosal inflammation, controlling infection, and restoring mucociliary clearance within the sinuses. The principal goal of this article is to outline a rational approach to the treatment of chronic sinus disease on the basis of currently available diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. Emphasis will be placed on the management, therapeutic response, and objective evaluation of therapeutic efficiency.

This was a retrospective analysis of data from a published international, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trial conducted between January 21, 2003, and February 20, 2004, that included 534 adult (age ≥ 18 years) outpatients with ABRS. All patients entering the study were required to have purulent nasal discharge, purulent drainage in the posterior pharynx, or purulent discharge from the maxillary sinus orifice and at least 1 of 3 other protocol-defined cardinal symptoms of ABRS (sinus pain, pressure, or tenderness) for ≥ 7 days. In addition, they were required to have at least 2 of the following 6 noncardinal symptoms at baseline: cough, fever, headache, nasal congestion, postnasal discharge, and leukocytosis. All patients who received medication were assessed for the occurrence of adverse events at study visits during and after therapy. At the ontreatment visit (between days 3 and 5), baseline symptoms were reassessed as resolved, improved, same, new, or worse. Resolution of symptoms was calculated as the proportion of patients with 3 or 4 cardinal symptoms either resolved (if present at baseline) or not new (if absent at baseline). Concomitant medications other than antibiotics were allowed as needed for symptomatic treatment.

Results

Demographic characteristics were similar at baseline between the AZ-ER and LFX treatment arms (mean age, 38.4 and 39.5 years, respectively), although more women were randomized to receive LFX (62.9%) than AZ-ER (53.3%) (P = 0.025). More than 90% of patients in both arms had ≥ 3 ABRS symptoms at baseline. At the on-treatment visit, resolution of ≥ 3 ABRS symptoms was achieved in 88 of 270 AZ-ER patients (32.6%) and 61 of 261 LFX patients (23.4%) (P = 0.018). Resolution of individual symptoms in the AZ-ER and LFX groups at 3 to 5 days was as follows: sinus pain (92/253[36.4%] and 77/251 [30.7%]; P = NS), sinus pressure (97/243 [39.9%] and 68/244 [27.9%]; P = 0.005), sinus tenderness (83/218 [38.1%] and 73/214 [34.1%]; P = NS), and nasal discharge (57/270 [21.0%] and 49/264 [18.6%]; P = NS). Treatment-related adverse events were reported by 63 of 270 AZ-ER patients (23.3%) and 41 of 268 LFX patients (15.3%). Gastrointestinal disturbances were the most common adverse events, including nausea (4.4% and 3.4%) and abdominal pain (2.6% and 0.4%).

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^1124vQyJ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical diagnosis — history of rhinosinusitis identifies that acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is suspected in patients whose upper respiratory infection (URI) has persisted beyond 7 to 10 days or is worsening after initial improvement, and symptoms lasting 5 to 10 days are the most difficult to assess because they may reflect an ongoing viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or the beginning of a bacterial infection. In adults, prominent symptoms include nasal congestion, obstruction, anterior and/or posterior purulent rhinorrhea, and facial pain or pressure, and a history of persistent purulent rhinorrhea and facial pain appear to have some correlation with increased likelihood of bacterial disease; in children, symptoms often also include increased irritability, even more prolonged cough, and vomiting that occurs in association with gagging on mucus. In contrast to ABRS, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) cannot be diagnosed by symptoms alone and can be subdivided into CRSsNP and CRSwNP; patients with CRSwNP generally present with periodic exacerbations with increased facial pain or pressure and increased drainage, and fever is absent or low grade with persistence of some sinonasal symptoms between episodes that distinguishes CRS from recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS), in which the patient is asymptomatic between ABRS episodes.

Steroid sinus instillations or drops — For chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), evidence is mixed: Two studies of topical steroid irrigations (rinses) for CRSsNP have shown benefit, and in CRSwNP three studies reported a beneficial effect on polyp size and one on quality of life, whereas another study found no benefit; in a 12-week trial of fluticasone propionate nasal drops the need for sinus surgery decreased (from 78% to 52%). Topical steroid instillations and/or drops are not approved by the FDA in the United States.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^116hYLF3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — Oral antihistamines plus oral decongestants: "Oral antihistamines and oral decongestant combinations control AR symptoms better than either oral antihistamine or oral decongestant alone", but adding a decongestant "increases side effects of insomnia, headache, dry mouth, and nervousness", and "the potential for tolerance from chronic use of oral decongestants may be seen". In one study, "24-hour extended-release pseudoephedrine (240 mg) caused less insomnia than 12-hour extended-release pseudoephedrine (120 mg) taken twice daily (4% vs 15%, P < .01)", and a meta-analysis found pseudoephedrine increased "systolic blood pressure (0.99 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.90)" and "heart rate (2.83 beats/min; 95% CI, 2.0 to 3.6)" with "no effect on diastolic blood pressure (0.63 mm Hg, 95% CI, −0.10 to 1.35)". Use is age-restricted: "not recommended for patients under 4 years of age", and "extended-release, 120-mg, 12-hour dose is not recommended for patients under 12 years of age".

### Intracranial pressure in unresponsive chronic migraine [^111WGgeY]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

To assess the prevalence and possible pathogenetic involvement of raised intracranial pressure in patients presenting with unresponsive chronic migraine (CM), we evaluated the intracranial opening pressure (OP) and clinical outcome of a single cerebrospinal fluid withdrawal by lumbar puncture in 44 consecutive patients diagnosed with unresponsive chronic/transformed migraine and evidence of sinus stenosis at magnetic resonance venography. The large majority of patients complained of daily or near-daily headache. Thirty-eight (86.4%) had an OP > 200 mmH 2 O. Lumbar puncture-induced normalization of intracranial pressure resulted in prompt remission of chronic pain in 34/44 patients (77.3%); and an episodic pattern of headache was maintained for 2, 3 and 4 months in 24 (54.6%), 20 (45.4%) and 17 (38.6%) patients, respectively. The medians of overall headache days/month and of disabling headache days/month significantly decreased (p < 0.0001) at each follow-up versus baseline. Despite the absence of papilledema, 31/44 (70.5%) patients fulfilled the ICHD-II criteria for "Headache attributed to Intracranial Hypertension". Our findings indicate that most patients diagnosed with unresponsive CM in specialized headache clinics may present an increased intracranial pressure involved in the progression and refractoriness of pain. Moreover, a single lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid withdrawal results in sustained remission of chronic pain in many cases. Prospective controlled studies are needed before this procedure can be translated into clinical practice. Nonetheless, we suggest that intracranial hypertension without papilledema should be considered in all patients with almost daily migraine pain, with evidence of sinus stenosis, and unresponsive to medical treatment referred to specialized headache clinics.

### Headache and facial pain / pressure in the chronic rhinosinusitis population: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1161hNoY]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the severity and prevalence of headache and facial pain/pressurere in the chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) population.

Data Sources

CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus.

Review Methods

The literature was searched from inception through June 2023 for English language articles documenting "headache" or "facial pain/pressure" and "chronic rhinosinusitis". Data collected included Lund-MacKay computed tomography score, Lund-Kennedy endoscopy score, sinonasal outcome test, and visual analog scale. Meta-analyses were performed on continuous measures (mean), proportions (%), and regression.

Results

A total of 69 studies were included with 8643 CRS patients and 703 control patients. The CRS group had a mean age of 44.1 (range: 16–82; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 40.3–48) and 86.1% [95% CI: 76.4–93.5] with nasal polyposis. The control group had a mean age of 39.2 (range: 17–88; 95% CI: 28.7–49.8). All CRS subgroups had significantly more severe headache and facial pain/pressure when compared to the control (P < .0001). Patients without polyps had significantly more severe facial pain/pressure and headache when compared to patients with polyps (P < .0001). Facial pain/pressure is a moderate problem or worse in 29.8% of polypoid patients versus 56.4% of nonpolypoid patients; Δ26.6% [95% CI: 0.7–50; P = 0.045].

Conclusions

Across all outcome metrics, CRS patients experience significantly more severe headache and facial pain/pressure when compared to a control population. Nonpolypoid patients experience significantly more severe facial pain/pressure and headache when compared to polypoid patients. The majority of nonpolypoid patients experience facial pain/pressure that is moderate in severity or worse.

### Effect of budesonide added to large-volume, low-pressure saline sinus irrigation for chronic rhinosinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^111NqCFk]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Recent studies suggest that budesonide added to saline nasal lavage can be an effective treatment for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

Objective

To evaluate the incremental effect of adding budesonide to large-volume, low-pressure saline sinus irrigation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted at a quaternary care academic medical center between January 1, 2016, and February 16, 2017. A total of 80 adult patients with CRS were enrolled; 74 completed baseline assessments; and 61 remained in the trial to complete all analyses. Data analysis was conducted from March 2017 to August 2017.

Interventions

All study participants were provided with a sinus rinse kit including saline and identical-appearing capsules that contained either budesonide (treatment group) or lactose (control group). Patients were instructed to dissolve the capsules in the saline and use the resulting solution to irrigate both nasal cavities, using half the solution for each cavity, once daily for 30 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measure was the change in Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) scores, pretreatment to posttreatment, in the budesonide group compared with the control group. Secondary outcome measures included patient-reported response to treatment, as measured with a modification of the Clinical Global Impressions scale, and endoscopic examination scored by the Lund-Kennedy grading system.

Results

Of the 74 participants who completed baseline assessments (37 in each study arm), mean (SD) age, 51 (14.7) years, 50 (68%) were women. Of the 61 who remained in the trial to complete all analyses, 29 were randomized to budesonide treatment, and 32 to saline alone. The average change in SNOT-22 scores was 20.7 points for those in the budesonide group and 13.6 points for those in the control group, for a mean difference of 7 points in favor of the budesonide group (95% CI, -2 to 16). A total of 23 participants (79%) in the budesonide group experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in their SNOT-22 scores compared with 19 (59%) in the control group, for a difference of 20% (95% CI, -2.5% to 42.5%). The average change in endoscopic scores was 3.4 points for the budesonide group and 2.7 points for the control group. There were no related adverse events.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study shows that budesonide in saline nasal lavage results in clinically meaningful benefits beyond the benefits of saline alone for patients with CRS. Given the imprecision in the treatment effect, further research is warranted to define the true effect of budesonide in saline nasal lavage.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^1139Rp1h]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Procedures

Our pharmacist (G.G.) prepared the study medications based on randomized dose allocations using Excel (Microsoft Corporation), with prescription bottles labeled only by study number. Enrolling clinicians, study personnel, and patients were blinded to the allotted dosage. The 2 treatment groups, allocated 1:1, were (1) standard dose: 875 mg of amoxicillin with 125 mg of clavulanate plus placebo tablet (containing lactase) twice a day for 7 days and (2) high dose: 875 mg of amoxicillin with 125 mg of clavulanate plus 875 mg of amoxicillin twice a day for 7 days.

At the time of enrollment, participants filled out SNOT-16, rating 16 symptoms on a scale of 0 (no problem) to 3 (severe problem): need to blow nose, sneezing, runny nose, cough, postnasal discharge, thick nasal discharge, ear fullness, headache, facial pain or pressure, waking up at night, lack of a good night's sleep, waking up tired, fatigue, reduced productivity, reduced concentration, and frustrated, restless, or irritable. They also indicated their tendencies to get constipation, diarrhea, or vaginal yeast infections (women). They were advised to use acetaminophen and nasal saline for symptomatic relief and were given a list of the questions they would be asked at the end of day 3.

At the end of day 3, the participants provided a Global Rating of Improvement (GRI) on the scale that Garbutt and colleagueshad used as a secondary outcome and to validate the SNOT-16, with 1 indicating a lot worse; 2, a little worse; 3, the same; 4, a little better; 5, a lot better; and 6, no symptoms. Participants also replied again to the SNOT-16; rated the adverse effects of diarrhea, abdominal pain, vaginal itching and discharge, or other on a scale of 0 indicating none to 3 indicating severe; and indicated whether they had used nasal saline, nasal steroids (known to improve symptoms), or other medications for their sinus symptoms.

At the end of day 10, participants again provided a GRI, responded to the SNOT-16 questions, and reported the severity of any adverse effects. They rated the balance of good effects and bad effects and indicated whether they would take the antibiotic again if needed.

### Pain and blood pressure: short-term physiological benefit, long-term pathological harm? [^113ZF7Pr]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute pain is known to prompt a physiological response with an acute increase in blood pressure. A systematic review published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia demonstrates a relationship between chronic pain and hypertension. The biological mechanisms contributing to the complex relationship between chronic pain and hypertension are not yet fully understood. However, clinicians delivering chronic pain or hypertension services should proactively assess for both issues and provide a holistic approach to management.

### Saline irrigation for allergic rhinitis [^1147gGBv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Allergic rhinitis is a common condition affecting both adults and children. Patients experience symptoms of nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea, sneezing and nasal itching, which may affect their quality of life. Nasal irrigation with saline (salty water), also known as nasal douching, washing or lavage, is a procedure that rinses the nasal cavity with isotonic or hypertonic saline solutions. It can be performed with low positive pressure from a spray, pump or squirt bottle, with a nebuliser or with gravity-based pressure in which the person instils saline into one nostril and allows it to drain out of the other. Saline solutions are available over the counter and can be used alone or as an adjunct to other therapies.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of nasal saline irrigation in people with allergic rhinitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 November 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nasal saline irrigation, delivered by any means and with any volume, tonicity and alkalinity, with (a) no nasal saline irrigation or (b) other pharmacological treatments in adults and children with allergic rhinitis. We included studies comparing nasal saline versus no saline, where all participants also received pharmacological treatment (intranasal corticosteroids or oral antihistamines).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were patient-reported disease severity and a common adverse effect - epistaxis. Secondary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), individual symptom scores, general HRQL, the adverse effects of local irritation or discomfort, ear symptoms (pain or pressure) and nasal endoscopy scores. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included 14 studies (747 participants). The studies included children (seven studies, 499 participants) and adults (seven studies, 248 participants). No studies reported outcomes beyond three months follow-up. Saline volumes ranged from 'very low' to 'high' volume. Where stated, studies used either hypertonic or isotonic saline solution. Nasal saline versus no saline treatmentAll seven studies (112 adults; 332 children) evaluating this comparison used different scoring systems for patient-reported disease severity, so we pooled the data using the standardised mean difference (SMD). Saline irrigation may improve patient-reported disease severity compared with no saline at up to four weeks (SMD -1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.84 to -0.81; 407 participants; 6 studies; low quality) and between four weeks and three months (SMD -1.44, 95% CI -2.39 to -0.48; 167 participants; 5 studies; low quality). Although the evidence was low quality the SMD values at both time points are considered large effect sizes. Subgroup analysis showed the improvement in both adults and children. Subgroup analyses for volume and tonicity were inconclusive due to heterogeneity. Two studies reported methods for recording adverse effects and five studies mentioned them. Two studies (240 children) reported no adverse effects (epistaxis or local discomfort) in either group and three only reported no adverse effects in the saline group. One study (48 children) reported disease-specific HRQL using a modified RCQ-36 scale. It was uncertain whether there was a difference between the groups at any of the specified time points (very low quality). No other secondary outcomes were reported. Nasal saline versus no saline with adjuvant use of intranasal steroids or oral antihistamines Three studies (40 adults; 79 children) compared saline with intranasal steroids versus intranasal steroids alone; one study (14 adults) compared saline with oral antihistamines versus oral antihistamines alone. It is uncertain if there is a difference in patient-reported disease severity at up to four weeks (SMD -0.60, 95% CI -1.34 to 0.15; 32 participants; 2 studies; very low quality) or from four weeks to three months (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.85 to 0.21; 58 participants; 2 studies; very low quality). Although none of the studies reported methods for recording adverse effects, three mentioned them: one study (40 adults; adjuvant intranasal steroids) reported no adverse effects (epistaxis or local discomfort) in either group; the other two only reported no adverse effects in the saline group. It is uncertain if saline irrigation in addition to pharmacological treatment improved disease-specific HRQL at four weeks to three months, compared with pharmacological treatment alone (SMD -1.26, 95% CI -2.47 to -0.05; 54 participants; 2 studies; very low quality). No other secondary outcomes were reported. Nasal saline versus intranasal steroidsIt is uncertain if there was a difference in patient-reported disease severity between nasal saline and intranasal steroids at up to four weeks (MD 1.06, 95% CI -1.65 to 3.77; 14 participants; 1 study), or between four weeks and three months (SMD 1.26, 95% CI -0.92 to 3.43; 97 participants; 3 studies), or indisease-specific HRQL between four weeks and three months (SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.73 to 0.75; 83 participants; 2 studies). Only one study reported methods for recording adverse effects although three studies mentioned them. One (21 participants) reported two withdrawals due to adverse effects but did not describe these or state which group. Three studies reported no adverse effects (epistaxis or local discomfort) with saline, although one study reported that 27% of participants experienced local discomfort with steroid use. No other secondary outcomes were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Saline irrigation may reduce patient-reported disease severity compared with no saline irrigation at up to three months in both adults and children with allergic rhinitis, with no reported adverse effects. No data were available for any outcomes beyond three months. The overall quality of evidence was low or very low. The included studies were generally small and used a range of different outcome measures to report disease severity scores, with unclear validation. This review did not include direct comparisons of saline types (e.g. different volume, tonicity). Since saline irrigation could provide a cheap, safe and acceptable alternative to intranasal steroids and antihistamines further high-quality, adequately powered research in this area is warranted.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^114DCjC1]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Sinus physiology and pressure changes with ostial obstruction — With obstruction, oxygen concentrations can decrease to close to 0% and this anaerobic condition is seen only with purulent secretions and not with nonpurulent secretions. Pressure decreases can range from 20 to 30 mm H2O, with the lowest pressure being 266 mm H2O, and transudation starts when the pressure is lower than 20 to 30 mm H2O below 0 mm H2O; in acute purulent sinusitis, pressure can be as high as 100 mm H2O. During deep sea diving, pressures can exceed 350 to 500 mm H2O, and when there is obstruction, changes similar to diving can occur with flying, which is why pilots are not permitted to fly when they have a cold.

### Management of thyroid eye disease: a consensus statement by the American Thyroid Association and the European Thyroid Association [^114TEGrX]. Thyroid (2022). High credibility.

Orbital decompression for inactive moderate-to-severe thyroid eye disease (TED) is characterized by its indications, expected effect size, and complications. Orbital decompression reduces intraorbital pressure and proptosis resulting from expanded orbital tissues by removal of bony walls, resection of orbital fat, or both, with indications including disfiguring proptosis, chronic orbital congestion, globe subluxation, and DON. Expected benefit is approximately 2 mm of proptosis reduction for each wall removed or 2 cm3 of fat excision. Technical considerations include that a posterior ethmoidectomy can decompress the optic nerve and greater reduction may be achieved by removing the bony medial wall and/or floor, opening the periorbital envelope, and displacing orbital fat and muscle into adjoining sinuses. A rare indication is relief of severe longstanding soft tissue congestion in patients with high CAS/VISA inflammatory scores without recent progression and nonsresponsive to medical intervention, in whom improved venous drainage can result in dramatic improvement in orbital soft tissue changes and relieve orbital pain. Complications include site-specific risks such as cerebrospinal fluid leak, oscillopsia, cheek numbness, inferior displacement of the globe, sinusitis, and anesthesia of the upper jaw and nose; new-onset strabismus may develop in 7–34% of cases, and in fat-targeted disease one large series showed new diplopia persisting at 6 months after retro-orbital fat dissection in 8.6% of patients.
