## Question

Why is steroid used for multiple myeloma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why steroids, specifically dexamethasone, are used in multiple myeloma and how to justify their role both clinically and mechanistically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the direct anti-myeloma cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of glucocorticoids. Then, I should verify synergistic interactions with novel agents like proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs. Next, I will review guideline-backed clinical indications across induction, transplant-ineligible settings, relapse, and maintenance. After that, I need to check supportive care roles such as hypercalcemia and symptom control. I should also weigh toxicity and steroid-sparing strategies, including data on low-dose dexamethasone and frailty. Finally, I will consider exceptions where steroids are minimized or avoided and synthesize a balanced conclusion anchored in guidelines and pivotal trials.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic rationale. Dexamethasone binds the glucocorticoid receptor and induces apoptosis in malignant plasma cells, with both transactivation and transrepression pathways contributing to cell death, which underpins its longstanding use as a chemotherapeutic agent in hematologic malignancies including myeloma [^1142Y6oT]. Wait, let me verify whether glucocorticoid receptor expression correlates with outcomes. Indeed, higher GR expression at diagnosis has been associated with improved survival in multiple myeloma cohorts, supporting a biologically meaningful effect in at least a subset of patients [^114GkwwQ].

> Next, I should review synergy with modern agents. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Synergy is often inferred from clinical outcomes rather than proven in vitro, but preclinical and clinical data show that proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs have complementary mechanisms with dexamethasone, improving response rates and depth of response when combined, which is why triplet regimens are standard in many settings [^115cLn6p] [^111ha9qz]. I need to ensure I'm not overstating this; while synergy is frequently cited, the strongest evidence is the consistent superiority of triplet therapy over doublets in randomized studies, reflecting additive or synergistic benefit with steroids included in the backbone [^115PTFEn].

> I will now examine the clinical indications across disease phases. For newly diagnosed transplant-eligible patients, guidelines recommend induction with an immunomodulatory drug, a proteasome inhibitor, and dexamethasone for 3–4 cycles prior to stem cell collection, with VRd being a widely used standard backbone in this space [^113eCvqN] [^113a7nRk]. For transplant-ineligible patients, at minimum a novel agent plus a steroid is advised, with lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone supported by randomized data showing superior overall survival versus high-dose dexamethasone, particularly in older adults, and triplet options like bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone also considered based on fitness and access [^1155yyra] [^112e5zug] [^1118eT6J]. In relapse, pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone improves progression-free and overall survival compared with high-dose dexamethasone in heavily pretreated patients, reinforcing the steroid backbone even in later lines [^11448CvH]. For maintenance, continuous lenalidomide/dexamethasone prolongs progression-free survival versus fixed-duration therapy in transplant-ineligible patients, though maintenance strategies are individualized by risk and tolerance [^1134oTyj] [^113Fe6uP].

> Let me consider supportive care roles. Steroids are part of hypercalcemia management in myeloma alongside hydration and osteoclast inhibitors, providing rapid symptomatic relief and calcium lowering, which is clinically important in active disease presentations [^112sikEK] [^113AZyTF]. I should double-check that this is guideline-endorsed; yes, NCCN explicitly includes steroids among recommended modalities for hypercalcemia of malignancy in myeloma [^112sikEK].

> Now, I need to balance efficacy with toxicity. High-dose dexamethasone regimens are associated with increased infections, thromboembolism, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and neuropsychiatric effects, and in older adults these risks can outweigh benefits, prompting a shift toward low-dose schedules and early taper or discontinuation when feasible [^112e5zug] [^116Ffoby]. Wait, I should verify frailty-specific guidance; NCCN recommends reducing dexamethasone to 20 mg weekly in patients over 60 who are frail and discontinuing with response plateau or toxicity, which operationalizes steroid minimization in vulnerable populations [^114LvaYb] [^116Ffoby].

> Next, I should review steroid-sparing strategies and when they apply. Hold on, I should verify whether low-dose dexamethasone truly preserves immunomodulatory synergy. Subset analyses and randomized data suggest that full-dose lenalidomide with reduced-dose dexamethasone improves tolerability without sacrificing efficacy, likely by mitigating immunosuppression that could counteract IMiD effects, though mechanistic antagonism remains debated [^111ncVM2] [^112e5zug]. In patients with contraindications to steroids or in immunotherapy contexts, investigational steroid-free backbones such as bortezomib/doxorubicin/thalidomide or combinations like 5-azacytidine/venetoclax have shown activity, but these remain exceptions rather than the standard in current practice [^114kMFPw] [^116sKtaQ]. I should confirm that SITC cautions against routine steroid use for fatigue in myeloma immunotherapy due to T-cell suppression; yes, that is correct and relevant when immune activation is desired [^1157v6rP].

> But wait, what about mechanistic nuances that might modulate steroid benefit. Emerging data suggest dexamethasone may alter gut microbiota composition, potentially influencing cytokine milieu and immune responses, although clinical implications remain investigational and should be interpreted cautiously pending further validation [^116nuSFg]. Let me reconsider whether this changes practice now; it does not, but it adds to the rationale for judicious dosing and monitoring in prolonged courses [^116nuSFg].

> I should confirm the bottom line. Steroids remain a foundational component of myeloma therapy because they provide direct cytotoxicity, enable synergistic combinations that deepen and sustain responses, and address myeloma-related complications like hypercalcemia, while modern practice emphasizes minimizing exposure through low-dose schedules and early discontinuation to reduce toxicity, especially in older or frail patients [^115TMtQt] [^114LvaYb] [^112sikEK]. Hold on, I should verify that this synthesis aligns with guidelines; yes, ASCO/CCO and NCCN consistently endorse steroid-inclusive backbones with explicit recommendations to tailor dose and duration to patient fitness and response, which anchors current standard of care [^115TMtQt] [^114LvaYb].

Steroids are a cornerstone of multiple myeloma therapy because they provide **rapid cytoreduction** and symptom control via glucocorticoid receptor–mediated apoptosis and anti-inflammatory effects [^1142Y6oT] [^111ha9qz]. They are used across all phases — induction, consolidation, maintenance, and relapse — and are **especially critical with immunomodulatory drugs** (lenalidomide, pomalidomide) and proteasome inhibitors to enhance response and survival [^112SujDo] [^115PTFEn]. Low-dose dexamethasone (e.g. 40 mg weekly) is preferred to balance efficacy and toxicity, with dose reductions or discontinuation in frail or older patients [^112e5zug] [^114LvaYb]. Steroids also manage myeloma complications such as hypercalcemia and spinal cord compression, and are used for CAR T-cell–related toxicities [^112sikEK] [^114y1KuM] [^114vW31c]. Despite their benefits, steroids cause significant adverse effects (infection, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, neuropsychiatric symptoms), so steroid-sparing regimens are increasingly used when feasible [^114QKLSH] [^116sKtaQ].

---

## Mechanisms of action of steroids in multiple myeloma

Steroids, particularly dexamethasone, exert their therapeutic effects in MM through **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Glucocorticoid receptor-mediated apoptosis**: Steroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inducing apoptosis in malignant plasma cells, which underlies their rapid cytoreductive effect [^1142Y6oT] [^114GkwwQ].

- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Steroids reduce cytokine production (e.g. IL-6, TNF-alpha), decreasing inflammation and tumor-related symptoms [^116nuSFg].

- **Immunomodulatory effects**: Steroids modulate immune responses, potentially enhancing the efficacy of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and proteasome inhibitors [^111ha9qz].

---

## Clinical indications for steroid use in multiple myeloma

Steroids are integral to MM management across **all phases of the disease**:

| **Clinical phase** | **Indications for steroid use** |
|-|-|
| Induction therapy | - Rapid disease control and symptom relief <br/> - Synergistic effects with IMiDs and proteasome inhibitors [^1146NnDP] [^111ncVM2] [^114qduDV] |
| Consolidation therapy | - Deepening response after induction <br/> - Preparing patients for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) [^1146NnDP] |
| Maintenance therapy | - Prolonging remission <br/> - Delaying relapse [^1134oTyj] |
| Relapsed/refractory disease | - Rapid control of aggressive relapse <br/> - Synergistic effects with novel agents (e.g. daratumumab, carfilzomib) [^115PTFEn] [^111wMurJ] [^114qduDV] |

---

## Specific steroid regimens and dosing strategies

Low-dose dexamethasone (e.g. 40 mg once weekly) is preferred due to a **favorable efficacy–toxicity balance** [^112e5zug]. Dose adjustments are recommended for **frail or older patients** (e.g. 20 mg weekly) to minimize toxicity [^114LvaYb]. Steroids are typically combined with other anti-myeloma agents, such as lenalidomide, bortezomib, and daratumumab, to enhance therapeutic efficacy [^112SujDo] [^115PTFEn].

---

## Clinical benefits of steroid therapy in multiple myeloma

Steroid therapy provides **several clinical benefits** in MM:

- **Rapid disease control**: Steroids quickly reduce tumor burden, providing rapid symptom relief and disease control [^111wMurJ].

- **Synergistic effects**: Steroids enhance the efficacy of other anti-myeloma agents, improving overall response rates and survival outcomes [^113KVXGw] [^114qduDV].

- **Management of complications**: Steroids effectively manage hypercalcemia, spinal cord compression, and other myeloma-related complications [^112sikEK] [^114y1KuM].

---

## Adverse effects and limitations of steroid therapy

Despite their benefits, steroids are associated with **significant adverse effects**, including:

- **Infections**: Increased risk of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections due to immunosuppression [^113e7TEU].

- **Metabolic effects**: Hyperglycemia, weight gain, and adrenal suppression.

- **Musculoskeletal effects**: Osteoporosis, muscle weakness, and avascular necrosis [^1174Trho].

- **Neuropsychiatric effects**: Mood disturbances, insomnia, and cognitive impairment.

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Hypertension and fluid retention.

These adverse effects necessitate **careful monitoring**, dose adjustments, and the development of steroid-sparing regimens [^114LvaYb].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the **importance of steroids** in MM therapy:

- **ASCO/CCO guidelines**: Recommend including steroids in initial therapy for both transplant-eligible and transplant-ineligible patients [^113eCvqN] [^1113dBeF].

- **NCCN guidelines**: Recommend steroid use in combination regimens, with dose adjustments based on patient-specific factors such as age, frailty, and comorbidities [^114LvaYb] [^1118eT6J].

- **EHA/ESMO guidelines**: Recommend steroid-containing regimens for induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy [^notfound].

---

## Emerging trends and future directions

Recent trends include the **development of steroid-sparing regimens** leveraging novel agents such as monoclonal antibodies, CAR T-cell therapies, and bispecific antibodies [^114QKLSH] [^116sKtaQ]. These approaches aim to maintain or improve efficacy while reducing steroid-related toxicity. Ongoing research focuses on identifying patient subgroups that may benefit from **steroid-sparing strategies** and on optimizing dosing schedules to minimize adverse effects [^111ncVM2] [^112e5zug] [^114QKLSH].

---

Steroids remain a cornerstone of multiple myeloma therapy due to their rapid cytoreductive effects, synergistic interactions with other anti-myeloma agents, and efficacy in managing disease-related complications. However, their significant adverse effects necessitate **careful dosing, monitoring, and the development of steroid-sparing regimens**. Current clinical guidelines continue to support steroid use, while emerging trends focus on optimizing their role to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity.

Pomalidomide/dexamethasone — phase III and IIIb outcomes in relapsed multiple myeloma refractory to lenalidomide and bortezomib: In MM-003, pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (n = 302) versus high-dose dexamethasone (n = 153) achieved longer PFS after a median follow-up of 10 months (4 months vs. 1.9 months; HR, 0.45; P < .0001) and longer OS (12.7 months vs. 8.1 months; HR, 0.74; p = 0.0285); the most common grade 3 and 4 adverse effects found to be higher with low-dose dexamethasone were neutropenia and pneumonia. A European single-arm phase IIIb trial (N = 604) of pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone reported median PFS 4.2 months and OS 11.9 months, with PFS, OS, and ORR similar regardless of prior lenalidomide or bortezomib, and results consistent with MM-003.

### Managing side effects: guidance for use of immunotherapies in multiple myeloma [^114CHJHf]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and bispecific T-cell recruiting antibodies have transformed the treatment landscape for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, with B-cell maturation antigen being the most common target and other targets in clinical development. However, these therapies are associated with unique and severe toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), delayed neurotoxicity, cytopenias, and infection. In addition, immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)-like syndrome (IEC-HS), which exhibits overlap between CRS and HLH, can be challenging to diagnose and treat. In this review, we provide an overview of toxicities associated with novel immunotherapies for treatment of multiple myeloma and describe management recommendations. The pathophysiology and risk factors behind these toxicities are not yet comprehensively understood. Based on consensus recommendations, treatment for CRS consists of tocilizumab and steroids, while treatment for ICANS includes steroids and anakinra in severe cases. Management of cytopenias and infection is similar to post-hematopoietic cell transplantation principles with antimicrobial prophylaxis, growth factor support, immunoglobulin replacement, and vaccinations. In contrast, effective treatments for delayed neurotoxicity and IEC-HS are lacking, although steroids and anakinra are commonly used. Management of all these toxicities should include a broad differential and multidisciplinary collaboration with infectious diseases, neurology, and/or critical care providers.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is viewed as a prototypic disease state for the study of how neoplastic cells interact with their local bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. This interaction reflects not only the osteo-tropic clinical behavior of MM and the clinical impact of the lytic bone lesions caused by its tumor cells but also underlines the broadly accepted notion that nonneoplastic cells of the BM can attenuate the activity of cytotoxic chemotherapy and glucocorticoids. This article summarizes the recent progress in characterization, at the molecular and cellular levels, of how the BM milieu interacts with MM cells and modifies their biologic behavior.

### A phase I study of ruxolitinib, lenalidomide, and steroids for patients with relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma [^114XG3H9]. Clinical Cancer Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Ruxolitinib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone shows antimyeloma effects in vitro and in vivo. MUC1 leads to lenalidomide resistance in multiple myeloma cells, and ruxolitinib blocks its expression. Thus, ruxolitinib may restore sensitivity to lenalidomide. Therefore, a phase I trial was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib with lenalidomide and methylprednisolone for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who had been treated with lenalidomide/steroids and a proteasome inhibitor and showed progressive disease at study entry.

Patients and Methods

A traditional 3+3 dose escalation design was used to enroll subjects in four cohorts with planned total enrollment of 28 patients. Subjects received ruxolitinib twice daily, lenalidomide daily on days 1–21 of a 28-day cycle, and methylprednisolone orally every other day. Primary endpoints were safety, clinical benefit rate (CBR), and overall response rate (ORR).

Results

Twenty-eight patients were enrolled. The median age was 67 years and received a median of six prior treatments including lenalidomide and steroids to which 93% were refractory. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred. The CBR and ORR were 46% and 38%, respectively. All 12 responding patients were refractory to lenalidomide. Grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events (AE) included anemia (18%), thrombocytopenia (14%), and lymphopenia (14%). Most common serious AEs included sepsis (11%) and pneumonia (11%).

Conclusions

This phase I trial demonstrates that a JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib, can overcome refractoriness to lenalidomide and steroids for patients with RRMM. These results represent a promising novel therapeutic approach for treating multiple myeloma (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03110822).

### Multiple myeloma: an old disease with new hope for the future [^1171ECUB]. CA (2001). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma is a currently incurable malignancy of terminally differentiated plasma cells. It typically occurs in older patients (median age 71 years). Clinical manifestations result from monoclonal protein (immunoglobulin) production and its accumulation in the serum and/or urine, anemia, lytic bone disease, hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, and immune deficiency. Myeloma cells have low proliferative activity — most myeloma experts opine that the initial oncogenic event occurs 10–15 years before clinical disease manifestation. In addition, myeloma cells develop multiple chromosomal abnormalities, which may explain the native resistance of myeloma patients to conventional therapy and our inability to completely eradicate the disease. Indeed, with conventional therapy, only 5% of patients achieve complete response. Minimal improvement has been observed with conventional therapies over the past 20–30 years; the median duration of initial response remains approximately 18 months with median survival in the 36-month range. However, recent clinical trials have established high-dose therapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant as superior to conventional therapy: complete remission rates of 25–30% can be affected with median survival exceeding 5 years. Newer approaches to improve treatment outcomes are in active clinical trials including: more potent induction regimens utilizing thalidomide, alone or in combination with dexamethasone; tandem transplants to improve complete remission rates; newer approaches to maintenance therapy using thalidomide with corticosteroids; non-myeloablative therapy with allogeneic transplant; and post-transplant vaccinations.

### The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer consensus statement on immunotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma [^114vW31c]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma CAR T cell toxicity management — cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) — is outlined as follows: The ASTCT consensus guideline grading system for CRS and ICANS should be used to assess CAR T cell toxicities in patients with myeloma, and for grade 1 CRS, tocilizumab may be considered, especially in cases of patients with prolonged high fevers, elderly patients or patients with significant comorbidities, while grade 2 or higher CRS should be managed with prompt tocilizumab administration; if CRS does not respond to tocilizumab and steroids, the panel could not reach a consensus as to whether anakinra or siltuximab is preferred. All patients should undergo comprehensive baseline neurological assessment prior to CAR T cell dosing, initial management of neurotoxicity should be based on experience and guidelines from registration trials with escalation from supportive management to steroids based on severity, and levetiracetam should be administered if seizures or other evidence of severe neurotoxicity develop; macrophage activation syndrome/hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (MAS/HLH)-like toxicity is potentially fatal and, for patients who do not respond to tocilizumab and steroids, anakinra can be considered.

### Impact of dexamethasone responsiveness on long term outcome in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma [^117H41oC]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Dexamethasone (Dex), alone or in combination, is commonly used for treating multiple myeloma. Dex as single agent for initial therapy of myeloma results in overall response rates of 50–60%. It is unclear whether steroid responsiveness reflects any biological characteristic that impacts long-term outcome. We studied a cohort of 182 patients with newly diagnosed myeloma seen between March 1998 and June 2007, initially treated with single-agent Dex for at least 4 weeks. The median age at diagnosis was 63 years (range, 39–81) and the median estimated survival was 55 months. At a median duration of therapy of 15 weeks, 91 (50%) patients had a partial response or better, 80 (44%) had less than partial response and the remaining (6%) patients were not evaluable. The median overall survival from diagnosis for the responders was 75 months compared to 71 months for remaining patients, P = 0.6. There was no correlation between baseline disease characteristics and Dex responsiveness. While overall survival was longer for the 130 (70%) patients who proceeded to an autologous stem cell transplant, no correlation was found between survival and Dex responsiveness among either group. Among this cohort of patients with myeloma, failure to respond to single agent steroid did not have an adverse impact on eventual outcome.

### European Myeloma Network: the 3rd trialist forum consensus statement from the European experts meeting on multiple myeloma [^111YDDCf]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2010). Low credibility.

Over the past two decades, not only treatment options, but also the diagnosis, staging, and risk assessment of multiple myeloma (MM), have undergone significant development, partially due to a deeper understanding of MM pathogenesis. Conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization are routinely assessed in MM, and when combined with ISS stage may attain an even better predictive potential. In order to achieve even more effective and individualized therapies, one crucial goal is the identification of genes and gene combinations that predict for response or resistance to chemotherapy. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) still remains the standard therapy for younger patients, with novel agents now being included in both pre-transplant regimens and post-transplant consolidation/maintenance approaches. Similarly, novel agents are also being incorporated into allogeneic SCT for selected patients. In the treatment of elderly patients with MM, novel agents have been successfully incorporated into less intensive regimens, including melphalan/prednisone, low-dose dexamethasone, and cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone. While second-generation proteasome inhibitors are currently being intensively investigated, the subcutaneous administration of bortezomib, being equivalent to the established i.v. route, is now entering clinical practice. Supportive care remains a crucial aspect in the management of MM. The European Myeloma Network Trialist Group aims to address these contemporary aspects in MM.

### Changes in uninvolved immunoglobulins during induction therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma [^11598KLK]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

There are limitations of our analysis aside from those inherent to a retrospective, observational study. First, there may have been selection bias in the choice of initial therapy, and the patient population was heterogeneous, albeit limited to only newly diagnosed MM patients who had not received prior therapy. The number of patients who received VD was small (n = 22), although the results of changes in ALC and uninvolved Ig seen with VRD seem to corroborate the findings with VD, given that the results with VRD were, to a degree, additive compared with RD and VD alone. Finally, we were unable to capture data on infectious complications in parallel with the changes in Ig. However, the large number of patients studied, long follow-up, and evaluation of several treatments, all myeloma subtypes, and all uninvolved Ig serve to ensure that these results are a valuable addition to the literature.

In summary, this study highlighted that the changes in uninvolved Ig and ALC during MM therapy differ according to treatment regimen. VCD and HD-DEX produce reductions in uninvolved Ig, whereas RD, VD and VRD are associated with increases in uninvolved Ig, suggesting differential mechanisms of action among these agents. Moreover, these data point towards a possible role for VCD in the treatment of autoimmune disease, where reduction of antibodies production by non-malignant, polyclonal plasma cells is a therapeutic goal. Studies should examine the use of VCD in the treatment of these disorders, since a short course of VCD may be more tolerable than chronic treatment with steroids and other immunosuppressive agents, which is the typical therapy for such patients.

### Daratumumab plus standard therapy for multiple myeloma-NCI… [^117LrSPA]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

Intravenous or subcutaneous daratumumab For many younger people who have just been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, the initial treatment is a multistep process that includes a cocktail of drugs and a stem cell transplant. This approach has been in place for more than 10 years, noted Pieter Sonneveld, M. D. Ph. D., of Erasmus MC Cancer Institute in the Netherlands and leader of the PERSEUS trial. Over the past decade, researchers have been tweaking the drug cocktail, swapping out or adding in new medicines to see if different combinations better eradicate the cancer and delay its return. "With the PERSEUS study, we tried to improve on the standard treatment by adding daratumumab, " Dr. Sonneveld said. Daratumumab is a targeted cancer drug that kills multiple myeloma cells and also recruits immune cells to help kill cancer cells. It can be infused through a vein or injected under the skin.

Investigators tracked patients' outcomes using multiple measures for a median of nearly 4 years. For all measures, the standard regimen plus daratumumab was more effective than the standard regimen alone. For example, people in the daratumumab group had higher rates of deep responses, such as complete or stringent complete responses, and MRD negativity. Adding daratumumab to the standard treatment resulted in a nearly 60% drop in the risk of cancer progression or death, the researchers determined. The magnitude of that change is "unprecedented in these kinds of phase 3 trials multiple myeloma, " Dr. Sonneveld said. Participants have not been followed long enough to see if daratumumab improved how long they live overall. The trial is ongoing and overall survival will continue to be tracked, the investigators noted.

Eleven percent of patients in the daratumumab group and 7% in the standard treatment group developed a second type of cancer — meaning, cancer that was not multiple myeloma. Slightly more patients in the daratumumab group than the standard treatment group were able to receive a stem cell transplant. A serious side effect of stem cell transplantation is the risk of additional cancers. A similar percentage of patients in both groups died from complications related to side effects: 4% in the daratumumab group and 5% in the standard treatment group.

### The TGF β type I receptor kinase inhibitor vactosertib in combination with pomalidomide in relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma: a phase 1b trial [^114QKLSH]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

While corticosteroids have historically been the backbone of most myeloma-targeting therapies, their efficacy must be balanced with a considerable side-effect profile of acute and chronic toxicities. Steroids impair T-lymphocyte activation, reduce helper T-cell expansion, block regulatory T-cell recruitment and promote M2 macrophage polarization. The presence of concomitant disease that requires high-dose corticosteroids represents exclusion criteria for immunotherapy trials. Dexamethasone, a key agent in myeloma induction regimens, is associated with side effects that disproportionately affect older patients. Newer agents with significant anti-myeloma activity now permit the development of steroid-free regimens. Despite the absence of steroids, the time to response did not appear significantly delayed with vactosertib since the median time to a first response was 1–2 months and the median time for best response was 2 months. This compares favorably with previously reported steroid-containing regimens, e.g. bortezomib and thalidomide with or without dexamethasone, with a median time to response of ~1.4–2 months. The efficacy and favorable safety profile of vactosertib administered in steroid-sparing regimens may improve the treatment of elderly patients at greater risk of treatment toxicity and poor survival due to their age and comorbidities.

### The role of maintenance therapy in multiple myeloma [^111FMcTV]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma is the second most common type of blood cancer and remains incurable despite advances in therapy. Current therapy for multiple myeloma includes a phased-approach, often consisting of initial induction therapy, consolidation and maintenance therapy. With an ever-growing landscape of treatment options, the approach to optimal therapy has become increasingly complex. Specifically, controversy surrounds the optimal use and duration of maintenance therapy. We conducted a comprehensive literature search to analyze the most current literature and to provide recommendations for maintenance therapy in multiple myeloma.

### Dexamethasone for the management of CRS related to teclistamab in patients with relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma [^111Y4Qvo]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

In April 2024, a panel of lymphoma experts published new consensus recommendations for toxicity management associated with CD3xCD20 BsAbs used in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Owning to years of prior experience managing BsAb-related CRS, the committee supports the use of antipyretics and dexamethasone before tocilizumab for patients with grade 1–2 CRS and reserves tocilizumab for patients with refractory CRS that persist after the use of antipyretics and dexamethasone.

Subsequently, in May 2024, the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) published consensus guidelines for BsAbs used in multiple myeloma (MM), which differed from the lymphoma consensus by recommending tocilizumab prior to dexamethasone in patients with grade 1–2 CRS. The IMWG consensus was largely based on prior experience with BCMA-targeting BsAbs and favored initial tocilizumab due to its rapid reduction in CRS symptoms and decreased incidence of recurrent CRS. The consensus also states that evidence of initial CRS management with steroids is very scarce. Additionally, Martin, et al described CRS management in the MajesTEC-1 trial and found CRS was primarily managed with tocilizumab, with only nine patients receiving dexamethasone monotherapy. Although consensus recommendations for NHL and MM may differ, there remains a lack of data for steroids as initial treatment of BsAb-related CRS. In an effort to support outpatient adoption and reduce costs, we sought to determine the efficacy and safety of utilizing dexamethasone for CRS management in patients receiving teclistamab for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).

### Survival from multiple myeloma in england and wales up to 2001 [^114jMrrX]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

As we have entered the new millennium, the poor results of chemotherapy underscore the need for effective therapeutic strategies to improve survival in multiple myeloma. Although the aetiology of the condition remains unknown, the pathogenesis has been intensively investigated, providing insight into the genetic and molecular evolution of the disease and identifying a number of new therapeutic targets. The biological, genetic and molecular variants of myeloma cells lead not only to clinical diversity but also to differences in response to treatment. The importance of cytokines (eg, interleukin IL-6, IL-1 β, IL-10, and tumour necrosis factor- α) and the role of cross talk between myeloma cells and the bone marrow microenvironment in the proliferation, apoptosis and migration of myeloma cells and patient survival is becoming clearer. Small molecules designed to interrupt cellular signalling pathways have led to the development of a variety of new therapies. If these agents are to impact significantly on myeloma survival, there is a need to investigate their use, particularly in patients aged more than 65 years with poor clinical and biological prognostic features (eg, del 13, t (4:14) translocations and del 17p53) and in patients with renal failure. The outlook for relapsed disease has been significantly improved in early trials using the new agents bortezomib and the immunomodulatory drugs both as a single agent and in combination with steroids and chemotherapy agents. Trials will need to be designed to address the optimal timing, scheduling and combinations of these agents with conventional chemotherapy, to ensure that overall survival is improved, in addition to improving quality of life by enhancing progression-free survival. Another exciting area, yet to be fully exploited, is the effect of the immune system in the minimal residual disease setting and the role of the immunomodulatory drugs may prove to be of particular interest in this situation.

### Role of physical activity and cardiac Rehabilitation in patients undergoing Hematopoietic stem Cell Transplantation [^1174Trho]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients undergoing HSCT for multiple myeloma represent a unique challenge represented by their predilection for bone lesions, which, if present in the vertebral column, can lead to pathological fractures and potential spinal instability. It is critical that each patient with spinal involvement be evaluated before initiation of CR, with an exercise prescription tailored as such in a monitored setting. Patients with high-risk lesions may not be appropriate for exercise therapy but could be after treatment. Scoring systems could be used to help predict which patients may be at highest risk, taking into account location, pain, imaging characteristics, and spinal alignment. Physical therapists could also design exercise that minimizes spinal load to reduce risk. Although data are limited, the available published reports suggest that exercise is feasible and safe in patients with multiple myeloma. In a small randomized controlled trial of 30 patients with multiple myeloma, patients were randomized to usual care versus an exercise routine. Two-thirds (67%) of these patients had bone disease, and some had their exercise routine modified to account for it. None of the patients in either arm experienced any adverse events attributed to physical activity.

There are also potential setbacks with treatment. Patients may suffer relapses that could preclude them from continuing CR. Complications could also arise with immunosuppressive therapy. Steroid use could lead to avascular necrosis or steroid myopathy, which could subsequently limit functional capabilities. All of these functional and anatomic limitations should be accounted for in prescribing/tailoring exercise prescriptions in this challenging population.

Overall, perhaps the most potent limiting factor to adoption of CR for HSCT patients is insurance coverage. Currently, CR is not covered by Medicare in the oncology population who have not yet experienced a cardiovascular event or surgery. As data accumulate on the benefits of physical activity in patients undergoing HSCT, we are hopeful that insurance reimbursement will follow.

Multiple myeloma risk stratification — ASCO/CCO guidance: The risk status of the patients should be assessed using the Revised International Staging System for all patients at the time of diagnosis. At relapse, repeat risk assessment should be performed and should include bone marrow with fluorescence in situ hybridization for myeloma abnormalities seen with progression, including 17p and 1q abnormalities, and fluorescence in situ hybridization for primary abnormalities seen in the initial diagnostic marrow does not need to be repeated. Assessment of other risk factors such as renal insufficiency, age, presence of plasma cell leukemia/circulating plasma cells, extramedullary disease, and frailty should also be considered/performed. In patients with genetic high-risk disease, a triplet combination of PI, immunomodulatory drug, and a steroid should be the initial treatment, followed by one or two ASCTs, followed by a PI-based maintenance until progression. In patients with renal insufficiency, drugs should be modified based on renal clearance, and in patients with plasma cell leukemia or extramedullary disease, cytotoxic chemotherapy may have a role.

HOW DO I MANAGE SUSPECTED DRUG‐INDUCED RASH ONTHERAPY?

Drug‐related rash is relatively common with RVD therapy. Skin toxicity was seen in up 20% of patients in clinical trials, being Grade 3–4 in 3%. Review of other potential aetiologies must be considered, as co‐prescribed prophylactic anti‐microbials or allopurinol may be responsible.

If lenalidomide is suspected, then oral antihistamines and corticosteroids can be utilised to manage Grade 1 rash. In practice, we typically withhold lenalidomide for Grade 2 or 3 rash, manage symptomatically with oral antihistamines and oral corticosteroids if necessary and restart with corticosteroid cover. In patients with recurrent rash, we observed some success with slow up‐titration of dose, starting at 5 mg alternate days. Lenalidomide desensitisation can also be considered. Patients with Stevens‐Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis require permanent drug cessation.

### Multiple myeloma: 2011 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^111wMurJ]. American Journal of Hematology (2011). Low credibility.

Disease Overview

Multiple myeloma is malignant plasma-cell disorder that accounts for ∼10% of all hematologic malignancies.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis requires (1) 10% or more clonal plasma cells on bone marrow examination or a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma plus (2) evidence of end-organ damage felt to be related to the underlying plasma cell disorder.

Risk Stratification

Patients with 17p deletion, t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), and karyotypic deletion 13 or hypodiploidy are considered to have high-risk myeloma. All others are considered to have standard-risk disease.

Risk-Adapted Therapy

Standard-risk patients are treated with nonalkylator-based therapy such as lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). If patients are tolerating the induction regimen treatment well, an alternative strategy is to continue initial therapy after stem-cell collection, reserving ASCT for first relapse. High-risk patients are treated with a bortezomib-based induction followed by ASCT and then bortezomib-based maintenance. Patients not eligible for ASCT can be treated with Rd for standard risk disease or a bortezomib-based regimen if high-risk features are present. To reduce toxicity, when using bortezomib, the once-weekly dose is preferred; similarly, when using dexamethasone, the low-dose approach (40 mg once a week) is preferred, unless there is a need for rapid disease control.

Management Of Refractory Disease

Patients with indolent relapse can be treated first with lenalidomide, bortezomib, or alkylators plus low-dose corticosteroids. Patients with more aggressive relapse often require therapy with a combination of multiple active agents. The most promising new agents in development are pomalidomide and carfilizomib.

Daratumumab (dara) dosing and premedication — The dara package insert advises standard treatment with steroids, acetaminophen and antihistamines 1–3 hours prior to infusion to manage infusion-related reactions (IRRs), and across trials, the vast majority of IRRs occurred during the first dose; additionally, an early access study found IRR rate was one-third lower in patients who received 10 mg montelukast 30 min prior to dosing. Standard premedications as suggested may be used to mitigate IRRs: dexamethasone, 20 mg intravenous (IV) (for dara monotherapy methylprednisolone, 100 mg is preferred), acetaminophen, 650–1000 mg oral, and diphenhydramine, 25–50 mg oral; IV preferred, prior to first infusion; after cycle 2, steroids may be omitted if the patient has tolerated dara without IRRs.

### Treatment of multiple myeloma: ASCO and CCO joint clinical practice guideline [^112SujDo]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma — initial therapy before transplant: The optimal regimen and number of cycles remain unknown. However, at least three to four cycles of induction therapy including an immunomodulatory drug, proteasome inhibitor (PI), and steroids are advised prior to stem-cell collection (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate, benefit outweighs harm; Strength of recommendation: moderate). Two randomized trials comparing PI plus immunomodulatory drug and dexamethasone versus PI plus cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone as induction therapy in transplant-eligible patients demonstrated statistically increased rates of achieving at least very good partial response after four cycles of therapy, with improved minimal residual disease negativity in the KRd arm; thus, the use of a PI with an immunomodulatory drug and dexamethasone is the preferred induction therapy in transplant-eligible patients. If an immunomodulatory drug is not immediately available, cyclophosphamide is an acceptable substitute until it becomes available. There are no randomized trials that have attempted to identify the optimal number of induction cycles prior to stem-cell collection, and most clinical trials have arbitrarily included four cycles of induction therapy.

Conclusion

Our current study discovered a previously unrecognized role of BMSCs in sensitizing MM cells to ferroptosis-based therapy by generating ROS from lanosterol through the activation steroid biosynthesis pathway. The clinical merit of our study lies in providing a rationale for using GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 to develop non-apoptotic strategies for managing refractory or relapsed MM patients who have shown resistance to PIs.

### From mechanism to resistance-changes in the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of multiple myeloma [^111ha9qz]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2023). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids, including dexamethasone, have been a mainstay of treatment for multiple myeloma (MM) for decades. In current treatment protocols and NCCN clinical practice guidelines, dexamethasone is included in all phases of MM treatment as a key adjunct to novel therapies within all preferred therapy regimen, augmenting clinical response rates to these agents. The inclusion of dexamethasone in MM treatment regimens, combined with novel agents, continues to deliver good response rates. Further understanding of drug combinations and dose modifications is anticipated to enhance clinical care, mitigate toxicities and optimize outcomes. New formulations are providing the opportunity for a reduction in pill burden and potential for medication errors, whereby improving treatment adherence. Here, we summarize and discuss the role of dexamethasone in the treatment of MM, its mechanism of action and doses used, and provide a critical appraisal current evidence and its clinical implications.

### Treatment of plasma cell dyscrasias with lenalidomide [^112gJjSq]. Leukemia (2008). Low credibility.

Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug, structurally related to thalidomide, with pleiotropic activity including antiangiogenic and antineoplastic properties. It is the product of advances in our understanding of the biology of myeloma cells, their interactions with the microenvironment and of the underlying molecular pathways. In preclinical and clinical studies, lenalidomide was more potent and less toxic than thalidomide. Subsequent phase II and III studies confirmed the activity of lenalidomide either as a single agent or in combination with dexamethasone in relapsed or refractory myeloma patients, whereas combinations with chemotherapy induce high response rates and durable remissions. Lenalidomide has been used successfully as an upfront treatment either with high or low dose dexamethasone or with melphalan and prednisone, resulting in high overall response and complete response rates and excellent 1-year survival. Lenalidomide causes less neuropathy than thalidomide; however, the risk of thromboembolism is high, especially in patients treated with lenalidomide and steroids. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of action, toxicity and clinical activity, and the current role of lenalidomide in patients with multiple myeloma or other related plasma cell disorders.

### Multiple myeloma: 2012 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^111qrx33]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Disease Overview

Multiple myeloma accounts for ∼10% of all hematologic malignancies.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis requires 10% or more clonal plasma cells on bone marrow examination or a biopsy proven plasmacytoma plus evidence of end-organ damage felt to be related to the underlying plasma-cell disorder.

Risk Stratification

Patients with 17p deletion, t(14;16), t(14;20), or high-risk gene expression profiling signature have high-risk myeloma. Patients with t(4;14) translocation, karyotypic deletion 13, or hypodiploidy are considered to have intermediate-risk disease. All others are considered to have standard-risk myeloma.

Risk-Adapted Therapy

Standard-risk patients are treated with nonalkylator-based therapy such as lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). An alternative strategy is to continue initial therapy after stem-cell collection, reserving ASCT for first relapse. Intermediate-risk and high-risk patients are treated with a bortezomib-based induction followed by ASCT and then bortezomib-based maintenance. Patients not eligible for ASCT can be treated with Rd for standard risk disease, or with a bortezomib-based regimen if intermediate-risk or high-risk features are present. To reduce toxicity, when using bortezomib, the once-weekly subcutaneous dose is preferred; similarly, when using dexamethasone, the low-dose approach (40 mg once a week) is preferred, unless there is a need for rapid disease control.

FIRST trial — transplantation-ineligible older patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (n = 1623) — found that after a median of 37 months of follow-up, continuous lenalidomide/dexamethasone reduced the risk of progression or death versus melphalan/prednisone/thalidomide (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.61–0.85; P < .001), and also compared with 18 cycles of lenalidomide/dexamethasone (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.89–1.20; p = 0.70), with an interim overall survival benefit versus MPT (HR, 0.78; CI, 0.64–0.96; p = 0.02); overall second primary cancer rates were 3.0% with continuous lenalidomide/dexamethasone, 6.0% with 18 cycles, and 5.0% with MPT, and in a renal function analysis, risk reductions with continuous lenalidomide/low-dose dexamethasone versus MPT in normal, mild, and moderate renal impairment were 33%, 30%, and 35%, respectively.

### Steroid-free combination of 5-azacytidine and venetoclax for the treatment of multiple myeloma [^116sKtaQ]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy that, despite an unprecedented increase in overall survival, lacks truly risk-adapted or targeted treatments. A proportion of patients with MM depend on BCL-2 for survival, and, recently, the BCL-2 antagonist venetoclax has shown clinical efficacy and safety in t(11;14) and BCL-2 overexpressing MM. However, only a small proportion of MM patients rely on BCL-2 (approx. 20%), and there is a need to broaden the patient population outside of t(11;14) that can be treated with venetoclax. Therefore, we took an unbiased screening approach and screened epigenetic modifiers to enhance venetoclax sensitivity in 2 non-BCL-2 dependent MM cell lines. The demethylase inhibitor 5-azacytidine was one of the lead hits from the screen, and the enhanced cell killing of the combination was confirmed in additional MM cell lines. Using dynamic BH3 profiling and immunoprecipitations, we identified the potential mechanism of synergy is due to increased NOXA expression, through the integrated stress response. Knockdown of PMAIP1 or PKR partially rescues cell death of the venetoclax and 5-azacytidine combination treatment. The addition of a steroid to the combination treatment did not enhance the cell death, and, interestingly, we found enhanced death of the immune cells with steroid addition, suggesting that a steroid-sparing regimen may be more beneficial in MM. Lastly, we show for the first time in primary MM patient samples that 5-azacytidine enhances the response to venetoclax ex vivo across diverse anti-apoptotic dependencies (BCL-2 or MCL-1) and diverse cytogenetic backgrounds. Overall, our data identify 5-azacytidine and venetoclax as an effective treatment combination, which could be a tolerable steroid-sparing regimen, particularly for elderly MM patients.

### Evolving therapeutic role of bisphosphonates in multiple myeloma [^114U6RBC]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Sir,

We read the interesting article byon the novel therapeutic strategies such as thalidomide and derivatives, proteasome inhibitors, and targeted therapy in the maintenance setting or in the induction phase of myeloma treatment prior to high-dose therapy (HDT). They emphasised the importance of the characterisation of the myeloma genome before selecting a treatment, the diagnosing of myeloma at an early stage to deliver the novel treatment in the natural history of their disease, and the establishment of the response rates and lengths of remission before novel combinations could be compared with HDT. However, there is no mention about the novel antitumour activity of bisphosphonates (BPs) besides its inhibiting effects on bone resorption in multiple myeloma (MM).

As is well known, BPs are used to treat osteoclast-mediated bone diseases, including osteoporosis, Paget's disease, hypercalcemia of malignancy, bone metastases, and bone disease associated with MM. Current views suggest that BPs may affect differentiation and recruitment of osteoclast precursors or alter the capability of mature osteoclasts to resorb bone by altering the permeability of the osteoclast membranes to small ions. As a member, the more potent nitrogen-containing group of BPs, zoledronic acid, inhibits protein prenylation, thus affecting osteoclast function and survival. As protein prenylation is required by all cells, not just osteoclasts, the possibility that nitrogen-containing BPs could also affect the viability of tumour cells arises. Several studies have clearly demonstrated that BPs are cytostatic to tumour cells in vitro, induce apoptosis, inhibit cell adhesion and interfere with the metastatic process. We have recently demonstrated that zoledronic acid induced antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on MM cell lines in vitro by activating protein kinase C and increasing extracellular calcium concentration, and these effects augmented with dexamethasone and thalidomide addition to zoledronic acid. Bisphosphonates may exert their antimyeloma effect by inhibiting release of bone marrow-derived growth factor, such as transforming growth factor β and insulin-like growth factor into marrow, by inducing apoptosis of MM cells, by downregulating production of interleukin 6 from bone marrow stroma, and by stimulating γδ T-cell-mediated antiplasma cell activity in the marrow. Therefore, zoledronic acid may augment in vivo the therapeutic action of dexamethasone and thalidomide through direct effects on myeloma cells as well as by inhibition of paracrine and autocrine signals by bone marrow stromal cells. In this context, the results of clinical studies have suggested that BPs may reduce tumor burden and may improve survival of patients with MM. In addition, objective remission or inhibition of disease progression has been reported in patients with MM who underwent pamidronate treatment alone. In another study of ours, we demonstrated that zoledronic acid was able to increase disease-free survival in the pristane-induced plasmacytoma, a model with no direct bone involvement, in BALB/c mice model. In this study, zoledronic acid treatment markedly impeded intraperitoneal plasmacytoma development. It also decreased tumour burden and extramedullary tumour growth in mice. Moreover, in contrast to many other animal tumours studied, which used high doses of BPs, the zoledronic acid dose of 20 μg kg⁻¹ week⁻¹ s.c. which was efficacious in the murine plasmacytoma model is approximately equivalent to the approved clinical dose for the treatment of the skeletal complications of MM (4 mg every 3–4 weeks i.v.). All these results raise the possibility that nitrogen-containing BPs, such as zolederonic acid, with their direct antitumour effects, may be valuable adjuncts to the novel therapeutic strategies in the treatment of MM.

### Glucocorticoid receptor expression in multiple myeloma patients is a predictor of survival [^114GkwwQ]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2020). Medium credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a blood neoplasia characterized by abnormal proliferation of plasma cells. Various treatments such as stem cell transplant (SCT), proteasome inhibitors, immune-modulating drugs, monoclonal antibodies and selective inhibitors of nuclear export have been routinely used to treat MM. However, relapse and treatment resistance are common problems in MM patients. Treatments are enhanced by Dexamethasone (Dex), a synthetic steroid that activates the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) which leads to apoptosis. To evaluate the potential impact of GR expression on overall survival, MM patient data from the CoMMpass study of 650 patients were analyzed. Multivariate modeling results show that increased GR expression at diagnosis is associated with a decreased risk of dying relative to those with lower levels of expression.

### Chemotherapy plus steroid therapy in treating patients… [^114uoQ5A]. ClinicalTrials (2001). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy Plus Steroid Therapy in Treating Patients With Multiple MyelomaClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. Steroids, such as dexamethasone or prednisolone, may help relieve some of the side effects of chemotherapy. It is not yet known which regimen of chemotherapy plus steroid therapy is more effective in treating patients with multiple myeloma. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two different regimens of chemotherapy plus steroid therapy in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has recurred for the first time. OBJECTIVES:
- Compare the response rate, response duration, and survival of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma after treatment with lomustine, idarubicin, and dexamethasone vs melphalan and prednisolone. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

Patients are stratified according to prior autologous transplant. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.
- **Arm I**: Patients receive oral lomustine on day 1, oral idarubicin once daily on days 1–3, and oral dexamethasone twice a day on days 1–4. Treatment is repeated every 28 days for 6–9 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
- **Arm II**: Patients receive oral melphalan once daily on days 1–4 and oral prednisolone twice a day on days 1–4. Treatment is repeated every 28 days for 6–9 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Some patients may receive oral cyclophosphamide every 7 days and oral prednisolone on alternate days for 6 weeks concurrently with chemotherapy in either treatment arm.
- Paraprotein in serum and/or urine
- Greater than 10% plasma cells in bone marrow
- Lytic bone lesions
- Measurable serum and/or urine paraprotein
- Progression from first or second stable plateau phase
- No non-secretory myeloma or plasma cell leukemia.

### Expert panel consensus statement on the optimal use of pomalidomide in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma [^114UiFD7]. Leukemia (2014). Low credibility.

In a randomised and pivotal phase III trial (MM-003), pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone was compared with high-dose dexamethasone in patients who had failed both bortezomib and lenalidomide treatment. With a median follow-up of 10 months, pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone decreased the rate of progression by 52% (PFS 4.0 vs 1.9 months; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39–0.60; P < 0.001) and significantly improved OS (12.7 vs 8.1 months; HR = 0.74; 95% CI 0.56–0.97; P = 0.03). However, the impact on OS is probably underestimated because of the confounding effect of crossover that occurred in the high-dose dexamethasone arm. At the time of the analysis, 50% of patients assigned to high-dose dexamethasone had received pomalidomide, and by month 16 of study treatment, it was estimated that all patients assigned to high-dose dexamethasone would have received pomalidomide as salvage therapy, underscoring the superiority of the combination regimen. Similar efficacy was seen for pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone vs high-dose dexamethasone in patients with disease refractory to both lenalidomide and bortezomib (PFS 3.7 vs 2.0 months; HR = 0.52; P < 0.001 and OS 11.1 vs 7.7 months; HR = 0.77; P = 0.096) and in those who received lenalidomide as last prior therapy (PFS 4.6 vs 1.9 months; HR = 0.38; P < 0.001 and OS 12.3 vs 7.3 months; HR = 0.53; P = 0.01).

Data from these large multicentre trials support the use of pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone in patients with RRMM who have received prior lenalidomide and bortezomib. Practical issues regarding the optimal use of pomalidomide in this setting are discussed below.

With conventional therapy, only 5% of multiple myeloma patients achieve complete response. But in recent clinical trials of high-dose therapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, complete remission rates of 25–30% can be affected with median survival exceeding 5 years. Newer approaches in clinical trials, including more potent induction regimens utilizing thalidomide, alone or in combination with dexamethasone, are improving treatment outcomes. The authors suggest that potential for a cure now appears to be within reach.

### Mechanisms of glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis in hematological malignancies [^1142Y6oT]. Clinical Cancer Research (2002). Low credibility.

Although glucocorticoids (GCs) have been used for their immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic effects for many years, their precise mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. Evidence indicates that GCs induce apoptosis in hematological cells, thus supporting their use as chemotherapeutic agents for leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloma. Although much research has been focused on investigating the mechanism of action responsible for GC-mediated cell death, the signaling pathways remain unclear. Two schools of thought have developed to account for GC-induced apoptosis. One supports the hypothesis that apoptosis is achieved via activation of death-inducing genes. The second theory states that GCs induce apoptosis via repression of transcription factor activity, thereby inhibiting the transcription of growth/survival genes. This review will attempt to clarify the complex signaling pathway responsible for mediating GC-induced apoptosis of hematological cells and to summarize the most current research in this field.

Iron accumulation activates steroid biosynthesis pathway in BMSCs interacting with MM cells

To further decipher the role of iron in MM cells, we conducted bulk RNA sequencing on MM.1S cells treated with iron. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) analysis showed 519 genes were downregulated, while 911 genes were upregulated significantly (Fig. s 4A). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis demonstrated that the upregulated genes were enriched in cholesterol, sterol, and steroid metabolic processes (Fig. s 4B). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis also indicated a significant enrichment of steroid biosynthesis pathway (Fig. s 4C). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) further suggested that iron promoted the activation of steroid biosynthesis pathway in MM cells (Fig. 3A). To discern the specific steps in the steroid biosynthesis pathway regulated by iron, we screened 12 key genes governing steroid biosynthesis in the RNA-seq data, and validated a remarkable upregulation in their expressions (Fig. 3B). These genes collectively participate in the entire pathway linking acetyl CoA to cholesterol (Fig. 3C). Importantly, plasma cells isolated from a patient with hereditary sideroblastic anemia (HAS) caused by ALAS2 mutation (1343G > A), which leads to failure of iron transportation and to iron overload in patient, (Fig. s 4D) exhibited a partial restoration of gene expressions within the entire sterol biosynthesis pathway after treatment. This favorable response was concomitant with a noteworthy reduction of iron levels after the successful clinical intervention (Figs. 3 D, E, s 4 E, F). Indeed, iron treatment significantly boosted the production of steroids, including cholesterol and lanosterol, in MM cells (Fig. s 4G). The suppression of key genes governing cholesterol production, namely HMGCR, DHCR7, and DHCR24 (Fig. s 4 H–J), limited the role of iron in promoting cholesterol production (Fig. 3 F, G). Similarly, knockdown of LSS gene (Fig. s 4K), which catalyzes the last step of lanosterol production, interrupted the role of iron in boosting lanosterol production (Fig. 3H). These findings strongly indicate that iron enhances cholesterol and lanosterol production by activating sterol biosynthetic pathway.

### A phase I trial of the anti-KIR antibody IPH2101 and lenalidomide in patients with relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma [^113VqZcr]. Clinical Cancer Research (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Natural killer (NK) cells may play an important role in the immune response to multiple myeloma; however, multiple myeloma cells express killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) ligands to prevent NK cell cytotoxicity. Lenalidomide can expand and activate NK cells in parallel with its direct effects against multiple myeloma; however, dexamethasone may impair these favorable immunomodulatory properties. IPH2101, a first-in-class antiinhibitory KIR antibody, has acceptable safety and tolerability in multiple myeloma as a single agent. The present work sought to characterize lenalidomide and IPH2101 as a novel, steroid-sparing, dual immune therapy for multiple myeloma.

Experimental Design

A phase I trial enrolled 15 patients in three cohorts. Lenalidomide was administered per os at 10 mg on cohort 1 and 25 mg on cohorts 2 and 3 days 1 to 21 on a 28-day cycle with IPH2101 given intravenously on day 1 of each cycle at 0.2 mg/kg in cohort 1, 1 mg/kg in cohort 2, and 2 mg/kg in cohort 3. No corticosteroids were utilized. The primary endpoint was safety, and secondary endpoints included clinical activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD).

Results

The biologic endpoint of full KIR occupancy was achieved across the IPH2101 dosing interval. PD and PK of IPH2101 with lenalidomide were similar to data from a prior single-agent IPH2101 trial. Five serious adverse events (SAE) were reported. Five objective responses occurred. No autoimmunity was seen.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that lenalidomide in combination with antiinhibitory KIR therapy warrants further investigation in multiple myeloma as a steroid-sparing, dual immune therapy. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (reference: NCT01217203).

Multiple myeloma is a relatively rare but severe hematologic malignancy. Marked depression in production of normal immunoglobulins, mild neutropenia, and alkylant/steroid therapy or BMT/SCT all produce major suppression of the immune system in the totality of patients. Recurrent bacterial, fungal, and viral infections are an important cause of morbidity and the most common cause of death in these subjects. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate anti-infective chemotherapy are essential in order to reduce the risk of mortality.

### A steroid-independent regimen of bortezomib, liposomal doxorubicin and thalidomide demonstrate high response rates in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients [^114kMFPw]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Novel agents have provided a new foundation for multiple myeloma therapies. When combined with other anti-myeloma agents, these compounds significantly enhance clinical efficacy. High-dose steroids are frequently used in anti-myeloma combination regimens; however, the doses employed are often poorly tolerated, especially in patients with concurrent comorbid conditions. We hypothesized that a steroid-independent combination regimen could be developed without significant compromise of efficacy. The availability of such a regimen will be important for patients whose concurrent ailments make them poor candidates for steroid containing anti-myeloma regimens. A phase II single institute, non-randomized clinical trial was conducted to investigate a novel steroid-free three-drug combination of bortezomib (V), pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (D), and thalidomide (T), the VDT regimen. Forty-three newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients requiring treatment were enrolled on this study. The overall response rate and complete response (CR) + near complete response (nCR) rate was 78% and 35%, respectively. Median time to progression was 29.5 months. Fatigue, rash, neuropathy, constipation and infections were the most common side effects. We concluded that VDT is a tolerable and an effective regimen capable of inducing high response rates and can be employed in patients considered to be poor candidates for steroid-based treatment regimens.

### Gaps and opportunities in the treatment of relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma: consensus recommendations of the NCI multiple myeloma steering committee [^113WYLH9]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Lines of therapy versus resistance to a class of drugs

Single arm studies for new drug development until recently have focused on late-stage patients who had been exposed to all approved agents in more than three prior lines of treatment and were progressing on the last line. In contrast, phase III trials using the new agents in combination involved patients in their first to third lines of treatment. This resulted in an bi-modal approach to treatment: early (first to third) versus late relapse (beyond third). As the number of agents available in myeloma has increased, adoption of these agents in earlier lines of treatment has posed a new challenge to the old paradigm. Therefore, lines of therapy should be modified to include sensitivity to versus resistance to classes of or individual agents. Broadly, the treatment approach to relapsed disease has been that it is preferrable to use triplet regimens, including at least two active drug classes other than steroids, and at least one from a class that the patient has not been exposed. If a class is repeated, a different drug from the class should be used. This approach can be employed in earlier relapses with drugs that the patient has not been exposed to but can be more difficult to implement in later relapses. Studies have shown that drugs can be effectively reused, especially when the patient has not been exposed to them for a while, thus allowing new combinations in later stages. The general approach has been to continue at least one drug in the combination as maintenance (if tolerable) until disease progression.

### Expert panel consensus statement on the optimal use of pomalidomide in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma [^113KVXGw]. Leukemia (2014). Low credibility.

Efficacy in clinical trials

In a phase I/II study (MM-002), the combination of pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone was assessed in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who had received prior lenalidomide and bortezomib. The median number of prior therapies was 5 (range 1–13); all patients had received prior steroids, lenalidomide and bortezomib, and 62% were refractory to both lenalidomide and bortezomib. In phase I of the study, the dose-limiting toxicity (grade 4 neutropenia) occurred at a pomalidomide dose of 5 mg; the maximum tolerated dose of pomalidomide was, therefore, 4 mg given on days 1–21 of each 28-day cycle in combination with low-dose dexamethasone (40 mg weekly for patients ≤ 75 years; 20 mg weekly for patients > 75 years). With this dose and schedule and in the pivotal phase II trial, pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone was associated with an overall response rate of 33% and median duration of response of 8.3 months. With a median follow-up of 14.2 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) and OS were 4.2 and 16.5 months, respectively. In comparison, response to single-agent pomalidomide was 18% with a median duration of response, PFS and OS of 10.7, 2.7 and 13.6 months, respectively, indicating that the addition of low-dose dexamethasone to pomalidomide improves efficacy. Subanalyses indicated that the efficacy of pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone was similar regardless of whether the patient was refractory to lenalidomide or bortezomib as last prior therapy.

### Lenalidomide plus high-dose dexamethasone versus lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone as initial therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: an open-label randomised controlled trial [^112e5zug]. The Lancet: Oncology (2010). Medium credibility.

Background

High-dose dexamethasone is a mainstay of therapy for multiple myeloma. We studied whether low-dose dexamethasone in combination with lenalidomide is non-inferior to and has lower toxicity than high-dose dexamethasone plus lenalidomide.

Methods

Patients with untreated symptomatic myeloma were randomly assigned in this open-label non-inferiority trial to lenalidomide 25 mg on days 1–21 plus dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1–4, 9–12, and 17–20 of a 28-day cycle (high dose), or lenalidomide given on the same schedule with dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle (low dose). After four cycles, patients could discontinue therapy to pursue stem-cell transplantation or continue treatment until disease progression. The primary endpoint was response rate after four cycles assessed with European Group for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant criteria. The non-inferiority margin was an absolute difference of 15% in response rate. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00098475.

Findings

445 patients were randomly assigned: 223 to high-dose and 222 to low-dose regimens. 169 (79%) of 214 patients receiving high-dose therapy and 142 (68%) of 205 patients on low-dose therapy had complete or partial response within four cycles (odds ratio 1.75, 80% CI 1.30–2.32; p = 0.008). However, at the second interim analysis at 1 year, overall survival was 96% (95% CI 94–99) in the low-dose dexamethasone group compared with 87% (82–92) in the high-dose group (p = 0.0002). As a result, the trial was stopped and patients on high-dose therapy were crossed over to low-dose therapy. 117 patients (52%) on the high-dose regimen had grade three or worse toxic effects in the first 4 months, compared with 76 (35%) of the 220 on the low-dose regimen for whom toxicity data were available (p = 0.0001), 12 of 222 on high dose and one of 220 on low-dose dexamethasone died in the first 4 months (p = 0.003). The three most common grade three or higher toxicities were deep-vein thrombosis, 57 (26%) of 223 versus 27 (12%) of 220 (p = 0.0003); infections including pneumonia, 35 (16%) of 223 versus 20 (9%) of 220 (p = 0.04), and fatigue 33 (15%) of 223 versus 20 (9%) of 220 (p = 0.08), respectively.

Interpretation

Lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone is associated with better short-term overall survival and with lower toxicity than lenalidomide plus high-dose dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma.

### Evolving paradigms in the treatment of relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma: increased options and increased complexity [^111AM8JG]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Expert commentary

Despite substantial progress, myeloma remains an incurable disease plagued by multiple relapses and increasing resistance to therapy. The past decade has been marked by the unraveling of the pathobiological process underlying myeloma pathogenesis, the emergence of new therapies and improvement in transplant technology, which paves the way for improved responses even in patients with double-refractory MM. While randomized trials have shown superiority of modern therapies over older regimens like mephalan-prednisone, very few have shown superiority of one modern therapy over the other in terms of OS and patient-reported quality-of-life. Approach to therapy is often dictated by regional availability of drugs, HSCT technology and varied regulatory frameworks that exist in different parts of the world. Thus, there remains marked heterogeneity in how NDMM or RRMM are treated around the world.

Use of new genomic and molecular prognostic tools throughout the disease course may give better insights into the clonal dynamics of the myeloma cell and pave the way for targeted and personalized therapy approaches. Validation of promising biomarkers will help to stratify patients based on risk and potential therapeutic benefit. With the increased complexity of treatment options for patients with RRMM, physicians must understand the guidelines for administration of new agents in the context of the patient's therapeutic and disease history. The strategy provided here may help facilitate a clear path through the complex treatment landscape in RRMM.

### Multiple myeloma: diagnosis and treatment [^112huLv9]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma, the most common bone malignancy, is occurring with increasing frequency in older persons. Typical symptoms are bone pain, malaise, anemia, renal insufficiency, and hypercalcemia. Incidental discovery on comprehensive laboratory panels is common. The disease is diagnosed with serum or urine protein electrophoresis or immunofixation and bone marrow aspirate analysis. Skeletal radiographs are important in staging multiple myeloma and revealing lytic lesions, vertebral compression fractures, and osteoporosis. Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography or computed tomography are emerging as useful tools in the evaluation of patients with myeloma; magnetic resonance imaging is preferred for evaluating acute spinal compression. Nuclear bone scans and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry have no role in the diagnosis and staging of myeloma. The differential diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies includes monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance, smoldering (asymptomatic) and symptomatic multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, and rare plasma cell leukemia and heavy chain diseases. Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance or smoldering multiple myeloma should be followed closely, but not treated. Symptomatic multiple myeloma is treated with chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, if possible. Melphalan, prednisolone, dexamethasone, vincristine, doxorubicin, bortezomib, and thalidomide and its analogue lenalidomide have been used successfully. It is important that family physicians recognize and appropriately treat multiple myeloma complications. Bone pain is treated with opiates, bisphosphonates, radiotherapy, vertebroplasty, or kyphoplasty; nephrotoxic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided. Hypercalcemia is treated with isotonic saline infusions, steroids, furosemide, or bisphosphonates. Because of susceptibility to infections, patients require broad-spectrum antibiotics for febrile illness and immunization against influenza, pneumococcus, and Haemophilus influenzae B. Five-year survival rates approach 33 percent, and the median survival rate is 33 months.

### Influence of gut microbiome on multiple myeloma: friend or foe? [^116nuSFg]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

The non-selective immunomodulator dexamethasone (DXM) is an essential component to most myeloma treatment regimens and its reciprocal interaction with human microbiota warrants investigation. Huang et al observed a change in the composition of the gut microbiota, specifically a higher prevalence of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in mice with chronic steroid exposure as compared with controls; in contrast, Mucispirillum, a known colonic mucin degrader, was absent in the mice with chronic steroid exposure. Moreover, DXM-treated donor mice may have reduced IL-17 production compared with control donor mice. Since IL-17 production is also mediated by gut flora, the changes in microbiota induced by chronic DXM use may contribute to the activity of this agent in treating DXM in myeloma.

To date, fungi have composed of a neglected part of the gut microbiome. The interaction between mycobiome and bacterial communities and the potential protective role of the former for whole human microbiota deserves special attention. While most studies focus on the gut bacteria, there is known interdependence and strategic evolutionary cooperation between bacteria and fungi. Biofilms are microbes including fungi and bacteria, embedded in a polymeric matrix that protects them from antimicrobials and resists host defenses. Biofilms shield the fungi from environmental factors and are associated with poor immune clearance by the host. Fungal filamentation is a known Candida virulence factor which damages host tissue and triggers host inflammatory response. Dysbiosis of gut bacteria can therefore interfere with mycobiome composition and the bacteria–fungi relationship may be another axis by which the gut bacteria influence systemic immunomodulation.DXM may also affect the host mycobiome profile. The role of the mycobiome community and fungal pathogens in MM outcomes and progression is not well understood. More studies are needed to understand the effects of DXM on gut fungi.

Studies on MM and microbiome are limited and while certain trends and observations have been made, like possible effect on microbiome on cytokines affecting BM microenvironment, role of SCFA on myelomagenesis and associations of microbiome on treatment toxicities, it may be premature to draw general conclusions based on available literature. A better understanding of dysbiosis, its role in disease propagation in MM, and its effects on response and toxicity, is essential. We summarize the current work on the microbiome and its perceived role in MM. AS we further understand the mechanisms on influence of the microbiome on the BM microenvironment, we hope that in the future, we could develop strategies to harness the microbiome to improve MGUS and MM outcomes.

### How I treat multiple myeloma in younger patients [^116DVZm6]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Therapeutic options for multiple myeloma (MM) patients have changed quickly in recent years and uncertainty has arisen about optimal approaches to therapy. A reasonable goal of MM treatment in younger "transplant eligible" patients is to initiate therapy with a target goal of durable complete remission, and the anticipated consequence of long-term disease control. To achieve this goal we recommend induction therapy with multi-agent combination chemotherapies (usually selected from bortezomib, lenalidomide, thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and corticosteriods) which when employed together elicit frequent, rapid, and deep responses. We recommend consolidation with high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation in the majority of patients willing and able to undergo this procedure and subsequent maintenance therapy in those failing to achieve a complete response or at high risk for early relapse based on prognostic, genetically defined risk factors. Defining genetic risk for early relapse is therefore an important aspect of early diagnostic testing and attention to minimizing expected toxicities once therapy begins is critical in ensuring the efficacy of modern combination therapy approaches. When access to newer drugs is restricted participation in clinical trials should be pursued.

### The role of maintenance therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma [^1111Y9Uk]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2010). Low credibility.

Maintenance therapy in multiple myeloma has been under investigation for more than 3 decades, without evidence of clear benefit until recently. Chemotherapy maintenance offers no benefit after conventional or high-dose treatment. Interferon-based maintenance is associated with minimal improvements in clinical outcomes, but is poorly tolerated. Results of corticosteroid maintenance studies have been conflicting; at least one randomized trial showed improved survival with prednisone maintenance after conventional chemotherapy. The role of the novel agents thalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib as maintenance is emerging. Most reported maintenance studies have evaluated thalidomide, alone or in combination with a corticosteroid. Several of these studies suggest that thalidomide-based maintenance prolongs overall survival after autologous stem cell transplantation. Important questions that have not yet been resolved include the optimal dose and duration of thalidomide, whether clinical benefit depends on response to induction therapy and risk for relapse, and whether reported benefits are caused by cytoreduction or eradication of minimal residual disease, especially with bortezomib maintenance. Ongoing randomized trials are evaluating lenalidomide and bortezomib maintenance therapies to better define the role of these drugs as maintenance in multiple myeloma.

### Multiple myeloma [^112sKLF2]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) constitutes 1% of malignant diseases and 15% of haematological malignancies. In virtually all patients MM is preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The cause of monoclonal gammopathies and the mechanisms of progression are unknown. The diagnosis of MM requires the presence of an M-protein in serum and/or urine, increased bone marrow plasma cells and related organ or tissue impairment. Cytogenetic status, serum β₂-microglobulin and response to therapy are the key prognostic factors. The treatment of younger patients with MM should include a triple-agent induction regimen (i.e. bortezomib/thalidomide/dexamethasone), autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and consolidation and maintenance incorporating novel agents along with sequential minimal residual disease studies to determine for how long treatment is still of benefit. Allogeneic transplantation with reduced-intensity conditioning is promising but remains experimental. For patients not eligible for ASCT the best initial regimens are melphalan/prednisone/thalidomide (MPT), melphalan/prednisone/bortezomib (MPV) and lenalidomide/dexamethasone. In relapsing patients, the choice of salvage therapy should depend on: (i) the components of initial therapy, (ii) the degree and duration of response, (iii) type of relapse: aggressive versus indolent, (iv) previous toxicities and (v) age and performance status. A sequential approach is preferred over combination of multiple agents. Supportive measures include the use of bisphosphonates and erythropoietin according to the updated guidelines.

WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE FOR THE TRANSPLANT‐ELIGIBLE PATIENT?

RVD induction therapy prior to planned ASCT has been evaluated in Phase II and Phase III studies. A subset of patients in other studies have also undergone up‐front ASCT. After induction, a very good partial response or better (≥ VGPR) is seen in 45%–67% of patients, increasing post‐ASCT ≥ VGPR to rates of 66%–75%. Further improvement is possible with consolidation and maintenance therapy. The median PFS in the IFM 2009 study, which compared RVD induction followed by ASCT with RVD alone, was 47.3 months in the transplantation arm compared to 35 months in those who did not undergo up‐front ASCT. However, there was no significant difference in OS at 8 years, at 62.2% and 60.2% respectively. In 1000 consecutive patients treated with RVD induction at Emory University, 751 underwent up‐front ASCT and in this cohort the median PFS was 63 months and median OS was 123.4 months. In this study, a selected group of 168 patients who had standard‐risk disease and a good response to induction therapy were offered deferred ASCT. The median PFS of this group was 74.3 months and median OS was not reached at a median follow‐up of 102 months.

### Impact of lenalidomide dose on progression-free survival in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma [^111ncVM2]. Leukemia (2011). Low credibility.

Although lenalidomide acts synergistically with dexamethasone to inhibit myeloma cell proliferation in vitro, its immunomodulatory activity is antagonized by dexamethasone. In this analysis, the median dexamethasone dose was comparable in all three subgroups (40, 40 and 36.3 mg in the ⩾12 months, < 12 months or no reduction groups, respectively). This reflects actual dose received on days in which there was no dose interruption divided by the number of actual treatment days. After 2 years of treatment, patients with lenalidomide dose reductions (⩾12 months and < 12 months) also received a lower proportion of the target dexamethasone dose compared with those without lenalidomide dose reductions. The enhanced efficacy and improved tolerability achieved when administering full-dose lenalidomide with reduced-dose dexamethasone, defined as ≤ 20 mg/day for just 4 days during the first 4 cycles or ≤ 20 mg/day in subsequent cycles, was demonstrated by San Miguel et al. in another subset analysis from MM-009 and MM-010 trials. In a recent ECOG study (E4A03) conducted in patients with newly diagnosed MM, a regimen of lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone was more clinically effective than the standard regimen. One explanation for the results is the improved tolerability of the low-dose dexamethasone regimen, which resulted in lower incidence of serious adverse events, including thromboembolism. Another explanation could be that lower doses of the immunosuppressant dexamethasone led to less antagonism of the immunomodulatory effects of lenalidomide, which in turn resulted in better disease control, as discussed above. This is supported by a number of studies that investigated steroid-sparing approaches and that demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of single-agent lenalidomide in patients with MM. Furthermore, emerging lenalidomide maintenance phase III studies in the frontline setting suggest that maintenance therapy with single-agent lenalidomide (10–15 mg/day, for 21 of 28 days or continuously) significantly prolongs PFS and duration of response, reducing the risk of disease progression by up to 61%. In the absence of maintenance studies in the relapsed setting, consensus guidelines for treatment of patients with RRMM recommend long-term continued treatment with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone with dose modifications for adverse events for both agents if required.

### Ibrutinib alone or with dexamethasone for relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma: phase 2 trial results [^116sg3jj]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

The management of relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) has changed considerably in the last decade, and there have been significant improvements with regards to patient outcomes. One reason behind these improvements is the incorporation of novel drugs with unique mechanisms of action into the treatment armamentarium, which until then, included the use of alkylating agents, corticosteroids, anthracyclines and autologous stem cell transplantation (Dimopoulos et al, 2015a). The most notable classes of new drugs include immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs) and proteasome inhibitors (PIs). Despite these improvements, most patients with multiple myeloma (MM) will ultimately relapse; therefore, agents with novel targets must be identified and explored to be used either as single agents or in combination with standard backbone therapies (Cottini & Anderson, 2015). Thus, MM remains one of the most significant areas of unmet medical need among lymphoid malignancies. In addition, the treatment of patients with RRMM is further complicated by advanced age, comorbidities (i.e. diabetes, cardiovascular and/or lung disease), residual toxicities from prior treatments (i.e. peripheral neuropathies, myelosuppression) and end‐organ damage resulting from the underlying disease (Dimopoulos et al, 2015a; Nooka et al, 2015).

### Treatment patterns and outcomes according to cytogenetic risk stratification in patients with multiple myeloma: a real-world analysis [^1139Ybdc]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable and heterogeneous disease, with a 5-year overall survival (OS) of approximately 55%. Induction therapies for MM consist of doublet or triplet combinations of agents with different mechanisms of action including corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone), immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs; e.g. lenalidomide), and proteasome inhibitors (PIs; e.g. bortezomib). A triplet combination including bortezomib and dexamethasone (e.g. bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone [VRd]) has been the standard-of-care for first-line induction in newly diagnosed patients. Recommendations for subsequent lines of therapy suggest the use of regimens that the patient had not previously been exposed to.

The MM treatment landscape has evolved significantly during the last decade, with the use of triplet combinations increasing and doublet combinations decreasing, and a trend toward longer OS has been reported. Survival outcomes are affected by several factors, including patient characteristics such as age and fitness, race, tumor burden, and genetic abnormalities involving chromosomes 14, 1p, 1q, 13, or 17. Several risk subgroups of patients with MM can be defined based on these cytogenetic abnormalities.

### Belantamab mafodotin, cyclophosphamide, and… [^115CjGLB]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

This phase I/II trial tests whether belantamab mafodotin, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone works to shrink tumors in patients with multiple myeloma that has come back or does not response to treatment. Belantamab mafodotin is a monoclonal antibody, called belantamab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called mafodotin. Belantamab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules on the surface of cancer cells, known as BCMA receptors, and delivers mafodotin to kill them. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Dexamethasone is a steroid and it is useful in myeloma treatment because it can stop white blood cells from traveling to areas where cancerous myeloma cells are causing damage.

This decreases the amount of swelling or inflammation in those areas and relieves associated pain and pressure. Giving belantamab mafodotin with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone may kill more cancer cells in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Exclusion Criteria
- Systemic anti-myeloma therapy within = < 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, or plasmapheresis within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
- Systemic treatment with high dose steroids within the past 14 days if administered to treat MM or non- MM disease.
- Symptomatic amyloidosis, active central nervous system disease, active plasma cell leukemia at the time of screening.
- Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant. NOTE: Participants who have undergone syngeneic transplant may be allowed, if no history of graft versus host disease. Additional locations may be listed on ClinicalTrials. gov for NCT04896658.

### Motixafortide and stem cell transplants for multiple myeloma-NCI… [^113R5Btw]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

New clinical trial results show that an experimental drug could help overcome this problem. The drug, motixafortide, helps blood-forming stem cells move from a person's bone marrow into their bloodstream. In the trial, a single injection of motixafortide given in addition to a series of injections of G-CSF, the drug most widely used to "mobilize" stem cells from the bone marrow to the blood, markedly increased the number of collected stem cells compared with treatment with G-CSF alone. Transplanted stem cells help restore normal blood counts In multiple myeloma, abnormal plasma cells build up in the bone marrow and blood and form tumors in bone. "Multiple myeloma is not curable, but long remissions are possible, " Dr. Schulz said. And high-dose chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant with the patient's own cells, known as an autologous transplant, is one of the main ways to achieve a long remission, he said.

Small preliminary studies in people showed that motixafortide can dramatically increase the number of stem cells in the blood. So, researchers wanted to test it in a larger and more rigorous study of people with multiple myeloma, including older patients, who needed a stem cell transplant. "This is a huge difference, and potentially makes life better for the patient, who does not have to go through this process multiple times, " Dr. Schulz said. Limiting additional apheresis procedures and shorter hospitalizations could also reduce the cost of care, he noted. But he cautioned that motixafortide's cost, should it be approved by FDA, is still unknown. BioLineRx has applied for FDA approval of the drug for use in mobilizing stem cells, with a decision expected by September. One year after transplantation, overall survival rates did not differ between the two treatment groups.

The GENESIS team is continuing to follow participants to see if a survival difference emerges after longer follow-up. The GENESIS study team also reported results from a small companion study comparing 14 patients treated with G-CSF plus plerixafor to a subset of participants from the randomized trial. Those findings suggest that G-CSF plus motixafortide is better at mobilizing stem cells than G-CSF plus plerixafor.

### Lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone induction therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: a practical review [^113AapcQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

For patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, survival outcomes continue to improve significantly: however, nearly all patients will relapse following induction treatment. Optimisation of induction therapy is essential to provide longer term disease control and the current standard of care for most patients incorporates an immunomodulatory agent and proteasome inhibitor, most commonly lenalidomide and bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone (RVD), with maintenance until progression. Historically there has been limited access to RVD as an induction strategy outside of the United States; fortunately, there is now increasing access worldwide. This review discusses the rationale for use of RVD as induction therapy and aims to provide guidance in prescribing this regimen in order to optimise efficacy while minimising the toxicities of treatment. We also highlight the increasing evidence for the utility of addition of a monoclonal antibody to the RVD backbone to deepen responses and potentially provide longer disease control.

### How I treat myeloma with new agents [^1122CGgA]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

At present, multiple classes of agents with distinct mechanisms of action are available for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM), including alkylators, steroids, immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitors (PIs), histone deacetylase inhibitors (DACIs), and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Over the last 5 years, several new agents, such as the third-generation IMiD pomalidomide, the second-generation PIs carfilzomib and ixazomib, the DACI panobinostat, and 2 mAbs, elotuzumab and daratumumab, have been approved, incorporated into clinical guidelines, and have transformed our approach to the treatment of patients. These agents may be part of doublet or triplet combinations, or incorporated into intensive strategies with autologous stem cell transplantation. In this review, I discuss the different treatment options available today for the treatment of MM in frontline and relapse settings.

### European Myeloma Network recommendations on the evaluation and treatment of newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma [^1112mk7P]. Haematologica (2014). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma management has undergone profound changes in the past thanks to advances in our understanding of the disease biology and improvements in treatment and supportive care approaches. This article presents recommendations of the European Myeloma Network for newly diagnosed patients based on the GRADE system for level of evidence. All patients with symptomatic disease should undergo risk stratification to classify patients for International Staging System stage (level of evidence: 1A) and for cytogenetically defined high- versus standard-risk groups (2B). Novel-agent-based induction and up-front autologous stem cell transplantation in medically fit patients remains the standard of care (1A). Induction therapy should include a triple combination of bortezomib, with either adriamycin or thalidomide and dexamethasone (1A), or with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (2B). Currently, allogeneic stem cell transplantation may be considered for young patients with high-risk disease and preferably in the context of a clinical trial (2B). Thalidomide (1B) or lenalidomide (1A) maintenance increases progression-free survival and possibly overall survival (2B). Bortezomib-based regimens are a valuable consolidation option, especially for patients who failed excellent response after autologous stem cell transplantation (2A). Bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone or melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide are the standards of care for transplant-ineligible patients (1A). Melphalan-prednisone-lenalidomide with lenalidomide maintenance increases progression-free survival, but overall survival data are needed. New data from the phase III study (MM-020/IFM 07–01) of lenalidomide-low-dose dexamethasone reached its primary end point of a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival as compared to melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide and provides further evidence for the efficacy of lenalidomide-low-dose dexamethasone in transplant-ineligible patients (2B).

### The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer consensus statement on immunotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma [^116P98La]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most commonly diagnosed hematological malignancy, with nearly 160 000 new cases worldwide in 2018. Before the 21st century, most patients with MM died within a few years after diagnosis, yet outcomes have improved dramatically during the past two decades. Novel therapies including immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitors (PIs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been incorporated into standard treatment approaches, which had previously been limited to stem cell transplants, alkylating agents and steroids. Additionally, advances in risk stratification based on cytogeneticsas well as the ability to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) with a high degree of sensitivity using multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologiesmay further enhance the selection of treatment strategies both at initial diagnosis and relapse. Despite these breakthroughs, however, MM remains largely incurable, with the vast majority of patients experiencing relapse at some point.

Advances in understanding of the basic mechanisms of immune evasion and suppression in MM has led to new therapies with demonstrated benefits for patients. In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two mAbs for the treatment of MM, daratumumab (dara) and elotuzumab, blazing a trail for the development of numerous other immunotherapies in this disease setting, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs)and cancer vaccines. As the world's leading non-profit member-driven organization dedicated to advancing cancer immunotherapy, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) develops Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines for a variety of disease states. Previously, SITC published the first-ever consensus statement for the use of immunotherapy to treat hematological malignancies in 2016.

### Treatment of multiple myeloma: ASCO and CCO joint clinical practice guideline [^115PTFEn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma — relapsed therapy selection and regimen composition: The treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma is complex and does not have a simple algorithm, and clinical trials are preferred and should be considered at every phase of treatment. For fit patients, triplet is generally recommended over doublet therapy due to improved clinical outcomes; triplet therapy is defined as containing two novel agents plus steroids, whereas doublet therapy is defined as one novel agent with steroids. Novel agents include immunomodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide; proteasome inhibitors (PI) such as ixazomib, bortezomib, or carfilzomib; and monoclonal antibodies such as daratumumab and elotuzumab. Multiple randomized studies and meta-analyses have shown that triplets are more effective than doublet combinations in improving progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate, and/or overall survival (OS), and data suggest that even the use of alkylating agents as part of triplet therapy yields better outcomes than doublets. Although triplet therapy offers better clinical outcomes, toxicity appears increased in triple versus doublet therapy and must be considered; for some patients, prior toxicity may result in selection of doublet versus triplet therapy. The ENDEAVOR trial demonstrated the superiority of carfilzomib plus dexamethasone to bortezomib plus dexamethasone in both PFS and OS in relapsed multiple myeloma, and in subgroup analyses carfilzomib, dexamethasone was superior regardless of cytogenetic risk, number of prior therapy lines, or prior exposure to bortezomib or lenalidomide. The selection of doublet versus triplet therapy should be individualized; the best triplet or how to sequence triplet or doublet therapy remains unclear, with randomized controlled trials comparing individual triplets lacking and network meta-analyses yielding variable results with no obvious conclusion. Because the optimal sequence is unknown, the general strategy has been to use all approved drugs in rational sequential combinations, and although clinical trials are preferred at all treatment time points, referral for a novel clinical trial can be considered as resistance develops; chemotherapeutic agents such as cyclophosphamide, melphalan, or panobinostat may also be considered.

### Bortezomib or high-dose dexamethasone for relapsed multiple myeloma [^1159HZS2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

This study compared bortezomib with high-dose dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who had received one to three previous therapies.

Methods

We randomly assigned 669 patients with relapsed myeloma to receive either an intravenous bolus of bortezomib (1.3 mg per square meter of body-surface area) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 for eight three-week cycles, followed by treatment on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for three five-week cycles, or high-dose dexamethasone (40 mg orally) on days 1 through 4, 9 through 12, and 17 through 20 for four five-week cycles, followed by treatment on days 1 through 4 for five four-week cycles. Patients who were assigned to receive dexamethasone were permitted to cross over to receive bortezomib in a companion study after disease progression.

Results

Patients treated with bortezomib had higher response rates, a longer time to progression (the primary end point), and a longer survival than patients treated with dexamethasone. The combined complete and partial response rates were 38 percent for bortezomib and 18 percent for dexamethasone (P < 0.001), and the complete response rates were 6 percent and less than 1 percent, respectively (P < 0.001). Median times to progression in the bortezomib and dexamethasone groups were 6.22 months (189 days) and 3.49 months (106 days), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.55; P < 0.001). The one-year survival rate was 80 percent among patients taking bortezomib and 66 percent among patients taking dexamethasone (P = 0.003), and the hazard ratio for overall survival with bortezomib was 0.57 (P = 0.001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 75 percent of patients treated with bortezomib and in 60 percent of those treated with dexamethasone.

Conclusions

Bortezomib is superior to high-dose dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have had a relapse after one to three previous therapies.

### S-adenosylmethionine biosynthesis is a targetable metabolic vulnerability in multiple myeloma [^114MMyKV]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the accumulation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. MM is the second most frequent hematologic disorder and accounts for 10% of all hematologic malignancies. Several drugs have already been approved to treat MM, including proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, steroids, histone deacetylase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. Bortezomib was the first proteasome inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of MM and is currently one of the standard-of-care agents for first-line treatment. However, despite the significant progress in treating MM patients, one of the major issues is the recurrence of the disease due to an incomplete eradication of myeloma cells. Thus, therapies capable of inducing durable elimination of MM cells are still needed. Recent studies provide evidence that dysregulation of cellular metabolism plays a central role in the pathogenesis of MM, including MM cell survival, growth, and drug resistance. 7- Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) is a key regulator of cellular metabolism and catalyzes the reaction of L-methionine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is an essential methyl donor.MAT includes MAT1A and MAT2A in mammals, which code for two different enzymes, MATI/III and MATII respectively. MAT1A is liver-specific, whereas MAT2A shows a wide distribution and is responsible for SAM synthesis in extrahepatic tissues.MAT2A is dysregulated in several cancer types, such as hepatic cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer and it has been shown that silencing of MAT2A results in reduced cancer cell proliferation and cell death. However, so far, the role of MAT2A in MM has not been explored.

### Is there still a role for stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma? [^113RRNz3]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

No therapy in multiple myeloma has been as extensively investigated as stem cell transplantation following high-dose chemotherapy. A search of the national library of medicine in February 2023 revealed over 27,000 publications covering stem cell transplantation. No other treatment for multiple myeloma has been so vigorously investigated. However, given the rapid advances seen in the treatment of multiple myeloma, it is legitimate to ask whether the technique first introduced in 1983 by Thomas McIlwain still has relevance. In 1984, Barlogie introduced infusional vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone and in 1986 published a first series on high-dose therapy with autologous marrow-derived stem cells. At this point, the only available therapies were melphalan, prednisone, other intensive steroids such as methylprednisolone, and interferon. Cyclophosphamide was used both orally and parenterally. VBMCP was introduced as a combination therapy at Memorial Hospital subsequently shown not to be superior to melphalan and prednisone.

j Use for patients with prior lenalidomide exposure.

For patients with newly diagnosed MM (NDMM), immunomodulatory drugs combined with PIs and a steroid are widely used, and more recently, daratumumab-based combinations have been recommended. Initial therapy can vary across countries depending on drug availability and patient eligibility for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). For those who are transplant eligible (TE), the most common standard treatment is lenalidomide, thalidomide, or cyclophosphamide added to a bortezomib-dexamethasone backbone as induction therapy prior to ASCT, followed by continuous lenalidomide maintenance therapy until disease progression (Table 1). Chemotherapy with high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m² intravenous) is the standard conditioning regimen before ASCT. Among these combinations, lenalidomide-bortezomib-dexamethasone has been suggested to offer the best risk-benefit profile. If an immunomodulatory drug is not available in certain countries, cyclophosphamide may be substituted. The inclusion of daratumumab or isatuximab as an early-line option is changing the treatment landscape, owing to the approval of combination regimens such as daratumumab-bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone in TE patients, daratumumab- or isatuximab-carfilzomib-dexamethasone in patients with RRMM who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy; and daratumumab-bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone or daratumumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone in those who are transplant ineligible (TI). The phase 3 CASSIOPEIA study demonstrated that the addition of daratumumab to thalidomide-bortezomib-dexamethasone increased the depth of response and improved rates of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with TE NDMM. The addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide-bortezomib-dexamethasone regimens also improved the depth of response in patients with TE NDMM in the phase 2 GRIFFIN study, a finding that is being evaluated further in the phase 3 PERSEUS study. Daratumumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Commission (EC), and Health Canada in 2019 in combination with thalidomide-bortezomib-dexamethasone; to date, studies are ongoing for the combination with lenalidomide-bortezomib-dexamethasone.

### New developments in myeloma treatment and response assessment [^116LK8EH]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

NEW THERAPEUTIC DEVELOPMENT

The treatment of MM has changed dramatically in the past decade with the incorporation of novel agents into therapeutic strategies. These new drugs, in various combinations, have been added to national and international clinical guidelines and have transformed our approach to the treatment of patients with MM, resulting in a significant improvement in overall survival.

With the availability of many different classes of approved agents, including alkylators, steroids, proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory agents, histone deacetylase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and selective inhibitors of nuclear export that can be combined in double, triple, or even quadruple regimens and can be used together with or without high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), or in some cases as continuous treatment, the choice of the optimal strategy at diagnosis and at relapse represents a challenge for physicians. Moreover, contemporary next-generation immunotherapies including antibody–drug conjugates, CAR T cells, and bispecific antibodies have been approved for patients failing proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory agents, and CD38 monoclonal antibodies.

For transplant-eligible patients, three to four cycles of induction therapy including an immunomodulatory drug, proteasome inhibitor, and steroids are outlined; consolidation therapy may be considered in the context of a clinical trial, and lenalidomide maintenance therapy for standard-risk patients starting at approximately day 90 to 110 at 10 to 15 mg daily until progression is shown. For transplant-ineligible patients, a novel agent (immunomodulatory drug or proteasome inhibitor) and a steroid if possible are listed, with options including bortezomib + lenalidomide + dexamethasone or daratumumab + bortezomib + melphalan + prednisone. At relapse, salvage or delayed SCT may be used as consolidation at first relapse for those not choosing to proceed to transplant initially, and triplet therapy (proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, or monoclonal antibodies) is presented. Footnote guidance includes that agents associated with stem-cell toxicity, such as melphalan and/or prolonged immunomodulatory drug exposure (more than four cycles), should be avoided in patients who are potential candidates for stem-cell transplant (SCT); tandem autologous SCT should not be routinely recommended; and for patients intolerant of or unable to receive lenalidomide, bortezomib maintenance every 2 weeks may be considered.

Lenalidomide/low-dose dexamethasone — newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (non-transplant candidates) — is supported by trials in transplant-ineligible and older patients showing it is a well-tolerated and effective regimen, with the ECOG E4A03 trial reporting a significantly higher overall survival rate versus high-dose dexamethasone; the inferior survival with high-dose dexamethasone was greatest in those aged ≥ 65 years, and at 2 years patients who did not proceed to transplant had an overall survival rate of 91%, with this regimen considered an option useful in certain circumstances (category 1).

Summary

For patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, survival outcomes continue to improve significantly: however, nearly all patients will relapse following induction treatment. Optimisation of induction therapy is essential to provide longer term disease control and the current standard of care for most patients incorporates an immunomodulatory agent and proteasome inhibitor, most commonly lenalidomide and bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone (RVD), with maintenance until progression. Historically there has been limited access to RVD as an induction strategy outside of the United States; fortunately, there is now increasing access worldwide. This review discusses the rationale for use of RVD as induction therapy and aims to provide guidance in prescribing this regimen in order to optimise efficacy while minimising the toxicities of treatment. We also highlight the increasing evidence for the utility of addition of a monoclonal antibody to the RVD backbone to deepen responses and potentially provide longer disease control.

### Autologous stem cell transplantation in the elderly including pre-and post-treatment options [^114dbbqT]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a disease of the elderly with a median age at diagnosis of 67 years in a referral population. High-dose chemotherapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplantation has been shown to improve survival in patients with MM in randomized trials and remains the preferred option for eligible patients. However, the randomized clinical trials demonstrating an advantage for HDT included only patients younger than 65 years and evidence supporting its role for the elderly patients has been based on retrospective reviews. The introduction of thalidomide, lenalidomide and bortezomib has changed the paradigm for treatment of myeloma and improved the outcome for these patients. Several ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the role of these novel agents in this population, specifically comparing these to HDT-based approaches. Other trials are examining the role of maintenance therapy post-HDT with these novel drugs with or without steroids. The role of HDT will be further redefined in the coming years with improvements in other therapies.

Systemic therapy and corticosteroids — corticosteroids remain a routine initial prescription for patients presenting with cord compression, but the preference between high-dose dexamethasone (96 mg daily) and low-dose (10–16 mg daily) is still unclear; systemic therapy has a limited role in metastatic spinal tumors except for chemosensitive tumors such as lymphoma, myeloma, small cell lung cancer, and germ cell tumors, and agents efficacious for the primary tumor are used.
