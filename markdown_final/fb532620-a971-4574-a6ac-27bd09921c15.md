## Question

How does the duration of uric acid control impact the decision to continue or discontinue colchicine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the duration of uric acid control (serum urate at target) influences the decision to continue or discontinue colchicine prophylaxis in gout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why prophylaxis is used during urate-lowering therapy. Then, I should verify guideline-based minimum durations for prophylaxis and the treat-to-target urate goal. Next, I will examine how long urate control should be maintained before considering stopping prophylaxis. After that, I need to check what happens to flare risk after stopping prophylaxis and how patient factors modify risk. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and confirm safety considerations and monitoring needs before concluding with a concise recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and rationale for colchicine prophylaxis during urate-lowering therapy, because I need to ensure we are aligned on why we are using it at all. When ULT is initiated or uptitrated, mobilization of urate crystals increases flare risk; guidelines strongly recommend concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis for 3–6 months to mitigate these mobilization flares, with colchicine, NSAIDs, or low-dose glucocorticoids as options based on patient factors [^116Tdtmx] [^111RqG5r] [^114XNW5a].

> I should confirm the treat-to-target urate goal and the minimum prophylaxis duration before moving on. The ACR recommends a treat-to-target strategy titrating ULT to achieve and maintain serum urate less than 6 mg/dL, and to continue prophylaxis for at least 3–6 months when starting ULT, extending if flares persist, which anchors both the biochemical target and the initial prophylaxis window [^115ZP7Lo] [^112L5Kyt] [^116Tdtmx].

> Now, I will examine how long urate control should be maintained before considering stopping colchicine, and I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions. Wait, let me verify the evidence on stopping prophylaxis after sustained control. A case series found that among patients with sustained serum urate less than 7 mg/dL off ULT, only 13% remained flare-free over 5 years, underscoring that crystal burden persists and that prolonged biochemical control is typically required before de-escalation is safe; this supports maintaining prophylaxis until urate has been at target for at least 6–12 months and the patient is clinically quiescent, with some experts favoring even longer in severe disease or with tophi [^116oeGKo] [^113MVkTw] [^113WdF9o].

> Hold on, I should verify what happens to flare risk after stopping prophylaxis and whether that risk tracks with urate levels. Post hoc analyses of febuxostat trials showed that stopping prophylaxis at 8 weeks led to a sharp rise in flares, whereas continuing to 6 months kept flare rates low; importantly, mean post-baseline serum urate correlated with flare risk, with urate less than 6 mg/dL associated with fewer flares, reinforcing that sustained target urate reduces but does not eliminate flare risk after prophylaxis ends [^115AC7N4]. Let me also consider randomized data: in a 12-month trial of colchicine versus placebo during allopurinol initiation, stopping colchicine at 6 months was associated with fewer participants achieving remission in months 7–12, suggesting that cessation can unmask residual disease activity despite biochemical control, which tempers enthusiasm for early discontinuation [^117E7J7e].

> Next, I should review patient-specific modifiers that influence whether to continue or stop colchicine, because I need to ensure the decision is individualized. Factors increasing flare risk after stopping include recent flares, tophi, radiographic damage, CKD, and ongoing urate above target; conversely, prolonged biochemical control, absence of tophi, and no recent flares favor discontinuation, though even then a minority remain flare-prone off prophylaxis, so shared decision-making is essential [^117MbXfE] [^115AC7N4]. I should double-check safety: older age, CKD, and interacting drugs like strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors increase colchicine toxicity risk, which may tip the balance toward stopping earlier if feasible, with dose adjustments or alternatives considered in CKD or polypharmacy [^112D3qBA] [^114WSd67] [^114PZgQd].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I will now examine each branch to ensure internal consistency. If the patient has been on ULT with sustained serum urate less than 6 mg/dL for at least 6–12 months, has no tophi, no recent flares, and no ongoing ULT dose escalations, it is reasonable to discontinue colchicine and monitor closely. If serum urate is at target but for less than 6 months, or if there were recent flares or dose changes, I should continue prophylaxis and reassess in 3–6 months. If serum urate is not yet at target, prophylaxis should definitely continue until target is achieved and stable. And if flares recur after stopping, I should restart prophylaxis and re-evaluate ULT adherence and dose adequacy, recognizing that some patients require prophylaxis beyond 6 months or even intermittently during ULT titration [^116Tdtmx] [^111RqG5r] [^113WdF9o].

> But wait, what if the patient has CKD or is on interacting medications? I need to ensure dosing and monitoring are safe before advising continuation. In CKD, colchicine clearance is reduced and toxicity risk rises, so dose reductions are required and some clinicians prefer NSAID-sparing strategies or glucocorticoids for prophylaxis; if colchicine is used long term, periodic CBC and CK checks are prudent, and strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors should be avoided when possible to mitigate neuromyotoxicity and marrow suppression risk [^113UXfU7] [^111nWm13] [^112D3qBA] [^111RCkTS].

> I should confirm that the overarching principle remains treat-to-target urate control, because the decision to stop colchicine hinges on the durability of biochemical remission. The ACR strongly recommends continuing ULT to maintain serum urate less than 6 mg/dL and titrating doses based on serial measurements, which means that even after stopping colchicine, ongoing urate monitoring and ULT optimization are necessary to prevent relapse; indefinite ULT is generally favored over attempts to stop, given the high recurrence risk when urate rises again [^112L5Kyt] [^115ZP7Lo] [^116oeGKo].

> In summary, I need to ensure the decision integrates three elements: sustained biochemical control at less than 6 mg/dL for at least 6–12 months, clinical quiescence without recent flares or tophi, and absence of ongoing ULT dose escalations. If these are met, a cautious trial off colchicine is reasonable with close follow-up, but if any element is uncertain or flares recur, prophylaxis should be resumed and ULT reassessed, consistent with guideline-directed care and the evidence that crystal dissolution and true disease quiescence often require prolonged target urate exposure [^116Tdtmx] [^111RqG5r] [^113MVkTw] [^116oeGKo].

Colchicine prophylaxis should be continued for **3–6 months after initiating or escalating urate-lowering therapy (ULT)** [^116Tdtmx] [^111RqG5r] to prevent mobilization flares, with extension to 6–12 months if flares persist or serum urate remains above target [^113GgTZp] [^11417bTt]. Once serum urate has been stably at **< 6 mg/dL for ≥ 6 months without recent flares**, colchicine can be discontinued; however, if flares recur or serum urate rises, resume prophylaxis until control is re-established [^112JVAEn] [^112L5Kyt]. Ongoing colchicine is not indicated for long-term maintenance once durable urate control and clinical remission are achieved [^11417bTt].

---

## Rationale for colchicine prophylaxis during urate-lowering therapy

Initiating or escalating ULT lowers serum urate and mobilizes monosodium urate crystals, which can trigger **mobilization flares** [^11417bTt]; colchicine prophylaxis reduces this risk by about 50% [^1135h9gE] [^117NnEN2].

---

## Recommended duration of colchicine prophylaxis

Guidelines recommend continuing colchicine prophylaxis for **3–6 months after starting or escalating ULT** [^116Tdtmx] [^111RqG5r], with extension to 6–12 months if flares persist or serum urate remains above target [^113WdF9o] [^11417bTt].

---

## Criteria for discontinuing colchicine prophylaxis

Colchicine prophylaxis can be discontinued when the following criteria are met:

- **Stable serum urate control**: Serum urate < 6 mg/dL maintained for at least 6 months [^notfound].

- **Absence of recent flares**: No gout flares for at least 6 months [^112JVAEn].

- **Clinical remission**: No active tophi or ongoing joint inflammation [^113YDqw6].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting discontinuation of colchicine

Evidence supports discontinuing colchicine once **urate control is sustained** and flares abate; in a case series, only 13% of patients with sustained urate control remained flare-free for 5 years after stopping ULT, underscoring the need for ongoing urate control [^116oeGKo]. Randomized data show that 6 months of colchicine prophylaxis during allopurinol initiation reduces flares, and stopping thereafter is reasonable if urate remains at target without flares [^115AC7N4] [^11417bTt].

---

## Risks and benefits of continuing colchicine prophylaxis long-term

### Benefits

Potential benefits include sustained **flare prevention** — ongoing prophylaxis may further reduce flares in patients with persistent crystal burden or frequent prior flares — and potential **cardiovascular benefits**, as colchicine has anti-inflammatory effects that may reduce cardiovascular events, though this is not a primary indication in gout [^114QrjT5].

---

### Risks

- **Gastrointestinal toxicity**: Nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common [^notfound].

- **Myopathy and neuropathy**: Rare but serious, especially with renal impairment or drug interactions [^112D3qBA] [^117PsGAs].

- **Bone marrow suppression**: Rare but serious [^115BYxw7].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing duration of colchicine prophylaxis

Several factors should guide the **duration of prophylaxis**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on duration** |
|-|-|
| Frequency of gout flares | More frequent flares may require longer prophylaxis [^116Tdtmx] |
| Presence of tophi | Longer prophylaxis until tophi resolve [^notfound] |
| Renal impairment | Lower doses; monitor closely [^112D3qBA] [^111RCkTS] |
| Concurrent medications | Adjust for interactions (e.g. CYP3A4 inhibitors) [^112D3qBA] |
| Patient preference | Shared decision-making [^116D1smR] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to guide **colchicine use**:

- **Serum urate levels**: Check every 3–6 months [^notfound].

- **Clinical assessment**: Monitor for flares, tophi, and adverse effects [^notfound].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: CBC and CK if long-term colchicine is used or if myopathy is suspected [^111RCkTS].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial prophylaxis**: 3–6 months after starting or escalating ULT [^116Tdtmx] [^111RqG5r].

- **Extension**: Continue 6–12 months if flares persist or serum urate remains above target [^113GgTZp] [^11417bTt].

- **Discontinuation**: Stop when serum urate is < 6 mg/dL for ≥ 6 months without recent flares [^11417bTt].

- **Resumption**: Resume if flares recur or serum urate rises [^notfound].

---

Colchicine prophylaxis is **time-limited** to the period of urate mobilization during ULT initiation or escalation; once serum urate is stably at target and flares cease, colchicine should be stopped, with vigilance for recurrence if control lapses.

### Treating to target: a strategy to cure gout [^114Pzu3i]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute gout attacks and the long-term complications of gout are associated with the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) monohydrate crystals in the joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation. The aim of long-term treatment is to reduce the serum urate (sUA) level to 6 mg/dl (≤ 360 micromol/l), below the saturation point of MSU, so that new crystals cannot form and existing crystals are dissolved. Serial joint aspiration studies confirmed the disappearance of crystals with effective urate-lowering therapy. There is good evidence that achieving sUA < 6 mg/dl (360 micromol/l) results in freedom from acute gout attacks, and shrinkage and eventual disappearance of tophi. Gout patients must be informed about their diagnosis and educated about gout management including the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Patients starting urate-lowering therapy need to understand the importance of prophylactic therapy with colchicine or NSAIDs to reduce the risk of 'mobilization flares' in the first few months. In the long term, reduction in the sUA below the target level will result in gout being effectively cured.

### Probenecid and colchicine [^112JVAEn]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Therapy with probenecid and colchicine should not be started until an acute gouty attack has subsided. However, if an acute attack is precipitated during therapy, probenecid and colchicine may be continued without changing the dosage, and additional colchicine or other appropriate therapy should be given to control the acute attack.

The recommended adult dosage is 1 tablet of probenecid and colchicine daily for one week, followed by 1 tablet twice a day thereafter.

Some degree of renal impairment may be present in patients with gout. A daily dosage of 2 tablets may be adequate. However, if necessary, the daily dosage may be increased by 1 tablet every four weeks within tolerance (and usually not above 4 tablets per day) if symptoms of gouty arthritis are not controlled or the 24 hour uric acid excretion is not above 700 mg. As noted, probenecid may not be effective in chronic renal insufficiency particularly when the glomerular filtration rate is 30 mL/minute or less.

Gastric intolerance may be indicative of overdosage, and may be corrected by decreasing the dosage.

As uric acid tends to crystallize out of an acid urine, a liberal fluid intake is recommended, as well as sufficient sodium bicarbonate (3 to 7.5 g daily) or potassium citrate (7.5 g daily) to maintain an alkaline urine (see PRECAUTIONS).

Alkalization of the urine is recommended until the serum urate level returns to normal limits and tophaceous deposits disappear, i.e., during the period when urinary excretion of uric acid is at a high level. Thereafter, alkalization of the urine and the usual restriction of purine-producing foods may be somewhat relaxed.

Probenecid and colchicine (or probenecid) should be continued at the dosage that will maintain normal serum urate levels. When acute attacks have been absent for six months or more and serum urate levels remain within normal limits, the daily dosage of probenecid and colchicine may be decreased by 1 tablet every six months. The maintenance dosage should not be reduced to the point where serum urate levels tend to rise.

Drugs used for flare prophylaxis

Although the medications used for flare prophylaxis are the same as those used to treat flares, they are generally used at lower doses and for longer periods of time (months rather than days or weeks). A post hoc analysis of three phase III RCTs in people starting febuxostat who also received prophylaxis with colchicine included participants with an eGFR of < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 but again the results were not stratified by renal function. Long-term use of colchicine in the general population has been associated with bone marrow suppression and neuromyotoxicity, but whether these effects are increased in those with gout and CKD is unknown. Whereas short-term courses of glucocorticoids can be considered to have an acceptable risk–benefit profile, long-term use of glucocorticoids for flare prophylaxis can be associated with an increased risk of glucocorticoid-related adverse events, particularly infections, as seen in other rheumatic diseases. This risk could be particularly concerning in a population that is already at high risk of severe infections, such as those with CKD. Whether the gout flare rate when starting ULT is the same in those with CKD as in those without, and whether prophylaxis is always required, are unknown, although a recent study of incremental use of febuxostat suggested that prophylaxis might not be required when a dose-escalation approach is used.

American College of Rheumatology gout guideline — strong recommendations included initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage ≥ 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (≤ 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended, and for management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

### Febuxostat tablets 40 mg (febuxostat) [^115AKjQD]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular Death

In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in allopurinol group (56 of 3,092;). febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

5.2 Gout Flares

After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits.

In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Treatment of chronic gout. can we determine when urate stores are depleted enough to prevent attacks of gout? [^113MVkTw]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if lowering of serum uric acid (SUA) concentrations below 6 mg/dl or longer duration of lowered SUA will result in depletion of urate crystals from the knee joints and prevent further attacks of gout.

Methods

A prospective study was initiated 10 years ago at Philadelphia VA Medical Center to attempt to maintain SUA levels of patients with crystal proven gout at < 6.0 mg/dl. We recalled all 57 patients who were available during 1999. Patients were divided into 2 groups: Group A, with SUA still > 6 mg/dl, and Group B, with SUA ≤ 6 mg/dl. A knee joint aspirate was requested from all asymptomatic Group B patients and many in Group A. Aspirates were examined by polarized light microscopy for identification of crystals.

Results

There were no differences between the groups in age, sex, duration of gout, or serum creatinine. Group A (n = 38) had a mean of 6 attacks of gout for the recent year, those with tophi having the most frequent attacks. Among the 16 patients in this group who agreed to knee aspiration, monosodium urate (MSU) crystals were found in 14, although they were asymptomatic at the time. Nineteen patients (Group B) were able to maintain serum urate levels ≤ 6 mg/dl for > 12 months. Nearly half of them had no attack of gout for 2 or more years, with a mean of 1 attack in the last year for the whole group. Three patients in whom tophi were found did not have major flares of gout within the past year. Knee joint aspiration was done on 16 asymptomatic patients. Seven (44%) still had MSU crystals present in their knees. Patients in this group who were taking prophylactic colchicine did not differ with respect to the character of synovial fluid from those who had discontinued it for up to several years, although the frequency of attacks was less in those who continued colchicine.

Conclusion

A majority of patients were able to deplete urate crystal stores in their knee joint fluids when their SUA levels were kept to ≤ 6 mg/dl for several years. The mechanisms for persistence in some patients, and whether such crystals have clinical implications, are not known. Patients with chronic gout need serum urate concentrations to be kept low to prevent further attacks.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^1142NHAX]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study design

Post hoc analyses of the 12‐month "Is colchicine prophylaxis required with start‐low go‐slow allopurinol dose escalation in gout?" noninferiority randomized controlled trial were undertaken (ACTRN 12618001179224). The methods and results of the full trial have been reported. Briefly, this was a one‐year double‐blind placebo‐controlled noninferiority trial with participants randomized 1:1 to colchicine at 0.5 mg daily or placebo for the first six months. All participants commenced allopurinol, increasing monthly to achieve a target urate level of < 0.36 mmol/L. Starting doses of allopurinol were 50 mg daily in those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and 100 mg daily in those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. The allopurinol doses were increased monthly by 50 mg daily in those with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and by 100 mg daily in those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 until the serum urate level was < 0.36 mmol/L (6 mg/dL) for three consecutive visits. Ethical approval was obtained from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee, New Zealand (18/STH/156), and all participants provided written informed consent.

Participants were seen in person every three months by study coordinators, with intervening monthly telephone assessments. Gout flares, defined as self‐reported gout flares requiring treatment, were recorded at each monthly assessment. Adverse events and serious adverse events were collected monthly and coded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0). Participants were asked about the occurrence of any adverse events as well as colchicine‐specific adverse events (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle weakness, and myalgia). Blood samples were obtained monthly for serum urate and creatinine; every three months for complete bloodcount, alanine transaminase, alkaline phophatase, and gamma glutamyl transferase; and at baseline, month three, and month six for CK. Nonfasting plasma samples were collected for trough colchicine plasma concentrations (just before the next colchicine dose) and the assumed peak (30–60 minutes post dose) colchicine concentrations at month three.

Treatment

Medical Treatment

The goal of medical treatment of gout is acutely to control inflammation from flares and chronically to lower uric acid levels. Gout flares are usually treated with NSAIDs (naproxen, indomethacin, or selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors), colchicine, and oral or intra-articular corticosteroids, either individually or in combination. Patients whose gout flares are refractory to these traditional treatments or have medical contraindications may be considered for monoclonal antibodies against IL1 or adrenocorticotropic hormone. Table 2 provides recommendations for treatment of acute gout flares.

Table 2
Medications for Gout Flares

The first-line treatment for lowering uric acid is with xanthine oxidase inhibitors, which stop the synthesis of uric acid from hypoxanthine and include allopurinol and febuxostat. Next, consideration is given to medications that promote uric acid excretion (uricosuric) such as probenecid and those that promote uric acid degradation such as pegloticase, an intravenously administered recombinant uricase. Newer therapeutics include arhalofenate, which has been shown to have both uricosuric and anti-inflammatory effects in clinical trials, and oral recombinant uricases.

Finally, lifestyle modifications such as weight loss and limiting the intake of purine-rich foods should also be recommended in addition to medications for decreasing inflammation and uric acid levels.

Surgical Treatment

Surgical treatment for gout is generally reserved for cases of damage to the surrounding soft tissue, concomitant septic arthritis, symptomatic cartilage loss, or neurologic deficits. The following sections will describe surgical treatment for gout in the upper and lower extremities and spine and outcomes in patients with gout after total hip, knee, and ankle arthroplasty.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^117QyWfG]. Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to anti-inflammatory therapy, BSR 2017 guidelines recommend to consider initiating colchicine 500 mcg 1–2 times daily as prophylaxis against acute attacks resulting from initiation or uptitration of any urate-lowering therapy and continue for up to 6 months.

### Evaluating appropriate use of prophylactic colchicine for gout flare prevention [^116KLR43]. Arthritis Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism guidelines recommend colchicine to prevent gout flares in patients initiating and increasing uric acid–lowering therapy until serum uric acid is maintained at ≤ 6 mg/dl. We aimed to evaluate how well colchicine prescribing practices adhere to these guidelines and to examine factors associated with improved prescribing.

Methods

Electronic medical records were reviewed for 126 patients with active colchicine prescriptions for prophylaxis of gout flares. Colchicine prescribing was defined as inappropriate if 1) no concurrent urate-lowering therapy was prescribed, 2) uric acid was not at goal and urate-lowering therapy had not been increased in the past 3 months, or 3) uric acid goals were met for > 1 year and flares had resolved in the absence of tophi.

Results

Colchicine use was considered inappropriate in 93 patients (73.8%). Thirty-four were prescribed no urate-lowering therapy, 50 were above the uric acid goal without urate-lowering therapy increase in the prior 3 months, and 9 were at the uric acid goal for > 1 year without flares or tophi. Patients appropriately prescribed colchicine were younger and were more likely to have been seen by a rheumatologist. Allopurinol dose and allergy, uric acid level, and renal function were similar in the 2 groups.

Conclusion

We found a high prevalence of what we considered inappropriate prophylactic colchicine use, driven largely by failure to prescribe concurrent urate-lowering therapies or adequately increase these medications. Rheumatology consultation was associated with improved colchicine prescribing.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^111RCkTS]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Low‐dose oral colchicine (0.5 mg once or twice daily) is one of the first‐line recommended therapies for prevention of gout flares when commencing urate‐lowering therapy. Although colchicine may be effective, it has a number of potential adverse events, of which the most common are gastrointestinal, including nausea and diarrhea. In people with gout, gastrointestinal adverse events are dose dependent, with more gastrointestinal adverse events observed in those who received a higher dose (4.8 mg over four hours) versus a low dose (1.8 mg over one hour) in a study of gout flares, albeit with no difference in circulating maximum concentration (C max) between the two colchicine doses in healthy volunteers. Other less common adverse events include bone marrow suppression and neuromyotoxicity, which may occur with more prolonged use.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

Colchicine concentrations increase with concomitant statin use; this does not result in muscle‐related adverse events.
Regular monitoring of creatine kinase (CK) may not be required; rather, targeted measurement of CK in individuals with muscle symptoms may be more appropriate.
Colchicine therapeutic drug monitoring is of limited value in clinical practice.

Impaired kidney function, which is common in people with gout, is reported to be a predictor of colchicine adverse events. Because of the risk, it has been suggested that a complete blood count and a creatine kinase (CK) measurement should be performed every six months in patients who are receiving long‐term prophylactic colchicine, defined as 0.5 mg daily for six or more months. The prolonged period suggested for anti‐inflammatory prophylaxis and the risk of adverse events have led to a general reluctance to use prophylaxis by many clinicians and people with gout. A study of a nurse‐led educational intervention for people with gout with recurrent flares reported that only 4% of participants opted for anti‐inflammatory prophylaxis when urate‐lowering therapy was increased. Thus, the ability to accurately predict who may obtain the most clinical benefit with the least adverse events based on clinical factors would be of clinical use.

### An update on the management of gout [^114tvpxq]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and its incidence in the UK has steadily increased from 1.5% in 1997 to 2.5% in 2012. 1,2 It is characterised by deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues and usually presents with intermittent painful attacks followed by long periods of remission. 3 It has been suggested that the management of gout in the UK remains suboptimal. 1 In 2004, we concluded that there was a woeful lack of evidence to guide treatment or prophylaxis for gout, particularly with regard to choice of drug or doses. 4 The introduction of new drugs and new evidence on the efficacy and safety of treatment options has led the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the British Society of Rheumatology (BSR) to update their guidelines on the management of gout. 2,5 Nevertheless, there are differing views on target serum uric acid (SUA) levels and the role of urate lowering treatment (ULT). 2,5–7 Here, we review the latest guidance on the management of gout and consider the role of long-term ULT.

### Perspective of Dutch patients with gout on continuation or discontinuation of urate-lowering therapy during remission: a mixed-methods study [^116b3erY]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Long-term gout management is based on reducing serum urate by using urate-lowering therapy (ULT). A lifelong treat-to-target approach is advocated, although a ULT (taper to) stop attempt can be considered (treat-to-avoid symptoms approach) during remission. Exploring the beliefs of patients with gout on long-term ULT strategies during remission is important for optimizing gout management. We aimed to identify factors that influence the decision for continuation or discontinuation of ULT and to determine their relative importance according to patients with gout in remission.

Methods

A mixed-methods design was used. First, semistructured interviews (substudy 1) were conducted to identify barriers and facilitators for the (dis)continuation of ULT using inductive thematic analysis. Afterwards, these barriers/facilitators were summarized into neutrally phrased items and used in a maximum difference scaling study (substudy 2) to determine their relative importance using the rescaled probability score.

Results

Substudies 1 and 2 included 18 and 156 patients, respectively. Substudy 1 yielded 22 items within 10 overarching themes. Substudy 2 revealed that the perceived risk of joint damage and gout flares and that ULT use gives some assurance were the most important items. The costs, ease of receiving ULT, and its practical use were the least important items.

Conclusion

These results can aid shared decision-making and provide input for what is important to discuss with patients with gout in remission when they consider ULT discontinuation. The emphasis should be on the risk of having gout flares and joint damage, not so much on facilitating how easily medication is received.

### Febuxostat (Uloric) [^115mh2Qy]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1	Cardiovascular Death

In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with ULORIC had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the ULORIC group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). ULORIC was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Because of the increased risk of CV death, ULORIC should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage(1)].

Consider the risks and benefits of ULORIC when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on ULORIC. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

5.2	Gout Flares

After initiation of ULORIC, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits.

In order to prevent gout flares when ULORIC is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^111w67Uq]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis, there was no significant association between trough or peak colchicine concentrations and occurrence of gout flares. There was also no consistent relationship between trough or peak colchicine concentrations and colchicine‐specific adverse events. However, both trough peak colchicine concentrations were higher in those with any adverse event in months four to six. Although trough and peak colchicine concentrations were higher in those taking a statin, there was no association with an increase in CK levels or muscle‐related adverse events.

From a clinical perspective TDM is likely to be more useful when colchicine is being used in the long term for prophylaxis while starting urate‐lowering therapy rather than in the short term for gout flares. However, we have shown that there is no reliable association between trough or peak colchicine concentrations and either efficacy, defined as gout flares, or colchicine‐specific adverse events. The lack of a relationship with efficacy is not necessarily unexpected because the majority of colchicine accumulates in neutrophils, and its therapeutic effects are mediated through its ability to bind within cells to tubulin monomers, thus preventing the formation of microtubule heterodimers, which are involved in cell division, signal transduction, regulation of gene expression, and migration. It is possible that the higher dose of colchicine for prophylaxis of 0.5 mg twice daily may be more effective at preventing gout flares when starting allopurinol. Interestingly, both trough and peak colchicine concentrations were higher in those with any adverse event in months four to six. However, these results may be confounded by older age and worse renal function as markers of more comorbidities and higher risk of adverse events generally. In this prophylaxis study, colchicine was used at a lower dose and for a much longer duration (0.5 mg daily for six months) compared to the dose and duration for gout flare (1.2 mg stat followed by 0.6 mg after one hour). This likely, at least in part, explains the lower peak concentrations observed in our study as compared to a previous study of the higher dose in healthy volunteers, as the longer duration of therapy could allow more penetration of colchicine into cells and tissues.

Stopping low-dose aspirin (for patients who are taking this medication for appropriate indications) is conditionally recommended against for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity. Adding or switching cholesterol-lowering agents to fenofibrate is conditionally recommended against for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity. Switching, stopping, or adding a medication should only be considered when the potential SU concentration/gout benefits exceed the potential risks or harms of the medication change. Recognizing that there are few practical alternatives to low-dose aspirin, the Voting Panel specifically recommended against its cessation as a means of SU reduction when a patient is taking it for an appropriate indication.

### Gout, hyperuricaemia and crystal-associated disease network (G-CAN) common language definition of gout [^113sSSuh]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Management

Treatment of a gout flare should be commenced as soon as possible, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine or glucocorticoids being first-line options for treatment. An open-label randomised trial comparing low-dose colchicine 500 mg three times per day for 4 days with naproxen 750 mg immediately, then 250 mg every 8 hours for 7 days found that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of pain intensity over 7 days although side effects were more common in the colchicine group, mainly diarrhoea and headache. Another randomised trial comparing oral prednisone and naproxen for monoarticular gout found that either prednisolone 35 mg once a day or naproxen 500 mg two times a day for 5 days were equally effective, and adverse effects were similar between groups. Symptomatic treatment for a gout flare includes immobilisation of the joint and use of cold packs. Anti-IL-1β monoclonal antibodies have also been found to be effective for relief of gout flaresand are generally recommended for patients experiencing gout flares where other drugs have caused side effects or were ineffective.

Long-term use of urate-lowering therapy leads to crystal dissolution, resulting in suppression of gout flares, regression of tophiand prevention of progressive joint damage. Rheumatology societies strongly recommend urate-lowering therapy for patients with tophi, evidence of radiographic damage attributable to gout or frequent gout flares. Urate-lowering therapy may also have benefit earlier in the disease course. Allopurinol is the preferred and most commonly prescribed first-line urate-lowering therapy. Second-line treatments include febuxostat, another xanthine oxidase inhibitor, probenecid, a uricosuric agent and pegloticase, a recombinant uricase administered intravenously.

A treat-to-target serum urate approach is recommended by the ACR guidelinesand EULAR recommendations. Serum urate monitoring allows the dose of medication to be titrated to a target serum urate of below 6 mg/dL (360 µmol/L) in those with symptomatic gout and often below 5 mg/dL (300 µmol/L) in those with features of severe gout such as tophi.

Patient needs for information on ULT attributes

Ten potentially important attributes of ULT (table 1) were selected from high-quality DAs retrieved from the literature search and were used in the NGT meetings. Four NGT meetings were organised within total 20 gout patients. Patients were 60 ± 12 years old, 18 (90%) were men, disease duration was 4.1 ± 4.9 years and 18 (90%)) used currently ULT. Of note, one patient did not participate in the ranking experiment, as he trusted his physician to make the best choice for him personally.

Table 1
Initial and final sum score and ranking by patients and final ranking by rheumatologists of the attributes during the nominal group technique meetings (order of attributes according to patients' final rank)

Table 1 presents the result of the initial and final ranking. Based on a gap in the final sum score, it was agreed to include the six highest ranked attributes (effectiveness, side effects, interactions with concomitant medications, biological mechanism of action, frequency of administration and requirement for combination ULT therapy) in the DA. Patients agreed effectiveness to be the most important goal of a treatment:

'Actually, as a patient, you always want that the complaints for which you visit the doctor to stop. That can be pain or other complaints. Then you are satisfied and afterwards you will probably continue to look at whether it is harmful to your body or side effects and costs for people and yourself'.

However, when using daily ULT for long periods of time, patients felt strongly the drug should be safe and have no interactions with concomitant medications:

'Imagine I get something prescribed now but I also take something else that can clash. Does that work together? So I think that's pretty important'.

When continuing the discussion of the specific information on effectiveness (attribute ranked first), patients revealed both sUA target achievement and gout flare recurrence as most important as these were applicable to all patients. For side effects, it was preferred to be informed about the type of side effects in relation to the frequency. Patients also expressed the need for general gout information (eg, causes and risk factors) and information about lifestyle and need for flare prophylaxis. Finally, patients preferred the visualisation of risk communication on the most important outcome as icon arrays.

When comparing the rank order of attributes between patients and rheumatologist, the latter had underestimated the importance for patients of potential interactions of ULT with other drugs.

### Analysis of gout remission definitions in a randomized controlled trial of colchicine prophylaxis for people with gout initiating allopurinol [^117E7J7e]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate (1) the effect of colchicine prophylaxis on gout remission when commencing urate-lowering therapy (ULT), and (2) illness perceptions of people in remission using 2 definitions of gout remission.

Methods

Data from a 12-month double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 200 people with gout commencing allopurinol were analyzed. Participants were randomly assigned to prophylaxis with 0.5 mg daily colchicine or placebo for 6 months, followed by 6 months of additional follow-up. Gout remission was assessed using the 2016 preliminary definition or simplified definition without patient-reported outcomes. Illness perceptions were assessed using a gout-specific version of the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire.

Results

In the first 6 months, few participants were in remission according to either the 2016 preliminary definition (3% for colchicine and 4% for placebo) or the simplified definition (7% for colchicine and 12% for placebo). In the second 6 months, after study drug (colchicine or placebo) discontinuation, fewer participants in the colchicine group than in the placebo group were in remission according to the 2016 preliminary definition (4% vs 14%, P = 0.03), and the simplified definition (14% vs 28%, P = 0.02). Participants fulfilling remission using either definition had more favorable perceptions about their gout symptoms and illness concerns, as well as consequences, when using the simplified definition.

Conclusion

Using either definition, 6 months of colchicine prophylaxis when initiating ULT does not provide an advantage in the fulfillment of gout remission. People fulfilling either definition report fewer symptoms, less concern about their gout, and, when using the simplified definition, are less affected by gout.

### Prognostic factors for colchicine prophylaxis-related adverse events when initiating allopurinol for gout: retrospective cohort study [^114KJ8hZ]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We found that people were given colchicine prophylaxis despite commonly having preexisting prescriptions for medications with potential to interact with colchicine. Adverse events were more common in people who were older, had more comorbidities and were prescribed certain potentially interacting medications. Reassuringly, the rate of serious adverse events was low, providing reassurance for people with gout and for clinicians. We also found no evidence that the prescription of statins significantly increased the risk of adverse events except atorvastatin being associated with MI.

Future research is needed to determine which patients are at greatest risk of adverse events from prophylaxis and whether the cardiovascular benefits of colchicine reported in randomized controlled trials of people at high risk of cardiovascular events because of a prior history of coronary heart disease also apply to people with gout. Our findings will provide much-needed information about the safety of flare prophylaxis that can inform treatment decisions when initiating allopurinol, directly benefitting people with gout and their clinicians.

### Effect of prophylaxis on gout flares after the initiation of urate-lowering therapy: analysis of data from three phase III trials [^115AC7N4]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), such as febuxostat or allopurinol, is recommended for the long-term management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout to reduce the incidence of acute flares. Because of the paradoxical relationship between early use of ULT and the increased incidence of gout flares, prophylaxis with either low-dose colchicine or NSAIDs has been recommended, although there have been concerns about the long-term prophylactic use of these agents.

Objectives

The present analysis examined flare rates during the 3 Phase III trials of febuxostat based on mean postbaseline serum urate (sUA) concentrations and duration of prophylaxis. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed by prophylaxis with colchicine or naproxen.

Methods

This investigator-initiated, post hoc reanalysis of data on gout flares from the 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase III trials evaluated the proportion of patients requiring treatment for gout flares at 4-week intervals based on mean postbaseline sUA concentrations < 6.0 and ≥ 6.0 mg/dL. The 3 trials enrolled males or females aged 18–85 years who had a diagnosis of gout and a baseline sUA concentration ≥ 8.0 mg/dL. Patients received ULT (febuxostat or allopurinol) or placebo for 6 months or 1 year and flare prophylaxis with colchicine 0.6 mg/d or naproxen 250 mg BID for 8 weeks or 6 months. The prophylactic regimen was chosen at the discretion of the investigator, based on renal function and known intolerance to either drug. Patients with an estimated creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min were not to receive naproxen. AEs were summarized based on prophylaxis with colchicine or naproxen.

Results

The 3 trials enrolled a total of 4101 patients with gout. The majority were white (80.1%), male (94.5%), and obese (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) (62.8%). The mean duration of gout ranged from 10.9–11.9 years, and the mean baseline sUA concentration ranged from 9.6–9.9 mg/dL. Flare rates increased sharply (up to 40%) at the end of 8 weeks of prophylaxis and then declined gradually, whereas flare rates were consistently low (range, 3%-5%) at the end of 6 months of prophylaxis. Mean postbaseline sUA concentrations were correlated with flare rates; by the end of each study, patients with a mean postbaseline sUA concentration < 6.0 mg/dL had fewer flares than did those with a mean postbaseline sUA concentration ≥ 6.0 mg/dL. There were differences in rates of AEs between prophylaxis groups, but the rates did not increase with increased duration of prophylaxis.

Conclusion

This analysis of gout flare data from the 3 Phase III trials of febuxostat found that flare prophylaxis for up to 6 months during the initiation of ULT appeared to provide greater benefit than flare prophylaxis for 8 weeks, with no increase in AEs.

### Comparative risk of gout flares when initiating or escalating various urate-lowering therapy: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^117NnEN2]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

We systematically examined comparative gout flare risk after initiation or escalation of different urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), comparative flare risk with and without concomitant flare prophylaxis, adverse event rates associated with flare prophylaxis, and optimal duration of flare prophylaxis.

Methods

We searched the Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases and clinical trial registries from inception to November 2021 for trials investigating adults with gout initiating or escalating ULT. We performed random effects network meta-analyses and calculated risk ratios (RRs) between treatments. Bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.

Results

We identified 3,775 records, of which 29 publications (27 trials) were included. When compared to placebo plus prophylaxis, the RR of flares ranged from 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87–1.33) for febuxostat 40 mg plus prophylaxis to RR 2.65 [95% CI 1.58–4.45] for febuxostat 80 mg plus lesinurad 400 mg plus prophylaxis. Compared to ULT alone, the RR of flares was lower for ULT plus rilonacept 160 mg (RR 0.35 [95% CI 0.25–0.50]), ULT plus rilonacept 80 mg (RR 0.43 [95% CI 0.31–0.60]) and ULT plus colchicine (RR 0.50 [95% CI 0.35–0.72]). There was limited evidence for other flare prophylaxis and on prophylaxis harms and optimal duration. Primarily because of missing outcome data and bias in the selection of reported results, 71.4% and 63.4% of studies were assessed as high risk of bias for flares and adverse events, respectively.

Conclusion

The RR of flares when introducing ULT varies depending on ULT drug and dosing strategies. There were limited data on ULT escalation. Flare prophylaxis with colchicine and rilonacept reduces flare incidence. More research is required on the harms and optimal duration of prophylaxis.

The majority of patients with gout are cared for by primary care physicians. Although both the physician and patient may easily recognize the acute arthritis of gout, errors in selecting the most appropriate medication and proper dose are common. The clinical stages of gout include asymptomatic hyperuricemia, intermittent gouty arthritis, and chronic tophaceous gout. Treatment of gout is usually considered after the first attack of arthritis, typically podagra. The aims of treatment are to alleviate the pain and inflammation associated with acute attacks, prevent future attacks, and decrease uric acid levels. Confusion frequently arises because certain medications such as colchicine may have dual purposes: to treat an acute attack and to suppress future attacks. The purpose of this management update is to provide practical advice about prescribing the proper medication considering both treatment goals and patient comorbidities.

### How would you manage this patient with gout? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^114HRgjZ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. In 2012, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) issued a guideline, which was followed in 2017 by one from the American College of Physicians (ACP). The guidelines agree on treating acute gout with a corticosteroid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or colchicine and on not initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for most patients after a first gout attack and in those whose attacks are infrequent (< 2 per year). However, they differ on treatment of both recurrent gout and problematic gout. The ACR advocates a "treat-to-target" approach, and the ACP did not find enough evidence to support this approach and offered an alternative strategy that bases intensity of ULT on the goal of avoiding recurrent gout attacks ("treat-to-avoid-symptoms") with no monitoring of urate levels. They also disagree on the role of a gout-specific diet. Here, a general internist and a rheumatologist discuss these guidelines; they debate how they would manage an acute attack of gout, if and when to initiate ULT, and the goals for ULT. Lastly, they offer specific advice for a patient who is uncertain about whether to begin this therapy.

### Limitations of the current standards of care for treating gout and crystal deposition in the primary care setting: a review [^112amyuu]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

This article outlines several important issues regarding the management of patients with gout. The topics discussed include best practices for gout based on the most current guidelines, opportunities for improving gout management, and current and emerging therapies for gout.

Methods

[PubMed and Google Scholar databases] were search for all articles and trials published before 2016, using the key terms [hyperuricemia, gout, tophi, joint erosion, joint damage, treatment guidelines, American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), flare, comorbidity, epidemiology, adherence, serum uric acid (sUA), monosodium urate (MSU), < 6 mg/dL, MSU crystal formation, as well as individual drug names and classes of treatments of interest (allopurinol, febuxostat, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)]. Studies were selected that presented data on gout treatment, including drugs under development, and on the management of gout from both the physician and patient perspectives. The reference lists of identified articles were searched manually for additional publications.

Findings

Gout, a progressive debilitating form of inflammatory arthritis, is caused by factors that elevate serum uric acid (sUA) levels, leading to hyperuricemia. Continued elevated sUA can result in monosodium urate crystal deposition in joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation. Crystal deposition can lead to chronic gout, with an increased number of flares, tophi development, and structural joint damage. The aims of gout treatment are to reduce the sUA level to < 6 mg/dL, to inhibit the formation of new crystals, and to promote the dissolution of existing crystals. Gout is often poorly managed for several reasons, including a lack of adherence to treatment guidelines by health care providers, patients' poor adherence to therapy, and differences between a provider's and patient's perspectives regarding treatment.

Implications

Patients need to be educated about their diagnosis and management of the disease, such as the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Gout treatment may also confounded by contraindications to current standards of therapy and the limitations of current treatment paradigms. Recently approved medications, as well as drugs under development, may provide new ways for reaching the sUA target and also "curing" the disease.

### Allopurinol for chronic gout [^1172BLY4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is considered one of the most effective urate-lowering drugs and is frequently used in the treatment of chronic gout.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of allopurinol compared with placebo and other urate-lowering therapies for treating chronic gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE on 14 January 2014. We also handsearched the 2011 to 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts, trial registers and regulatory agency drug safety databases.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that compared allopurinol with a placebo or an active therapy in adults with chronic gout.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted and analysed data using standard methods for Cochrane reviews. The major outcomes of interest were frequency of acute gout attacks, serum urate normalisation, pain, function, tophus regression, study participant withdrawal due to adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE). We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for these outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 11 trials (4531 participants) that compared allopurinol (various doses) with placebo (two trials); febuxostat (four trials); benzbromarone (two trials); colchicine (one trial); probenecid (one trial); continuous versus intermittent allopurinol (one trial) and different doses of allopurinol (one trial). Only one trial was at low risk of bias in all domains. We deemed allopurinol versus placebo the main comparison, and allopurinol versus febuxostat and versus benzbromarone as the most clinically relevant active comparisons and restricted reporting to these comparisons here. Moderate-quality evidence from one trial (57 participants) indicated allopurinol 300 mg daily probably does not reduce the rate of gout attacks (2/26 with allopurinol versus 3/25 with placebo; risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 3.52) but increases the proportion of participants achieving a target serum urate over 30 days (25/26 with allopurinol versus 0/25 with placebo, RR 49.11, 95% CI 3.15 to 765.58; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 1). In two studies (453 participants), there was no significant increase in withdrawals due to AE (6% with allopurinol versus 4% with placebo, RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.61 to 3.08) or SAE (2% with allopurinol versus 1% with placebo, RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.48 to 7.80). One trial reported no difference in pain reduction or tophus regression, but did not report outcome data or measures of variance sufficiently and we could not calculate the differences between groups. Neither trial reported function. Low-quality evidence from three trials (1136 participants) indicated there may be no difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks with allopurinol up to 300 mg daily versus febuxostat 80 mg daily over eight to 24 weeks (21% with allopurinol versus 23% with febuxostat, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.1); however more participants may achieve target serum urate level (four trials; 2618 participants) with febuxostat 80 mg daily versus allopurinol 300 mg daily (38% with allopurinol versus 70% with febuxostat, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.65, NNTB with febuxostat 4). Two trials reported no difference in tophus regression between allopurinol and febuxostat over a 28- to 52-week period; but as the trialists did not provide variance, we could not calculate the mean difference between groups. The trials did not report pain reduction or function. Moderate-quality evidence from pooled data from three trials (2555 participants) comparing allopurinol up to 300 mg daily versus febuxostat 80 mg daily indicated no difference in the number of withdrawals due to AE (7% with allopurinol versus 8% with febuxostat, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.26) or SAE (4% with allopurinol versus 4% with febuxostat, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.82) over a 24- to 52-week period. Low-quality evidence from one trial (65 participants) indicated there may be no difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks with allopurinol up to 600 mg daily compared with benzbromarone up to 200 mg daily over a four-month period (0/30 with allopurinol versus 1/25 with benzbromarone, RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.58). Based on the pooled results of two trials (102 participants), there was moderate-quality evidence of no probable difference in the proportion of participants achieving a target serum urate level with allopurinol versus benzbromarone (58% with allopurinol versus 74% with benzbromarone, RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.11). Low-quality evidence from two studies indicated there may be no difference in the number of participants who withdrew due to AE with allopurinol versus benzbromarone over a four- to nine-month period (6% with allopurinol versus 7% with benzbromarone, pooled RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.58). There were no SAEs. They did not report tophi regression, pain and function. All other comparisons were supported by small, single studies only, limiting conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review found low- to moderate-quality evidence indicating similar effects on withdrawals due to AEs and SAEs and incidence of acute gout attacks when allopurinol (100 to 600 mg daily) was compared with placebo, benzbromarone (100 to 200 mg daily) or febuxostat (80 mg daily). There was moderate-quality evidence of little or no difference in the proportion of participants achieving target serum urate when allopurinol was compared with benzbromarone. However, allopurinol seemed more successful than placebo and may be less successful than febuxostat (80 mg daily) in achieving a target serum urate level (6 mg/dL or less; 0.36 mmol/L or less) based on moderate- to low-quality evidence. Single studies reported no difference in pain reduction when allopurinol (300 mg daily) was compared with placebo over 10 days, and no difference in tophus regression when allopurinol (200 to 300 mg daily) was compared with febuxostat (80 mg daily). None of the trials reported on function, health-related quality of life or participant global assessment of treatment success, where further research would be useful.

2.1 Recommended Testing Prior to Treatment Initiation

Prior to initiating treatment with allopurinol tablets in patients with gout, assess the following baseline tests: serum uric acid level, complete blood count, chemistry panel, liver function tests (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin), kidney function tests (serum creatinine and eGFR).

2.2 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares

Gout flares may occur after initiation of allopurinol tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with colchicine or an anti- inflammatory agent according to practice guidelines is recommended upon initiation of allopurinol tablets. While adjusting the dosage of allopurinol tablets in patients who are being treated with colchicine and/or anti-inflammatory agents, continue flare prophylaxis drugs until serum uric acid has been normalized and the patient has been free of gout flares for several months. If a gout flare occurs during allopurinol tablets treatment, allopurinol tablets need not be discontinued. Manage the gout flare concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### EULAR evidence based recommendations for gout. part II: management. report of a task force of the EULAR standing committee for international clinical studies including therapeutics (ESCISIT) [^111yGxST]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence based recommendations for the management of gout.

Methods

The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorised according to the level of evidence. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales.

Results

12 key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. Propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (weight loss if obese; reduced alcohol consumption; low animal purine diet) and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasised. Recommended drugs for acute attacks were oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.50)), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long term ULT (ES = 1.39 (0.78 to 2.01)). If allopurinol toxicity occurs, options include other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol desensitisation, or a uricosuric. The uricosuric benzbromarone is more effective than allopurinol (ES = 1.50 (0.76 to 2.24)) and can be used in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency but may be hepatotoxic. When gout is associated with the use of diuretics, the diuretic should be stopped if possible. For prophylaxis against acute attacks, either colchicine 0.5–1 mg daily or an NSAID (with gastroprotection if indicated) are recommended.

Conclusions

12 key recommendations for management of gout were developed, using a combination of research based evidence and expert consensus. The evidence was evaluated and the SOR provided for each proposition.

### Colchicine: the good, the bad, the ugly and how to minimize the risks [^117PsGAs]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical uses of colchicine and dosing

The indications and dosing of colchicine, both established and emerging, are outlined in Table 1. Lower doses are recommended for those with renal impairment and those receiving medications known to interact with colchicine (Table 2).

Table 1.
Established and emerging indications and doses of colchicine

Table 2.
Recommended dosing adjustment for colchicine

There is ample data that colchicine is effective in the management of gout. Colchicine is effective at preventing gout flares when commencing urate-lowering therapy as well as for the treatment of gout flares. It is essential to recognize that the older dosing regimen for treating gout flares, namely 1.2 mg stat followed by 0.6 mg hourly until the flare resolves or diarrhoea occurs, is no longer recommended due to the high rates of gastrointestinal toxicity and the evidence that lower doses of colchicine are effective without the associated gastrointestinal effects. In rheumatology practice, colchicine is also widely used in the treatment of CPP deposition disease, particularly to prevent and treat acute CPP crystal arthritis, as well as in the treatment of Behçet's syndrome, FMF and other systemic autoinflammatory syndromes. While colchicine has been used for some time in acute and recurrent pericarditis, more recently its beneficial effects have been observed in other cardiovascular diseases, including postoperative atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. The evidence for its use in cardiovascular disease has recently been reviewed by Deftereos et al.

The adverse effects of low-dose colchicine are also well known. The most common adverse effect is diarrhoea, which settles on cessation of colchicine. Small increases in alanine transaminase and creatine kinase are common with colchicine treatment over 2–4 years. Long-term colchicine therapy has also been associated with rare cases of neuromyotoxicity and rhabdomyolysis. There is no evidence that long-term colchicine increases the risk of kidney disease, cancer, sepsis or cytopaenias.

### Failure to reach uric acid target of… [^112RGmYL]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Variability in the number of sUA determinations during the first year, as well as their timing before or after 12 months after up-titrating treatment could have some effect on mortality. In order to avoid this limitation, all patients in the cohort had a minimum of three urate (UA) levels during the first year (3, 6 and 12 months). Besides, in the majority of patients, follow-up sUA levels were obtained after ULT had worked (84% had a follow-up time longer than 12 months).

The impact of ULT on CV events is controversial, with studies showing allopurinol treatment is associated with a reduction in the risk of myocardial infarctionand outweighing the impact of rare serious adverse effects, and other studies showing no impact on CV mortality. In our study. we confirm the beneficial impact of allopurinol and benzbromarone in reducing overall mortality, as each of these was associated with improved survival. This positive benefit also extended to lower rates of CV death, although the level of significance was less likely related to the smaller event rate. No safety signal was observed for first-line treatment with either allopurinol, febuxostat or benzbromarone, as multivariate analysis included confounding variables for CV risk factors, comorbidity and severity of gout. No benefit was observed for colchicine prophylaxis, but the number of patients was small and clinically heterogeneous (patients not willing to take any more colchicine, with formal contraindication, and some exposed to anakinra as off-label prophylaxis). Therefore, we are cautious with this negative result.

### Prognostic factors for colchicine prophylaxis-related adverse events when initiating allopurinol for gout: retrospective cohort study [^115BYxw7]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is caused by high serum urate levels leading to the formation of MSU crystals in and around joints. It is the most prevalent inflammatory arthritis and affects 2.5% of adults in the UK and 3.9% in the USA. Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of excruciating joint pain and inflammation, and is associated with substantial comorbidity and impaired health-related quality of life. Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for gout leads to gradual dissolution of MSU crystals and cessation of flares over several months. However, initiating or escalating the dose of ULT often precipitates a gout flare, which may lead patients or practitioners to stop ULT, as they believe that it has exacerbated the gout. Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis to prevent such flares, most commonly with colchicine, is therefore recommended for several months when initiating ULT.

Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are common side-effects of colchicine, but rarely, it can cause more serious side-effects such as myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, neuropathy or bone marrow suppression. We recently reported a cohort study which determined the risk of adverse events severe enough to warrant seeking healthcare associated with colchicine prophylaxis when initiating allopurinol in patients with gout in UK primary care. We found that adverse events affected 1 in 15 people taking colchicine. However, serious adverse events were rare.

The risk of side-effects due to colchicine prophylaxis is thought to be influenced by patient characteristics. For example, the risk of serious events including neuromyopathy, rhabdomyolysis and bone marrow suppression is higher in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which affects one in four people with gout, and in people taking certain medications. Through its metabolism by CYP3A4, colchicine toxicity is theoretically increased by concomitant treatment with common drugs such as statins, fibrates, macrolide antibiotics, rate-limiting calcium-channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem), digoxin, amiodarone and antifungals, as well as protease inhibitors and ciclosporin. Although colchicine is contraindicated in patients taking these medications, in our clinical experience from primary and secondary care, their co-prescription still commonly occurs. However, evidence that these factors are prognostic for adverse events is largely anecdotal or theoretical, and large research studies are lacking.

In this study, we aimed to assess to what degree co-prescriptions and other potential prognostic factors for adverse events, including age, gender, BMI, CKD and multimorbidity, affect the risk of adverse events when commencing colchicine prophylaxis for ULT in people with gout.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^112kpWS7]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology gout flare management — For patients experiencing a gout flare, the guideline states "we strongly recommend using oral colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intramuscular, or intraarticular) as appropriate first-line therapy for gout flares over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH", and "when colchicine is the chosen agent, we strongly recommend low-dose colchicine over high-dose colchicine given its similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects". For patients who are unable to take oral medications, "we strongly recommend glucocorticoids (intramuscular, intravenous, or intraarticular) over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH". If other antiinflammatory therapies are poorly tolerated or contraindicated, "we conditionally recommend using IL-1 inhibition over no therapy (beyond supportive/analgesic treatment)". As adjunctive care for a flare, "we conditionally recommend using topical ice as an adjuvant treatment over no adjuvant treatment". For colchicine dosing during flares, the guideline notes "the FDA-approved dosing should be followed (1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an hour later, with ongoing antiinflammatory therapy until the flare resolves)".

### Evolution of management of gout: a comparison of recent guidelines [^114JoBPf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There have been several guidelines on the management of gout over the last decade; however, inconsistencies between them create confusion for practitioners. This review highlights areas of agreement between guidelines and discusses data where disagreements exist.

Recent Findings

For acute gout, the guidelines agree that anti-inflammatory treatment should start as soon as possible, preferably within 24hours. Older guidelines preferred NSAIDs or colchicine over steroids, but newer ones leave the choice of agent to the physician. For colchicine, all guidelines recommend using low dose. Intra-articular, oral or intramuscular steroids are all described as effective. For management of hyperuricemia, indications for initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) have become more inclusive over the years by requiring lower burden of disease severity or including patient comorbidities. Probenecid has fallen out of favour with most guidelines favouring allopurinol over febuxostat. Although there is a disagreement about timing of initiation for ULT, guidelines recommend treating to target of serum urate (sUA) less than 6mg/dl, and less than 5mg/dl for patients with more severe disease. Concurrent anti-inflammatory prophylaxis has gained strong support over the years.

Summary

Most guidelines are in agreement with recommendations for management of gout and most changes have been directional and evolutionary.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of antihyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout.

14.1	Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout

The efficacy of ULORIC was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level ≥ 8 mg/dL.

Study 1 (NCT00430248) randomized patients to: ULORIC 40 mg daily, ULORIC 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Clcr) ≥ 60 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Clcr ≥ 30 mL/min and ≤ 59 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months.

Study 2 (NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, ULORIC 80 mg daily, ULORIC 120 mg daily, ULORIC 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and ≤ 2 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months.

Study 3 (NCT00102440), a year study, randomized patients to: ULORIC 80 mg daily, ULORIC 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with ULORIC for over three years.

In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks.

The efficacy of ULORIC was also evaluated in a 4-week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, ULORIC 40 mg daily, ULORIC 80 mg daily, or ULORIC 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with ULORIC for up to five years.

Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which ULORIC use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies.

Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Study quality was assessed by 2 independent reviewers. Strength-of-evidence assessment was done by group discussion.

Data Synthesis

High-strength evidence from 28 trials (only 3 of which were placebo-controlled) shows that colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids reduce pain in patients with acute gout. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that low-dose colchicine is as effective as high-dose colchicine and causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol or febuxostat) reduces long-term risk for acute gout attacks after 1 year or more. High-strength evidence shows that prophylaxis with daily colchicine or NSAIDs reduces the risk for acute gout attacks by at least half in patients starting urate-lowering therapy, and moderate-strength evidence indicates that duration of prophylaxis should be longer than 8 weeks. Although lower urate levels reduce risk for recurrent acute attacks, treatment to a specific target level has not been tested.

Limitation

Few studies of acute gout treatments, no placebo-controlled trials of management of hyperuricemia lasting longer than 6 months, and few studies in primary care populations.

Conclusion

Colchicine, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout. Urate-lowering therapy decreases serum urate levels and reduces risk for acute gout attacks.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116D1smR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant prophylaxis, in patients with recurrent gout attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Colchicine for acute gout [^1135R2x9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases from inception to April 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search. We also handsearched conference proceedings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League against Rheumatism (2010 until 2013) and reference lists of identified studies. We searched the clinical trials register clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials register.

Selection Criteria

We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (active or placebo) in acute gout. The primary benefit outcome of interest was pain, defined as a proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain, and the primary harm outcome was study participants withdrawal due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened search results for relevant studies, extracted data into a standardised form and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We pooled data if deemed to be sufficiently clinically homogeneous. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Two RCTs (124 participants) were included in this updated review, including one new RCT. We considered one trial to be at low risk of bias, while we considered the newly included trial to be at unclear risk of bias. Both trials included a placebo and a high-dose colchicine arm, although the colchicine regimens varied. In one trial 0.5 mg colchicine was given every two hours until there was either complete relief of symptoms or toxicity and the total doses were not specified. In the other trial a total of 4.8 mg colchicine was given over six hours. The newly identified trial also included a low-dose colchicine arm (total 1.8 mg over one hour). Based upon pooled data from two trials (124 participants), there is low-quality evidence that a greater proportion of people receiving high-dose colchicine experience a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours compared with placebo (35/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 12/50 in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 3.65), with a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 12). However, the total number of adverse events (diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea) is greater in those who receive high-dose colchicine versus placebo (62/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 11/50 in the placebo group (RR 3.81, 95% CI 2.28 to 6.38), with a number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) of 2 (95% CI 2 to 5). Only one trial included reduction of inflammation as part of a composite measure comprising pain, tenderness, swelling and erythema, each graded on a four-point scale (none 0 to severe 3) to derive a maximum score for any one joint of 12. They reported the proportion of people who achieved a 50% reduction in this composite score. Based upon one trial (43 participants), there was low-quality evidence that more people in the high-dose colchicine group had a 50% or greater decrease in composite score from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours than people in the placebo group (11/22 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 1/21 in the placebo group (RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38) and 45% absolute difference). Based upon data from one trial (103 participants), there was low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is more efficacious than placebo with respect to the proportion of people who achieve a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline to 32 to 36 hours (low-dose colchicine 31/74 versus placebo 5/29 (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.64)), with a NNTB of 5 (95% CI 2 to 20). There are no additional harms in terms of adverse events (diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting) with low-dose colchicine compared to placebo (19/74 and 6/29 respectively (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.79)). Based upon data from one trial (126 participants), there is low-quality evidence that there are no additional benefits in terms of the proportion of people achieving 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours with high-dose colchicine compared to low-dose (19/52 and 31/74 respectively (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36). However, there were statistically significantly more adverse events in those who received high-dose colchicine (40/52 versus 19/74 in the low-dose group (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.98 to 4.54)), with a NNTH of 2 (95% CI 2 to 3). No trials reported function of the target joint, patient-reported global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life or withdrawals due to adverse events. We identified no studies comparing colchicine to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other active treatments such as glucocorticoids (by any route).

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon only two published trials, there is low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is likely to be an effective treatment for acute gout. We downgraded the evidence because of a possible risk of selection and reporting biases and imprecision. Both high and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo. While there is some uncertainty around the effect estimates, compared with placebo, high-dose but not low-dose colchicine appears to result in a statistically significantly greater number of adverse events. Therefore low-dose colchicine may be the preferred treatment option. There are no trials about the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as NSAIDs and glucocorticoids.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^112Jj7YF]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Baseline characteristics of participants included in this analysis

Peak and trough colchicine concentrations were available for 79 participants in the colchicine arm. Demographics of the 79 participants at month three are outlined in Supplementary Table 1. The median time between the dose of colchicine and peak samples was 30 (interquartile range 30–70) minutes.

Relationship between colchicine concentrations and participant variables

As expected, mean trough colchicine concentrations were lower than mean peak concentrations (0.30 ng/mL vs 0.61 ng/mL; P < 0.001). Trough colchicine concentrations were significantly higher in participants who were > 60 years of age, were of non‐Māori or non‐Pacific ethnicity, had eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, had a body mass index of < 30, and were taking a statin (Table 1). Peak colchicine concentrations were also significantly higher in those > 60 years of age and those taking a statin (Table 1).

Table 1
Relationship between mean trough and peak colchicine concentrations and clinical and demographic factors *

Multivariable analysis showed that those taking a statin (0.39 ng/mL vs 0.22 ng/mL, GMR 1.76, 95% CI 1.30–2.40) and those of non‐Māori or non‐Pacific ethnicity (0.39 ng/mL vs 0.26 ng/mL, GMR 1.54, 95% CI 1.15–2.05) were independently associated with higher trough colchicine concentrations. Only age > 60 years (0.77 ng/mL vs 0.51 ng/mL, GMR 1.51, 95% CI 1.10–2.07) was independently associated with higher peak colchicine concentrations.

Relationship between colchicine concentrations, gout flares, and gout disease activity states

There was no significant difference in mean trough or peak colchicine concentrations at month three between the three gout flare states in months one to six (Table 2). Likewise, there was no association between colchicine concentrations at month three and experience of at least one gout flare between months zero and three or months four and six (Table 2). There was no association between colchicine concentration at month three and experience of at least one gout flare between months seven and nine, the period immediately after colchicine had been stopped (Table 2).

### Cost-effectiveness of colchicine prophylaxis for gout flares when commencing allopurinol [^112QBRm8]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Colchicine prophylaxis to prevent gout flares when commencing urate-lowering therapy is recommended by international rheumatology society guidelines. Whether this is a cost-effective intervention is currently unknown. Our objective was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis using both a US cost input model and an Australian cost input model.

Methods

This cost-effectiveness analysis was completed from the point of view of the third-party payer. We used a 2-arm decision tree with 1 arm commencing allopurinol with no colchicine prophylaxis and the other with colchicine prophylaxis. Model inputs were drawn from published literature where available. We completed a univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to confirm the robust nature of the modeling. The time frame for the model was 6 months.

Results

The colchicine prophylaxis arm resulted in a cost of $1,276 and 0.49 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), while in the placebo arm the cost was $516 and 0.47 QALYs, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $34,004 per QALY gained. In Australia, where cost of colchicine was much lower, the colchicine arm dominated the placebo ($208 [Australian] in the colchicine arm versus $415 [Australian] in the placebo). Univariate and probability sensitivity analysis demonstrated that results were robust to changes in input parameters. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability of colchicine prophylaxis being the most cost-effective option was 93% in the US and 100% in the Australian setting.

Conclusion

Colchicine prophylaxis to prevent gout flares while commencing allopurinol in gout is very cost-effective.

### Gout [^111HAoku]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout affects about 5% of men and 1% of women, with up to 80% of people experiencing a recurrent attack within 3 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for acute gout? What are the effects of xanthine oxidase inhibitors to prevent gout in people with prior acute episodes? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 21 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: colchicine, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and xanthine oxidase inhibitors.

### Prophylaxis for acute gout flares after initiation of urate-lowering therapy [^113UXfU7]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

This review summarizes evidence relating to prophylaxis for gout flares after the initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT). We searched MEDLINE via PubMed for articles published in English from 1963 to 2013 using MEsH terms covering all aspects of prophylaxis for flares. Dispersion of monosodium urate crystals during the initial phase of deposit dissolution with ULT exposes the patient to an increased rate of acute flares that could contribute to poor treatment adherence. Slow titration of ULT might decrease the risk of flares. According to the most recent international recommendation, the two first-line options for prophylaxis are low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg once or twice a day) or low-dose NSAIDs such as naproxen 250 mg orally twice a day. They can be given for up to 6 months. If these drugs are contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) might be used. Recently, reports for four trials described the efficacy of canakinumab and rilonacept, two IL-1 inhibitors, for preventing flares during the initiation of allopurinol therapy. Prophylaxis for flares induced by ULT is an important consideration in gout management. Low-dose colchicine and low-dose NSAIDs are the recommended first-line therapies. Although no IL-1 blockers are approved as prophylactic treatment, this class of drug could become an interesting option for patients with gout with intolerance or contraindication to colchicine, NSAIDs or corticosteroids.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^114XNW5a]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

### Spontaneous resolution of acute gout: mechanisms and therapeutic targets [^113GNHQD]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

At present, the number of patients with refractory gout is continuing to increase, and the question of how to control acute attacks in patients with refractory gout is a clinical problem that requires urgent resolution. Treatment of acute gout inflammation mainly relies on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine and glucocorticoids; however, refractory gout is a persistence of clinical manifestations characterised by the inability to reduce the serum urate acid concentration below the target 6.0 mg/dL, increased MSU deposition and tophi formation, and chronic inflammatory arthritis, ongoing symptoms of recurrent flares. Patients with refractory gout often do not respond well to these drugs or have contraindications. Targeted therapy, including biologics and targeted synthetic small molecule drugs, has been widely used in other inflammatory arthritis diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, with promising results. We hope that patients with refractory gout can receive similar targeted therapies to patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. We have discovered many potential therapeutic targets by elucidating the pathogenesis and self-remission mechanisms of gout (figure 1). Fortunately, some drugs have either received approval or are currently in clinical trials. We believe that targeted therapy for gout is coming soon, providing welcome relief for patients with refractory gout.

### Probenecid [^112zQSmh]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Gout:

Therapy with probenecid should not be started until an acute gouty attack has subsided. However, if an acute attack is precipitated during therapy, probenecid may be continued without changing the dosage, and full therapeutic dosage of colchicine, or other appropriate therapy, should be given to control the acute attack.

The recommended adult dosage is 250 mg (½ probenecid tablet), twice a day for one week, followed by 500 mg (1 tablet) twice a day thereafter.

Some degree of renal impairment may be present in patients with gout. A daily dosage of 1000 mg may be adequate. However, if necessary, the daily dosage may be increased by 500 mg increments every 4 weeks within tolerance (and usually not above 2000 mg per day) if symptoms of gouty arthritis are not controlled or the 24 hour uric acid excretion is not above 700 mg. As noted, probenecid may not be effective in chronic renal insufficiency particularly when the glomerular filtration rate is 30 mg mL/minute or less.

Gastric intolerance may be indicative of over dosage, and may be corrected by decreasing the dosage.

As uric acid tends to crystallize out of an acid urine, a liberal fluid intake is recommended, as well as sufficient sodium bicarbonate (3 to 7.5 g daily), or potassium citrate (7.5 g daily) to maintain an alkaline urine (see PRECAUTIONS).

### Allopurinol [^116EJ8Fu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Administration

Advise patients to take allopurinol tablets after meals to minimize gastric irritation. If a single dose of allopurinol tablets is occasionally forgotten, there is no need to double the dose at the next scheduled time.

Skin Rash and Hypersensitivity

Inform patients that allopurinol tablets may increase the risk of serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions. Instruct patients to discontinue allopurinol tablets and to seek medical attention immediately, at the first sign of a skin rash, blisters, fever, painful urination, blood in the urine, irritation of the eyes, swelling of the lips or mouth, or other signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Gout Flares During Treatment With Allopurinol Tablets

Inform patients that gout flares may occur during initiation of treatment with allopurinol tablets, even when their serum uric acid is normal. Concurrent use of additional medications such as colchicine or other anti-inflammatory agents can prevent gout flares. Advise patients to continue treatment with both, allopurinol tablets and the prophylactic therapy as prescribed, even if gout flares occur. Reassure them that it may take months to achieve control of the flares but the flares typically become shorter and less severe after several months of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Relationship between gout flare States and patient-reported outcomes after allopurinol initiation [^116F5Bu9]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

It is important to note that the study population was 93% male. Although this reflects a typical gout trial population, women often experience higher disease severity, have more negative illness perceptions, and experience higher impact on daily activities. Although the number of women in our study were too small to enable analysis by gender, we would expect the observed effects to be even more pronounced in women.

These data contribute to our understanding of the impact and burden of gout flares in people with gout, highlighting their concern about this core clinical manifestation of the disease. In the long term, excellent serum urate control is important. However, it is also essential that health care professionals support people with gout to prevent and manage flares as a core part of gout management.

Strengths of this study include the standardized study protocols, prospective gout flare event ascertainment, and use of outcomes of relevance to patients. Limitations include some loss to follow‐up, albeit minimal; the use of subjective assessments; and the short study design, which did not allow for assessment beyond one year. It is well recognized that gout flares can paradoxically increase after starting ULT. Given this peak in flares after starting ULT, it is not surprising that LDA and PASS are hard to achieve in the first six months of starting ULT even with anti‐inflammatory prophylaxis with colchicine. Over time, there is a gradual reduction in gout flares such that, by the second year of ULT, if target serum urate is achieved, flares may cease altogether or occur less frequently. Thus, it is likely that longer trials beyond 12 months are required to see the full effect of ULT on achievement of the disease activity states. Finally, we did not asked participants in the study whether they considered that their flare frequency aligned with the ascribed disease state.

The majority of people (57%) were able to achieve PASS or LDA in the second six months after commencing ULT. As the flare burden increases, so does the impact of gout on the patient. These findings highlight the importance of flare prevention in the management of gout.

### Cost-effectiveness of low dose colchicine prophylaxis when starting allopurinol using the "start-low go-slow" approach for gout: evidence from a non-inferiority randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^112e6DBP]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of low-dose colchicine prophylaxis for preventing gout flares when starting allopurinol using the "start-low go-slow" approach.

Methods

Participants with gout, fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology recommendations for starting urate-lowering therapy and with serum urate ≥ 0.36 mmol/L (6mg/dL), were randomly allocated (1:1) to either colchicine (0.5 mg daily) or placebo for six months with a further six-month follow-up. All participants received allopurinol, with monthly increase in dose to achieve target urate < 0.36 mmol/L. The primary outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness at 6-month and 1-year follow-up from the health system perspective, measured by incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) at a willingness-to-pay threshold equivalent to gross domestic product per capita.

Results

Two hundred participants were randomized to either colchicine (n = 100) or placebo (n = 100). Mean costs were higher in the colchicine group over both 6 months and 1 year (adjusted mean difference $1848 [95%CI -321 to 4017] and $2282 [95%CI -173 to 4737], respectively). Quality-adjusted life years were slightly higher in the colchicine group over 6 months (adjusted mean difference 0.008 [95%CI -0.020 to 0.035]), but lower over 1 year (-0.015, [95%CI -0.039 to 0.010]). Treatment with colchicine was not found to be cost-effective at either 6-months or 12-months (INMB -$1373 (95%CI -4287 to 1542) and -$3191 (95%CI -6274 to -107), probability of cost-effectiveness 17.7% and 1.5%, respectively). Similar results were obtained from a societal perspective.

Conclusion

Six months of low-dose colchicine prophylaxis when starting allopurinol using the "start-low go-slow" approach is unlikely to be cost-effective over 12 months.

### Non-adherence to urate lowering therapy in gout after 5 years is related to poor outcomes: results from the NOR-gout study [^111sYYzy]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

This study reports on patients completing a 5-year follow-up examination in the prospective observational NOR-Gout (Gout in Norway), which was performed in a hospital-based rheumatology clinic to study long-term gout outcomes. All included patients had crystal proven gout and fulfilled the ACR/EULAR classification criteria for gout. They had been recruited after a recent clinical gout flare at the rheumatology outpatient clinic and were, after indicating willingness to participate, pre-screened and consented to inclusion. They were required to have an increased sUA level > 360 μmol/l at inclusion. In NOR-Gout they started ULT with allopurinol or febuxostat if intolerance to allopurinol with frequent follow-up visits during the first year, met after 2 years and had a final visit at 5 years. During the treat-to-target strategy during year 1, ULT was escalated during monthly visits to achieve sUA < 360 μmol/l (or < 300 μmol/l if clinical tophi were present) as internationally recommended. The starting dose of allopurinol was 100 mg daily, and 40 mg daily for febuxostat. In all patients starting ULT a prophylaxis of 0.5–1 mg with colchicine was prescribed for 3–6 months. The study (ACTRN12618001372279) was registered at. The Norwegian Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics South East (reference number 2015/990) approved the study, patient representatives were included in the study planning and participants had given their written informed consent.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^113UohHc]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths of this study include analysis of a randomized clinical trial with consistent measurement of adverse events and blood tests, together with comprehensive concomitant medication data collection. Limitations are that the study was not powered to detect rare adverse events due to colchicine and that the study design did not allow analysis of the safety of higher doses of colchicine or longer durations. The study was not designed as a formal pharmacokinetics study. It is important to note that there is substantial variation in colchicine bioavailability in healthy individuals, with additional variation possible in people with gout, because of polypharmacy and genetic variants in transporters, among other factors. In addition, there is widespread distribution of colchicine into cells and tissues, where its anti‐inflammatory effects are exerted, compared to the much lower levels observed in plasma. The inability to assess drug concentration in tissues where colchicine exerts its anti‐inflammatory effects, such as leucocytes, as well as calculate the volume of distribution is a limitation. The samples collected did not allow us to accurately calculate volume of distribution or area under the curve, and there is wide variation in these parameters, as shown in a small study in healthy volunteers in which total body colchicine clearance was approximately doubled and the area under the curve was approximately four times less for healthy individuals compared with older individuals. Finally, the sampling may have missed the true peak concentrations in some individuals.

In conclusion, colchicine concentrations are not associated with gout flare prophylaxis efficacy, and there is no consistent relationship between colchicine concentrations and colchicine‐specific adverse events. Although colchicine concentrations increase with concomitant statin use, this does not result in muscle‐related adverse events. These findings indicate that colchicine TDM is of limited value in routine clinical practice.

### Predicting gout flares in people starting allopurinol using the start-low Go-slow dose escalation strategy [^117MbXfE]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The study objective was to determine predictors of gout flare when commencing allopurinol using the "start-low go-slow" dose escalation strategy.

Methods

A post hoc analysis of a 12-month double-blind placebo-controlled noninferiority trial with participants randomized 1:1 to colchicine 0.5 mg daily or placebo for the first six months was undertaken. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify independent predictors of gout flares in the first and last six months of the trial.

Results

Multivariable analysis revealed a significant association between risk of a gout flare in the first six months and flare in the month before starting allopurinol (odds ratio [OR] 2.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36–5.17) and allopurinol 100 mg starting dose (OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.41–7.27). The predictors of any gout flares in the last six months of the trial, after stopping colchicine or placebo, were having received colchicine (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.48–5.86), at least one flare in the month before stopping study drug (OR 5.39, 95% CI 2.21–13.15), and serum urate ≥ 0.36 mmol/L at month 6 (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.14–7.12).

Conclusion

Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis when starting allopurinol using the "start-low go-slow" dose escalation strategy may be best targeted at those who have had a gout flare in the month before starting allopurinol and are commencing allopurinol 100 mg daily. For those with ongoing gout flares during the first six months of starting allopurinol who have not yet achieved serum urate target, a longer period of prophylaxis may be required.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^113WdF9o]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology 2020 gout guideline — urate-lowering therapy (ULT) titration, monitoring, and flare prophylaxis — states that ULT titration should occur over weeks to months and cites prior guidance to titrate every 2–5 weeks, with serum urate (SU) checked after each dose titration; to limit ULT-related flares, it reinforces using concurrent antiinflammatory prophylaxis for 3–6 months' duration, which should be extended in the setting of frequent ongoing flares.
