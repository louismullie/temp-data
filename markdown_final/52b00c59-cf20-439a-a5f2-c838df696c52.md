## Question

Which defense mechanisms are commonly observed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which defense mechanisms are commonly observed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining and verifying the hierarchical framework used across sources. Then, I should verify large-sample prevalence estimates and what they imply clinically. Next, I will examine cross-diagnostic patterns and treatment-associated change. After that, I'll extract specific, frequently cited mechanisms and check transdiagnostic links, noting any initial errors and correcting them explicitly. Finally, I'll consider clinical implications for assessment and intervention and state key limitations to avoid over-interpretation, which aligns with the hierarchical and transdiagnostic framing described in multiple sources.

> Let me first confirm the conceptual scaffold, because if I misstate the hierarchy the downstream inferences will wobble. The documents consistently deploy a four-level hierarchy of defenses: mature, neurotic, immature, and pathological, with mature defenses reflecting healthier adaptation and pathological defenses reflecting the least adaptive end of the spectrum, and this is used both in observational and interventional studies of psychopathology and psychotherapy outcomes [^116N8ADH] [^114brV1F] [^111GL7iP].

> Wait, let me verify prevalence with the largest available dataset before drawing transdiagnostic conclusions. The national epidemiologic study of 43,093 adults shows markedly higher prevalence of any pathological defense among those with mood, anxiety, or substance use disorders compared with those without psychiatric disorders, with point estimates around 67.6 percent in mood, 62.8 percent in anxiety, 49.8 percent in substance use, versus 30.0 percent in those with no disorder, indicating that pathological defenses are common and scale with clinical burden at the population level [^113g5amF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about disorder-specific signatures. The meta-analysis in depressive disorders shows significantly greater use of non-mature (neurotic/immature) defenses versus controls, and psychotherapy trials demonstrate that overall defensive functioning and adaptive defenses can improve with treatment, yet the national study finds no disorder-unique defense profiles, supporting a transdiagnostic rather than diagnosis-specific pattern of defensive functioning; depressed patients may start with lower adaptive defenses but can show pronounced gains over therapy, reinforcing the clinical malleability of defensive functioning [^114brV1F] [^111GL7iP] [^113g5amF].

> I need to check which specific mechanisms recur across disorders, and whether they plausibly link to core maintenance processes. Avoidance and suppression repeatedly emerge as ubiquitous, appearing in psychosis cohorts and correlating with paranoid symptoms, prospectively linking to PTSD symptom maintenance via avoidant coping including social withdrawal, and predicting heightened panic responses in biological challenge paradigms; mechanistically, this dovetails with fear-conditioning models in which overgeneralization, impaired extinction, and excessive avoidance amplify anxiety and chronicity [^112uegLG] [^114HGf68] [^1113B5U2] [^116786Rw].

> Let me consider aggression-linked defenses next and verify age effects. Acting out appears elevated in intermittent explosive disorder and tends to be higher in younger adults, consistent with greater impulsive-reactive patterns; this aligns with neurobiologic frameworks for reactive aggression emphasizing threat reactivity and reduced top-down control, which clinically tracks with immature defenses that externalize affect under provocative stress [^115eaQaS] [^112y7wXs] [^112oi2H4].

> I should confirm associations with somatic symptom presentations because displacement and somatization were flagged. In a large community sample, displacement, somatisation, and passive aggression clustered with higher somatic symptom severity, with displacement moderating the link between dysphoric temperament and bodily symptom burden, suggesting that certain immature defenses may channel distress into somatic focus and expression, especially under dysphoric affective temperaments [^113TKrxX].

> Next, I will examine developmental patterns, but wait, I should verify that regression is indeed more common in younger adults. Cross-sectional data indicate younger adults endorse more acting out, passive-aggression, and regression compared with older adults, while adaptive defenses remain relatively stable, implying that age-related maturation may attenuate specific immature defenses even as mature defenses persist across the lifespan [^112y7wXs].

> Now, about reaction formation, I see an incomplete statement in the trace: "Reaction Formation (3 documents): Specifically decreased in". Hmm, wait a minute, that's truncated; let me correct it by going back to the longitudinal OCD cohort and related clinical observations. In a four-year OCD follow-up, there was a significant decrease in the use of reaction formation over time, especially alongside symptom improvement, and qualitative work in medically stressed adolescents also identified reaction formation as a salient, contextually deployed defense, indicating it may decrease with effective treatment yet emerge situationally under stress loads [^1161pdcJ] [^1149raSv].

> Hold on, I should verify whether neurotic and immature defenses are empirically separable in these datasets, because some analyses pool them. The depression meta-analysis aggregated neurotic and immature defenses into a non-mature category showing medium-to-large elevation versus controls, and the national study emphasized that defense patterns index overall psychopathology severity rather than disorder-specific profiles; complementary work on coping emphasizes that maladaptive strategies correlate more strongly with symptom severity than deficits in adaptive strategies, a pattern that conceptually overlaps with the non-mature defense burden seen across diagnoses [^114brV1F] [^113g5amF] [^112a92Jr].

> I should double-check the clinical implications so I do not overgeneralize beyond the data. Targeting avoidance directly through exposure-based treatments is guideline-recommended and mechanistically aligned with reducing avoidant defenses in PTSD, while psychotherapy can increase adaptive defenses and overall defensive functioning across anxiety and depression; in practice, conceptualizing defenses as transdiagnostic targets supports selecting treatments that downshift avoidance and externalizing defenses and upshift mature strategies such as sublimation and suppression under voluntary control [^115Q2NEG] [^111GL7iP].

> Let me think about limitations and measurement caveats, because I need to ensure the conclusions are proportionate to the evidence. Many studies rely on self-report measures like DSQ with cross-sectional designs, limiting causal inference and potentially conflating coping and defense constructs, and the largest epidemiologic analysis underscores that defenses map onto general psychopathology burden without unique disorder signatures, which argues for careful, longitudinal, multi-method assessment when linking specific defenses to diagnoses or outcomes [^114brV1F] [^113g5amF] [^112a92Jr].

Common defense mechanisms include **denial, repression, projection, displacement, regression, rationalization, sublimation, suppression, reaction formation, and intellectualization** [^1149raSv]. These unconscious strategies help individuals manage anxiety and stress by distorting or avoiding reality [^114U4VgA]; **mature defenses** like sublimation and suppression are linked to better psychological health, whereas **immature defenses** such as denial and projection are associated with greater distress and psychopathology [^112y7wXs] [^114brV1F] [^116N8ADH].

---

## Classification of defense mechanisms

Defense mechanisms are typically classified into **three categories** by **maturity and adaptiveness** [^114U4VgA] [^112y7wXs]:

| **Category** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Mature defenses | Adaptive and socially acceptable mechanisms that promote healthy functioning | - Sublimation <br/> - Suppression <br/> - Humor <br/> - Altruism |
| Neurotic defenses | Intermediate mechanisms that may cause temporary distress but are generally manageable | - Repression <br/> - Displacement <br/> - Reaction formation <br/> - Intellectualization |
| Immature defenses | Maladaptive mechanisms associated with psychological distress and impaired functioning | - Denial <br/> - Projection <br/> - Regression <br/> - Passive aggression <br/> - Acting out |

---

## Common defense mechanisms

### Denial

Denial involves **refusing to accept reality or facts** to avoid uncomfortable emotions or situations. It is commonly observed in individuals facing traumatic events, chronic illnesses, or addiction. For example, a person diagnosed with a serious illness refuses to acknowledge the diagnosis and avoids seeking treatment [^111gaiHN].

---

### Repression

Repression is the **unconscious blocking of unpleasant emotions, memories, or impulses** from conscious awareness, often associated with traumatic experiences and potentially leading to psychological distress if unresolved. For example, an individual who experienced childhood trauma may have no conscious memory of the event but exhibits anxiety or behavioral issues [^1149raSv].

---

### Projection

Projection involves **attributing one's own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or impulses to others**, allowing individuals to avoid confronting their own undesirable traits. For example, a person who is angry at their colleague accuses the colleague of being hostile toward them [^114U4VgA].

---

### Displacement

Displacement occurs when emotions or impulses are **redirected from their original source to a safer or more acceptable target**. For example, an employee frustrated with their boss vents anger at home toward family members [^113TKrxX].

---

### Regression

Regression involves **reverting to earlier developmental stages or behaviors** when faced with stress or anxiety. For example, an adult experiencing significant stress begins exhibiting childlike behaviors, such as temper tantrums or thumb-sucking [^112y7wXs].

---

### Rationalization

Rationalization involves **creating logical or plausible explanations to justify unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or behaviors**. For example, a student who fails an exam blames the teacher's unfair grading rather than acknowledging their lack of preparation.

---

### Sublimation

Sublimation is **channeling unacceptable impulses or emotions into socially acceptable or constructive activities**. For example, an individual with aggressive tendencies becomes a professional athlete or engages in vigorous physical exercise [^115eaQaS].

---

### Suppression

Suppression is the **conscious effort to delay or avoid dealing with uncomfortable emotions or thoughts**. For example, a person postpones thinking about a stressful situation until they are better prepared to handle it [^112uegLG].

---

### Reaction formation

Reaction formation involves **expressing emotions or behaviors opposite to one's true feelings** to avoid anxiety or guilt. For example, a person who harbors resentment toward someone behaves in an excessively friendly manner toward them [^1161pdcJ].

---

### Intellectualization

Intellectualization involves **using logic and reasoning to avoid emotional involvement or distress**. For example, a person diagnosed with a serious illness focuses solely on medical facts and treatment options, avoiding emotional processing [^111GL7iP].

---

## Psychological and physiological impacts

Defense mechanisms significantly influence **psychological well-being and physiological responses** [^112y7wXs]. Psychologically, **immature defenses** are associated with increased psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and impaired functioning [^114brV1F], whereas **mature defenses** correlate with better psychological health and resilience [^112y7wXs]. Physiologically, defense mechanisms influence **stress responses**, including **HPA axis activity** and **immune function**, potentially affecting overall health.

---

## Influence of individual differences

Individual differences — including **personality traits, attachment styles, and resilience** — significantly shape the selection and effectiveness of defense mechanisms [^1165v13N]:

- **Personality traits**: Individuals with hyperthymic or euthymic temperaments tend to use mature defenses, while those with cyclothymic or depressive temperaments use immature defenses [^111UTBzC].
- **Attachment styles**: Insecure attachment styles are associated with immature defenses and increased psychological distress [^1165v13N].
- **Resilience**: Higher resilience is linked to adaptive coping strategies and reduced psychological distress [^1111kXpz] [^111Y7T72].

---

## Role in mental health disorders

Defense mechanisms play a **critical role** in the development and maintenance of mental health disorders:

- **Anxiety disorders**: Immature defenses such as avoidance and suppression are associated with increased anxiety symptoms.
- **Depressive disorders**: Non-mature defenses are prevalent in depressive individuals and are associated with symptom severity [^114brV1F].
- **Personality disorders**: Immature defenses are common in personality disorders, contributing to maladaptive behaviors and interpersonal difficulties.

---

## Therapeutic interventions

Therapeutic interventions aim to modify **maladaptive defense mechanisms** and promote **adaptive coping strategies** [^114U4VgA]:

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Effective in reducing maladaptive defenses and improving adaptive coping skills.
- **Psychodynamic therapy**: Focuses on increasing awareness of unconscious defenses and promoting mature defenses [^114U4VgA].
- **Mindfulness-based interventions**: Enhance emotional awareness and reduce reliance on avoidance-based defenses.

---

Defense mechanisms are **unconscious psychological strategies** that help individuals cope with stress and anxiety. They are classified into mature, neurotic, and immature categories, each with distinct impacts on psychological and physiological well-being. Both **individual differences** and **therapeutic interventions** significantly influence the selection and modification of these mechanisms.

### The physician's quality of life: Relationship with ego defense mechanisms and object relations [^116N8ADH]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

To assess whether ego defense mechanisms and object relations, defined as the way an individual subjectively experiences their relationships with others, are related to quality of life among physicians, a cross-sectional mail survey was conducted. This survey included 602 physicians from Botucatu, SP, Brazil, who were sent a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Bell Object Relations and Reality Testing Inventory-Form O (BORRTI-O), the Defense Style Questionnaire-40 (DSQ-40), and the World Health Organization Abbreviated Instrument for Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-BREF).

A total of 198 questionnaires (33%) with valid responses were obtained. High BORRTI-O scores, indicative of pathology on the alienation, egocentricity, and insecure attachment subscales, were associated with reduced WHOQOL-BREF scores for the psychological health and social relationship domains. Immature ego defense mechanisms were also associated with lower WHOQOL-BREF scores for all domains. No significant associations were observed between WHOQOL-BREF scores and factors such as working hours, workplace, or monthly income in the study population.

WHOQOL-BREF scores correlated positively with mature defense mechanisms and normal object relations, suggesting an association between psychological maturity and quality of life among physicians.

### Defensive functioning in individuals with depressive disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114brV1F]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address the limited generalizability of studies on defense mechanisms in depression by comparing depressive individuals with non-clinical controls (aim a) and examining changes throughout psychological interventions (aim b) [PROSPERO CRD42023442620].

- **Methods**: We followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines, searching PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO until April 13, 2023, for studies evaluating defense mechanisms with measures based on the hierarchical model in depressive patients versus non-clinical controls or throughout psychological intervention. We conducted random-effect meta-analyses for mature defenses, non-mature (neurotic/immature) defenses, and overall defensive functioning (ODF), with standardized mean difference (SMD) as the outcome measure metric. Meta-regression, sub-group, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Study quality was appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), and the certainty of evidence for aim b outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) system.

- **Results**: Eighteen studies were included (mean NOS score = 5.56). Depressive patients used significantly more non-mature defenses than non-clinical controls (SMD = 0.74; k = 13). Non-clinical controls did not significantly differ in the use of mature defenses compared to depressive patients (SMD = 0.33; k = 14). Significant moderators were publication year, NOS score, geographical distribution, and mean age for non-mature defenses, and NOS score and geographical distribution for mature defenses. Throughout psychological intervention, the results were consistent with the initial findings.

### Dysfunctional coping with stress in psychosis. An investigation with the maladaptive and adaptive coping styles (MAX) questionnaire [^112uegLG]. Schizophrenia Research (2016). Low credibility.

Objective: Psychotic episodes have long been conceptualized as inevitable incidents triggered by endogenous biological impairments. It is now well-accepted that the ability of an individual to deal with social and environmental challenges plays an important role in whether or not a vulnerability to psychosis translates into symptoms. For the present study, we examined symptomatic correlates of dysfunctional coping in psychosis and aimed to elucidate a profile of coping strategies that distinguishes patients with schizophrenia from those with depression.

Method: The newly devised Maladaptive and Adaptive Coping Styles Scale (MAX) was administered to 75 individuals with psychosis, 100 individuals with depression, and 1100 nonclinical controls.

Results: Schizophrenia patients showed compromised coping abilities relative to nonclinical controls, particularly a lack of engaging in adaptive coping. Depression was more closely tied to dysfunctional coping than were positive symptoms, as indicated by group comparisons and correlational analyses. Correlations between positive symptoms, especially paranoid symptoms, and avoidance and suppression remained significant when depression was controlled for.

Conclusions: Although maladaptive and adaptive coping are unlikely to represent proximal mechanisms for the pathogenesis of positive symptoms, fostering coping skills may reduce positive symptoms via the improvement of depressive symptoms, which are increasingly regarded as risk factors for core psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, the reduction of avoidance and suppression may…

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^115Q2NEG]. APA (2025). High credibility.

The APA 2025 guidelines recommend offering the following psychological interventions for patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with respect to nonpharmacologic interventions, specifically psychotherapy:

- **Cognitive processing therapy**: Cognitive processing therapy is an effective intervention for addressing PTSD symptoms.

- **Prolonged exposure**: This therapy helps patients confront and process their trauma-related memories and cues.

- **Trauma-focused CBT**: Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy is a structured, short-term treatment model aimed at reducing PTSD symptoms through cognitive and behavioral strategies.

### Stress dynamics that maintain posttraumatic stress disorder across 20 years [^113oNTH2]. Psychological Medicine (2025).

Stress-symptom dynamics and underlying maintenance mechanisms contribute significantly to PTSD. One candidate dynamic is stress reactivity, which refers to how stressful events occurring after the initial trauma can exacerbate symptoms. Stressors may be especially potent for people with PTSD because of pre-trauma vulnerabilities associated with the condition. Longitudinal studies of trauma-exposed populations support the role of stress reactivity, with many finding that post-trauma stressors predict subsequent increases in PTSD symptoms and that people exposed to more traumatic experiences are especially reactive.

Furthermore, according to stress sensitization models, trauma exposure may actually cause biological, cognitive, and behavioral changes that amplify responses to stressful life events. Some mechanisms that have been proposed to explain heightened reactivity after trauma include abnormalities in neurobiological systems involved with memory, selective attention to threat, and engagement in avoidant coping strategies that prevent adaptive fear conditioning. In support of the possibility that trauma contributes to stress reactivity, there is also evidence that the more traumatic events a person is exposed to, the more reactive they are to subsequent stressors.

### Understanding clinical fear and anxiety through the lens of human fear conditioning [^116786Rw]. Nature Reviews Psychology (2023). High credibility.

Fear is an adaptive emotion that mobilizes defensive resources upon confrontation with danger. However, fear becomes maladaptive and can give rise to the development of clinical anxiety when it exceeds the degree of threat, generalizes broadly across stimuli and contexts, persists after the danger is gone, or promotes excessive avoidance behavior. Pavlovian fear conditioning has been the prime research instrument that has led to substantial progress in understanding the multi-faceted psychological and neurobiological mechanisms of fear in past decades.

In this perspective, we suggest that fruitful use of Pavlovian fear conditioning as a laboratory model of clinical anxiety requires moving beyond the study of fear acquisition to associated fear conditioning phenomena: fear extinction, generalization of conditioned fear, and fearful avoidance. Understanding individual differences in each of these phenomena, not only in isolation but also in how they interact, will further strengthen the external validity of the fear conditioning model as a tool with which to study maladaptive fear as it manifests in clinical anxiety.

### The COVID-19 pandemic: diverse contexts; different epidemics-how and why [^116ds5pV]. BMJ Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

How a virus spreads and its disease progresses depend not only on the variables described above but also on the human reactions deployed when people are confronted with a disease outbreak or the threat of an outbreak. All these variables combined result in what unfolds as 'the epidemic' and the diverse ways it affects communities.

What a population experiences during an epidemic is not fully characterized by the numbers of known infections and deaths at the scale of a country. Such numbers hide regional and local differences, especially in large and diverse countries. The epidemic reaches the different geographical areas of a country at different moments and with varying intensities. It affects different communities in various ways, influencing how these communities perceive it and react to it. What constitutes a local COVID-19 epidemic is thus also characterized by the perceptions and the reactions it triggers in the different sections of society.

Even before the virus reaches a community, the threat of an epidemic causes fear, stress, and anxiety. Consequently, the threat or arrival of the epidemic also triggers responses, early or late, with various degrees of intensity and effectiveness.

- **Coping strategies and collective strategies**:
	- Coping strategies are the actions people and families take when disease threatens and sickness occurs, including the ways they try to protect themselves.
	- The response to an epidemic can be divided into individual and household actions (coping strategies) and collectively organized strategies (collective strategies).

### The diagnostic value of absolute neutrophil count, band count and morphologic changes of neutrophils in predicting bacterial infections [^113PxQ33]. Medical Principles and Practice (2007). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC)" is primarily used in the field of hematology and oncology. It is applicable to patients who have undergone chemotherapy, those with suspected neutropenia, or those at risk for severe infection due to immunosuppression. The ANC is calculated from the total white blood cell count and the percentage of neutrophils, providing a measure of the body's primary defense against bacterial infections.

The clinical utility of the ANC lies in its ability to assess the severity of neutropenia and the risk of infection in patients. It is particularly useful in monitoring patients undergoing chemotherapy, as these individuals are at a high risk for neutropenia and subsequent infection.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the ANC. However, it should be noted that the ANC may not accurately reflect the risk of infection in patients with conditions that cause functional neutrophil defects, such as chronic granulomatous disease. Additionally, the ANC may be less useful in patients with conditions that cause neutrophilia, such as corticosteroid use or acute stress, as these conditions can artificially elevate the neutrophil count.

### Top-down and bottom-up control of stress-coping [^113DwJpT]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, there are no clinical studies based on MR blockade as a means to interfere with retrieval. The first randomized controlled trial using GR activation to disturb retrieval (and facilitate extinction) showed a positive effect of cortisol treatment on reducing the re-experience of PTSD-like symptomatology and nightmares.

A second study conducted in a larger cohort with patients receiving medication failed to replicate this outcome. Surís et al. demonstrated, in a double-blind placebo-controlled study, that glucocorticoid treatment after reactivation of memory reduced PTSD symptoms experienced one week later. Yehuda et al. found that augmentation with cortisol around prolonged re-exposure to trauma significantly reduced PTSD symptoms.

Studies using high doses of glucocorticoids in emergency room settings showed a beneficial effect in preventing PTSD. Cortisol was also effective in the treatment of phobias in exposure-based therapy.

Why some of these treatment schedules were effective, even beyond the context of the fearful experience, might be explained by the remarkable capacity of glucocorticoid receptor modulation to reset the stress system.

### Prevalence and association of defense mechanisms with common psychiatric disorders: A national study [^113g5amF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

The objective is to understand whether individual psychiatric disorders or categories of disorders are associated with a specific profile of defense mechanisms or if these mechanisms are general markers of the severity of psychopathology. Despite defense mechanisms being central concepts in psychiatry, this relationship is largely unexplored.

Methods employed include analysis of data from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (N = 43,093), which investigates the associations of 12 pathological defense mechanisms with mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Logistic regressions were performed with mental disorders as predictors, defense mechanisms as outcomes, and included respondent age, sex, and race/ethnicity as covariates.

Results indicate that individuals with mood, anxiety, or substance use disorders generally have a higher prevalence of defense mechanisms compared to those with no disorders. Specifically, the prevalence of any pathological mechanism was 30.0% (95% CI, 29.4%-30.7%) for individuals with no disorders; 67.6% (95% CI, 65.9%-69.2%) for mood disorders; 62.8% (95% CI, 61.3%-64.2%) for anxiety disorders; and 49.8% (95% CI, 48.7%-51.0%) for substance use disorders. Neither broad diagnostic categories nor individual psychiatric disorders were associated with specific defense mechanism profiles.

Our findings suggest that defense mechanisms and psychiatric disorders represent correlated but different dimensions of psychopathology, potentially requiring different treatment approaches.

### Coping strategies as mediators in relation to resilience and posttraumatic stress disorder [^114HGf68]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Resilience has been shown to protect against the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the aftermath of trauma. However, it remains unclear how coping strategies influence resilience and PTSD development in the acute aftermath of trauma. This prospective, longitudinal study investigated the relationship between resilience, coping strategies, and the development of chronic PTSD symptoms.

- **Methods**: A sample of patients was recruited from an emergency department following a Criterion A trauma. Follow-up assessments were completed at 1-, 3-, and 6-months post-trauma to assess PTSD symptom development (N = 164).

- **Results**: Resilience at 1-month positively correlated with the majority of active coping strategies (all p < .05) and negatively correlated with the majority of avoidant coping strategies (all p < .05), as well as future PTSD symptoms (p < .001). Additionally, all avoidant coping strategies, including social withdrawal, positively correlated with future PTSD symptoms (all p < .01). After controlling for demographic and clinical variables, social withdrawal at 3-months fully mediated the relationship between resilience at 1-month and PTSD symptoms at 6-months.

- **Limitations**: Limitations include participant dropout and the conceptual overlap between avoidant coping and PTSD.

- **Conclusions**: These data suggest that resilience and social withdrawal may be possible therapeutic targets for mitigating the development of chronic PTSD in the aftermath of trauma.

### Staphylococcus aureus: The bug behind the itch in atopic dermatitis [^111eedgo]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Pruritus, or itch, is a defining symptom of atopic dermatitis (AD). The origins of itch are complex; it is considered both a defense mechanism and a cause of disease, leading to inflammation and psychological stress. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the processes that trigger itch, particularly the pruritoceptive origins generated in the skin. This perspective review discusses the implications of a recent observation that the V8 protease expressed by Staphylococcus aureus can directly trigger sensory neurons in the skin through activation of protease-activated receptor 1. This may be a key to understanding why itch is so common in AD, as S. aureus commonly overgrows in this disease due to deficient antimicrobial defense from both the epidermis and the cutaneous microbiome. Increased understanding of the role of microbes in AD provides increased opportunities for safely improving the treatment of this disorder.

### Defensive coping and health-related quality of life in chronic kidney disease: A cross-sectional study [^112cePKU]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Coping with the stresses of chronic disease is considered a key factor in the perceived impairment of health-related quality of life (HRQL). Little is known about these associations in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aimed to investigate the relationship between defensive coping and HRQL among patients in different CKD stages, after adjusting for psychological distress, sociodemographic, and disease-related variables.

- **Methods**: The sample consisted of 98 CKD patients attending a university nephrology department. This included 79 pre-dialysis patients of disease stages 3 to 4 and 19 dialysis patients. HRQL was assessed by the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), defensive coping by the Rationality/Emotional Defensiveness (R/ED) scale of the Lifestyle Defense Mechanism Inventory (LDMI), and psychological distress by the depression and anxiety scales of the revised Hopkins Symptom CheckList (SCL-90-R). Regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between SF-36 dimensions and defensive coping style.

- **Results**: Patients on dialysis had worse scores on SF-36 scales measuring physical aspects of HRQL. In the fully adjusted analysis, a higher defensive coping score was significantly associated with a lower score on the mental component summary (MCS) scale of the SF-36, indicating worse mental health. In contrast, a higher defensive coping score showed a small positive association with the physical component summary (PCS) scale of the SF-36, suggesting better health, but this was marginally significant.

- **Conclusions**: The results provided ev

### Changes in the psychological defense mechanism and clinical features of patients with OCD - A four-year follow-up study [^1161pdcJ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

The present study aims to (1) follow up with 4-year changes in the efficacy outcome, defense style questionnaire (DSQ) score, and clinical features of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and (2) analyze the relationship between different levels of efficacy and changes in the patients' psychological defense mechanisms.

- **Methods**: The following data collection and 4-year follow-up were completed for 153 patients with OCD: (1) the treatment process, efficacy outcome, course of disease, and clinical features of OCD were collected using a self-made general information questionnaire, and (2) the control method was used to analyze the changes in clinical symptoms (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale [YBOCS], Hamilton Anxiety Score [HAMA], and Hamilton Depression Scale [HAMD]) in patients with OCD. Moreover, the changes in the psychological defense mechanism (measured by DSQ) and the relation between the prognosis and DSQ score were investigated.

- **Results**: (1) The HAMA score (8.7 ± 4.8 points), HAMD score (12.0 ± 6.6 points), and YBOCS score (16.4 ± 8.4 points) were significantly lower during the follow-up than at the time of enrollment (p < 0.01). In the two DSQ evaluations, there were no significant differences in the factors, with the exception of a significant decrease in the use of "reaction formation" (t = 2.533, p = 0.015). The changes of mature defense factors in the significant efficacy group significantly increased (p < 0.01), which was mainly manifested in the significant increase in the score of "sublimation" item.

### Relationships between psychological distress, coping styles, and HPA axis reactivity in healthy adults [^11461MTX]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2010). Low credibility.

Psychological distress and coping styles have been suggested to relate to altered function in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, although there remains much to be understood about their relationships. High and low cortisol levels (or reactivity) both represent HPA axis dysfunction, with accumulated evidence suggesting that they are linked to different types of psychopathology. The dexamethasone (DEX)/corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) test has been extensively used to identify HPA axis abnormalities in various psychiatric conditions, including mood disorders; however, the possible associations of psychological distress and coping styles with HPA axis function have not been well documented using this test. Here, we examined the relationships of HPA axis reactivity as measured by the DEX/CRH test with subjectively perceived psychological distress and coping styles. Both were assessed with self-report questionnaires in 121 healthy volunteers.

Subjects were divided into three groups by the cortisol suppression pattern:

- **Incomplete-suppressors**: DST-Cortisol ≥ 5 μg/dL or DEX/CRH-Cortisol ≥ 5 μg/dL.
- **Moderate-suppressors**: DST-Cortisol < 5 μg/dL and 1 μg/dL ≤ DEX/CRH-Cortisol < 5 μg/dL.
- **Enhanced-suppressors**: DST-Cortisol < 5 μg/dL and DEX/CRH-Cortisol < 1 μg/dL.

The enhanced-suppressors showed significantly higher scores in obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, and anxiety symptoms and significantly more frequent use of avoidant coping strategy compared to the other two groups. These results point to the important role of enhanced HPA axis reactivity in psychological distress and coping mechanisms.

### Distress intolerance as a moderator of the relationship between daily stressors and affective symptoms: Tests of incremental and prospective relationships [^116xvg3k]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Distress intolerance (DI) is conceptualized as an individual difference reflective of the ability to tolerate aversive psychological states. Although high DI has demonstrated cross-sectional associations with multiple forms of psychopathology, few studies have tested key facets of its theoretical conceptualization. Specifically, little research has been conducted on DI's theorized role as an incrementally valid prospective moderator of the relationship between daily stressful events and affective symptoms reflective of preoccupation with aversive internal (e.g. depression, worry) rather than external stimuli (e.g. social anxiety).

- **Method**: A non-clinical sample (N = 147; 77% female; M age = 19.32) in which high DI individuals were oversampled was recruited. Participants completed baseline measures of DI and trait negative affect, followed by six diary entries over a two-week period in which participants reported on daily stressors, negative affect, worry, depressive, and social anxiety symptoms.

- **Results**: Hierarchical linear models revealed that DI positively predicted depressive and worry, but not social anxiety symptoms, independent of daily stressors and negative affect. Further, a significant interaction effect was found, such that the positive association between daily stressor(s) occurrence and daily worry was significant at high, but not low DI, and a similar trend-level interaction effect was observed for depressive symptoms. The interaction for social anxiety symptoms was non-significant.

Limitations: Utilization of a non-clinical sample precludes generalization.

### The impact of attachment styles and defense mechanisms on psychological distress in a non-clinical young adult sample: A path analysis [^1165v13N]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Insecure attachment styles and immature or neurotic defense mechanisms are related to psychological distress; however, their mutual interaction in influencing psychological distress deserves further investigation.

- **Methods**: One thousand one hundred twenty-nine university students were evaluated using the Global Severity Index of the Symptoms Checklist 90-Revised for psychological distress, the Relationship Questionnaire for attachment styles, and the Defense Style Questionnaire for defense mechanisms. Following exploratory analyses, a path analysis was performed with psychological distress as the outcome.

- **Results**: Fearful and preoccupied attachment styles had a substantial impact on psychological distress, with about 30% of their effect mediated by immature and neurotic defenses, the former having the major effect. Dismissing attachment showed no substantial effect on psychological distress. Secure attachment and mature defenses had a small protective effect on psychological distress, but their inclusion in the path model did not improve overall goodness-of-fit. Attachment style and defense mechanisms accounted for nearly 25% of the variance in psychological distress.

- **Conclusions**: The results showed that attachment styles and defense mechanisms have a substantial impact on psychological distress. The effect of attachment style is mediated by defense mechanisms. Individual differences in attachment style and defense mechanisms represent risk factors for psychological distress in young adults.

### What are set and setting: Reducing vagueness to improve research and clinical practice [^117R4WUY]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Low credibility.

The mechanism-first approach is an iterative research agenda, according to which set and setting researchers should first focus on paradigmatic examples of (interventions on) set and setting that are widely regarded as critical to psychedelic outcomes. These include paradigms that are thought to promote good outcomes, such as "openness to the experience" and creating a calm background environment, and those that are considered bad for psychedelic outcomes, such as being "closed to" the experience. Even if there is debate about whether various other factors should count as set or setting components, and which of these factors are important, these are widely agreed-upon paradigms.

On the mechanism-first approach, after verifying that paradigmatic factors significantly affect outcomes, researchers should clarify the mechanisms through which these factors exert their influence. As the mechanisms are explained, hypotheses about further elements of psychological profile and environmental context that may also influence these mechanisms will emerge for testing. If those further elements are determined to influence outcomes through the same or similar mechanisms, they become new paradigms of set and setting. In addition, as potential mechanisms become clear, psychedelic researchers can draw on how similar mechanisms are understood in other research to elucidate how they work in the psychedelic domain or identify candidate set and setting factors that might engage those mechanisms in the psychedelic space. Notably, many PAT modalities already in use draw on psychological intervention techniques, hinting at the overlap between psychological and psychedelic research.

### Coping processes relevant to posttraumatic growth: An evidence-based review [^114CxaEd]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic growth (PTG) refers to positive psychological changes and growth beyond previous levels of functioning and thereby implies both an outcome and a process, such as the struggle following a traumatic event. PTG starts when a severe adverse life event challenges or shatters the person's cognitive scheme of the world and themselves, such as a cancer diagnosis. The subsequent growth represents the outcome due to coping processes being employed to adapt first to the event, and secondly, to use to create a more positive revised worldview. In literature, there has been an attempt to differentiate between PTG as an outcome and PTG as a coping strategy in terms of positive illusions that might help people counterbalance emotional distress. The same authors, however, concluded that such differentiation is only for ontological purposes.

Coping refers to cognitive and behavioral efforts to master, reduce, or tolerate the internal and external demands of the stressful encounter. Coping has two major functions: dealing with the problem causing the distress (problem-focused coping) and regulating emotions (emotion-focused coping). Recently, researchers have begun to investigate psychological mechanisms or pathways potentially contributing to PTG, and it has been suggested that coping strategies are key components of the pathway to PTG. Taylor and Armour, who reviewed the literature of coping strategies with an array of normal stressful events and those dealing with extreme stressful events like cancer, heart disease, and HIV infection, implied that individuals who are capable of dealing with these events can achieve PTG.

### Top-down and bottom-up control of stress-coping [^115TVVRk]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

In this 30th anniversary issue review, we focus on the glucocorticoid modulation of limbic-prefrontocortical circuitry during stress-coping. This action of the stress hormone is mediated by mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) that are co-expressed abundantly in these higher brain regions. Via both receptor types, the glucocorticoids demonstrate, in various contexts, rapid nongenomic and slower genomic actions that coordinate consecutive stages of information processing. MR-mediated action optimizes stress-coping, whereas, in a complementary fashion, the memory storage of the selected coping strategy is promoted via GR.

We highlight the involvement of adipose tissue in the allocation of energy resources to central regulation of stress reactions. Additionally, we point to still poorly understood neuronal ensembles in the prefrontal cortex that underlie cognitive flexibility critical for effective coping. Finally, we evaluate the role of cortisol as a pleiotropic regulator in vulnerability to, and treatment of, trauma-related psychiatric disorders.

### Loss, trauma, and human resilience: Have we underestimated the human capacity to thrive after extremely aversive events [^115B4r3a]. The American Psychologist (2004). Low credibility.

Many people are exposed to loss or potentially traumatic events at some point in their lives, and yet they continue to have positive emotional experiences and show only minor and transient disruptions in their ability to function. Unfortunately, because much of psychology's knowledge about how adults cope with loss or trauma has come from individuals who sought treatment or exhibited great distress, loss and trauma theorists have often viewed this type of resilience as either rare or pathological.

The author challenges these assumptions by reviewing evidence that resilience represents a distinct trajectory from the process of recovery, that resilience in the face of loss or potential trauma is more common than is often believed, and that there are multiple and sometimes unexpected pathways to resilience.

### Posttraumatic stress syndromes: Useful or negative heuristics [^116ZFP5b]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

The articles in this special issue provide a wide range of challenges to conceptions, nosology, and assessment procedures for posttraumatic stress disorders. At best, they overcome the negative heuristic posed by these disorders, reopening issues that have preemptively been closed about dissociation, the presumed causal connection between a life-threatening event and the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorders, and the adequacy of checklist assessments of symptoms. They note discontinuities between thinking about these disorders and the dominant thinking of the past. We make recommendations for more studies that similarly challenge the validity of conceptions of posttraumatic disorders and dissociation, and the adequacy of checklist assessments of symptoms. With this goal, we note the value of studying ersatz posttraumatic stress response. Finally, we call for greater transparency in this literature with author disclosure of activity as expert witnesses.

### A stress-coping model of mental illness stigma: II. Emotional stress responses, coping behavior and outcome [^116LSvCk]. Schizophrenia Research (2009). Low credibility.

Stigma can be a major stressor for people with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses, leading to emotional stress reactions and cognitive coping responses. Stigma is appraised as a stressor if perceived stigma-related harm exceeds an individual's perceived coping resources. It is unclear, however, how people with mental illness react to stigma stress and how that affects outcomes such as self-esteem, hopelessness, and social performance.

The cognitive appraisal of stigma stress, as well as emotional stress reactions (social anxiety, shame) and cognitive coping responses, were assessed by self-report among 85 people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective, or affective disorders. In addition to self-directed outcomes (self-esteem, hopelessness), social interaction with majority outgroup members was assessed by a standardized role-play test and a seating distance measure.

High stigma stress was associated with increased social anxiety and shame but not with cognitive coping responses. Social anxiety and shame predicted lower self-esteem and more hopelessness, but not social performance or seating distance. Hopelessness was associated with the coping mechanisms of devaluing work/education and of blaming discrimination for failures. The coping mechanism of ingroup comparisons predicted poorer social performance and increased seating distance. The cognitive appraisal of stigma-related stress, emotional stress reactions, and coping responses may add to our understanding of how stigma affects people with mental illness. Trade-offs between different stress reactions can explain why stress-related outcomes vary.

### The mediating role of personalized psychological flexibility in the association between distress intolerance and psychological distress: A national survey during the fourth wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Iran [^1141pGC4]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2021). Low credibility.

The global COVID-19 outbreak has tested the human race's distress tolerance abilities, with distress worsening during each pandemic wave. However, more flexible individuals have a greater chance of coping effectively. This study aimed to examine the mediating role of personalized psychological flexibility (PPF) in the link between distress intolerance and psychological distress during the fourth wave of the pandemic in Iran. A total of 576 individuals (mean age 34.80, ± 10.9, females 55.6%) participated in the online survey.

In this national sample, PPF partially mediated the mentioned association. Interestingly, this mediation was independent of demographic factors (age, gender, marital status, and educational level) as well as fear of COVID-19, mindfulness, and satisfaction with life. Despite these variables, accepting and using unpleasant emotions as a driving force to achieve valued goals, rather than avoiding them, would mitigate psychological distress during the pandemic. Consequently, public health services can aim to provide interventions that enhance psychological flexibility to alleviate COVID-19-related mental distress.

### Defense style in panic disorder before and after pharmacological treatment [^116Dj8tr]. Psychiatry Research (2011). Low credibility.

Whether the use of a maladaptive defense style is a trait, as opposed to a state-dependent phenomenon in panic disorder (PD), remains a topic of considerable debate. The aim of this study was to verify whether PD patients, both before and after treatment, used different defense styles than the control group. Sixty-one PD patients (recruited from an original sample of 90 patients) and 64 healthy controls were evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV disorders, the Symptoms Check List-90, the Hamilton Rating Scales for Anxiety and Depression, and the Defense Style Questionnaire-40 (DSQ).

The patients were treated with paroxetine or citalopram and were evaluated monthly for one year to assess remission. The DSQ was re-administered to the patients at the end of the study. Before treatment, PD patients employed more neurotic and immature forms of defense than controls. After treatment, those in remission used defense styles similar to the control group, whereas non-remitters continued to use more immature defenses. However, all aforementioned differences disappeared after excluding the effect of symptom severity.

Our data supports the hypothesis that the use of maladaptive defenses might be a consequence of PD: when individuals become ill, their capacity to employ mature adaptive defenses may diminish, but upon recovery, their defensive style returns to greater maturity. The present results are, however, limited by the dropout rate (one-third of patients did not complete the study) and the use of only one questionnaire to evaluate the complexity.

### Defense mechanism differences between younger and older adults: A cross-sectional investigation [^112y7wXs]. Aging & Mental Health (2007). Low credibility.

This study evaluated defense mechanism differences between younger and older adults and assessed the relationship between defense mechanisms and perceived stress. This was done to provide evidence of construct validity for a self-reported defense mechanisms scale. Community-dwelling younger (n = 259; M age = 19.7 years) and older adults (n = 69; M age = 70.8 years) completed the Defense Style Questionnaire and the Perceived Stress Scale. Whereas there were no age differences in adaptive defense mechanisms, younger adults scored higher than older adults on the Acting Out, Passive-Aggression, and Regression maladaptive defense mechanism scales. Maladaptive defenses were significantly and positively correlated (r = .57) with perceived stress.

Cross-sectional results suggest a general stability of adaptive defense mechanisms across the lifespan but a lessening of maladaptive defense mechanisms with advancing age. These results dispel the myth that old age is associated with inevitable psychological impairment and suggest some specific positive psychological adaptations with age. The correlational findings provide partial support for the construct validity of a self-report measure of defense mechanisms.

### The origins of '5-HT and mechanisms of defence' by Deakin and Graeff: A personal perspective [^117UJPXr]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

In this brief reflection, I outline how Fred Graeff and I came to integrate our ideas and findings concerning the behavioral functions of serotonin (5-HT) over 20 years ago in '5-HT and Mechanisms of Defence', reproduced in this volume. The principal insight was that different 5-HT pathways mediate distinct adaptive responses to aversive events of different types. This conclusion emerged from various strands in neuropsychopharmacology: the functional implications of the then-new images of monoamine neuroanatomy of the 1970s; the ethological differentiation of behavioral responses to proximal and distal threats; and the seemingly contradictory effects of 5-HT drugs in unconditioned, Pavlovian, and instrumental paradigms of reward and aversion.

The article has been cited over 600 times and continues to be acknowledged. While most evidence was derived from animal research, it also included some experimental psychopharmacological tests in humans. This perspective highlights some more recent and notable human corroborations.

### Psychological characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease patients: A comparison between active and nonactive patients [^112BMysx]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The role of new psychological factors such as psychopathological patterns and defense mechanisms in the care of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been poorly investigated. We aimed to assess the psychological characteristics and defense mechanisms of IBD patients.

- **Methods**: This was a single-center, observational, cross-sectional study. Consecutive adult IBD patients were enrolled and stratified according to disease activity. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected, and validated questionnaires (Symptom Checklist-90-R [SCL-90-R]) for psychological distress, Defense Mechanism Inventory (DMI) for psychological defense mechanisms, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) for quality of life (QoL) were administered.

- **Results**: Two hundred one patients were enrolled: 101 in remission and 100 with active disease. The mean score for IBDQ was below the cutoff level (156.8 ± 37.8), with a significantly greater impairment of QoL in subjects with flares (136.5 vs 177.5, P < 0.001). Lower scores were associated with female gender. No patients had psychological scores above the cutoff for normality. Statistically higher SCL-90-R scores were found in active patients for obsessive-compulsive disorder (P = 0.026), depression (P = 0.013), anxiety (P = 0.013), phobic anxiety (P = 0.002), psychoticism (P = 0.007), global severity index (GSI) (P = 0.005), and positive symptom total (PST) (P = 0.001). A significantly increased probability of higher global indexes was associated with Crohn's disease and disease flares. None of the defensive mechanisms were elevated in the active group compared to the nonactive group.

### What is posttraumatic stress disorder [^117SNpz6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Our understanding of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has increased significantly over the last two decades. Although the cause of the condition is usually easy to determine in individual patients, the symptoms of PTSD are diverse, involving a mixture of psychological processes. This article presents a broad overview of PTSD, including its definition according to DSM-IV and ICD-10 diagnostic criteria, and its clinical course with reference to its association with depression and other mental disorders. The article also briefly reviews the assessment of patients and considers physiologic features, such as responses to startle stimuli, which appear to be useful in diagnosing PTSD and in differentiating it from other anxiety disorders and depression. Finally, a brief overview of the treatment of PTSD is given, including psychological and biological treatment options.

### Top-down and bottom-up control of stress-coping [^115ePJ87]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

Understanding how glucocorticoids, as master regulators of the stress response, facilitate coping and adaptation is a critical challenge. Another important quest is identifying the role of glucocorticoids in the mechanism underlying individual differences in coping with stress. The extent to which the stress hormone directs early‐life programming of stress and fear circuitry is a hot topic. Evidence suggests a role of pleiotropic glucocorticoids in precipitating vulnerability to stress‐related disorders, although translating this basic knowledge to clinical practice has been slow. These challenges ultimately lead to a fundamental question in stress research: how can the action of glucocorticoids change from protective to harmful? What is the cause and what are the consequences?

It is sobering to consider that this question was as significant at the Journal of Neuroendocrinology's launch as it is today. Nevertheless, there is hope. Big data, as well as genome‐ and imaging technology, have revealed novel aspects of signaling cascades, circuit connectivity, and synaptic plasticity that are at the root of the stress‐coping mechanism in higher brain regions. These regions are targets for glucocorticoids that can coordinate and integrate the various stages of information processing, from the perception and appraisal of a stressor to coping and behavioral adaptation. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (corticosterone in rodents and cortisol/corticosterone in humans) act via activation of two types of receptors: mineralocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoid receptors.

### More adaptive versus less maladaptive coping: What is more predictive of symptom severity? Development of a new scale to investigate coping profiles across different psychopathological syndromes [^112a92Jr]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Lack of adaptive coping and enhanced maladaptive coping with stress and negative emotions are implicated in many psychopathological disorders. We describe the development of a new scale to investigate the relative contribution of different coping styles to psychopathology in a large population sample. We hypothesized that the magnitude of the supposed positive correlation between maladaptive coping and psychopathology would be stronger than the supposed negative correlation between adaptive coping and psychopathology. We also examined whether distinct coping style patterns emerge for different psychopathological syndromes.

- **Methods**: A total of 2,200 individuals from the general population participated in an online survey. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory Revised (OCI-R), and the Paranoia Checklist were administered along with a novel instrument called the Maladaptive and Adaptive Coping Styles (MAX) questionnaire. Participants were reassessed six months later.

- **Results**: MAX consists of three dimensions representing adaptive coping, maladaptive coping, and avoidance. Across all psychopathological syndromes, similar response patterns emerged. Maladaptive coping was more strongly related to psychopathology than adaptive coping both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The overall number of coping styles adopted by an individual predicted greater psychopathology. Mediation analysis suggests that a mild positive relationship between adaptive and certain maladaptive styles (emotional suppression) partially accounts for the attenuation of results.

### Top-down and bottom-up control of stress-coping [^113Wj72k]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

The outcome of attempts to deal with (in)escapable challenges relates to Henry's distinction of two evolutionary successful response modes in coping with psychosocial stress: the active fight-flight and the passive conservation-withdrawal mode. Koolhaas et al. and de Boer et al. have further elaborated on the physiological and behavioural stress response patterns of these two extremes in coping style.

In their studies, they used male mice genetically selected for highly aggressive short-attack latency (SAL) versus long-attack latency mice (LAL). A higher trait aggressiveness in these mice is associated with prolonged active coping bouts in the forced swim test (FST). By contrast, the LAL mice showed signs of withdrawal upon social defeat. This expression of a passive coping style triggered a much higher and prolonged release of corticosterone.

- **Characteristics of SAL animals**: The dominant SAL animals feature diminished cognitive flexibility, a rigid rather routine-like behavioural control, a reduced impulse control, high sympathetic activity, high striatal dopamine (DA) activity, and low hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity in response to stressors. Such animals also have high limbic expression of mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) and low serotonin (5-HT) activity, whereas MR antagonists can reverse some aspects of this phenotype. Koolhaas et al. qualified the active mice as proactive rather than active copers to reflect their tendency to take the initiative.

- **Characteristics of LAL animals**: On the other extreme, the passive animals, qualified as reactive, showed the mirror image characteristics with high HPA axis and parasympathetic activity.

### Association between individual differences in self-reported emotional resilience and the affective perception of neutral faces [^111Y7T72]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Resilience, i.e. the ability to cope with stress and adversity, relies heavily on judging adaptively complex situations. Judging facial emotions is a complex process of daily living that is important for evaluating the affective context of uncertain situations, which could be related to the individual's level of resilience. We used a novel experimental paradigm to test the hypothesis that highly resilient individuals show a judgment bias towards positive emotions.

- **Methods**: 65 non-treatment seeking subjects completed a forced emotional choice task when presented with neutral faces and faces morphed to display a range of emotional intensities across sadness, fear, and happiness.

- **Results**: Overall, neutral faces were judged more often to be sad or fearful than happy. Furthermore, high compared to low resilient individuals showed a bias towards happiness, particularly when judging neutral faces.

- **Limitations**: This is a cross-sectional study with a non-clinical sample.

- **Conclusions**: These results support the hypothesis that resilient individuals show a bias towards positive emotions when faced with uncertain emotional expressions. This capacity may contribute to their ability to better cope with certain types of difficult situations, especially those that are interpersonal in nature.

### Defensive coping and health-related quality of life in chronic kidney disease: a cross-sectional study [^114Jx76E]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Coping with the stresses of chronic disease is considered a key factor in the perceived impairment of health-related quality of life (HRQL). Little is known, though, about these associations in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aimed to investigate the relationship between defensive coping and HRQL among patients in different CKD stages, after adjusting for psychological distress, sociodemographic, and disease-related variables.

- **Methods**: The sample consisted of 98 CKD patients attending a university nephrology department. Seventy-nine pre-dialysis patients in disease stages 3 to 4 and 19 dialysis patients were included. HRQL was assessed by the 36-item Short-Form health survey (SF-36). Defensive coping was measured using the Rationality/Emotional Defensiveness (R/ED) scale of the Lifestyle Defense Mechanism Inventory (LDMI), and psychological distress was measured using the depression and anxiety scales of the revised Hopkins Symptom CheckList (SCL-90-R). Regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between the SF-36 dimensions and defensive coping style.

- **Results**: Patients on dialysis had worse scores on SF-36 scales measuring physical aspects of HRQL. In the fully adjusted analysis, a higher defensive coping score was significantly associated with a lower score on the mental component summary (MCS) scale of the SF-36, indicating worse mental health. In contrast, a higher defensive score showed a small positive association with the physical component summary (PCS) scale of the SF-36, indicating better health, but this was marginally significant.

- **Conclusions**: The results provided evidence that defensive coping styles might influence various aspects of HRQL in CKD patients.

### What are set and setting: Reducing vagueness to improve research and clinical practice [^111XLx8b]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Low credibility.

A mechanism-first approach

A mechanism for a given phenomenon is composed of parts (e.g. individual neurons in the nervous system or core beliefs in a person's psychological structure) that interact to produce that phenomenon. Many scientific advances in biology, neurology, and psychology have resulted from the broad project of identifying potential mechanisms, individuating their components, and charting the interactions and organization of these components that produce observable phenomena. For example, an explanation of a psychotherapeutic intervention might describe the parts involved (i.e. beliefs, desires, etc) that are targeted by the intervention. By contrast, a psychopharmacological intervention's mechanism might involve a description of how the intervention targets neurotransmitters and brain states.

### Comparison and change of defense mechanisms over the course of psychotherapy in patients with depression or anxiety disorder: Evidence from a randomized controlled trial [^111GL7iP]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). High credibility.

Defense mechanisms play an important role in the development and maintenance of both health and psychopathology. Research is still in the early stages of investigating the specific relationships among diagnostic groups and defense mechanisms, along with their response to different treatment types.

- **Methods**: For the present study, a total of 47 outpatients diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorders were randomized to receive 25 ± 3 sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy with integrated elements of either emotion-focused therapy (CBT + EFT) or treatment components based on self-regulation theory (CBT + SR). An observer-rated method, the Defense Mechanism Rating Scale (DMRS), was used to code transcripts of the 1st, 8th, 16th, and 24th session to assess change in defensive functioning.

- **Results**: Over the course of therapy, overall defensive functioning (ODF) as well as adaptive defenses increased significantly, whereas maladaptive and neurotic defenses did not change. At the beginning of treatment, the proportion of adaptive defenses and ODF was significantly higher in patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders than in patients with depressive disorders. However, depressed patients exhibited greater improvement in their defensive functioning over the course of therapy.

- **Conclusions**: Results support the view of defense mechanisms as a useful transdiagnostic and transtheoretical concept and support the notion that change of defense mechanisms may be a relevant mechanism of change in psychotherapy.

### Capacity to love and problematic sexuality: The role of defense mechanisms and psychopathological suffering [^112z6asq]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Limitation to the capacity to love is often a feature of a suffering personality. We aimed to investigate the role of the capacity to love in hypersexual behavior, considering both distress and defense mechanisms as possible psychological mediators.

Through an online platform, we recruited a convenience sample of 521 subjects (390 [74.9%] females and 131 [25.1%] males; mean [SD] age, 26.46 [5.89] years). Recruited subjects completed a psychometric protocol that included completion of the following measurement tools: (1) the Capacity to Love Inventory (CTL-I), (2) the Hypersexual Behavior Inventory (HBI), (3) the 30-item self-report Defense Mechanisms Rating Scale, and (4) the Brief Symptom Inventory. We then performed correlation and regression analyses and used a mediation model for data analysis.

A significant negative relationship between the capacity to love and hypersexual behavior was found. Furthermore, indirect effects were also statistically significant, supporting the hypothesis that limitation to the capacity to love is related to hypersexuality through the paths of psychological distress and immature defense mechanisms. Finally, compared to the other subjects, those with pathological scores for the HBI showed significantly lower scores on the CTL-I, which suggested limitations to the capacity to love.

The relationship between limitation to the capacity to love and hypersexuality is fundamental to the diagnostic process in persons with problematic sexuality and psychopathological distress.

### Top-down and bottom-up control of stress-coping [^114fMUo4]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

### New approaches to the study of immune responses in humans [^116ThDtA]. Human Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

The human immune system consists of multiple, layered mechanisms of sensing and responding to cellular stress, infection, and tissue damage to ensure defense from pathogens, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and the integrity of the holobiont. Every single cell in the body has a role to play; however, a few dozen specialized white blood cells are particularly important in this respect. Understanding the overall state of this multifaceted system in a single individual is challenging. We are only beginning to do this across populations of individuals to understand the vast range of inter-individual variation and the influences of genes and environmental factors that collectively shape the immune system in a given individual. We are also only beginning to understand the changes occurring within this system over time and how this relates to health and disease susceptibility.

Several technological breakthroughs in recent years have enabled these developments and the emergence of a new, complementary approach to studying human immune systems, namely systems immunology. In this paradigm, the focus is shifted from the understanding of individual immune system components and their mechanisms of action toward analyses of cell–cell interactions and mechanisms of coordination and regulation within the human immune system.

### Disease tolerance: Concept and mechanisms [^117RVjfJ]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Two distinct defense strategies provide a host with survival to infectious diseases: resistance and tolerance. Resistance is dependent on the ability of the host to kill pathogens, while tolerance promotes host health and has a neutral to positive impact on pathogen fitness. Immune responses are almost inevitably defined in terms of pathogen resistance. Recent evidence has shown, however, that several effects attributed to the activation of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms cannot be readily explained with the paradigm of immunity as effectors of microbial destruction. This review focuses on integrating the concept of disease tolerance into recent studies of immune system function related to the regulation and resolution of tissue damage, T cell exhaustion, and tolerance to innocuous antigen.

### Pregnancy denial: Toward a new understanding of the underlying mechanisms [^111gaiHN]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Low credibility.

According to the literature, pregnancy denial is a pathological issue. It is likely a consequence of some trauma, the wish not to have a child (possibly a defense mechanism triggered by trauma), or a psychiatric problem of a different origin. However, given that the majority of cases cannot be clearly linked to any of the above reasons, we argue that the phenomenon cannot be placed in any particular category as it is not always associated with mental or physiological problems. Under certain circumstances, it can affect any woman. Therefore, it is important for gynecologists as well as general practitioners to be more aware of this phenomenon. This awareness will enable them to conduct appropriate investigations when pregnancies are suspected by them, despite the patients' categorical denial of the fact.

### Avoidance-oriented coping as a predictor of panic-related distress: A test using biological challenge [^1113B5U2]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

This experimental psychopathology study investigates how pre-experimental levels of avoidance-oriented coping predict anxious and fearful responses during acute physical stress, compared to other relevant variables. The study included 80 participants with no known history of psychological or physical health issues. Dependent measures consisted of self-reported anxiety, DSM-IV panic symptoms, and physiological indices such as heart rate and skin conductance. Consistent with the hypotheses, the tendency to engage in avoidance-oriented coping was a predictor of increased physical panic symptoms and self-reported anxiety elicited by biological challenge, relative to specific dimensions of anxiety sensitivity (AS). These findings discuss how specific coping types associate with prototypical indices of panic distress, recommending further research on emotional regulation in panic disorder.

### Affective temperaments and ego defense mechanisms associated with somatic symptom severity in a large sample [^113TKrxX]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Several complex mechanisms, including biological, psychological, and social factors, may contribute to the development of bodily symptoms. Affective temperaments may represent heritable subclinical manifestations of mood disorders, and the concept of ego defense mechanisms provides a model for understanding psychopathology. However, the relationship between affective temperaments, defensive functioning, and somatic symptom severity remains unknown.

- **Methods**: We obtained data from a subsample of the Brazilian Internet Study on Temperament and Psychopathology (BRAINSTEP). Participants completed the Affective and Emotional Temperament Composite Scale (AFECTS), the Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40), and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). The SCL-90-R Somatization scale was used as the outcome variable.

- **Results**: Among 9,937 participants (47% male), individuals with dysphoric, cyclothymic, and depressive temperaments, as well as those who adopted displacement, somatisation, and passive aggression as their predominant defense mechanisms, presented with high somatic symptom severity. Participants with a dysphoric temperament and those with higher displacement scores were more likely to endorse numerous bodily symptoms after controlling for age, gender, education, and depressive symptoms. Moderator analysis indicated that the relationship between dysphoric temperament and somatic symptom severity was significantly stronger in individuals who adopted displacement as their predominant defense mechanism.

- **Limitations**: The data was collected from a convenience web-based sample, limiting the study's generalizability. Additionally, the research was cross-sectional, which precludes any causal inferences.

### The neuroimmune response during stress: A physiological perspective [^111KiKVC]. Immunity (2021). Low credibility.

However, this apparent discrepancy can be resolved, at least in part, if we recognize that stress is not a uniform phenomenon. Stressors vary in their origin (physical or psychosocial), their duration (acute or chronic), and their intensity (mild, moderate, or intense). Stress heterogeneity also stems from individual physiological and psychological differences and factors such as the organism's inflammatory, metabolic, and emotional state, which affect the individual's perception of stress and its physiological outcome. Therefore, attributing a uniform manifestation to stress limits our ability to gain a mechanistic understanding of the phenomenon.

The attempt to produce a uniform view of stress reflects an understanding of stress articulated by Selye, who defined stress as "the non-specific response of the body to any demand". Selye used the term 'non-specific' to indicate that, regardless of the nature of any demand or stressor, all responses to stress share some common characteristics. The "General Adaptation Syndrome" proposed by Selye was a pioneering framework describing a uniform stress response characterized by three phases: a nonspecific mobilization phase, which promotes sympathetic nervous system activity; a resistance phase, during which the organism attempts to cope with the threat; and an exhaustion phase, which occurs if the organism fails to overcome the threat and depletes its physiological resources. While the mechanistic concept proposed by Selye of neuroendocrine control of the pituitary-adrenal humoral axis has been expanded, it has been generally validated.

### The anxiety spectrum and the reflex physiology of defense: from circumscribed fear to broad distress [^111gn46g]. Depression and Anxiety (2012). Low credibility.

Guided by the diagnostic nosology, anxiety patients are expected to show defensive hyperarousal during affective challenge, irrespective of the principal phenotype. In the study, patients representing the whole spectrum of anxiety disorders (i.e. specific phobia, social phobia, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)), and healthy community control participants completed an imagery-based fear elicitation paradigm paralleling conventional intervention techniques. Participants imagined threatening and neutral narratives as physiological responses were recorded.

Clear evidence emerged for exaggerated reactivity to clinically relevant imagery — most pronounced in startle reflex responding. However, defensive propensity varied across principal anxiety disorders. Disorders characterized by focal fear and impairment (e.g. specific phobia) showed robust fear potentiation. Conversely, for disorders of long-enduring, pervasive apprehension and avoidance with broad anxiety and depression comorbidity (e.g. PTSD secondary to cumulative trauma, GAD), startle responses were paradoxically diminished to all aversive contents. Patients whose expressed symptom profiles were intermediate between focal fearfulness and broad anxious-misery in both severity and chronicity exhibited a still heightened but more generalized physiological propensity to respond defensively.

Importantly, this defensive physiological gradient — the inverse of self-reported distress — was evident not only by…

### Prostatitis [^111EJMq2]. Canadian Urological Association Journal (2011). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic bacterial prostatitis, more specifically with respect to psychosocial assessment, the CUA 2011 guidelines recommend obtaining a psychological assessment. Psychosocial parameters, such as depression, maladaptive coping mechanisms, and poor social support, impact symptoms and the results of therapy.

### Understanding brain mechanisms of reactive aggression [^112oi2H4]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

We systematically summarized and structured the recent literature in three sections on threat sensitivity, frustrative non-reward as activating conditions, and cognitive control subsuming regulatory mechanisms to search for transdiagnostic biobehavioral mechanisms. Based on these sections, we will formulate a working model for future research designs that aim to capture the multidimensional nature of reactive aggression. We hypothesize about pathways from typical situational triggers, such as social threat, provocation, and frustration, through the three brain mechanisms to behavior.

First, we acknowledge some important limitations:

- **Data limitations**: Data on neural correlates of induced reactive aggression, particularly in highly aggressive or clinical groups, are still limited. This may be strongly related to:
	- **MRI environment challenge**: Difficulties in reliably inducing reactive aggression in the MRI environment.

- **Activated brain regions**: Existing studies revealed an array of activated brain regions, which have been interpreted in various ways based on:
	- A priori hypotheses
	- The particular paradigm used
	- Specific functional deficits of the included clinical group
	- **Task demands**: Different task demands have not been fully addressed in this review, which may also explain various activation patterns.

- **Aggression measurement**: Although we focused on studies where aggression is explicitly measured, the heterogeneity and variation in the symptomatology of clinical phenotypes need consideration. This is in addition to the correlational nature of the presented brain imaging results.

### Coming from behind to win — a qualitative research about psychological conditions of adolescents who have undergone open-heart surgery for single ventricle between the ages 0–5 [^1149raSv]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

We believe that the theme of "being strong and resistive" that emerged from our data could best be explained by some psychological defense mechanisms. We came to the conclusion that three psychological mechanisms, namely repression, compensation, and reaction formation, were being used. According to the Freudian psychoanalytical theory, defense mechanisms are subconscious processes restored to sustain one's self-image and cope with the disturbing realities of the external world. The main objective is to avoid anxiety.

Defense mechanisms do not always indicate the presence of a psychopathological problem. Healthy people also form different defense mechanisms; according to Anna Freud, every individual has a repertory specific to his/her own self. Only if these are continually disruptive to psychological functionality can they be identified as being pathological. According to Vaillant, defense mechanisms are divided into four main groups: pathological, immature, neurotic, and mature. We can look closely at the three mechanisms we have observed in our study from this point of view.

### Defense styles in intermittent explosive disorder [^115eaQaS]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

The overreliance on immature and/or neurotic defense mechanisms, as opposed to more mature defensive functioning, has been linked to several psychiatric disorders. However, at the time of writing, the role of defense styles among individuals with intermittent explosive disorder (IED) has not been examined. Given that individuals with IED display difficulties controlling their anger and aggression, one might expect these individuals to exhibit more immature and less mature defense styles.

The study compared participants with IED to a personality disorder (PD) comparison group, as well as to healthy volunteers (HV), using the Defense Style Questionnaire, a self-report measure that assesses the extent to which individuals endorse using mature, immature, and neurotic defense styles. Subjects with IED had significantly higher scores than both comparison groups on immature defense styles and exhibited lower scores on mature defense mechanisms. Hierarchical regression of significant defense style subscales showed that higher levels of acting out and lower levels of sublimation uniquely discriminated participants with IED from the PD and HV comparison groups.

### Predicting emotional distress, based on acquisition, extinction, avoidance, and generalization learning [^114k5hHN]. Depression and Anxiety (2024). Low credibility.

In the field of psychopathology, a key question is why certain individuals develop enduring emotional problems following stressful life events while others do not. The diathesis-stress model offers a framework for understanding the complex interplay between individual vulnerability factors (i.e. diatheses) and external stressors, such as adverse life events. These vulnerability factors, which can be biological or psychological in nature, may predispose individuals to be more susceptible to developing complaints in response to the adverse effects of stress.

Over the past century, learning processes have increasingly come into focus as potential influential diatheses or vulnerability factors, specifically in the development of anxiety problems. Individual differences in learning may determine how individuals cope with stressful events. Understanding learning processes in anxiety can be achieved by building upon a fundamental learning mechanism — fear acquisition.

### Greater tactile sensitivity and less use of immature psychological defense mechanisms predict women's penile-vaginal intercourse orgasm [^111boNxT]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Previous research has suggested that diminished tactile sensitivity might be associated with reduced sexual activity and function. Research has also demonstrated significant physiological and psychological differences between sexual behaviors, including immature psychological defense mechanisms impairing specifically women's orgasm from penile-vaginal intercourse (PVI).

- **Aims**: To examine the extent to which orgasm triggered by PVI (distinguished from other sexual activities) is associated with both greater tactile sensitivity and lesser use of immature psychological defenses.

- **Methods**: Seventy French-Canadian female university students (aged 18–30) had their finger sensitivity measured with von Frey type microfilaments, completed the Defense Style Questionnaire and a short form of the Marlowe-Crowne social desirability scale, and provided details of the 1-month (and ever) frequencies of engaging in, and having an orgasm from, PVI, masturbation, anal intercourse, partner masturbation, and cunnilingus.

- **Main outcome measures**: Logistic and linear regression prediction of orgasm triggered by PVI from tactile sensitivity, age, social desirability responding, and immature psychological defenses.

- **Results**: Having a PVI orgasm in the past month was associated with greater tactile sensitivity (odds ratio = 4.0 for each filament point) and less use of immature defense mechanisms (odds ratio = 5.1 for each scale point). Lifetime PVI orgasm was associated only with less use of immature defense mechanisms (and lower social desirability).

### Coping strategies and associated symptom burden among patients with advanced cancer [^114ZqSus]. The Oncologist (2024). Low credibility.

The term coping is a broad concept used to describe a wide variety of cognitive and behavioral strategies to manage situations or emotions that are either internally or externally overwhelming. Several coping strategies and classification systems have been proposed to better understand and categorize how people cope with stressful situations; however, no consensus has been agreed upon.

Forerunners in distinguishing these strategies, Folkman and Lazarus, classified coping into four groups: problem-focused, emotion-focused, support-seeking, and meaning-making. Various coping strategies can further be identified as either healthy (positive, adaptive, or constructive, approach-oriented, or engaged), resulting in reduced distress, or unhealthy (negative, maladaptive, disengaged, or avoidant). As more research has been conducted, some academics have questioned the psychometric validity of the categorization of coping mechanisms, noting that people's responses to stress are often complex and multidimensional. Investigators also reported that people adopted various coping strategies, often using several strategies simultaneously, and noted a high likelihood of changing strategies over time. In addition, the complexities of coping, and its effectiveness, are likely to be influenced by an individual's unique personality as well as their social environment.

Unfortunately, research on coping strategies among patients with advanced cancer is limited. One study of female patients with breast cancer found their coping capacity to be a predictor of the degree to which they could manage their illness.

### Defensive coping and health-related quality of life in chronic kidney disease: a cross-sectional study [^117HrCMS]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Defensive coping was assessed by the Rationality/Emotional Defensiveness (R/ED) scale of the Lifestyle Defense Mechanism Inventory (LDMI). The R/ED scale consists of 12 items, assessing individual differences in the frequency that a person engages in rational, non-emotional thought processes and behaviors (e.g. "I try to understand other people even if I do not like them"; "I try to do what is sensible and logical"). Rating is based on a 4-point frequency scale, ranging from (1) "almost never" to (4) "almost always". Items are summed to give a range of 12 to 48, where 48 indicates excessive use of unconscious defensiveness (i.e. repression and denial). For its development, the Rationality/Anti-emotionality questionnaire was used, which proved to be a reliable predictor of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Both the R/ED scale alone and the LDMI in total have been administered to several populations and cultures and found to possess satisfactory psychometric properties. The Greek version of R/ED was developed according to the recommended forward and backward translation procedure. As this was the first time that the R/ED was used in a Greek patient population, reliability analysis was performed for this sample. Internal consistency was found satisfactory, with a Cronbach's alpha value being 0.76.

The 13-item depression scale and the 10-item anxiety scale of the revised Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) were used to measure psychological symptom status with a time reference of the past 7 days.

### The relationships among positive coping style, psychological resilience, and fear of falling in older adults [^1111kXpz]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Psychological resilience is a powerful trait that enables effective adaptation to stress, adversity, and setbacks. It serves as a protective factor for human well-being. Influenced by both cognitive and behavioral factors, psychological resilience is evoked by positive cognitive appraisals and is quantifiable as an indicator of one's stress coping capacity. Studies on stress-related mental health issues have identified psychological resilience as a mediator in stress management. For instance, during the pandemic, Park et al. observed reduced distress levels and restored well-being among U.S. residents compared to the initial lockdown phase, highlighting the adaptive role of psychological resilience. Among older adults, higher levels of psychological resilience have been associated with attenuated fall-related anxiety and depression. However, the correlation between psychological resilience and fear of falling (FOF) has not been extensively explored.

The mediational role of psychological resilience in our model is supported by the stress-coping model and empirical evidence from various fields. Resilience theory posits that individuals can exhibit differential responses to stressors, with resilient individuals demonstrating more adaptive coping strategies. This concept has been supported by numerous studies showing that resilience buffers against the negative effects of stress on mental health. In the context of falls, resilience may moderate the relationship between positive coping styles and FOF by enhancing the individual's capacity to cope with the emotional and physical consequences of falling.

### The relationship between affective temperaments, defensive styles and depressive symptoms in a large sample [^111UTBzC]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Affective temperaments may represent heritable subclinical manifestations of mood disorders. The concept of ego defense mechanisms also provides a model for the comprehension of mood psychopathology. The relationships between affective temperaments, defense styles, and depressive symptoms remain unknown. We obtained data from a subsample of the Brazilian Internet Study on Temperament and Psychopathology (BRAINSTEP). Socio-demographic information was collected, and participants completed the Affective and Emotional Temperament Composite Scale (AFECTS), the defense style questionnaire (DSQ-40), and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R).

Among 9,937 participants (4,472 male; 45%), individuals with hyperthymic or euthymic temperaments were more likely to present a mature defense style, whereas an immature defensive style was predominantly observed in individuals with cyclothymic, volatile, depressive, dysphoric, euphoric, and disinhibited temperaments. Higher immature and lower mature defense style scores were independently associated with depressive symptoms. Participants with either euthymic or hyperthymic temperaments were less likely to endorse depressive symptoms. Euthymic and hyperthymic temperaments moderated the correlations of mature/immature defenses with depressive symptoms.

The data was collected from a convenience web-based sample, and the study was cross-sectional. Affective temperaments are associated with distinct defense styles. These two personality theories provide distinct but interacting views.

### The neuroimmune response during stress: A physiological perspective [^111ypNrx]. Immunity (2021). Low credibility.

Stress is an essential adaptive response that enables the organism to cope with challenges and restore homeostasis. Different stressors require distinctive corrective responses in which immune cells play a critical role; hence, the effects of stress on immunity may vary accordingly. Epidemiologically, stress can induce either inflammation or immune suppression in an organism. However, in the absence of a conceptual framework, these effects appear chaotic, leading to confusion. Here, we examine how stressor diversity is embedded in the neuroimmune axis. Stressors differ in the brain patterns they induce, diversifying the neuronal and endocrine mediators dispatched to the periphery and generating a wide range of potential immune effects. Uncovering this complexity and diversity of the immune response to different stressors will allow us to understand the involvement of stress in pathological conditions, identify ways to modulate it, and even harness the therapeutic potential embedded in an adaptive response to stress.

### Change in defense mechanisms during long-term dynamic psychotherapy and five-year outcome [^114U4VgA]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Research suggests that defense mechanisms may underlie other aspects of functioning and psychiatric symptoms. The authors examined whether defenses change in accordance with the hierarchy of defense adaptation during long-term dynamic psychotherapy and whether such change is associated with long-term outcomes on other measures.

Twenty-one adults with depressive, anxiety, and/or personality disorders entered long-term dynamic psychotherapy (mean = 248 weeks) and subsequent follow-along (mean duration, 5.1 years). Measures of functioning and symptoms were gathered in periodic follow-along interviews, external to the therapy. A median of eight psychotherapy sessions over 2.5 years for each participant were rated using the Defense Mechanism Rating Scales quantitative method.

Overall, the lowest (action) and highest (high adaptive) defense levels in the hierarchy of defenses improved significantly, as did overall defensive functioning (median effect size = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.01–1.83). Overall defensive functioning still remained below the healthy-neurotic range. A higher number of Axis I disorders and childhood histories of sexual abuse and witnessing violence were associated with a slower rate of improvement in defenses. Change in defenses within therapy by 2.5 years was highly associated with significant levels of change at 5 years in external measures of both functioning (rs = 0.60) and symptoms (rs = 0.58), controlling for initial levels.

Change in defensive functioning in long-term psychotherapy largely follows the hierarchy of defense adaptation.
