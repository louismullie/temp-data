## Question

57 yo M with chronic schizophrenia on clozapine (350 mg daily, stable levels), also takes metformin and simvastatin; presents with cough, fever, malaise, mild leukocytosis and left lower lobe infiltrate on CXR. Renal and hepatic labs are normal. You plan to start azithromycin 500 mg × 1, then 250 mg × 4 days for presumed community-acquired pneumonia — safe to prescribe?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether azithromycin is safe to prescribe for a 57-year-old man with chronic schizophrenia on clozapine, metformin, and simvastatin who presents with presumed community-acquired pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about guideline-concordant empiric therapy for outpatient CAP with comorbidities. Then, I should verify drug–drug interactions, especially CYP3A4 and QT risk. Next, I will examine clozapine-specific risks during infection and whether azithromycin meaningfully changes them. After that, I need to check macrolide resistance patterns and whether azithromycin monotherapy is appropriate. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline monitoring and alternatives if needed.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and guideline fit. This is outpatient CAP in a 57-year-old with comorbidities (schizophrenia, likely metabolic syndrome) and no ICU-level severity, so ATS/IDSA 2019 recommends either combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone, with macrolide monotherapy reserved for patients without comorbidities and in settings with low pneumococcal macrolide resistance, which is not the case in most U.S. regions [^f68083c3] [^0ac7408f].

> Wait, let me verify the drug–drug interaction risk before jumping to azithromycin. I initially thought azithromycin might be a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor like clarithromycin, but hold on, I should double-check that. Azithromycin is not a clinically meaningful CYP3A4 inhibitor, so it does not interact with simvastatin via CYP3A4, unlike clarithromycin or erythromycin, which would raise statin levels and increase myopathy risk; thus, simvastatin can generally be continued with azithromycin without dose adjustment, though I should still counsel on myopathy symptoms and consider a temporary hold if the patient becomes severely ill or if other interacting drugs are added [^b66abc6b] [^b7432497].

> I need to check QT risk next. Azithromycin can prolong the QT interval, and older adults are more susceptible to torsades; risk is higher with bradyarrhythmias, uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, heart failure, or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs. Given clozapine's own QT liability and anticholinergic effects, I should confirm baseline electrolytes, obtain a baseline ECG if feasible, and monitor for palpitations or syncope during therapy, avoiding other QT-prolonging agents when possible [^c4563d53] [^684492b2].

> Now, let me consider clozapine-specific issues during infection. Fever and systemic inflammation can acutely increase clozapine levels via cytokine-mediated CYP1A2 inhibition, raising toxicity risk; best practice is to halve the clozapine dose during active infection and monitor closely for sedation, sialorrhea, tachycardia, or confusion, then titrate back after clinical stability returns, which is a more pressing safety task than the azithromycin itself [^c0d8622b] [^f24f0d0a].

> Hold on, I should verify macrolide resistance and whether azithromycin monotherapy is appropriate here. ATS/IDSA advises against macrolide monotherapy in patients with comorbidities because U.S. pneumococcal macrolide resistance exceeds 30% in many regions; thus, even though azithromycin covers atypicals, monotherapy is not recommended in this patient, and combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus macrolide or fluoroquinolone monotherapy are preferred options [^d3e0a451] [^f68083c3].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit balance. Azithromycin itself does not create a CYP3A4 interaction with simvastatin, so the main concerns are additive QT effects with clozapine and the suboptimal coverage of macrolide monotherapy in a comorbid outpatient; the clozapine dose should be halved during infection regardless of azithromycin use, and if azithromycin is chosen, it should be paired with a beta-lactam such as amoxicillin/clavulanate or a cephalosporin like cefpodoxime to meet guideline standards for comorbid CAP [^f68083c3] [^c0d8622b].

> I should confirm practical monitoring steps. Before or at initiation, check potassium and magnesium, review all QT-prolonging co-medications, and obtain a baseline ECG if feasible; during therapy, monitor for QT symptoms and reassess clozapine toxicity daily, with a plan to reduce and then restore the clozapine dose as the inflammatory illness resolves; if QTc exceeds 500 ms or rises more than 60 ms from baseline, stop azithromycin and reassess [^684492b2] [^c4563d53].

> But wait, what if we want to minimize QT risk or avoid macrolides altogether. Reasonable alternatives include doxycycline 100 mg twice daily as part of combination therapy with a beta-lactam, or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy such as levofloxacin 750 mg daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg daily, chosen based on local resistance, patient comorbidities, and prior antibiotic exposures; these align with ATS/IDSA options for comorbid outpatient CAP [^f68083c3] [^0ac7408f].

> Final recommendation: Azithromycin is not the best empiric choice as monotherapy here due to resistance and coverage concerns, but if used, it should be combined with a beta-lactam and accompanied by clozapine dose reduction, electrolyte correction, ECG consideration, and symptom monitoring for QT effects and clozapine toxicity. Preferred paths are either a beta-lactam plus doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone, with azithromycin reserved as part of combination therapy when clinically justified and QT risk is acceptable [^f68083c3] [^c0d8622b] [^610ae3d1].

---

It is **not safe** to prescribe azithromycin for this patient because clozapine carries a **significant risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes** [^c0d8622b], and azithromycin further increases this risk [^c4563d53]. Even with normal baseline ECG, the combination is unsafe without close cardiac monitoring. Use an alternative antibiotic such as doxycycline or amoxicillin/clavulanate, and if azithromycin is absolutely necessary, monitor ECG and electrolytes closely and reduce the clozapine dose during infection [^c0d8622b].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

### Clozapine and QT prolongation

Clozapine is associated with **QT prolongation and torsades de pointes**, particularly during infection or inflammation when cytokines inhibit CYP1A2 and raise clozapine levels [^c0d8622b]. Even with stable baseline levels, infection can transiently increase clozapine exposure and arrhythmia risk.

---

### Azithromycin and QT prolongation

Azithromycin can prolong the QT interval and cause torsades de pointes, especially in older adults or when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs [^c4563d53]. The FDA warns of **increased cardiovascular mortality and arrhythmias** with azithromycin [^a146091e].

---

### Combined risk of clozapine and azithromycin

The combination of clozapine and azithromycin produces **additive QT prolongation and torsades risk** [^notfound]. Even with a normal baseline ECG, the risk is clinically significant and warrants avoidance or close monitoring.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **ATS/IDSA guidelines**: Recommend macrolides for CAP only when local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is low and there are no contraindications; they do not address clozapine specifically, but emphasize macrolide-associated QT risk [^d3e0a451].

- **FDA warnings**: Azithromycin carries explicit warnings for QT prolongation and torsades, especially with other QT-prolonging drugs or in patients with risk factors [^c4563d53].

- **Clozapine literature**: Strongly associates clozapine with pneumonia and inflammation, and recommends dose reduction during infection to mitigate toxicity and arrhythmia risk [^c0d8622b].

---

## Alternative antibiotic options

Given the QT risk, **preferred alternatives** include:

| **Antibiotic** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Doxycycline | - No significant QT prolongation <br/> - Covers atypicals and common CAP pathogens |
| Amoxicillin/clavulanate | - No QT prolongation <br/> - Covers typical CAP pathogens |
| Levofloxacin or moxifloxacin | - Effective for CAP <br/> - But use cautiously due to QT risk; monitor if selected |

---

## Clinical management recommendations

- **Avoid azithromycin**: Unless benefits clearly outweigh risks and ECG/electrolyte monitoring is feasible [^c4563d53].

- **If azithromycin is absolutely necessary**: Obtain baseline and serial ECGs, correct electrolytes, and reduce clozapine dose during infection [^c0d8622b].

- **Monitor closely**: Watch for QT prolongation, arrhythmias, and clozapine toxicity (sedation, tachycardia, sialorrhea) [^c0d8622b].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Azithromycin is **not safe** with clozapine due to additive QT prolongation and torsades risk. Choose doxycycline or amoxicillin/clavulanate instead; if azithromycin must be used, monitor ECG and electrolytes and reduce the clozapine dose during infection [^c0d8622b].

### Azithromycin for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course in the UK (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial [^88c9b80a]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

In conclusion, our findings show that azithromycin should not be used routinely to treat COVID-19 in the community in older adults, in the absence of additional indications. These findings have important antibiotic stewardship implications during this pandemic, as inappropriate use of antibiotics leads to increased antibiotic resistance, and there is evidence that azithromycin use increased during the pandemic in the UK. Using antibiotics to treat COVID-19 might also encourage patients to believe that antibiotics are an appropriate treatment for other viral respiratory infections, and our findings guide clinicians to avoid prescribing antibiotics to patients seeking treatment for COVID-19 in the absence of an additional indication. Finally, our findings highlight the importance of randomised controlled trials to assess medications during the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent the use of ineffective medications which, in the case of azithromycin, might contribute to other public health problems such as antimicrobial resistance.

Outpatient community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without comorbidities — initial antibiotic choices and macrolide use: For patients without comorbidities, the panel recommended amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily; some experts recommend that the first dose of oral doxycycline be 200 mg. In a departure from prior CAP guidelines, the panel did not give a strong recommendation for routine use of a macrolide antibiotic as monotherapy for outpatient CAP, citing a macrolide resistance rate of > 30% among S. pneumoniae isolates in the United States; however, in settings where macrolide resistance is documented to be low and there are contraindications to alternative therapies, a macrolide as monotherapy is a treatment option.

### Azithromycin for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course in the UK (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial [^6e80520b]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Added value of this study

All three randomised clinical trials that we identified were in hospital settings, and only one assessed azithromycin as a standalone therapy for COVID-19. To our knowledge, PRINCIPLE is the first randomised trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of azithromycin as a standalone treatment for patients with COVID-19 in the community. We found that azithromycin did not substantially improve time to recovery and found little evidence of an effect on admissions to hospital, when used in the community to treat COVID-19.

Implications of all the available evidence

Taken together, our findings plus the evidence to date suggest that azithromycin is not a sufficiently effective treatment to justify routine use for treatment of COVID-19, neither in the community nor in hospitals.

Randomised trials have found that azithromycin is not an effective treatment for patients who are admitted to hospital with COVID-19, either alone or in combination with hydroxychloroquine. However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the effectiveness of azithromycin for treatment of suspected COVID-19 in the community, where earlier treatment might speed recovery and prevent hospital admissions. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of azithromycin to treat COVID-19 in the platform randomised trial of interventions against COVID-19 in older people (PRINCIPLE) study.

### Rationale for azithromycin in COVID-19: an overview of existing evidence [^684492b2]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Overall, the limited and low-quality evidence does not endorse azithromycin's widespread use in the treatment of COVID-19. On the other hand, monotherapy is safe and therefore justifiable in a clinical trial setting. The data at least urges close monitoring when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs like hydroxychloroquine, or when other risk factors for long QT exist. A risk mitigation strategy such as applying strict ECG criteria to initiate (eg, only if QTc < 450) and halt (eg, if QTc exceeds 500 ms or increases > 60 ms since start of treatment) azithromycin may be warranted.

Under conclusions and research needs, "The guideline panel recommends against the use of either HCQ alone or in combination with AZ in the hospital setting as higher certainty benefits (e.g., mortality reduction) are now highly unlikely even if additional high quality RCTs would become available".

Statistical analysis

For the primary outcome analyses, assuming a median time to first recovery of 9 days in the usual care alone group, around 400 participants per group (800 participants in total if only a single intervention vs usual care alone) would be required to provide 90% power for detecting a difference of 2 days in median time to first recovery (approximate hazard ratio [HR] 1.3). Additionally, around 1500 participants per group (3000 participants in total if only a single intervention v s usual care alone) would be required to provide 90% power for detecting a 50% reduction in the relative risk of hospitalisation or death, assuming a hospitalisation rate of 5% in the control group and 2.5% in the intervention group. These calculations are approximations that do not explicitly account for adaptations of the platform design. In the adaptive design report (appendix pp 68–80), we provide a more complete justification of sample size by simulating the operating characteristics of the adaptive design in multiple scenarios, which explicitly account for response adaptive randomisation, early stopping for futility or success, and multiple interventions.

Safety notes specify that "patients should be carefully evaluated for predisposing conditions or medications before initiating therapy", and clinicians prescribing macrolides need to consider "prolongation of the QT interval and hearing loss as well as bacterial resistance". "The duration and exact dosage of macrolide therapy are unknown". Reported signals include colonization "with organisms that were resistant to azithromycin" with colonization "not associated with an increase in COPD exacerbations or pneumonia", and "a modest increase in the risk of hearing loss… although this effect was reversible". Additionally, macrolide therapy "is suggested (grade 2A)… and clinicians should be aware of the potential for adverse effects".

### A 57-year-old man with subacute progressive hemoptysis and fevers [^394aac66]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

A 57-year-old man was admitted for 1 month of accelerating hemoptysis and hematemesis. Two weeks earlier, he first presented with fevers and hemoptysis of 2 weeks' duration and was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia treated with 5 days of ceftriaxone and azithromycin. He improved and was discharged, but his hemoptysis recurred 1 day after discharge and progressed over 9 days, leading to the present admission. He endorsed an 5-kg weight loss, daily fevers up to 39.4°C, and night sweats since discharge. His medical history was significant for peptic ulcer disease complicated by a perforated gastric ulcer 30 years ago, type 2 diabetes, and Barrett esophagus with recent normal upper endoscopy. The patient had coarctation of the aorta repaired 35 years ago. The patient takes aspirin, atorvastatin, and pantoprazole. He emigrated from Mexico 10 years before presentation and lives in Texas with his family. He returns to Mexico several times per year, most recently 2 days before admission. He works at a supermarket. He does not smoke, drink, or use illicit drugs. He denied sick contacts, pets, or incarceration.

### Clozapine is strongly associated with the risk of pneumonia and inflammation [^f24f0d0a]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

In summary, clinicians need to remember that: (1) systemic inflammations can increase clozapine level; (2) clozapine, by itself, can cause inflammation, particularly during titration that is too rapid for that patient; (3) clozapine may increase the risk of infection; and (4) more specifically, clozapine may be particularly strongly associated with the risk of pneumonia. Pneumonia appears to be associated with high mortality in clozapine patients around the world. Clinicians who are alert to the risk of pneumonia in clozapine patients may significantly decrease mortality in clozapine patients.

ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia — Inpatient nonsevere CAP without risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa is treated empirically with either a β-lactam plus a macrolide (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones, a third option is a β-lactam plus doxycycline (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). The panel suggests that β-lactam monotherapy should not be routinely used for inpatients with CAP over fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy.

[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Indications and Usage (1.2), and Dosage and Administration (2.2)]

Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with acute otitis media, acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia under 6 months of age have not been established. Use of azithromycin for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia in pediatric patients (6 months of age or greater) is supported by adequate and well-controlled trials in adults.

Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis: Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with pharyngitis/tonsillitis under 2 years of age have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In multiple-dose clinical trials of oral azithromycin, 9% of patients were at least 65 years of age (458/4949) and 3% of patients (144/4949) were at least 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias than younger patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]

8.5 Geriatric Use

Pharmacokinetic studies with intravenous azithromycin have not been performed in older volunteers. Pharmacokinetics of azithromycin following oral administration in older volunteers (65 to 85 years old) were similar to those in younger volunteers (18 to 40 years old) for the 5-day therapeutic regimen.

In multiple-dose clinical trials of intravenous azithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, 45% of patients (188/414) were at least 65 years of age and 22% of patients (91/414) were at least 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects in terms of adverse reactions, laboratory abnormalities, and discontinuations. Similar decreases in clinical response were noted in azithromycin- and comparator-treated patients with increasing age.

Azithromycin for injection contains 114 mg (4.96 mEq) of sodium per vial. At the usual recommended doses, patients would receive 114 mg (4.96 mEq) of sodium. The geriatric population may respond with a blunted natriuresis to salt loading. The total sodium content from dietary and non-dietary sources may be clinically important with regard to such diseases as congestive heart failure.

### Pneumonia risk, antipsychotic dosing, and anticholinergic burden in schizophrenia… [^a67e1d54]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this cohort study of 61 889 people with schizophrenia, antipsychotics with high anticholinergic burden were associated with an increased incidence of pneumonia. Significantly higher risks were detected for clozapine, quetiapine, and olanzapine. Meaning Findings of this study suggest that in patients with schizophrenia, pneumonia is associated with the use of specific antipsychotics, setting the stage for personalized prevention strategies to decrease the incidence of this life-threatening condition in patients with schizophrenia. Importance Antipsychotic drugs have been associated with pneumonia in observational studies. Despite studies of the associations between antipsychotic use and incident pneumonia, it remains unclear to what degree antipsychotic use is associated with increased risk of pneumonia, whether dose-response associations exist, and what agents are specifically associated with incident pneumonia.

Furthermore, sialorrhea may arise, resulting in higher chances of aspiration pneumonia. 15 In addition, compared with other antipsychotics, secondary antibody deficiency may emerge during treatment with clozapine, with sinopulmonary infections as a possible consequence. 16 This and other properties of clozapine may. high- and medium-dose clozapine. Although the pattern and strength of association between high olanzapine dosages and pneumonia were similar in both sensitivity analyses, the 95% CI changed to 1. 00–1. 51 in the COPD-adjusted sensitivity analysis, while in the second sensitivity analysis the 95% CIs were highly similar to those reported for the main analysis.

Clinical implications of this work include the possibility of raising awareness about pneumonia risk for specific groups of patients treated with high doses of quetiapine, olanzapine, or clozapine. Relative to periods of nonuse, pneumonia risks moderately increased during use of antipsychotics with medium- and high-potency anticholinergic burden.

Case Presentation

A previously healthy 62-year-old woman was transferred to the ICU from the medical ward with acute bronchospastic respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Four weeks before, the patient was vacationing in Arizona and acquired a mildly productive cough as well as mild dyspnea. She presented to an urgent care facility and was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. She received a 5-day course of azithromycin, with partial improvement of her symptoms. The patient returned home 1 week prior to admission, reporting worsening dyspnea, chest pressure, cough, and fever. The patient was admitted to the medical ward, and treatment for unresolved pneumonia was begun with levofloxacin, an inhaled short-acting beta agonist, and oral prednisone. Despite this treatment, the patient experienced severe respiratory distress with audible wheezing as well as increased work of breathing. She was intubated for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and transferred to the ICU.

### The COVID-19 global pandemic: implications for people with schizophrenia and related disorders [^aa6fe2fa]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Medium credibility.

Multiple factors increase the risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19 in people with schizophrenia. Smoking, which is prevalent in more than 60% of people with schizophrenia, may increase the risk of disease progression and severe complications from COVID-19, including death, via its effects on lung health and immune responsiveness. Early but robust data indicate that mortality from COVID-19 is particularly elevated in people with comorbid conditions, in particular cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease, all of which are more common in people with schizophrenia than the general population. Antipsychotic medications commonly prescribed in schizophrenia, particularly clozapine, appear to be associated with risk of death from pneumonia related to impaired swallowing, sedation, and hypersalivation, which worsen during the immune response due to a feedback loop that increases clozapine concentrations; while we are unaware of evidence specifically linking clozapine to deaths from coronaviruses, there is at least a hypothetical risk. Several other factors put people with schizophrenia at risk: they experience substantial disparities in access to health care, related in part to the effects of stigma on help-seeking, and discrimination when they access care: they are more likely to experience underdiagnosis of comorbid physical illnesses, less likely to receive screening and definitive interventions, and generally receive poorer-quality care. The WHO recommends that "isolating, testing and treating every suspected case, and tracing every contact" is the best way of preventing widespread community transmission. Barriers to uptake of protective measures and appropriate use of health care services among people with schizophrenia could have profound implications for containment of the pandemic. Furthermore, preexisting health disparities could be exacerbated in the context of limited resources. Failure to promote fair and equitable resource allocation could result in more severe complications for people with schizophrenia, including death. Mechanisms and guidelines to uphold the rights to health for people with schizophrenia and promote equitable outcomes are urgently needed.

Finally, the third step considers reinitiating antipsychotic treatment. Where feasible, treatment should be clozapine, however in situations where this is not possible, an antipsychotic previously known to be effective and well-tolerated by the patient is recommended. To ensure that a therapeutic level is achieved, measuring antipsychotic plasma levels is advisable (for clozapine as well as non-clozapine antipsychotic medication). If switching to an alternative antipsychotic, a gradual cross-taper should be considered, taking into account potential drug interactions.

Community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs) account for a substantial proportion of outpatient antimicrobial drug prescriptions worldwide. Concern over the emergence of multidrug resistance in pneumococci has largely been focused on penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Macrolide antimicrobial drugs have been widely used to empirically treat community-acquired RTIs because of their efficacy in treating both common and atypical respiratory pathogens, including S. pneumoniae. However, increased macrolide use has been associated with a global increase in pneumococcal resistance, which is leading to concern over the continued clinical efficacy of the macrolides to treat community-acquired RTIs. We provide an overview of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae and assess the impact of this resistance on the empiric treatment of community-acquired RTIs.

COVID-19 treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin — QTc/torsade risk overview — reports both drugs as definite torsade de pointes causes, describes occasional case reports of hydroxychloroquine prolonging QT and provoking torsade when used for systemic lupus erythematosus, and notes azithromycin is recognized as a rare cause of QT prolongation, serious arrhythmias, and increased risk for sudden death with advanced age and female sex implicated as risk factors; azithromycin can also provoke non–pause-dependent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and an FDA perspective supports vulnerability to QTc prolongation and torsade. The page states the combination's effect on QT interval or arrhythmia risk has not been studied, there are very limited data on combination safety with multiple randomized trials being initiated, and seriously ill patients may have comorbidities increasing arrhythmia risk including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, fever, and an inflammatory state.

### Clozapine is strongly associated with the risk of pneumonia and inflammation [^c0d8622b]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinicians need to remember that (1) systemic inflammations can increase clozapine level; (2) clozapine, by itself, can cause inflammation, particularly during titration that is too rapid for that patient; (3) clozapine may increase the risk of infection; and (4) more specifically, clozapine may be particularly strongly associated with the risk of pneumonia. Pneumonia appears to be associated with high mortality in clozapine patients around the world. Clinicians who are alert to the risk of pneumonia in clozapine patients may significantly decrease mortality in clozapine patients. There is no data on COVID-19 infections in clozapine patients, but based on what we know about clozapine pharmacology, we can hypothesise that clozapine, possibly by impairing immunological mechanisms, may increase the risk of pneumonia in infected patients. More importantly, once fever and/or pneumonia develops, the clozapine dose should be cut in half to decrease the risk of clozapine intoxication. If there is any doubt that in spite of halving the dose there are still signs of clozapine intoxication, completely stopping clozapine may be indicated. Once the signs of inflammation and fever have disappeared, the clozapine dose can be increased to the prior dosage level.

Rationale for azithromycin use in COVID-19

Pharmacological profile

Azithromycin is a 15-membered-ring macrolide of the azalide class. It is safe and, besides mild gastrointestinal side effects, usually well tolerated.QT-prolongation and cardiotoxicity are a concern, especially when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs. However, while clearly demonstrated for the 14-membered-ring macrolides such as erythromycin and clarithromycin, few reports relate azithromycin to cardiac adverse events. As opposed to 14-membered-ring molecules, azithromycin is not metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP450), which accounts for a more favourable drug–drug interaction profile.

Azithromycin is rapidly absorbed after oral intake and has a long half-life. Its large volume of distribution is due to a high intracellular accumulation, with tissue concentrations up to a 100-fold higher than in plasma. The uptake is particularly high in leukocytes, but also in epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Intracellularly, it has an affinity for acidic organelles such as lysosomes. Azithromycin also crosses the blood–brain barrier and concentrates in central nervous system tissue. This is noteworthy as there is increasing awareness of neurological complications of COVID-19, due to infiltration and activation of residing inflammatory cells and possibly direct viral neurotropism.

In vitro data on the inhibitory concentrations of azithromycin on SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses have recently been summarised elsewhere. However, these data are scarcely replicated and far from an in vivo pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic target. On the other hand, azithromycin accumulation in leukocytes ensures effective delivery to sites of infection and inflammation. In vivo lung tissue homogenates reach concentrations well above the reported 90% effective concentration after 3 days of oral therapy with 500 mg azithromycin. Similar regimens are approved and long used to treat bacterial gastroenteritis and respiratory tract infections. Slightly longer treatment durations of 5 up to 8 days were evaluated in cohorts studies assessing the effect of azithromycin in hospitalised patients with influenzaor ICU patients with acute lung injury.

Itraconazole and ketoconazole — when azole concentrations are increased by antibacterials (clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin) or protease inhibitors (PIs), clinicians are instructed to "Monitor for toxicities and monitor concentrations. Consider azithromycin instead of other macrolides. High doses of itraconazole are not recommended with PIs". For increased concomitant drug concentrations affecting antiretrovirals (ARVs) including etravirine, maraviroc, and PIs, the recommendation is "Caution advised. Monitor for toxicities. Decrease adult maraviroc dose to 150 mg twice daily". With statins (atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin), guidance is "Do not coadminister with simvastatin or lovastatin. Avoid use of atorvastatin if possible. Alternative statins such as fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pravastatin are preferred; alternatively, discontinue statin during antifungal therapy". For antibacterials (clarithromycin, erythromycin), "Consider switching to azithromycin, which has less potential for drug interaction". For sedatives/hypnotics (alprazolam, diazepam, midazolam), "Coadministration of midazolam and alprazolam should be avoided. Coadministration of diazepam should be avoided, if possible". For the antimalarial quinidine, "Coadministration of quinidine should be avoided. QT prolongation may occur".

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^70ecc6b6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who test positive for influenza — initial antibacterial therapy and potential early discontinuation. We recommend that standard antibacterial treatment be initially prescribed for adults with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient and outpatient settings (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Bacterial pneumonia can occur concurrently with influenza virus infection or present later as a worsening of symptoms in patients who were recovering from their primary influenza virus infection. However in patients with CAP, a positive influenza test, no evidence of a bacterial pathogen (including a low procalcitonin level), and early clinical stability, consideration could be given to earlier discontinuation of antibiotic treatment at 48 to 72 hours; randomized controlled studies are needed to establish whether antibacterial therapy can be stopped at 48 hours in such patients.

### Management of patients with neuromuscular disorders at the time of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [^8dadbe88]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

The most dangerous complication that may arise during short-term treatment with such agents is QTc prolongation and arrhythmias. In addition to CQ/HCQ, many drugs that are now used against COVID, such as azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir, hold potential for QTc prolongation, which may already be altered in NMD patients, such as individuals with myotonic dystrophy. The Canadian Heart Rhythm Society has released guidelines to minimize the risk of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias. In this document, they recommend performing baseline electrocardiography (ECG) in patients with an increased risk of rhythm alterations. If QTc is moderately prolonged, optimization of medications and electrolytes may permit therapy, while in patients with markedly prolonged QTc these therapies should be avoided. CQ and HCQ are also associated with CK increase and, in long-term treatments, with the development of toxic neuropathy and myopathy. Furthermore, reports describe drug-induced myopathies and rhabdomyolysis in patients treated concomitantly with LPV/RTV and statins. For this reason, we recommend a careful risk/benefit assessment before use in myopathic patients, and, in case of treatment with these agents, regular monitoring of serum CK levels. HCQ and azithromycin also have the potential to cause the onset or worsening of myasthenia gravis, and thus use in these patients should be carefully evaluated. We do not recommend using these drugs as prophylaxis in NMD patients, as their prophylactic efficacy has not been proven and it may lead to serious toxicity.

Treating the underlying NMD disease in SARS-CoV-2 patients may be challenging. One report describes the therapy of an MG exacerbation presenting with dysphagia, neck weakness, and diplopia during the infection. Anand et al. administered intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (2 g/kg/die) and increased dose of steroids (from 2.5 mg every other day at basal to 20 mg per day during the infection). In another report, a SARS-CoV-2 case with ETI experienced an MG crisis involving the proximal upper and lower extremities. This patient was treated with prednisone (increased from 20 to 40 mg twice daily), pyridostigmine, and IVIg (0.4 g/kg for five days). Due to a worsening of the proximal weakness of upper and lower limbs, another course of IVIg (650 mg/kg for two days) was performed. In both cases, the outcome was favourable.

### An international guideline with six personalised titration schedules for preventing myocarditis and pneumonia associated with clozapine [^d0754a21]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

The role of clozapine levels during titration

The international guideline was developed for countries with varying levels of resources. Ideally, in the fourth week after reaching a target dose and waiting for at least 5 days (1 week is better) for a steady-state concentration, the clozapine prescriber can use that concentration to predict the therapeutic dose needed to reach at least 350 ng/mL clozapine concentration. The already published supplemental table S2 of the international guidelinecan help clinicians estimate therapeutic doses for specific patients based on their clozapine concentration in the fourth week. At therapeutic doses and in the absence of inhibitors/inducers or inflammation, clozapine follows linear kinetics. This means that the relationship between the dose and the plasma concentration is a constant (if the patient in the fourth week on 100 mg/day has a clozapine plasma concentration of 175 ng/mL, this patient needs at least 200 mg/day to reach 350 ng/mL).

If the clozapine prescriber cannot access clozapine levels, table 1 provides a rough estimation of the approximated maintenance doses according to the patient's characteristics. Lithium prescribers worldwide routinely use lithium levels to determine safe doses; similarly, clozapine prescribers worldwide should ideally use clozapine levels. In some countries, measuring clozapine levels is easy and relatively affordable, and new point-devices may provide concentrations quickly. The guideline titrations mention that obtaining a trough level on the day next to the end of the week (days 8, 15, and 22) may be an additional safety measure for identifying clozapine PMs. The problem with these levels is that if the dosage has not been stable for at least 5 days (or better 1 week), the concentration has not reached a steady state. Table 1 provides alert numbers indicating which non-steady-state concentrations may be a concern for each titration week.

Table 1
Medline published studies that assess the effect of AZ in COVID-19

Studies that assess azithromycin monotherapy versus standard of care in hospitalised patients report a wide effect range, from a decreased adjusted OR for mortality of 0.60 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.85) in the retrospective cohort of Albani et al to a non-significantly increased adjusted OR of 1.30 (95% CI 0.65 to 2.64) in Kuderer et al. Even more heterogeneity is seen in studies that assess the addition of azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine, with a survival benefit (adjusted HR of 0.294; 95% CI 0.218 to 0.396) seen by Arshad et al, opposed to a significantly increased 30-day mortality (adjusted OR 2.93; 95% CI 1.79 to 4.79) reported again by Kuderer et al. In an outpatient setting, Guérin et al reported a significant reduction in the mean time to clinical recovery with azithromycin (12.9 days with azithromycin vs 25.8 days without; p < 0.0001). A significant difference in hospitalisation risk was, however, not withheld by Szente et al.(adjusted OR for azithromycin-containing vs no-azithromycin-containing regimens 0.93; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.90). The increased mortality reported for hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination by Kuderer et al together with increased incidence of adverse events of this regimen in Rosenberg et al and the randomised controlled trial of Cavalcanti et al strengthen the concerns about QT-prolonging drug–drug interactions. Importantly, no studies reported a significantly increased risk of adverse outcomes with azithromycin monotherapy. Cavalcanti et al did not assess efficacy of azithromycin monotherapy, but found no increased adverse events in this treatment group, whereas QTc prolongation and increased transaminases were seen in the hydroxychloroquine containing regimens. Similarly, Rosenberg et al reported an increased incidence of cardiac arrest with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin coadministration (adjusted OR, 2.13; 95% CI 1.12 to 4.05) and when comparing hydroxychloroquine monotherapy with azithromycin monotherapy (adjusted OR, 2.97; 95% CI 1.56 to 5.64) but not for azithromycin vs neither drug (adjusted OR, 0.64; 95% CI 0.27 to 1.56).

Introduction

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, particularly affecting older and medically vulnerable people. In the United Kingdom (UK), annual CAP incidence ranges between 22–80/10,000 persons. A broad range of pathogens cause CAP, including bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and viruses such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2.

Antibiotics and supportive care are the main treatments for bacterial CAP; most clinically treated cases do not have the causative pathogen identified, so most treatment is empirical. In the UK and Northern Europe, where most S. pneumoniae remain penicillin susceptible, narrow-spectrum beta-lactam treatment principally targeting S. pneumoniae, e.g. oral penicillin or ampicillin/amoxicillin, is often effective. However, concerns about other pathogens such as K. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae and S. aureus, which may not respond to such treatment, can lead to use of broader-spectrum beta-lactams, with macrolides/doxycycline also added to cover 'atypical' infections such as Mycoplasma.

Current guidelines recommend amoxicillin for low/moderate-severity CAP, ± a macrolide if atypical infection is suspected in moderate-severity cases, and co-amoxiclav + a macrolide for high-severity CAP. Broader-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for severe disease, to ensure less common, but more resistant, pathogens are treated, given the greater potential for adverse outcomes. However, concern about resistance and prior community treatment with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, can lead to use of co-amoxiclav and other broad-spectrum beta-lactams in non-severe CAP presenting to hospital. Use and over-use of broad-spectrum antibiotics contributes to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), more side effects, and increased Clostridioides difficile infections. Understanding when narrower-spectrum antibiotics can safely be used could help mitigate AMR development.

While population-based studies and clinical trials have examined the effectiveness of different antibiotic treatments for CAP, none have directly compared the treatment outcomes between amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav, the two most commonly used antibiotics for CAP in the UK. We used electronic healthcare records (EHR) from a large UK teaching hospital group to investigate clinical outcomes in patients with CAP treated with either amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav, to understand if narrow-spectrum antibiotics could be safely used more widely.
