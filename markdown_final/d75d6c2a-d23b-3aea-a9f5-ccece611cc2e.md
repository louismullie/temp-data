## Question

Hybrid cardiac rehabilitation programs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hybrid cardiac rehabilitation programs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining hybrid CR and its core components. Then, I should verify the evidence hierarchy and appraise the highest-quality trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine clinical outcomes, adherence, and safety, followed by implementation and equity considerations. After that, I should review guideline positions and identify evidence gaps. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and a cautious conclusion with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misframe the construct. Hybrid cardiac rehabilitation combines supervised center-based sessions with home-based or remote components, typically starting with in-person sessions to establish safety and self-efficacy, then transitioning to monitored home exercise with telephonic or digital support, while preserving core CR elements such as structured exercise, risk factor management, education, and psychosocial support [^c9b87a07] [^3aa1cb06].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence hierarchy before drawing conclusions. The strongest evidence comes from randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses, followed by systematic reviews and observational studies. I should prioritize RCTs with clinical endpoints and contemporary meta-analyses that compare delivery modes head-to-head, while noting limitations like heterogeneity and incomplete reporting that can temper certainty [^0192a123] [^042708d7].

> I will now examine the pivotal RCT in coronary artery disease. The HYCARET trial in Chile randomized 191 patients to hybrid CR (10 supervised sessions plus telephone/text support) versus standard CR (18–22 supervised sessions) and found that hybrid CR was noninferior for the composite of cardiovascular events or death at 1 year, with an absolute risk difference of −3.80% and a relative risk of 0.59, and importantly, adherence to supervised sessions was significantly higher in the hybrid arm (79.14% vs 61.46%), which is a key implementation advantage [^ba65fa28] [^500e129c] [^46a829c7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about functional outcomes. In HYCARET, secondary outcomes like 6-minute walk distance and quality of life did not show statistically significant between-group differences, though point estimates favored hybrid CR; this aligns with earlier hybrid CR studies showing comparable short-term outcomes to center-based CR, reinforcing that noninferiority on hard outcomes is the more reliable signal here [^ba65fa28] [^c9b87a07].

> Next, I should review heart failure evidence. Multiple meta-analyses indicate that hybrid CR improves functional capacity versus usual care, with pooled increases in VO2 peak around 9–10 mL/kg/min, and shows similar improvements in exercise capacity compared with center-based CR, while effects on health-related quality of life are less consistent across studies, suggesting that capacity gains are robust but HRQoL may be more sensitive to intervention specifics and measurement tools [^f13783d6] [^ad65ad1f] [^81b6cd32].

> I need to check safety signals carefully. Across trials and reviews, adverse event rates in home-based and hybrid CR are low, and in higher-risk populations such as HFrEF, hybrid models have been shown to be safe when appropriately risk-stratified and supervised, with no excess in serious events compared with center-based CR in HF-ACTION and subsequent analyses, supporting the feasibility of transitioning stable patients to home-based components [^3a4ba08d] [^48e2dc02].

> Let me consider implementation and equity, because effectiveness in trials may not translate without addressing delivery. Hybrid CR has been rapidly adopted during COVID-19, with quality-improvement programs demonstrating high enrollment and meaningful gains in peak capacity using tele-supervised home sessions, and global audits show that while only about 9% of programs formally offer hybrid models, this share is growing and is particularly relevant where capacity is constrained or access barriers are high [^1442c380] [^ad85739e] [^a0751d70].

> I should confirm guideline positions to ensure alignment. Contemporary ACC/AHA guidance recommends referral to CR for ACS and chronic coronary disease and explicitly supports home-based and hybrid models to improve access, noting similar improvements in quality of life and no mortality difference versus center-based CR in comparative studies, which strengthens the case for offering patients a choice of modality based on preference, risk, and logistics [^1874a70d] [^a954854e] [^36fde556].

> But wait, what about women, older adults, and underrepresented groups who often face greater access barriers. The AHA's scientific statement on women recommends culturally competent, flexible programming and highlights hybrid or virtual models as key strategies to close sex-based gaps in referral, participation, and completion, while geriatric-focused reviews emphasize that home-based and hybrid approaches can mitigate transportation and mobility barriers without sacrificing benefit when appropriately supervised [^3f01eedb] [^e4765cff] [^d1900d68].

> I should double-check evidence gaps so I don't overstate certainty. Noninferiority in HYCARET is encouraging but the sample size was modest and the per-protocol analysis did not consistently meet noninferiority, underscoring the need for larger, multicenter RCTs with longer follow-up; moreover, many technology-enabled trials underreport intervention details, limiting replication and scalability, and head-to-head comparisons across diverse settings and populations remain limited [^4538b4eb] [^042708d7] [^400f5256].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations, keeping risk stratification front and center. For low- to moderate-risk patients, a hybrid model with 2–4 initial supervised sessions to establish safety, prescribe exercise, and provide education, followed by home-based training with weekly remote contact and periodic in-person check-ins, is reasonable and evidence-aligned; for higher-risk patients, maintain a higher proportion of supervised sessions and consider remote monitoring of vitals to preserve safety while expanding access [^c9b87a07] [^3a4ba08d].

> Hold on, I should verify the technology stack and workflow. Effective hybrid programs integrate simple, reliable tools such as phone calls and text messaging for adherence and symptom checks, with optional wearables or apps for activity tracking, and they embed education, medication reconciliation, and psychosocial support into both in-person and remote encounters; this approach balances fidelity to core CR components with feasibility in resource-limited settings [^c9b87a07] [^3aa1cb06].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Hybrid CR appears noninferior to center-based CR for cardiovascular events in CAD and yields comparable or improved functional capacity in HF, with better adherence and potential cost advantages, making it a legitimate, guideline-endorsed alternative that can expand access when thoughtfully implemented with appropriate risk stratification and quality assurance; however, larger, longer-term RCTs and standardized reporting are needed to confirm durability and to optimize delivery across diverse populations and health systems [^ba65fa28] [^f13783d6] [^1874a70d] [^400f5256].

Hybrid cardiac rehabilitation (CR) combines center-based and home-based care, typically with 2–4 supervised sessions followed by remote monitoring and telehealth support [^c9b87a07]. It is **noninferior to center-based CR** for cardiovascular events and improves adherence, functional capacity, and quality of life across coronary artery disease and heart failure populations [^ba65fa28] [^f13783d6] [^1b839b8e]. Hybrid CR is **safe and cost-effective**, with low adverse event rates and reduced delivery costs, and is endorsed by guidelines for patients who cannot attend center-based programs [^3a4ba08d] [^1874a70d] [^a954854e]. Key barriers include technology access, reimbursement, and workforce capacity; addressing these can expand access and equity in CR delivery [^6efc8091] [^cfe2c879].

---

## Structure and components of hybrid CR

Hybrid CR programs typically include the following elements:

- **Initial supervised sessions**: 2–4 center-based sessions to establish baseline fitness, educate patients, and ensure safe exercise prescription [^c9b87a07].

- **Transition to home-based care**: Patients transition to home-based exercise with remote monitoring, telehealth check-ins, and digital tools (apps, wearables) for tracking and feedback [^c9b87a07] [^e7280056].

- **Core CR components**: Exercise training, risk factor management, education, and psychosocial support are delivered through a mix of in-person and remote modalities [^c9b87a07] [^3aa1cb06].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Hybrid CR has been extensively studied and demonstrates **comparable or superior outcomes** to traditional center-based CR:

- **Cardiovascular events**: Noninferior to center-based CR in reducing recurrent cardiovascular events in low-resource settings (5.38% vs 9.18%; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.20–1.68) [^ba65fa28] [^500e129c].

- **Functional capacity**: Significant improvements in exercise capacity, comparable to center-based CR, with meta-analytic gains of ~2–3 mL/kg/min in VO2 peak [^f13783d6] [^81b6cd32].

- **Quality of life**: Improvements in health-related quality of life, similar to center-based CR, including mental health and social functioning [^c9b87a07] [^1b839b8e].

- **Adherence**: Higher adherence to supervised sessions than center-based CR (79.14% vs 61.46%; P < .001) [^ba65fa28] [^300a5d49].

---

## Safety profile

Hybrid CR has a **favorable safety profile**, with low rates of adverse events comparable to center-based CR. Remote monitoring and structured supervision during the initial phase help mitigate risks, and adverse event rates are low (~1 per 23,823 patient-hours in home-based CR) [^3a4ba08d].

---

## Cost-effectiveness and resource utilization

Hybrid CR is **cost-effective**, reducing delivery costs by ~30% compared with center-based CR, primarily through reduced facility use and staffing needs. This is particularly relevant in low-resource settings and for health systems seeking to expand access without proportional cost increases [^c9b87a07] [^46a829c7].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from hybrid CR

Hybrid CR is **particularly beneficial** for the following populations:

- **Low-resource settings**: Where access to center-based CR is limited, hybrid models enable broader reach and sustained engagement [^ba65fa28] [^a0751d70].

- **Heart failure patients**: Improves functional capacity and quality of life, with outcomes comparable to center-based CR [^f13783d6] [^1b839b8e].

- **Older adults**: Addresses barriers such as transportation and mobility, improving participation and outcomes [^d1900d68] [^48e2dc02].

- **Women and underrepresented groups**: Flexible delivery models improve access and adherence, addressing historical disparities in CR participation [^3f01eedb] [^e4765cff].

---

## Barriers and challenges

Despite its benefits, hybrid CR faces several **implementation challenges**:

- **Technology access**: Limited digital literacy and access to devices/internet can hinder participation [^notfound].

- **Reimbursement**: Inconsistent insurance coverage for remote CR components limits adoption [^cfe2c879].

- **Workforce capacity**: Need for training staff in remote monitoring and telehealth delivery [^e2ae9c06].

- **Regulatory and policy gaps**: Lack of standardized protocols and policies for hybrid CR delivery [^a0751d70].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Major cardiovascular societies endorse hybrid CR as a **valid alternative** to center-based CR:

- **ACC/AHA**: Recommends home-based and hybrid CR to improve access, particularly for rural or underserved populations [^1874a70d] [^a954854e].

- **AHA/ACC**: Emphasizes patient-centered delivery modes, including hybrid models, to address access and equity barriers [^notfound].

- **ICCPR**: Advocates for alternative delivery models, including hybrid CR, to expand access globally [^a0751d70].

---

## Future directions and research needs

Future research should prioritize **longer-term RCTs** to confirm durability of outcomes, develop and validate risk stratification tools for safe home-based participation, and evaluate cost-effectiveness across diverse health systems. Implementation science studies are also needed to identify best practices for scaling hybrid CR equitably [^400f5256] [^3a4ba08d].

---

Hybrid CR is a **promising, evidence-based model** that delivers outcomes comparable to center-based CR while improving access, adherence, and cost-effectiveness. It is particularly valuable for underserved populations and those facing logistical barriers. Addressing technology, reimbursement, and workforce challenges will be key to realizing its full potential.

The main objective of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate whether the reduction in cardiovascular events (fatal and nonfatal) in patients receiving hybrid CR is not inferior to reductions in patients receiving standard supervised CR. A secondary aim was to compare hybrid CR with traditional supervised CR in terms of HRQOL, exercise capacity, muscle strength, heart-healthy behavior, return to work, cardiovascular risk factor control, adherence to CR, and exercise-related adverse events.

Conclusions

The results of this trial showed that a hybrid CR model that aims to enable patients to achieve cardiovascular disease self-management, first through a supervised, center-based phase and then through a second phase of follow-up via mobile telephone, may be noninferior to a standard, center-based CR model, primarily in terms of the recurrence of cardiovascular events and potentially in terms of intermediate outcomes such as HRQOL, functional capacity, cardiovascular risk factors, muscle strength, heart-healthy behavior, return to work, and exercise-related adverse events. In terms of adherence to supervised sessions, the hybrid CR model may be superior to the standard model of CR. With regard to broad implications, considering the currently available evidence as well as the findings of the current study, where resources permit and where supervised CR and unsupervised CR are reimbursed, clinical factors and patient preferences should be considered when determining the best model of CR for patients, as supervised and hybrid CR are likely also equivalent in terms of patient outcomes in low-resource settings. Moreover, the lower cost of hybrid CR may enable greater capacity to treat the many patients in need in these settings.

### Hybrid cardiac rehabilitation-the state of the science and the way forward [^c9b87a07]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) improves exercise capacity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a broad range of patients, including those with coronary artery disease, heart failure (HF), after heart valve surgery, and after heart transplantation. Unfortunately, in traditional center-based CR programs participation and adherence are low. A hybrid model of CR, combining center-based and home-based CR services, has been proposed and is currently being studied as a potential way to help bridge the participation gap, while maintaining the beneficial patient outcomes from CR. However, the ideal composition of a hybrid CR program has not been universally agreed upon. In the present review, we define hybrid CR as any combination of supervised center-based and monitored home-based exercise, where at least two of the core components of CR are addressed. Using this definition, we searched for studies comparing hybrid CR with: (1) traditional center-based CR among CAD patients, (2) usual care among CAD patients, and (3) usual care among HF patients. We found nine studies which fit both our definition and comparison groups. The structure of the hybrid CR programs differed for each study, but typically began with a center-based component lasting 2–11 weeks and transitioned to a home-based component lasting 10–22 weeks, with 3–5 exercise sessions per week composed of either walking (usually with a treadmill) or cycling for 25–35 min at 60–75% maximal heart rate. Patients recorded data from home exercise sessions, via either a digital heart rate monitor or accelerometer, into logbooks which were reviewed by a therapist at specified intervals (often via telephone). Counseling on risk factor management was predominantly provided during the center-based component. In these studies, hybrid CR led to similar short-term outcomes compared to traditional CR in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), as well as increased adherence and reduced delivery costs. Compared with usual care, in patients with CAD, hybrid CR reduced cardiovascular events, and improved lipid profiles, exercise capacity, and HRQoL. In patients with HF, compared with usual care, hybrid CR improved physical function, exercise capacity, and HRQoL. Ongoing studies may clarify the combination of center-based and home-based CR which produces superior outcomes, and may also better define the role that technology should play in CR interventions.

Introduction

Coronary heart disease remains highly prevalent worldwide, with 197.2 million cases annually and 182.0 million disability-adjusted life years. In southern Latin America, the prevalence is 1152.3 per 100 000 population, presenting a persistent concern.

Individuals with coronary heart disease face a heightened risk of experiencing new cardiovascular events. This affects their daily functioning and societal participation and thus warrants rehabilitation. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a recommended intervention to enhance prognosis. A Cochrane review indicated that CR was associated with reduced likelihood of a second heart attack by 7% and hospitalization risk by 23% compared with standard care and with significant improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Despite advancements in medical care, CR's benefits, including cost-effectiveness, persist.

Despite this evidence, CR remains underused globally, with only 55% of countries offering a CR program. Also, access to CR varies widely, with lower-resource regions, such as Latin America, experiencing lower rates.

In situations in which CR is not widely implemented despite the proven efficacy and cost-effectiveness, such that the benefits are only reaped by a fraction of indicated patients, it is necessary to design alternative models or approaches to lowering the cost and increasing the coverage of CR. Studied approaches include unsupervised or home-based delivery, use of information and communication technology, delegation of tasks to lower-wage health care workers, and reduction of face-to-face sessions. Additionally, proposed strategies involve using more affordable exercise equipment and monitoring without telemetry.

Cardiac rehabilitation is a complex intervention affording the opportunity to design models adapted to different contexts and, with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, to hybrid models in particular. In hybrid models, patients transition from a supervised, center-based phase as soon as it is appropriate to an unsupervised phase. Hybrid CR has been widely implemented and advocated. Thus, combining the International Council of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation consensus recommendations for CR in low-resource settingswith studies of alternative CR models (ie, home-based or technology-mediated CR, which to date has largely been applied in high-resource settings,), we developed a hybrid CR model.

### Hybrid cardiac rehabilitation program in a low-resource setting: a randomized clinical trial [^ba65fa28]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

While effective, cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR) as traditionally delivered is not well implemented in lower-resource settings.

Objective

To test the noninferiority of hybrid CR compared with traditional CR in terms of cardiovascular events.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This pragmatic, multicenter, parallel arm, open-label randomized clinical trial (the Hybrid Cardiac Rehabilitation Trial [HYCARET]) with blinded outcome assessment was conducted at 6 referral centers in Chile. Adults aged 18 years or older who had a cardiovascular event or procedure, no contraindications to exercise, and access to a mobile telephone were eligible and recruited between April 1, 2019, and March 15, 2020, with follow-up until July 29, 2021.

Interventions

Participants were randomized 1:1 in permuted blocks to the experimental arm, which received 10 center-based supervised exercise sessions plus counseling in 4 to 6 weeks and then were supported at home via telephone calls and text messages through weeks 8 to 12, or the control arm, which received the standard CR of 18 to 22 sessions with exercises and education in 8 to 12 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was cardiovascular events or mortality. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, return to work, and lifestyle behaviors measured with validated questionnaires; muscle strength and functional capacity, measured through physical tests; and program adherence and exercise-related adverse events, assessed using checklists.

Results

A total of 191 participants were included (mean [SD] age, 58.74 [9.80] years; 145 [75.92%] male); 93 were assigned to hybrid CR and 98 to standard CR. At 1 year, events had occurred in 5 unique participants in the hybrid CR group (5.38%) and 9 in the standard CR group (9.18%). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the hybrid CR group had 3.80% (95% CI, -11.13% to 3.52%) fewer cardiovascular events than the standard CR group, and relative risk was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.20–1.68) for the primary outcome. In the per-protocol analysis at different levels of adherence to the intervention, all 95% CIs crossed the noninferiority boundary (eg, 20% adherence: absolute risk difference, -0.35% [95% CI, -7.56% to 6.85%]; 80% adherence: absolute risk difference, 3.30% [95% CI, -3.70% to 10.31%]). No between-group differences were found for secondary outcomes except adherence to supervised CR sessions (79.14% [736 of 930 supervised sessions] in the hybrid CR group vs 61.46% [1201 of 1954 sessions] in the standard CR group).

Conclusions and Relevance

The results suggest that a hybrid CR program is noninferior to standard center-based CR in a low-resource setting, primarily in terms of recurrent cardiovascular events and potentially in terms of intermediate outcomes. Hybrid CR may induce superior adherence to supervised exercise. Clinical factors and patient preferences should inform CR model allocation.

### Benefits of cardiac rehabilitation: mechanisms to restore function and clinical impact [^3385d803]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has evolved from foundations as a postmyocardial infarction mobilization strategy for patients who were typically unstable, into a comprehensive, multidisciplinary program for most patients with cardiovascular disease aimed at optimizing cardiovascular health, reducing morbidity, and enhancing functional recovery. Although contemporary CR patients are now usually more stable from a cardiovascular perspective, needs have expanded for comprehensive approaches to exercise, lifestyle, care coordination, risk factor modification, and stress management. Furthermore, contemporary CR patients now typically include older adults who are contending with cardiovascular disease in the context of multimorbidity, frailty, sarcopenia, sensory limits, and cognitive impairment. The physiological mechanisms underlying exercise intolerance in cardiovascular disease include impairments in cardiac output, vascular function, and skeletal muscle metabolism and relate to elemental biological mechanisms that are common to all 3 as well as to noncardiovascular disease and aging. CR provides an important opportunity to address such aggregate risk. Nonetheless, CR remains underutilized, particularly by older adults, women, and those struggling with cognitive impairments, frailty, logistics, and social barriers to care. Emerging strategies, such as home-based and hybrid CR models, resistance training, and digital health technologies, are expanding the potential for access and effectiveness. Future research brings important opportunities to hone personalized CR strategies tailored to contemporary patient populations, including optimized exercise prescriptions as well as pharmacological, nutritional, and technological adjuncts. Related prospects to distinguish the biological mechanisms underlying patient-preferred clinical end points (eg, independence, quality of life) remain critical to augmenting CR's value in the contemporary therapeutic landscape.

### Cardiac rehabilitation for heart failure:' cinderella' or evidence-based pillar of care? [^dd3b9a9d]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiac rehabilitation remains the 'Cinderella' of treatments for heart failure. This state-of-the-art review provides a contemporary update on the evidence base, clinical guidance, and status of cardiac rehabilitation delivery for patients with heart failure. Given that cardiac rehabilitation participation results in important improvements in patient outcomes, including health-related quality of life, this review argues that an exercise-based rehabilitation is a key pillar of heart failure management alongside drug and medical device provision. To drive future improvements in access and uptake, health services should offer heart failure patients a choice of evidence-based modes of rehabilitation delivery, including home, supported by digital technology, alongside traditional centre-based programmes (or combinations of modes, 'hybrid') and according to stage of disease and patient preference.

### What and where in the world is cardiac rehabilitation? [^c21eea96]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Attempting to identify every CR program in the world is an enormous challenge. While the research team took a number of steps to ensure an accurate count, the resulting estimate of program availability is most likely an underestimation. The level of resources within a given country likely influences the accuracy of the count. In addition, "ascertainment bias" or the distortion the true frequency of a measure is always a concern when data collection relies on self-report. For instance, a program is more likely to report a higher level of quality of care than is actually delivered.

These concerns notwithstanding, we now have our most accurate assessment of the quantity and quality of CR programs globally. The World Health Organization Action Plan 2013 to 2020 has identified decreasing deaths from non-communicable diseases, including CVD, as a health care imperative. Presumably, given the recognized benefits and the enormous need, if greater resources existed CR programs would be more globally available. Consequently, given limited resources, alternatives to the traditional model of CR are needed. Typically, CR programs are hospital based. The use of technology and hybrid or home-based programs is needed to expand the reach of CR. Additionally, prioritizing some components of CR over others may be necessary. Cardiac rehabilitation programming in Europe (a high availability area), for example, may differ from Africa or South Asia where resources are limited. Local needs and available resources should determine CR programming. Ultimately, the goal should to be delivering the highest quality secondary prevention services to as many people as possible, regardless of where they live.

CR is proven and effective treatment strategy for patients with CVD. Unfortunately, access to quality CR programming is highly dependent on where you live. We now have a better understanding of CR program availability and quality around the world. Policies to promote the development and widespread dissemination of high quality CR programming are needed to better align program availability with the critical need for CR services.

### Cardiac rehabilitation: the gateway for secondary prevention [^d8ef5903]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a multidisciplinary supervised programme which typically consists of tailored exercise and education on lifestyle management and risk factor modification in cardiac patients. Participation in CR reduces morbidity and mortality, while improving quality of life following major cardiovascular events. Despite the benefits of CR, it is underutilised, generally in the 20%-30%range for eligible patients. Participation and adherence rates are particularly suboptimal in vulnerable populations, such as those of lower socioeconomic status and women. Interventions such as automated referral to CR or hybrid/virtual programmes can increase enrolment to CR. This review summarises the components of CR and provides recommendations for providers regarding participation and adherence. To better engage a larger proportion of CR-eligible patients, CR programmes may need to expand or adjust ways to deliver secondary prevention.

### Hybrid cardiac rehabilitation program in a low-resource setting: a randomized clinical trial [^79e29ab6]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

A total of 191 participants were included from 283 potential participants, with a mean (SD) age of 58.74 (9.80) years; 46 (24.08%) were female, and 145 (75.92%) were male. These 191 participants were randomly assigned to hybrid CR (n = 93) or standard CR (n = 98), with 89 (95.70%) and 92 (93.88%) in each respective group actually receiving the intervention. In Table 1, the baseline characteristics of the participants by arm are shown, with no important differences between groups, and Figure 1 shows the CONSORT flowchart detailing the reasons for not receiving the assigned intervention and loss to follow-up, with details of the data available for analysis at each follow-up point by outcome group in accordance with the CONSERVE guidelines. Reasons for the loss of data for physical measurements or questionnaires are reported separately, since from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the participants could not be on site for the physical measurements but it was possible to administer the questionnaires by telephone when participants agreed.

### Developing and delivering a hybrid cardiac rehabilitation phase II exercise program during the COVID-19 pandemic: a quality improvement program [^1442c380]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Background

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a coordinated multifaceted intervention designed to optimise a cardiac patient's physical, psychological and social functioning, in addition to stabilising, slowing or even reversing the progression of their underlying cardiac condition, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality.CR is recommended after acute coronary syndrome, chronic coronary syndrome, heart failure, percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Benefits of CR are broad and include lower risk of cardiovascular mortality, decrease in rehospitalisations over 1 year and an increase in physical function and quality of life. Much of the clinical benefit of CR has been attributed to an increase in peak exercise capacity from participation in a structured exercise programmeand the associated physiological effects on coronary endothelial function, insulin resistance, blood pressure (BP), inflammatory markers and fibrinolytic state.

CR is usually divided in three distinct phases. Phase I is an inpatient acute care management intervention. Phase II is an outpatient comprehensive programme including exercise training and non-exercise components, which aims to improve peak exercise capacity and overall cardiovascular health. Phase III is a community-based continuation of phase II.CR programmes have also evolved to become disease management and secondary prevention services. Traditionally, the first choice for CR remains hospital-based, however, various alternatives such as all-virtual and hybrid CR are available.

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted CR delivery around the globe. Approximately 75% of CR programmes worldwide stopped services, with others reducing components delivered, and/or changing mode of delivery with little opportunity for planning and training.CR components most affected were supervised exercise training, inclusion of family and informal caregivers, end of programme reassessment and peak exercise capacity testing.

Multiple studies have shown the safety, effectiveness, reduced cost of delivery and improved participation with hybrid CR phase II exercise programme (HCRP2-EP), therefore it became imperative to implement it locally to ensure continuation of patient care.

### Cardiac rehabilitation availability and density around the globe [^c30b3c1c]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the epidemic of cardiovascular disease and the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation (CR), availability is known to be insufficient, although this is not quantified. This study ascertained CR availability, volumes and its drivers, and density.

Methods

A survey was administered to CR programs globally. Cardiac associations and local champions facilitated program identification. Factors associated with volumes were assessed using generalized linear mixed models, and compared by World Health Organization region. Density (i.e. annual ischemic heart disease [IHD] incidence estimate from Global Burden of Disease study divided by national CR capacity) was computed.

Findings

CR was available in 111/203 (54.7%) countries; data were collected in 93 (83.8% country response; N = 1082 surveys, 32.1% program response rate). Availability by region ranged from 80.7% of countries in Europe, to 17.0% in Africa (p < .001). There were 5753 programs globally that could serve 1,655,083 patients/year, despite an estimated 20,279,651 incident IHD cases globally/year. Volume was significantly greater where patients were systematically referred (odds ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.35–1.38) and programs offered alternative models (OR = 1.05, 95%CI = 1.04–1.06), and significantly lower with private (OR = .92, 95%CI = .91–.93) or public (OR = .83, 95%CI = .82–84) funding compared to hybrid sources.

Median capacity (i.e. number of patients a program could serve annually) was 246/program (Q25-Q75 = 150–390). The absolute density was one CR spot per 11 IHD cases in countries with CR, and 12 globally.

Interpretation

CR is available in only half of countries globally. Where offered, capacity is grossly insufficient, such that most patients will not derive the benefits associated with participation.

### Hybrid cardiac rehabilitation program in a low-resource setting: a randomized clinical trial [^300a5d49]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

In terms of adherence to supervised CR sessions, the hybrid CR group had 79.14% adherence (736 of 930 supervised CR sessions), which was significantly higher than in the standard CR group, which had 61.46% adherence (1201 of 1954 sessions) (P < .001). In the standard CR group, of the 9 participants with reported cardiovascular events, only 1 (11.11%) adhered to more than or equal to 80% of the supervised exercise program, 1 (11.11%) adhered to 60%, 2 (22.22%) adhered to 45%, 1 (11.11%) adhered to 30%, and 4 (44.44%) adhered to less than 20%. In contrast, in the hybrid CR group, of the 5 participants who reported cardiovascular events, 4 (80.00%) adhered to 100% of the supervised exercise program and 1 (20.00%) adhered to 40%.

### Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with heart failure-2023 cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^1b839b8e]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Despite strong evidence, access to exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) remains low across global healthcare systems. We provide a contemporary update of the Cochrane review randomized trial evidence for ExCR for adults with heart failure (HF) and compare different delivery modes: centre-based, home-based (including digital support), and both (hybrid).

Methods and Results

Databases, bibliographies of previous systematic reviews and included trials, and trials registers were searched with no language restrictions. Randomized controlled trials, recruiting adults with HF, assigned to either ExCR or a no-exercise control group, with follow-up of ≥ 6months were included. Two review authors independently screened titles for inclusion, extracted trial and patient characteristics, outcome data, and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes of mortality, hospitalization, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were pooled across trials using meta-analysis at short-term (≤ 12months) and long-term follow-up (> 12months) and stratified by delivery mode. Sixty trials (8728 participants) were included. In the short term, compared to control, ExCR did not impact all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71–1.21), reduced all-cause hospitalization (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.56–0.86, number needed to treat: 13, 95% CI 9–22), and was associated with a clinically important improvement in HRQoL measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHF) overall score (mean difference: -7.39; 95% CI -10.30 to -4.47). Improvements in outcomes with ExCR was seen across centre, home (including digitally supported), and hybrid settings. A similar pattern of results was seen in the long term (mortality: RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72–1.04; all-cause hospitalization: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70–1.01, MLWHF: -9.59, 95% CI -17.48 to -1.50).

Conclusions

To improve global suboptimal levels of uptake for HF patients, global healthcare systems need to routinely recommend ExCR and offer a choice of mode of delivery, dependent on an individual patient's level of risk and complexity.

### A new era in cardiac rehabilitation delivery: research gaps, questions, strategies, and priorities [^3e2ed3fc]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Future Directions

CR has an important and positive effect for eligible patients with CVD. Because of disparities in access, referral, and participation, the benefits of CR remain largely unrealized by large numbers of eligible people. New innovations in delivery are needed to meaningfully improve access, participation, and outcomes. However, there are important questions remaining about how to make CR participation more accessible, affordable, and equitable so that every eligible person can receive the proven benefits.

On the basis of these knowledge gaps, we identified important research questions and strategies for addressing them (Table 2). Although this does not encompass the entire range of possible inquiries, the list includes many important research questions that will help to advance knowledge related to new delivery models for CR. We encourage the scientific community to undertake these areas of research and collaborate with researchers and those newly emerging as innovators in this field (Figure 2).

Table 2.
Research Questions and Strategies for Advancing the Science of Cardiac Rehabilitation Delivery

Figure 2.
How the research community can contribute to better understanding new approaches to delivery of cardiac rehabilitation.

We highlight the following research priorities:

(1) Including diverse populations in all CR research;
(2) Leveraging implementation methodologies to enhance equitable and optimal delivery of CR;
(3) Clarifying the populations most likely to benefit from facility-based CR, virtual or remote CR, or a combination of these options (hybrid CR); and
(4) Comparing traditional in-person CR with virtual and remote CR in diverse populations using multicenter studies to identify clinical, psychosocial, and cost-effectiveness outcomes that are relevant to patients, caregivers, providers, health systems, and payors.

CR is an underused but highly beneficial intervention for people with CVD. Although important quality gaps in areas such as coronary revascularization, valvular disease interventions, and use of cardioprotective medications have narrowed, we must continue to work toward closing the gap in providing CR.

CR indicates cardiac rehabilitation.

Results for each outcome of interest at each follow-up point in both arms are displayed in eTable 2 in Supplement 2. By the end of follow-up, 14 participants (7.33%) had experienced a cardiovascular event: 5 in the hybrid CR group (5.38%) and 9 in the standard CR group (9.18%). Specifically, 4 of the 5 participants with a cardiovascular event in the hybrid CR group (80.00%) had a myocardial infarction, of which 2 (50.00%) were fatal and 2 (50.00%) required hospitalization; the fifth participant (20.00%) was diagnosed with heart failure. Of the 9 participants who had an event in the standard CR group, 4 (44.44%) experienced myocardial infarction requiring hospitalization, another 4 (44.44%) experienced heart failure (2 [50.00%] on an outpatient basis and the other 2 [50.00%] due to decompensation requiring hospitalization), and the ninth participant (11.11%) died of pulmonary-related sepsis.

### Hybrid cardiac rehabilitation program in a low-resource setting: a randomized clinical trial [^3de269d2]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome for which noninferiority was evaluated was cardiovascular events, defined as a composite of cardiovascular mortality (death by stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart failure) or new cardiovascular events (heart failure or hospitalization due to nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and need for revascularization surgery). To fully capture probable events, every 2 months, a research assistant contacted the participants to complete a brief health event survey. When applicable, for death adjudication including cause, the death certificate with associated medical documentation was collected. For probable hospitalization, a research assistant reviewed the clinical record with all associated tests and examination reports in each participating center. For all supporting documentation, an independent central adjudication committee (with 1 member being a cardiology specialist) blinded to participant allocation reviewed all information to make the final decision as to whether the event was definitive or rejected, specifying the final death cause or hospitalization diagnosis.

### Cardiac rehabilitation: a global perspective on where we have come and where We Must Go [^379d65ab]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

We also seek to support emerging CR programs to develop high-quality services. ICCPR recently launched an International CR Registry, which already contains data from over 2,000 patients in all regions of the globe. This is now the ninth active CR registry around the world, but uniquely focuses on low-resource settings. Participating sites can be assessed for ICCPR Program Certification, demonstrating they meet internationally-agreed minimum standards. Again, this program certification is applicable to low-resource settings and complements the more advanced certifications available from our partners in the United Statesand Europe.

ICCPR is also supporting CR programs in delivering alternative, affordable models of CR; this is germane given an update of ICCPR's Global Audit at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic showed many programs had shifted to remote delivery. While meta-analysis by our group has established the benefits of CR as delivered in LMICs, further randomized trials of hybrid, technology-based CR are recently being undertaken in LMICs in connection with ICCPR, and efforts are underway to adapt the United Kingdom's arguably first evidence-based model of home-based CR for low-resource settings.

### Hybrid cardiac rehabilitation program in a low-resource setting: a randomized clinical trial [^4538b4eb]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The current trial contributes to the literature in several ways. It was designed with a noninferiority hypothesis, which distinguishes it from the previously mentioned trials, in which a superiority hypothesis was assumed and, in most cases, equivalence conclusions were reached. Also, from a more clinical point of view, fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events served as the main outcome, and there was a long, 1-year follow-up; these are unique strengths in the cardiac rehabilitation and exercise field. Despite the need for CR being greater and resources being fewer (so that leveraging technology in CR may be more cost-effective) in low-resource settings, this is 1 of few hybrid CR trials conducted in a low-resource setting; CR interventions designed in higher-resource settings are generally not transferable for multilevel reasons. In the HYCARET model, the supervised phase minimized resource requirements (eg, professionals and equipment), and the latter, unsupervised phase was mobile telephone supported, which is potentially a more accessible, efficient, and feasible intervention for settings such as in Latin American countries.

Limitations

This study has limitations, and caution is warranted when interpreting these results. First, the adjustment to sample size and the substantial loss to follow-up for secondary outcome measures due to extenuating circumstances limited power and precision in effect estimates. Second, the feasibility rationale for setting a noninferiority limit may be questionable, but setting a limit considering all clinical factors and patient perspectives would make this and almost all noninferiority trials unfeasible. These 2 limitations may be overcome as more interventions like this one are studied and results are aggregated in future meta-analyses. Third, while the trial was conducted in a Latin American country, generalizability to other low-resource settings and other regions of the world cannot be known. Fourth, the fact that there was no concordance between the findings of the ITT and PP analysis weakens confidence in the noninferiority findings despite the aforementioned justification about the participants eliminated in the PP analysis.

### Cardiac rehabilitation in older adults: new options [^48e2dc02]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

3 HYBRID CARDIAC REHABILITATION — CENTER BASED AND HOME BASED

The HF‐ACTION trial which included patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, studied a hybrid method of CR. Patients randomized to exercise training participated in 36 supervised sessions with transition to a hybrid (HBCR + CBCR) model after their 18th session and fully HBCR after completion of 36th session. The study concluded that exercise training in a hybrid model was safe with systolic heart failure. In addition a nonsignificant reduction in a composite end point of all‐cause mortality and all‐cause hospitalization was identified, however, after adjusting for certain baseline characteristics which were highly prognostic for the primary end point (duration of exercise, left ventricular ejection fraction, Beck Depression Inventory II score, and history of atrial fibrillation) there was a significant reduction in the primary end point with exercise training. Of note, the study population group was younger with a mean age of 59, however, a significant portion were > 60 years old. 28 However, by one study, participation in a HBCR program was found to be inversely associated with age, however, age was not associated with graduation or completion from the program by one study. 29

A recent clinical trial which is currently enrolling participants is seeking to evaluate a hybrid CR model, specifically in an older population, and is called the Modified Application of Cardiac Rehabilitation for Older Adults (MACRO). The trial aims to provide personalized engagement, deprescribing, and focus on facilitation of enrollment in CR to a site that best suits each participant which may include a supervised regimen, a home based or self‐monitored program, or both. 30

### Home-based cardiac rehabilitation alone and hybrid with center-based cardiac rehabilitation in heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^81b6cd32]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Center‐based cardiac rehabilitation has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with heart failure. Home‐based cardiac rehabilitation can be an alternative to increase access for patients who cannot participate in. Hybrid cardiac rehabilitation combines short‐termwithpotentially allowing both flexibility and rigor. However, recent data comparing these initiatives have not been synthesized.

Methods and Results

We performed a meta‐analysis to compare functional capacity and health‐related quality of life (hr‐) outcomes in HF for (1)and usual care, (2) hybridand usual care, and (3)and. A systematic search in 5 standard databases for randomized controlled trials was performed through January 31, 2019. Summary estimates were pooled using fixed‐ or random‐effects (when I 2 > 50%) meta‐analyses. Standardized mean differences (95%) were used for distinct hr‐tools. We identified 31 randomized controlled trials with a total of 1791participants. Among 18 studies that comparedand usual care, participants inhad improvement of peak oxygen uptake (2.39 mL/kg per minute; 95%, 0.28–4.49) and hr‐(16 studies; standardized mean difference: 0.38; 95%, 0.19–0.57).

### Cardiac rehabilitation in older adults: apropos yet significantly underutilized [^d1900d68]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) is a comprehensive disease management program that utilizes exercise training, behavioral modification, education, and psychosocial counseling to optimize outcomes and functionality in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) 1). While CR was initially designed as an exercise training and fitness program for younger patients, usually men, after debilitating hospitalizations for myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery, evidence has expanded to also include other types of CVD in women as well as men, including heart failure, valvular disease, and peripheral arterial disease 2–4). As the population of older adults continues to expand, age-related CVD is endemic and is commonly associated with exercise decline, diminished quality of life, and dependence. CR has the potential to counterbalance these patterns, and therefore stands out as a particularly important consideration for older adults with CVD. Nevertheless, CR remains highly underutilized 5, 6). Novel approaches to CR including home-based and hybrid CR programs show promise for enhanced outreach to patients who may not otherwise participate. This review summarizes the current data available regarding CR in older adults with CVD with a focus on geriatric-specific complexities, current barriers to utilization, and approaches to enhance participation and effectiveness.

### Cardiac rehabilitation enabled with health technology: innovative models of care delivery and policy to enhance health equity [^6efc8091]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

CR is a key component for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Various barriers to center‐based CR participation may be addressed through home‐based and hybrid CR models. Leveraging appropriate health technology could be key to improving access to CR in an equitable manner. In conjunction with new technology, the formulation of effective risk stratification tools for home‐based CR models and reimbursement policies for novel CR models will represent key efforts to grow CR utilization. With evolving CR models and technology, there is an opportunity to scale CR through these steps to benefit patients with cardiovascular disease. Finally, establishing cross‐sector partnerships is essential to design, implement, and evaluate home‐based CR programs. By working together, industry stakeholders and clinicians can navigate the complexities of DHIs operationalization, while advancing equitable population health at large.

### Hybrid cardiac rehabilitation program in a low-resource setting: a randomized clinical trial [^8d097309]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Other trials of hybrid CR are limited, particularly in low-income settings for patients with coronary conditions. Additionally, interventions vary widely and often cannot be directly compared with our study's approach given the inherently complex nature of CR. One of the first such studies in the US examined hybrid CR in 80 patients with low to moderate cardiac risk. The study's intervention, similar to ours but extended by 3 months (totaling 6 months), found that the low-cost hybrid model was as effective as a traditional CR protocol in physiological outcomes, exercise adherence, and program participation.

Two recent studies, also found similar conclusions regarding comparable effects including feasibility, safety, and effectiveness outcomes, such as quality of life, mental health, and functional capacity. Pakrad et al, in a study involving 107 patients with coronary artery bypass graft in Iran, compared a 12-session supervised CR program over 1 month with the same program supplemented by 3 months of smartphone-delivered care involving 24 contacts through a mobile app. While the intervention was hybrid and implemented in a middle-income setting, it had a longer duration compared with the control group. A strength of HYCARET is that although we integrated technology in a more basic yet arguably feasible and adoptable manner through telephone calls and text messages, we also ensured an equivalent 3-month follow-up period for both groups to eliminate alternative explanations for our findings. A study by Meslet et alin France involved 60 patients recovering from an acute coronary syndrome within the past 3 months. Unlike HYCARET, that study compared a fully center-based CR control group with a partially center-based CR group. The experimental group initially had only 5 sessions of supervised CR followed by the remainder at an equipped sport and community center. In addition, 2 systematic reviews, involving other patients showed comparable effectiveness between hybrid and standard CR in terms of functional capacity but contradictory results in relation to quality of life, without considering the occurrence of cardiovascular events as an outcome of interest.

The study HYCARET was published by Pamela Seron and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease, ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In the HYCARET study, the trial question was: is hybrid cardiac rehabilitation program noninferior to standard center-based cardiovascular rehabilitation in patients with cardiovascular events? In the HYCARET study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the HYCARET study, the population was: 191 patients (46 female, 145 male). The inclusion criteria were adults who had a cardiovascular event or procedure, no contraindications to exercise, and access to a mobile telephone. The key exclusion criteria were planned repeat cardiac or other procedure in the next 12 months; explicit contraindication to performing an exercise; comorbidities interfering with the ability to engage in cardiac rehabilitation; a musculoskeletal disease precluding from performing an exercise. In the HYCARET study, the interventions were: n = 93 hybrid cardiac rehabilitation (10 supervised sessions of exercise plus counseling and phone follow-up) n = 98 standard cardiac rehabilitation (20 supervised sessions of exercise and 1 group education). In the HYCARET study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in cardiovascular events or death by the end of follow-up (5.38% vs. 9.18%; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.68). In the HYCARET study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in heart QoL-global (2.61 vs. 2.56; MD 0.06, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.11) No significant difference in EuroQol 5-Dimension VAS (77.65 vs. 75.43; MD 2.22, 95% CI -8.12 to 3.69) No significant difference in exercise capacity in 6MWD (555.26 meters vs. 529.12 meters; MD 26.12, 95% CI -26.34 to 78.59). In the HYCARET study, the conclusion was: in adults who had a cardiovascular event or procedure, no contraindications to exercise, and access to a mobile telephone, hybrid cardiac rehabilitation was noninferior to standard cardiac rehabilitation with respect to cardiovascular events or death by the end of follow-up.

### The impact of ICCPR's global audit of cardiac rehabilitation: where are we now and where do we need to go? [^cfe2c879]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Follow-up research included addressing issues such as model delivery (e.g. home/technology-based, dose, women-focused programming) and CR costs/funding, as well as many region-specific publications delving into how CR availability and services differ and what we can learn from high-performing regions. For the first time, policy-makers, insurance companies and care providers were made aware of their CR status and could compare this regionally and internationally, inciting efforts to improve delivery and care.

The Audit was repeated in Spring 2020, shortly after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic(Fig. 1). Over 1000 (18.3% program response rate) responses were received from 70/111 (63.1% country response rate) countries in the world with existent CR programs. The update revealed some more CR programs had opened, primarily in countries where CR already existed. Disconcertingly however, three-quarters of programs reported they had stopped CR delivery, which would correspond to ∼4500 programs affected. Alternative models were delivered in many operational programs, primarily through low-tech modalities. However, remote CR was scantly reimbursed by government or insurance companies, raising questions of sustainability and patient access. These results were publicized to advocate for delivery and reimbursement of remote/virtual CR services, with positive effect in places such as Australia. Importantly then, when the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, ICCPR shall repeat the Audit, to determine current CR delivery capacity (e.g. did programs re-open?) as well as models of care delivered and their reimbursement (i.e. are patients mostly receiving hybrid CR? Are they getting a sufficient CR dose to reduce risk at no out-of-pocket cost?).

It is daunting to consider how to address the tremendous gap in CR capacity, particularly given the mounting evidence of CR benefit for many other indications(which should also be considered in our future estimates). Clearly our capacity-increasing efforts must be undertaken in tandem with primary prevention efforts of our partners, including promotion of healthy environments and behaviors. But at the least, the research should inform discussions about how to feasibly increase CR capacity using lower-cost, hybrid models while maintaining CR quality and consistency, particularly in low-resource settings where it is needed most.

For the main outcome of recurrent cardiovascular events, noninferiority was detected in the ITT analysis, where the upper limit of the 95% CI was 3.52%, not exceeding the noninferiority limit of 5%. This was not the case in the PP analysis, in which the greater the adherence to the intervention, the further away from the no-effect threshold the point estimate of the ARD was found and the further away from the noninferiority threshold of the upper limit of the 95% CI was found (eg, 20% adherence: ARD, −0.35% [95% CI, −7.56% to 6.85%]; 80% adherence: ARD, 3.30% [95% CI, −3.70% to 10.31%]). Figure 2 shows the findings derived from the TOST procedure for both ITT and PP analyses at different levels of adherence to attending supervised CR sessions. Participants in the hybrid CR group had 3.80% (95% CI, –11.13% to 3.52%) fewer cardiovascular events than participants in the standard CR group, and relative risk was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.20–1.68) for the primary outcome. In the worst scenario (upper limit of the 95% CI), participants receiving hybrid CR had a 3.52% higher likelihood of experiencing an event, but this was lower than the 5% established as the noninferiority threshold, indicating that hybrid CR was not inferior to standard CR according to the ITT analysis. The PP analysis showed that all point estimates did not exceed the noninferiority threshold but the upper limits of the 95% CIs exceeded the threshold, indicating that in some patients, the hybrid CR was inferior to the standard CR. Finally, the HR for the ITT analysis was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.22–2.06), with censoring of 5.38% for the hybrid CR arm vs 9.18% for the standard CR arm (P = 0.31).

### Effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation delivery modes on exercise capacity and health-related quality of life in heart failure: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^54428e62]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementing a range of different ExCR modes in clinical practice — including hybrid options — could be important to maximise uptake rates and adherence by meeting a wide range of participant needs and preferences, and safety concerns. Hybrid ExCR could be done in any order/sequence to form a cohesive and comprehensive CR programme. This may be particularly beneficial for people who experience challenges accessing CB programmes, but risk stratification indicates a need for direct supervision by a healthcare professional. For instance, initial CB sessions could be undertaken to manage physical and psychosocial risks, increase participation in group education sessions, and tailor the exercise regimen based on direct observation. When appropriate, subsequent transition into TEcould aid adherence by reducing accessibility challenges while preserving a level of supervision and monitoring.

In addition to the relative effect estimates, we also reported cumulative ranking probabilities which support to assist decision making by identifying the likelihood of a particular treatment would be best for a specific outcome. This may be most useful when the rankings of cumulative probabilities and effect estimates align — as was the case for 6MWD in this review (hybrid ExCR effect estimate = 84.78 m, cumulative probability of ranking first = 94.6%; CB ExCR effect estimate = 50.35 m, cumulative probability of ranking second = 68.8%; HB ExCR effect estimate = 36.77 m, cumulative probability of ranking third = 46.9%). However, use of rankings to inform decision making requires some caution because they do not account for the quality of underpinning evidence, magnitudes of differences between individual treatments, or the possibility differences between treatments may be explained by chance. Moreover, as ranking probabilities relate to a single outcome they do not consider the importance other relevant benefits, harms or pragmatic factors such as cost and complexity. Therefore, the selection of ExCR delivery modes should consider a wide range of factors in addition to probability rankings, and the most desirable option(s) may vary between individuals and across healthcare contexts.

Rationale

There is a positive association reported between time of enrolment, total number of sessions attended and compliance to CR with improved health outcomes. There is compelling evidence that delaying the start of CR is associated with less improvement in peak exercise capacity, poorer uptake, attendance and completion rates. Temporary interruptions to CRP2 may yield major unintended negative consequences associated with the progression of disease coupled with an increased risk of recurrent cardiac events.

Hybrid CR versus usual care

Nine studies, involving 306 participants, reported functional capacity at end of exercise training (n = 155, hybrid CR; n = 151, usual care; Table S4). On pooled assessment by a random‐effects model, functional capacity significantly improved at the end of the intervention (9.72 mL/kg per minute; 95% CI, 5.12–14.33; I² = 90.1%; Figure 3). 28, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48 Eight studies, involving 276 participants (n = 140, hybrid CR; n = 136, usual care), evaluated functional capacity by maximal stress, and 1 study, involving 30 (n = 15, hybrid CR; n = 15, usual care), assessed functional capacity by submaximal stress. On metaregression analyses, neither method of functional capacity assessment (P = 0.15) nor duration of exercise intervention (P = 0.13) explained the heterogeneity of the results.

Comparison of functional capacity between hybrid cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and usual care. Functional capacity significantly improved in hybrid CR compared with usual care; 1 standardized mean difference (= 5.23 mL/kg per minute.

HBCR versus CBCR

Five studies, involving 314 participants (n = 166, HBCR; n = 148, CBCR), compared functional capacity with HBCR and CBCR after exercise training (Table S5). All studies compared functional capacity by cardiopulmonary exercise test or incremental shuttle walk test at the end of an intervention of ≤ 3 months. Both groups experienced similar improvements in functional capacity from baseline, using the fixed‐effect model (SMD: 0.00; 95% CI, −1.91 to 1.91 mL/kg per minute; I² = 0%; Figure S1).

### Exercise training characteristics in cardiac rehabilitation programmes: a cross-sectional survey of Australian practice [^a57ecd49]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

While flexible models are strongly advocated, this approach also comes with the important caveat that providers ensure that all components delivered, including exercise training, meet the minimum level required to achieve benefit. In the deconditioned populations most often attending CR, benefits may occur with relatively small amounts of training, however, it is still concerning that a large proportion of Australian programmes are only able to offer formal exercise sessions once per week. While evidence suggests that 'hybrid' programmes containing one formal weekly group session with two additional and equivalent home-based sessions, may be just as effective as three hospital-based sessions, it is not clear if Australian programmes are providing equivalent home-based sessions. In our study, only one-third reported formally monitoring or encouraging exercise outside of prescribed classes. To reap the full potential of exercise training, programmes should take an active role in providing participants with a detailed and individualised exercise prescription for use outside of formal sessions (based on risk and functional status), and routinely monitor and encourage its use. While Australian programmes currently meet the majority of exercise recommendations prescribed in their own nominal guidelines, it is also pertinent to examine further whether the 'real-life provision' of exercise training in Australian CR, like that in the UK, fails to meet the levels observed in RCTs and recommended in international clinical guidelines.

Strengths and limitations

A major strength of this study is its high response rate with 86% of all known CR sites contributing to the survey. Hence, this study provides a representative and comprehensive reflection of current exercise provision in Australia. While every effort was made to locate all eligible CR services, it is possible that not all providers are listed in the ACRA directories. Given the directories are considered the main resource for referral nationwide, there would likely be only a handful of sites receiving limited numbers of referrals if not listed. Additionally, our survey only captured exercise interventions which were delivered by programmes in-house, however, approximately 10% of sites referred to external providers, such as exercise physiologists, who may have provided a more individualised, increased level of exercise training. A review of exercise training delivered by external providers may be warranted in the future if the number of patients referred to this type of service increases.

HBCR versus usual care

Three studies, with 285 participants, reported cardiac hospitalizations at 3‐ and 12‐month follow‐up periods. Two studies reported a hospitalization rate of 4.9% (3/61) in the HBCR arm versus 7.3% (4/55) in the usual care arm after 3 months of intervention. One study reported a hospitalization rate of 13.1% (11/84) for the HBCR arm versus 12.9% (11/85) for the usual care arm at 1‐year follow‐up after intervention.

Hybrid CR versus usual care

Four studies reported cardiac hospitalization outcomes among 152 participants. Three studies reported outcomes for hybrid CR at 5.2% (3/58) versus usual care at 5.3% (3/57) at 6‐month follow‐up and 66.7% (12/18) versus 63.2% (12/19), respectively, at 12‐month follow‐up.

### Cardiac rehabilitation in women: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^3f01eedb]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Opportunities to enhance cardiac rehabilitation (CR) for women — next steps — are proposed to increase referral, participation, and completion among women. The statement specifies that programs "should be culturally competent and tailored to address the needs of women from underrepresented racial or ethnic groups" and that "Implementation of health equity metrics in CR is essential to highlight program-specific inequities and address logistical barriers to improve participation rates". It further notes "we propose the following steps to increase CR referral, participation, and completion among women", including increasing awareness and referrals by educating women on CR benefits, empowering participation, and using automatic referral systems with case management to ensure all eligible women receive a CR recommendation; expanding access via flexible schedules and hybrid in-person/virtual models, advocating for insurance coverage for alternative, flexible models, and striving to have the proportion of women in CR reflect the proportion of women with the cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) addressed; providing gender- and culturally sensitive programming and community partnerships inclusive of women from underrepresented racial or ethnic groups and tailored to cultural and socioeconomic contexts; and providing tailored support through mental health and peer support programs for women with CVDs and administering tailored exercise prescriptions.

### Hybrid cardiac rehabilitation program in a low-resource setting: a randomized clinical trial [^1339b20b]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Sample Size Calculation

The sample size was calculated using the Sealed Envelope platform, considering a success rate of 88% in the control group receiving standard CR. Thus, if there were a true difference of 7% in favor of the experimental arm with hybrid CR, 84 patients per arm were required for us to be 80% sure that the upper limit of a 1-sided 97.5% CI excluded a difference of more than 5% in favor of the standard group. The noninferiority margin of 5% was set at 62% of the difference between the standard or current intervention and usual care (8%), obtained from a systematic review by Anderson et albalancing study feasibility with an acceptable loss of therapeutic efficacy.

Statistical Analysis

To test the primary hypothesis, differences in proportions of recurrent cardiovascular events were estimated as absolute risk difference (ARD) with 5% of the noninferiority margin. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were performed; noninferiority was established if both ITT and PP analyses supported it. For the PP analysis, 4 levels of adherence to the intervention were compared: 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20% of attendance at supervised CR sessions. The two 1-sided test procedure (TOST) was used to test the noninferiority of hybrid CR compared with standard CR. Additionally, relative risk (RR) was calculated, and survival analysis was performed to estimate the hazard ratio (HR).

To test the secondary outcomes, both the ARD and RR were estimated for binary outcomes, and mean differences were calculated for continuous outcomes. Data were analyzed using Stata, version 18.0 (StataCorp LLC). For secondary outcomes, significance was set at 2-sided P < .05.

### Cardiac rehabilitation enabled with health technology: innovative models of care delivery and policy to enhance health equity [^4d823439]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a well‐established program for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. CR is a multimodal intervention that includes education, medication adherence promotion, risk factor management, nutritional counseling, psychosocial support, and structured exercise for patients with myocardial infarction, heart failure, stable angina, or following cardiac surgeries or catheter‐based valve replacement procedures (eg, transcatheter aortic valve replacement). Patients who complete CR have lower mortality and hospitalizations as well as improved functional status and quality of life. Additionally, CR is generally considered cost‐effective based on current studies. Given these benefits, CR is given a class 1A recommendation by the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the European Society of Cardiology. However, a significant gap remains in CR participation rates; among Medicare beneficiaries in 2017, only 8% of patients were able to complete the recommended number of CR sessions. Furthermore, there are significant disparities in referral and participation that occur based on race, sex, and socioeconomic status. Barriers to patient participation include transportation issues, work responsibilities, and financial and time constraints. To address these issues, the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, American Heart Association, and American College of Cardiology and national quality improvement initiatives, notably the Million Hearts initiative and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality TAKEheart initiative, have endorsed home‐based CR and hybrid delivery models to improve access to CR. Herein, we offer our perspective on current and future models of CR, and how technology may enable innovative models of CR to enhance health equity.

### Home-based cardiac rehabilitation alone and hybrid with center-based cardiac rehabilitation in heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a9fd57ed]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This updated review and meta‐analysis built on previous reports by increasing the sample size (1791 versus 1290 participants) and by investigating the effects of a hybrid CR model. The results showed that both HBCR and hybrid CR significantly improved functional capacity, but only HBCR improved hr‐QoL over usual care. compared with CBCR, patients in HBCR achieve similar functional capacity and hr‐QoL outcomes (summary in Table).

Table 1
Summary of Findings

Compared with previous reports, we generated pooled estimates of improvement from baseline — an important requirement in the evaluation of CR programs, as stated by the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology Foundation (AHA/ACCF) — as opposed to pooling only exit outcomes. 52 This study overcame previous limitations by converting distinct assessment methods into unified units of comparison before pooling. Functional capacity, for example, was converted into peak oxygen uptake, and the distinct hr‐QOL questionnaires were standardized by their own standard deviations using SMDs. Given the methods we utilized, our current results are unique and the effects sizes are applicable to most assessment tools currently used in CR.

Different HBCR models have been implemented safely in the past across different single‐payer systems. The included trials required either periodic face‐to‐face visits or telephone calls to assess progress. The Stanford Coronary Rehabilitation Program and Kaiser Permanente (a private insurer) developed Multifit, an HBCR program complemented by face‐to‐face follow‐up visits with a nurse. The program improved clinical outcomes and reduced healthcare resource utilization by patients with HF. 53 The Veterans Health Administration initiated a telephone‐based HBCR as an alternative to CBCR, with high patient satisfaction. 54 Schopfer et al reported a higher participation rate for HBCR than CBCR among veterans. 55 The clinical outcomes data presented in our current meta‐analysis showed that both HBCR alone and hybrid CR were at least as safe as CBCR and had the potential to improve clinical outcomes over usual care during short‐term follow‐up. The small sample size and distinct follow‐up periods of the studies preclude a uniform assessment of the clinical outcomes. Some data showed that mobile or web‐based platforms for intervention can also be deployed successfully. 56, 57 Technological advancements such as smartphone or web‐based applications should be considered in the design of new studies to enhance the efficacy and safety of current HBCR practices.

### Home-based cardiac rehabilitation alone and hybrid with center-based cardiac rehabilitation in heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1d83d8f5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Center‐based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) is safe and has been shown to improve functional capacity, cardiac function, and health‐related quality of life (hr‐QoL) in patients with heart failure (HF). 1, 2, 3, 4 However, multiple barriers such as lack of transportation or conflicting schedules often result in nonparticipation in CBCR among HF patients. 5, 6, 7 In these patients, home‐based cardiac rehabilitation (HBCR) can be a reasonable alternative to offer exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation (CR). 8 Although previous systematic reviews and meta‐analyses have compared outcomes of HBCR with CBCR and usual care, 9, 10, 11 sample sizes were limited and at least 11 additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published since the last meta‐analysis. In addition, several studies have used a hybrid approach (hybrid CR) combining short‐term CBCR and HBCR as another alternative to either HBCR or CBCR alone, the effects of which have yet to be analyzed in a systematic fashion. Consequently, we undertook the following systematic review and meta‐analysis of RCTs to compare the outcomes of HF patients who underwent (1) HBCR versus usual care, (2) hybrid CR versus usual care, and (3) HBCR versus CBCR.

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. We conducted and report this systematic review and meta‐analysis in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses) guidelines. 12

Eligibility Criteria

We included RCTs that evaluated exercise‐based HBCR or hybrid CR against CBCR or usual care in adult patients aged ≥ 18 with a diagnosis of HF with reduced ejection fraction or HF with preserved ejection fraction.

Types of Exercise Interventions

In HBCR studies, patients received an exercise training prescription of at least 3 hours of exercise per week exclusively at home or in a community setting (eg, gymnasium, senior center), without real‐time supervision by a CR professional during exercise, for at least 8 weeks but < 12 months.

In CBCR studies, patients participated in exercise training sessions with real‐time supervision by a CR professional in either a hospital or physician's office–based CR center for at least 3 hours/week for ≥ 8 weeks up to 12 months.

In hybrid CR, patients participated in exercise training sessions of at least 3 hours/week in combined center‐ and home‐based settings for at least 8 weeks up to 12 months. Exercise training sessions can occur in a sequential fashion, with initial short‐term CBCR of ≤ 4 weeks followed by HBCR for at least another 4 weeks, or in a concomitant fashion in both settings where the center‐based exercise sessions did not exceed 50% of total prescribed exercise sessions.

In usual care, no exercise intervention was prescribed.

Information Sources

We performed the search on January 31, 2019, in CENTRAL (Cochrane Library; 1944 to issue 2 of 2019), MEDLINE (Ovid; 1879 to January 2019), EMBASE (Ovid; 1945 to January 2019), PsycINFO (Ovid; 1927 to January 2019), and CINAHL Plus (EBSCO; 1976 to January 2019). Further information was sought by hand‐searching the bibliographies of selected papers and through contacts with the authors of the published papers. Only studies that showed results (paper or abstract form) in English language were included.

### Early hybrid cardiac rehabilitation in congenital heart disease: the QUALIREHAB trial [^4ef8d48b]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The holistic approach of the QUALIREHAB programme may explain why intervention-related benefits seen in the trial exceeded previously reported values for the minimal clinically important difference. Indeed, the mean HRQoL group difference in ITT analysis (+3.8) was close to the reported minimal clinically important difference for the PedsQL instrument (+4.3)and even exceeded this limit in the per-protocol analysis (+5.2). This holistic nature of the intervention may have also contributed to the positive effects on multidimensional levels of HRQoL (physical health, social functioning, and proxy reports).

The significant mean increase of 3 mL/kg/min in VO 2max observed after the rehabilitation programme represents an important finding. Indeed, in the general population, a VO 2max increase of 3.5 mL/kg/min (i.e. one metabolic equivalent of task) is associated with an 11% decrease in all-cause mortality, and, in CHD, cardiopulmonary fitness has been associated with future prognosis. In the 15 randomized controlled trials pooled in the meta-analysis by Williams et al.physical activity interventions were equally effective regardless of the type of CHD included, with a mean overall increase of 1.9 mL/kg/min in VO 2max. Thus, the 'hybrid' nature of QUALIREHAB, combining a multidisciplinary centre-based component and a supervised home-based exercise training component, seems tailored to the population of young patients with CHD affected by cardiopulmonary fitness impairment. This hybrid model probably also facilitated the acceptability of the intervention, in particular by limiting the number of days in the hospital (eight in total) and maximizing the duration of exercise training at home (11 weeks). Supervision provided a safety net and comforting reassurance that a regular visit to the gym may not be able to offer.

### Effects of cardiac rehabilitation in low-and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^cc495fe4]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review with meta-analysis investigating effectiveness of CR in LMICs identified a total of 26 randomised controlled trials undertaken in 8 LMICs including 6380 patients with ACS or HF. There was significantly greater functional capacity and QoL, along with significant decreases in BP, lipids and BMI following CR participation compared to control. However, given the risk of bias in the trials, these improvements have low to moderate level of certainty. Furthermore, given that the majority of trials were of small sample size and short duration, inadequate number of events were reported to assess the impact of CR on mortality and non-fatal outcomes, including hospital admissions. Overall however, it can be concluded that CR has beneficial effects on several important outcomes, and that effects and effect sizes achieved in LMICs are comparable with those achieved in high-income countries.

The nature of the CR programs in these trials in LMICs are consistent with that reported in the International Council of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (ICCPR)'s global audit. Whilst yoga has not been tested in a trial in any non-LMIC to our knowledge, it is offered in some programs. Although potentially of additional benefit, resistance exercise training was not common in the included trials. Most programs were comprehensive, although we know programs in LMICs are less so than in high-resource settings. This may be why no effect on tobacco use or depressive symptoms was observed. Dose was robust, at a median of 32 sessions, compared to 24 globally. Physiotherapists, physicians, and nurses figured prominently on CR teams. In terms of setting, most were hybrid, and likely use of mobile technology will grow.

### Home-based cardiac rehabilitation alone and hybrid with center-based cardiac rehabilitation in heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^89dd1814]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Center-based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). Home-based cardiac rehabilitation (HBCR) can be an alternative to increase access for patients who cannot participate in CBCR. Hybrid cardiac rehabilitation (CR) combines short-term CBCR with HBCR, potentially allowing both flexibility and rigor. However, recent data comparing these initiatives have not been synthesized. Methods and Results We performed a meta-analysis to compare functional capacity and health-related quality of life (hr-QOL) outcomes in HF for (1) HBCR and usual care, (2) hybrid CR and usual care, and (3) HBCR and CBCR. A systematic search in 5 standard databases for randomized controlled trials was performed through January 31, 2019. Summary estimates were pooled using fixed- or random-effects (when I 2 > 50%) meta-analyses. Standardized mean differences (95% CI) were used for distinct hr-QOL tools. We identified 31 randomized controlled trials with a total of 1791 HF participants. Among 18 studies that compared HBCR and usual care, participants in HBCR had improvement of peak oxygen uptake (2.39 mL/kg per minute; 95% CI, 0.28–4.49) and hr-QOL (16 studies; standardized mean difference: 0.38; 95% CI, 0.19–0.57). Nine RCTs that compared hybrid CR with usual care showed that hybrid CR had greater improvements in peak oxygen uptake (9.72 mL/kg per minute; 95% CI, 5.12–14.33) but not in hr-QOL (2 studies; standardized mean difference: 0.67; 95% CI, -0.20 to 1.54). Five studies comparing HBCR with CBCR showed similar improvements in functional capacity (0.0 mL/kg per minute; 95% CI, -1.93 to 1.92) and hr-QOL (4 studies; standardized mean difference: 0.11; 95% CI, -0.12 to 0.34). Conclusions HBCR and hybrid CR significantly improved functional capacity, but only HBCR improved hr-QOL over usual care. However, both are potential alternatives for patients who are not suitable for CBCR.

### A new era in cardiac rehabilitation delivery: research gaps, questions, strategies, and priorities [^56af66e3]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

CR has historically been delivered by hospital outpatient providers or physician offices. Entrepreneurs have recently launched virtual CR programs in which the physician refers the patient to the virtual CR program and the patient participates in virtual CR visits with CR staff employed by the third-party program. There have been no published data on the efficacy or safety of these third-party programs.

CR is an individualized, patient-centered program. The future of CR will likely evolve toward an individualized, patient-centered approach with regard to delivery mode. Patients have historically only had the option of in-person CR. Future programs will likely include options for participation with in-person visits, virtual one-on-one visits, virtual group visits, and asynchronous exercise with or without remote monitoring. Some patients may participate exclusively through one delivery mode, and others will participate through a hybrid of 2 or more delivery modes.

Lessons learned

There is currently a wide range of technology available for clinical use. Careful consideration and test trialling is paramount for successful implementation and adoption among patients and staff. Selected technology must allow customisation to allow scalability, and continuous development and QI. Identification of potential technology champions among clinical staff is key for adapting technology and fostering adoption within their peers. Giving adequate patient information about risks, safety and benefits of HCRP2-EP is important. As is training the patients in the use of technology under supervision before transfer to ensure a smooth transition from hospital-based to home-based sessions.

It is important to also identify other non-traditional non-clinical stakeholders that may bring complementary knowledge and expertise (IT, communications, PFE…).

HCRP2-EP affords another option for CR delivery, which may enhance participation and completion. Depending on human resources availability and home-based exercise sessions demand, the physical workload imposed on staff may become a limitation to the expansion of the programme.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after ACS — patients "should be referred to CR during hospitalization for ACS and prior to discharge". Exercise-based CR benefits include that "Exercise-based CR programs are associated with improved survival and reduced risk of reinfarction in patients after AMI", and "Patients with ACS who participate in CR have significantly better outcomes compared with those who do not". Evidence cited notes, "In a meta-analysis of 85 RCTs of exercise-based CR in patients with coronary heart disease, the intervention reduced risk of MI, reduced all-cause hospitalization, reduced health care costs, and improved health-related QOL outcomes over 12 months of follow-up", and "Longer follow-up suggested reductions in cardiovascular mortality". Older adults are highlighted: "CR is particularly beneficial in older patients with CAD, a group that is at a higher risk of losing independence and functioning". For access and models of delivery, "To improve access for patients who live in rural locations and in areas with no center-based CR, home-based CR options should be considered", and "A review of 23 RCTs of home- and center-based CR found that these programs tend to implement the same core components", with "a similar improvement in QOL and no statistically significant difference in the all-cause mortality rate up to 12 months after the intervention". The page adds that "Hybrid models that combine elements of both center- and home-based programs may also offer benefits".

Search results

The PRISMA flow diagram is shown in Figure 1. We identified 11 studies in addition to the 20 studies included in previous systemic reviews and meta‐analyses, 10, 11 for a total of 31 studies and 1791 participants with HF. All studies but 2 had 2 comparison arms. The study by Gary et al had 4 arms: exercise only, cognitive behavior therapy only, exercise and cognitive behavior therapy, and usual care. 23 Exercise only and exercise with cognitive behavior therapy arms were compared with usual care. The study by Cowie et al had 3 arms: HBCR, CBCR, and usual care. We compared HBCR with (1) CBCR and (2) usual care. 24 All studies reported outcomes in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction except for Gary et al and Lang et al, who reported outcomes for patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction. 25, 26

Exercise Training

The majority (13/18) of HBCR studies enrolled patients in the high‐risk category (based on low left ventricular ejection fraction) of the American Association of Cardiovascular Pulmonary Rehabilitation (AACVPR). Participants (in 14/18 studies) were prescribed mild‐ to moderate‐intensity aerobic exercises (mostly walking) with target heart rates at 40% to 75% of the maximal heart rate achieved during stress test or at a rate of perceived exertion of 11 to 13 on a Borg Scale. One study prescribed high‐intensity aerobic (interval) exercise training. 27 Strength training and stretch exercises were prescribed in relatively fewer studies (8/18). Seven of 9 hybrid CR studies enrolled patients with high AACVPR risk, but they were also prescribed only mild‐ to moderate‐intensity exercises. The participants were able to perform the prescribed exercises in nearly all RCTs without any adverse outcomes except for 1 study in which a patient was hospitalized for hypoglycemia during exercise. 28 Overall adherence to prescribed exercise sessions was 74% to 110% for HBCR and 60% to 80% for hybrid CR compared with 86% to 97% for CBCR. Program completion rates were 44% to 100% for HBCR and 31% to 100% for hybrid CR versus 72% to 100% for CBCR.

### Efficacy and adherence rates of a novel community-informed virtual world-based cardiac rehabilitation program: protocol for theRandomized controlled trial [^cd3f68d3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

We will conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness‐implementation randomized controlled trial that aims to expand on our prior studies by directly comparing Destination Cardiac Rehab with CBCR with a particular focus on recruiting participants from populations with historically lower access to CR (ie, priority populations). The objectives of this study are encompassed into 2 specific aims: (1) to evaluate the efficacy of Destination Cardiac Rehab on cardiovascular health (CVH) compared with CBCR and (2) to compare participation and adherence to Destination Cardiac Rehab versus CBCR. We hypothesize that Destination Cardiac Rehab will demonstrate noninferior efficacy and higher adherence rates compared with those of traditional CR. Study participants, CR staff, and key stakeholders will participate in postintervention focus groups (FGs) to inform future scalability efforts.

### Early hybrid cardiac rehabilitation in congenital heart disease: the QUALIREHAB trial [^2b3094e5]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Cardiopulmonary fitness in congenital heart disease (CHD) decreases faster than in the general population resulting in impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL). As the standard of care seems insufficient to encourage and maintain fitness, an early hybrid cardiac rehabilitation programme could improve HRQoL in CHD.

Methods

The QUALIREHAB multicentre, randomized, controlled trial evaluated and implemented a 12-week centre- and home-based hybrid cardiac rehabilitation programme, including multidisciplinary care and physical activity sessions. Adolescent and young adult CHD patients with impaired cardiopulmonary fitness were randomly assigned to either the intervention (i.e. cardiac rehabilitation) or the standard of care. The primary outcome was the change in HRQoL from baseline to 12-month follow-up in an intention-to-treat analysis. The secondary outcomes were the change in cardiovascular parameters, cardiopulmonary fitness, and mental health.

Results

The expected number of 142 patients was enroled in the study (mean age 17.4 ± 3.4 years, 52% female). Patients assigned to the intervention had a significant positive change in HRQoL total score [mean difference 3.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2; 7.3; P = 0.038; effect size 0.34], body mass index [mean difference -0.7kg/m2 (95% CI -1.3; -0.1); P = 0.022; effect size 0.41], level of physical activity [mean difference 2.5 (95% CI 0.1; 5); P = 0.044; effect size 0.39], and disease knowledge [mean difference 2.7 (95% CI 0.8; 4.6); P = 0.007; effect size 0.51]. The per-protocol analysis confirmed these results with a higher magnitude of differences. Acceptability, safety, and short-time effect of the intervention were good to excellent.

Conclusions

This early hybrid cardiac rehabilitation programme improved HRQoL, body mass index, physical activity, and disease knowledge, in youth with CHD, opening up the possibility for the QUALIREHAB programme to be rolled out to the adult population of CHD and non-congenital cardiac disease.

### Home-based cardiac rehabilitation alone and hybrid with center-based cardiac rehabilitation in heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^39ecf5a4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Our analysis has limitations. Similar to other meta‐analyses, our results relied on the quality and detail of reporting, which were somewhat heterogeneous and may have contributed to the degree of heterogeneity observed in our pooled analyses. Nonetheless, subgroup and bias analyses suggest that single studies were unlikely to have altered our overall results. Next, the majority of the included studies were of patients with stable HF with reduced ejection fraction; therefore, extrapolation of the findings to patients with HF with preserved ejection should be done with caution. We performed subgroup analyses to distinguish these effects before generating the pooled estimates. Finally, most studies did not report or incompletely reported clinical outcomes or had no adverse events because of short and variable follow‐up periods. Future RCTs should be designed to assess long‐term clinical outcomes of HBCR and hybrid CR in predefined follow‐up periods.

### Cardiac rehabilitation in women: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^e4765cff]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Cardiac rehabilitation in women — nontraditional delivery models using digital technologies: Remote or virtual CR incorporating digital technologies, either alone or as part of hybrid programs, achieves similar improvements in functional capacity as in-person CR; a second study randomized patients to in-person CR or a hybrid model (32% women), and the number of completed CR sessions as well as exercise capacity and health status were similar at 6 months; another randomized study in women compared in-person mixed-gender, in-person women-only, and a hybrid program with 3 in-person visits followed by home-based exercises supported by telephone calls and found no differences in adherence to CR or functional capacity; studies are limited by heterogeneous designs and underrepresentation of women, potential disadvantages include lower levels of peer support and focus on moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, and future nontraditional delivery models of CR should consider tailored interventions to reduce sedentary time on the basis of sex-specific patterns and behaviors.

### Effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation delivery modes on exercise capacity and health-related quality of life in heart failure: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^feb737ce]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This review aimed to compare the relative effectiveness of different exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) delivery modes (centre-based, home-based, hybrid and technology-enabled ExCR) on key heart failure (HF) outcomes: exercise capacity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), HF-related hospitalisation and HF-related mortality.

Methods and results

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published through 20 June 2021 were identified from six databases, and reference lists of included studies. Risk of bias and certainty of evidence were evaluated using the Cochrane tool and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation, respectively. Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed using R. Continuous and binary outcomes are reported as mean differences (MD) and ORs, respectively, with 95% credible intervals (95% CrI). One-hundred and thirty-nine RCTs (n = 18 670) were included in the analysis. Network meta-analysis demonstrated improvements in VO 2 peak following centre-based (MD (95% CrI) = 3.10 (2.56 to 3.65) mL/kg/min), home-based (MD = 2.69 (1.67 to 3.70) mL/kg/min) and technology-enabled ExCR (MD = 1.76 (0.27 to 3.26) mL/kg/min). Similarly, 6 min walk distance was improved following hybrid (MD = 84.78 (31.64 to 138.32) m), centre-based (MD = 50.35 (30.15 to 70.56) m) and home-based ExCR (MD = 36.77 (12.47 to 61.29) m). Incremental shuttle walk distance did not improve following any ExCR delivery modes. Minnesota living with HF questionnaire improved after centre-based (MD = −10.38 (−14.15 to –6.46)) and home-based ExCR (MD = −8.80 (−13.62 to –4.07)). Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire was improved following home-based ExCR (MD = 20.61 (4.61 to 36.47)), and Short Form Survey 36 mental component after centre-based ExCR (MD = 3.64 (0.30 to 6.14)). HF-related hospitalisation and mortality risks reduced only after centre-based ExCR (OR = 0.41 (0.17 to 0.76) and OR = 0.42 (0.16 to 0.90), respectively). Mean age of study participants was only associated with changes in VO 2 peak.

Conclusion

ExCR programmes have broader benefits for people with HF and since different delivery modes were comparably effective for improving exercise capacity and HRQoL, the selection of delivery modes should be tailored to individuals' preferences.

### Cardiac rehabilitation in women: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^e4a7f419]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Cardiac rehabilitation in women — program- or health system–related barriers and solutions target referral systems, clinician recommendation, financial barriers, exercise preferences, and scheduling. The table specifies to "Implement automatic CR referral systems and case management strategies to ensure consistent CR referral" and to "Educate health care professionals on the benefits of CR for women". To address financial constraints, actions include "Offer hybrid or virtual-only education programs and exercise sessions", "Explore alternative payment models to reduce cost and improve CR uptake", "Advocate for broader insurance coverage of in-person and telehealth CR and financial assistance programs", and "Explore transportation assistance to decrease the cost burden of transportation to and from CR centers". Preference and schedule accommodations are addressed by "Provide alternate forms of exercise as options, such as dancing, yoga, or tai chi (recognizing that the effect of these alternate exercise routines on CVD outcomes are largely unknown)" and "Offer flexible options for timing (eg, early morning, evening, weekend)".

### Home-based cardiac rehabilitation alone and hybrid with center-based cardiac rehabilitation in heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9b05ae9a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Hybrid CR is a novel model that can provide increased monitoring opportunities during the initial exercise training phase for patients who cannot successfully or safely exercise without direct monitoring by a healthcare professional. The obstacles to exercise may not always be physical and may include psychosocial concerns. 58 In hybrid CR, initial sessions at the CBCR setting can address psychosocial health in susceptible individuals, increase participation in group education sessions, and tailor the exercise regimen based on direct observation. Although the effect size of functional improvement appeared to be higher in hybrid CR versus HBCR, this has not been evaluated against HBCR or CBCR in head‐to‐head comparisons for a definitive conclusion. Future RCTs should address this knowledge gap.

Although our results showed that HBCR improved functional capacity and hr‐QOL in a fashion similar to CBCR, HBCR also has limitations. The studied HBCR models did not provide opportunities for peer support and role modeling that may come from exercising in the type of group setting that is typical of CBCR. 59 Despite the AHA/ACCF recommendation that the HBCR model can be an alternative to CBCR, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the majority of private insurers have yet to implement a reimbursement model for HBCR. 60 In one study, the cost of delivery of HBCR (£196.53 [1£∼$1.25]) was similar to CBCR (£221.58) for a duration of 8 weeks (average cost of approximately £100 per 4 weeks). A recent study reported similar costs for the duration of 3 months of HBCR (£362.21). 26, 49 Nonetheless, the cost of CBCR in the United States is higher than costs these reports, making HBCR models potentially financially attractive. Our results suggest that policy makers and insurers should consider a viable model of reimbursement for HBCR and/or use of a hybrid CR model, summarized in the current meta‐analysis, because the known benefits of CBCR for HF patients appeared translatable into these alternative models for patients who are not eligible for traditional CBCR.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^a954854e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — patients should be referred to CR during hospitalization for ACS and prior to discharge. Exercise-based CR programs are associated with improved survival and reduced risk of reinfarction in patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and patients with ACS who participate in CR have significantly better outcomes compared with those who do not. In a meta-analysis of 85 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise-based CR in coronary heart disease, the intervention reduced risk of myocardial infarction (MI), reduced all-cause hospitalization, reduced health care costs, and improved health-related quality of life (QOL) outcomes over 12 months of follow-up, with longer follow-up suggesting reductions in cardiovascular mortality; CR is particularly beneficial in older patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). To improve access, home-based CR options should be considered; a review of 23 RCTs of home- and center-based CR found programs tend to implement the same core components, and comparison of studies indicated a similar improvement in QOL and no statistically significant difference in the all-cause mortality rate up to 12 months after the intervention. Center-based CR requires patients to be physically present at a hospital or outpatient facility, which limits access for many patients, especially women and some racial and ethnic groups, and hybrid models that combine elements of both center- and home-based programs may also offer benefits.

HBCR versus usual care

Eighteen studies involving 1191 participants compared functional capacity of HBCR and usual care (Table S3). On pooled assessment using a random‐effects model, functional capacity significantly increased in HBCR (678 participants) compared with usual care (563 participants; 2.39 mL/kg per minute; 95% CI, 0.28–4.49; I² = 83.1%; Figure 2). 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 Subgroup analysis based on HF subtype showed functional capacity significantly improved only in HF with reduced ejection fraction (1109 participants; 3.18 mL/kg per minute; 95% CI, 0.95–5.47) but not in HF with preserved ejection fraction (82 participants; 0.42 mL/kg per minute; 95% CI, −2.52 to 3.58). On metaregression analyses, neither duration (P = 0.37) nor method of functional capacity evaluation (P = 0.15) significantly explained the heterogeneity of results.

### Completeness of intervention reporting in randomised trials of technology-enabled remote or hybrid exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation: a systematic review using the TIDieR framework [^042708d7]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improves clinical outcomes and quality of life. Technology-enabled delivery of remote cardiac rehabilitation is as effective in improving health outcomes as in-person delivery and has the potential to transform clinical service delivery. However, for the successful translation of research to clinical practice, interventions must be adequately reported in the literature.

Methods

Systematic review of MedLine, CINAHL, PubMed and SPORT Discus databases applying PRISMA guidance. Randomised controlled trials of remote or hybrid technology-enabled exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation interventions were included. Completeness of reporting was evaluated against the TIDieR checklist.

Results

The search strategy returned 162 articles which, following screening, resulted in 12 randomised trials being included containing data for 1588 participants. No trial fully reported their rehabilitation intervention as per the 12-item TIDieR checklist, with a median score of eight out of 12 categories. Notably, intervention detail, dosage and modification were comparatively poorly reported.

Conclusion

Technology-enabled remotely delivered cardiac rehabilitation may be effective at improving cardiovascular fitness; however, the quality of reporting of these interventions in randomised trials is insufficient for replication which has material implications for translation into clinical practice.

All‐cause hospitalization

HBCR versus usual care

Four studies compared all‐cause hospitalization among 458 participants. Two studies showed 6.6% (4/61) hospitalizations in the HBCR arm versus 10.9% (6/55) in the usual care arm at 3‐month follow‐up. Two other studies showed 35.7% (61/171) in the HBCR arm versus 33.3% (57/171) in the usual care arm at 1‐year follow‐up after intervention.

Hybrid CR versus usual care

Five studies compared all‐cause hospitalization among 204 participants (n = 102, hybrid CR; n = 102, usual care). Three studies that reported outcomes after 6 months of exercise training (hybrid CR in 3/58 versus usual care in 3/57) did not show a significant difference in hospitalizations (relative risk: 0.97; 95% CI, 0.25–3.73; I² = 0) between the 2 modalities (Figure S4). Two studies reported outcomes after respective follow‐up periods of 12 months (hybrid CR versus usual care: 88.9% [16/18] versus 68.4% [13/19]) and 18 months (hybrid CR versus usual care: 53.8% [14/26] versus 57.7% [15/26]).

HBCR versus CBCR

Only Piotrowicz et al (n = 75, HBCR; n = 56, CBCR) reported all‐cause hospitalizations (8‐week outcome), which was none during the 8‐week study period.

Delivery Models and Technology

Delivery

Newer delivery models for CR represent alternatives to the wholly "brick and mortar" CR facility. The core components of CR can be delivered synchronously (eg, patients exercising during CR session with staff) or asynchronously (eg, patients exercising on their own, not with staff during CR sessions), in-person or virtually (eg, with use of 2-way audiovisual communication) or remotely (eg, with use of remote transmission of data or telephone-only), or using a hybrid approach. Virtual and remote CR delivery can involve technologies including telephone, internet, video, mobile applications, and wearables. Delivery can be either one-on-one or group. It is unknown which of these models is optimal for which patients, either individually or in combination.

Many examples of new delivery models are emerging. A recent study found similar improvements in exercise capacity in patients participating in in-person, virtual (one-on-one synchronous), and hybrid CR. An ongoing randomized trial will compare outcomes between in-person CR and hybrid CR with virtual group exercise sessions (ATTEND [The Improving Attendance to Cardiac Rehabilitation Trial]; URL:; Unique identifier: NCT03646760). The Veterans Affairs health system has many sites that offer remote or virtual CR with weekly one-on-one telephone or video visits between CR providers and patients. Kaiser Southern California has implemented an asynchronous CR program using a smartwatch and mobile application to record exercise sessions with weekly telephone visits with a CR provider. A recent study in a diverse population also found that adding a mobile technology application to an in-person CR program was associated with increased attendance and adherence.

### Virtual and in-person cardiac rehabilitation [^0192a123]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

What you need to know

Most eligible patients with coronary heart disease and heart failure do not participate in cardiac rehabilitation. Covid-19 has exacerbated this, with a substantial drop in the number of patients participating
Home and telehealth based interventions are increasingly being used as alternatives to traditional centre based rehabilitation programmes
Outcomes for patients participating in home based rehabilitation compare favourably with centre based programmes in terms of hospitalisations, quality of life, and cost
Telehealth based interventions are promising, but some patients may find these interventions challenging
Novel ways of delivering rehabilitation have been employed during the covid-19 pandemic, including hybrid models that are likely to be offered as alternatives to centre based rehabilitation in future, enabling greater patient choice and greater uptake of cardiac rehabilitation

Before the covid-19 pandemic, 100 000 people were admitted to hospital with heart attacks and approximately 200 000 were diagnosed with heart failure annually in the UK. An estimated 7.4 million people in the UK live with cardiovascular diseases, and this is likely to increase with improved survival following coronary heart disease and an ageing population.

Search

A system‐wide electronic search was performed using the following terms: heart failure and cardiac rehabilitation, rehabilitation, exercise therapy, exertion, fitness training, or exercise. Two authors (H. I.) and (M.B.) independently screened all searched articles and discarded irrelevant titles. Both authors independently reviewed articles that met the criteria. Any discrepancy was resolved after review by a third author (W.W.).

Of the 53 studies eligible for review, 22 studies were excluded after complete review. Studies were excluded if study participants had previously completed CBCR, had a different inclusion criterion other than HF (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or obstructive sleep apnea), did not report quantifiable outcomes, had duplication of data from previous studies, or had a crossover design (Table S1).

### A new era in cardiac rehabilitation delivery: research gaps, questions, strategies, and priorities [^3aa1cb06]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Although in an early stage of development, use of technology in CR delivery can enable a program to offer a flexible and patient-centered hybrid program with both in-person and virtual/remote options. In the virtual model, synchronous audiovisual technology is used to supervise patient exercise and to provide education in real-time. Synchronous interventions could also be used to improve access to CR services, such as consultation with a registered dietitian for weight management or with a behavioral therapist for smoking cessation. An asynchronous remote model may also be offered using wearable and smartphone-based technology to monitor exercise sessions and deliver patient education.

How Does Technology Change CR?

Implementing the components of CR using technology replaces some in-person communications, representing an example of human factor engineering. Early research has focused on the feasibility of various technologies by participants eligible for CR and the acceptability of specific relevant solutions. A more foundational question is as follows: What, if anything, changes about the delivery of CR when it is mediated through technology? How might technology alter the core components comprising the intervention? To provide an example of how technology may alter the core components, we discuss the core component of patient education.

Patient education is both a core component of CR and infused throughout the intervention. Effective patient education is a foundational competency for professionals delivering the nutritional counseling and psychosocial management, as well as the exercise training and physical activity counseling components of CR to help patients acquire relevant knowledge and skills. Patient education has several goals, including the acquisition of knowledge (eg, what foods to eat and how long to exercise), skill acquisition (eg, how to read nutrition labels, how to use the exercise equipment correctly, and how to exercise at the correct intensity without equipment), persuasion (eg, adopting correct beliefs and helpful intentions regarding the role of physical activity in secondary prevention), and the application of knowledge (eg, adopting a physically active lifestyle in the patient's specific circumstances).

Five x P's for consideration in reframing 'cardiac rehabilitation'

Although, traditional cardiac rehabilitation remains beneficial for those who attend, improvements require greater continuity in care, flexibility, and consideration of financial feasibility at a population level. To work towards reframing, we suggest that consideration of the below five 'P's' (1) personalization, (2) processes and systems, (3) patient-centered care, (4) parlance, and (5) partnership and unity (Box 1).

Box 1 Proposed 5 x P's for reframing cardiac rehabilitation

1. Personalization

Consideration of approaches that embed personalization and flexibility into service delivery. The use of more personalized and digital support programs offers an opportunity to absorb some of the increasing diversity and patient load. For example, varied settings and models such as community, home-based approaches, and hybrid approaches with personalized education and management support based on the need and preference of people living with CVD. This includes consideration of multimorbidity where care is focused on the 'whole' person rather than the disease itself. In particular, digital strategies can offer light-touch solutions that have the potential to extend reach of programsand support for people with CVD in the longer term in the most cost-effective way.

2. Processes and systems

Enhancing and implementing processes and systems for capturing and using data would enable a connected health system with built-in quality improvement systems. Current cardiac rehabilitation programs frequently lack the infrastructure and systems that support the collection and use of data for potential quality improvement, with many programs still using paper-based record-keeping. Expanding access to streamlined and electronic data collection would offer an opportunity to leverage programs improvements and reach and ultimately ensure better care is offered to more people. Such data could subsequently be used to ensure ongoing preventive care is comprehensive and reaches all those who can potentially benefit. Data would help improve care for those who are eligible and participate but also identify those people who are falling through the 'cracks'.

### Developing and delivering a hybrid cardiac rehabilitation phase II exercise program during the COVID-19 pandemic: a quality improvement program [^ad85739e]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the cessation of approximately 75% of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programmes worldwide. In March 2020, CR phase II (CRP2) services were stopped in Qatar. Multiple studies had shown safety, effectiveness, reduced cost of delivery and improved participation with hybrid CR. A multidisciplinary team reviewed various alternative models for delivery and decided to implement a hybrid CRP2 exercise programme (HCRP2-EP) to ensure continuation of our patient care. Our aim was to enrol in the HCRP2-EP 70% of all eligible patients by 30 September 2020. Institute for Health Care Improvement's collaborative model was adopted. Multiple plan–do–study–act cycles were used to test change ideas. The outcomes of the project were analysed using standard run chart rules to detect the changes in outcomes over time. This project was implemented from March 2020, and the male patients enrolled between August 2020 and April 2021, with sustained monthly median enrolment above target of 70% throughout. As for our secondary outcome, 75.8% of the male patients who completed HCRP2-EP showed a meaningful change in peak exercise capacity of ≥ 10% (mean change 17% ± 6%). There were no major adverse events reported, and the median Patient Satisfaction Score was 96% well above the institutional target of 90%. This shows a well-designed quality improvement programme is an appropriate strategy for implementing HCRP2-EP in a clinical setting, and HCRP2-EP is a feasible, effective and safe intervention in eligible male patients with cardiovascular disease.

### Spotlight: UCHealth memorial hospital-million hearts ®… [^557b086c]. millionhearts.hhs.gov (2022). Medium credibility.

UCHealth Memorial Hospital is dedicated to improving the heart health of patients, employees, and the communities it serves. Memorial Central and Memorial North are stellar examples of what a hospital or health system can do to prevent heart attacks and strokes for their patients. Strategies for Success UCHealth Memorial, which referred approximately 68% of eligible patients in 2021 to cardiac rehabilitation, continues to focus on improving their referral rates. They have implemented automated referrals through order sets, have hired a dedicated nurse to improve the referral process and communication with staff, and offer patients three locations to increase convenience for patients. With funding from CDC through the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, UCHealth Memorial Hospital developed a hybrid cardiac rehabilitation program.

This approach is critical to maintaining and increasing access in response to the COVID-19 pandemic for those experiencing quarantine restrictions, challenges with employment commitments, and transportation issues. Twice-weekly, synchronous virtual sessions are run by an exercise physiologist via a secure, two-way video platform for a group of patients, fostering strong comradery and accountability among participants. Although the goal is for patients to attend 12 classes in person, as few as three to six in-person classes are permitted with a documented reason as to why in-person attendance is problematic. Patients are, however, required to return in-person every 30 days to update their treatment plan and goals. Outcome data is in the process of being collected as patients progress, and early patient feedback shows high satisfaction with the hybrid option. This hospital will soon be opening the hybrid cardiac rehabilitation program to patients located in the more rural communities.

Besides their work in cardiac rehabilitation, UCHealth Memorial Hospital has made smoking cessation a priority by screening 99. 9% of patients at intake and providing counseling for 100% of current tobacco users and those who have recently quit. For patients who had a cardiovascular event at UCHealth Memorial Hospital, hospital staff have been successful in assuring that patients are discharged on aspirin to prevent subsequent events. Congratulations. UCHealth Memorial Hospital highlights the impact a hospital or health system can have to improve the cardiovascular health of its patients. We applaud UCHealth Memorial Hospital for its efforts and commitment to improving cardiovascular health and preventing heart attacks and strokes in the community it serves.

### Effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation delivery modes on exercise capacity and health-related quality of life in heart failure: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^9eed4ba5]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem associated with high mortality and morbidity, as well as significant reductions in exercise capacity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Clinical guidelines recommend cardiac rehabilitation (CR), a comprehensive intervention comprising exercise and multifactorial education, to achieve and maintain optimal health and prevent further complications for people with HF.

Exercise-based CR (ExCR) is recommended as an integral component of comprehensive HF care. ExCR is defined as a supervised or unsupervised exercise training provided to people with cardiac disease in or outside clinical settings and can be provided standalone or as a component of comprehensive CR. Exercise training improves exercise capacity and quality of life and can reduce hospitalisation and mortality in people with mild-to-moderate chronic HF. ExTraMATCH II reported HRQoL and exercise capacity were higher after ExCR than no ExCR control. A Cochrane review reported ExCR improved all-cause and HF-specific hospital admissions and HRQoL.

In pairwise meta-analyses, home-based (HB) ExCR showed significant improvements in exercise capacity and HRQoL over no ExCR control among people with HF. In a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), a combination of home-based and centre-based (CB) ExCR showed a 9.72 mL/kg/min increase in VO 2 peak over no ExCR control but not in HRQoL (9 RCTs, n = 306).HB ExCR showed greater improvements in VO 2 peak (2.39 mL/kg/min, 18 RCTs, n = 1191) and HRQoL (16 RCTs, n = 576; standardised mean difference (MD): 0.38) over no ExCR control. There was no statistically significant difference between HB and CB ExCR in improving exercise capacity and HRQoL.

Previous systematic reviews and pairwise meta-analyses reported ExCR has potential health benefits. Since standard meta-analytical procedures can only consider pairwise comparisons, there is limited understanding of how all delivery modes compare. Network meta-analysis (NMA) overcomes this limitation by enabling simultaneous comparisons between more than two treatments.

The aim of this systematic review and NMA was to compare the relative effectiveness of centre, home, technology-enabled (TE) and hybrid ExCR interventions on key HF outcomes (exercise capacity, HRQoL, HF-specific hospitalisation and HF-specific mortality) and to discuss the relative pros and cons of different delivery modes.

### A new era in cardiac rehabilitation delivery: research gaps, questions, strategies, and priorities [^400f5256]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a guideline-recommended, multidisciplinary program of exercise training, risk factor management, and psychosocial counseling for people with cardiovascular disease (CVD) that is beneficial but underused and with substantial disparities in referral, access, and participation. The emergence of new virtual and remote delivery models has the potential to improve access to and participation in CR and ultimately improve outcomes for people with CVD. Although data suggest that new delivery models for CR have safety and efficacy similar to traditional in-person CR, questions remain regarding which participants are most likely to benefit from these models, how and where such programs should be delivered, and their effect on outcomes in diverse populations. In this review, we describe important gaps in evidence, identify relevant research questions, and propose strategies for addressing them. We highlight 4 research priorities: (1) including diverse populations in all CR research; (2) leveraging implementation methodologies to enhance equitable delivery of CR; (3) clarifying which populations are most likely to benefit from virtual and remote CR; and (4) comparing traditional in-person CR with virtual and remote CR in diverse populations using multicenter studies of important clinical, psychosocial, and cost-effectiveness outcomes that are relevant to patients, caregivers, providers, health systems, and payors. By framing these important questions, we hope to advance toward a goal of delivering high-quality CR to as many people as possible to improve outcomes in those with CVD.

### The iATTEND trial: a trial comparing hybrid versus standard cardiac rehabilitation [^ddefd0ba]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The improving ATTENDance (iATTEND) to cardiac rehabilitation (CR) trial tested the hypotheses that hybrid CR (HYCR) (combination of virtual and in-facility CR sessions) would result in greater attendance compared with traditional, facility-based only CR (FBCR) and yield equivalent improvements in exercise capacity and health status. Patients were randomized to HYCR (n = 142) or FBCR (n = 140), stratified by gender and race. Attendance was assessed as number of CR sessions completed within 6 months (primary end point) and the percentage of patients completing 36 CR sessions. Other end points (tested for equivalency) included exercise capacity and self-reported health status. HYCR patients completed 1 to 12 sessions in-facility, with the balance completed virtually using synchronized, 2-way audiovisual technology. Neither total number of CR sessions completed within 6 months (29 ± 12 vs 28 ± 12 visits, adjusted p = 0.94) nor percentage of patients completing 36 sessions (59 ± 4% vs 51 ± 4%, adjusted p = 0.32) were significantly different between HYCR and FBCR, respectively. The between-group changes for exercise capacity (peak oxygen uptake, 6-minute walk distance) and health status were equivalent. Regarding safety, no sessions required physician involvement, there was 1 major adverse event after a virtual session, and no falls required medical attention. In conclusion, although we rejected our primary hypothesis that attendance would be greater with HYCR versus FBCR, we showed that FBCR and HYCR resulted in similar patient attendance patterns and equivalent improvements in exercise capacity and health status. HYCR which incorporates virtually supervised exercise should be considered an acceptable alternative to FBCR.

As with the Million Hearts Cardiac Rehabilitation Collaborative, most initiatives to address the CR paradox — vast underutilization despite demonstrated benefit — have focused on increasing participation in CR. It should be noted, however, that CR programs in the United States currently lack capacity to accommodate a national enrollment rate of 70% as well as improved CR adherence. Furthermore, achieving 70% CR participation still leaves 30% of the population — perhaps concentrated in lower socioeconomic areas — unaccounted for with respect to evidenced‐based approaches for rehabilitation following acute coronary care. These and other considerations have spurred efforts to develop "alternatives" to CR, including home‐based rehabilitation programs, and hybrid approaches using mobile technologies for remote health monitoring. 11

In the current issue of JAHA, Salmoirago‐Blotcher et al, provide data from an exploratory clinical trial assessing tai chi in coronary artery disease patients who declined to enroll in CR. 12 Pointing to tai chi's safety profile, and to the perception that it may be more facile and appealing than CR for many individuals, the researchers posit tai chi as a complementary and/or alternative approach to CR. Whereas roughly half of all 106 eligible subjects did not participate because of lack of interest, 29 ultimately started the intervention and were randomized to tai chi within a CR facility twice‐weekly for 12 weeks (LITE) or 3 times weekly for 12 weeks with an extended taper (PLUS). Additional instructions for 3‐times weekly home tai chi were provided for both groups. Each participant underwent stress testing at the start of the study and wore a home accelerometer to ascertain baseline and follow‐up levels of activity. The primary feasibility, acceptability, and safety outcomes were achieved: 95% of participants gave the program a favorable rating, and there was 90% retention at 9 months, with 55% of enrollees attending at least 70% of classes. No significant adverse events were attributed to tai chi.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients [^1e646884]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

ISHLT Topic 3 — Home-based and hybrid cardiac rehabilitation and mobile health after heart transplantation — notes that home-based cardiac rehabilitation (HBCR) can be an alternative to increase access for selected clinically stable low- to moderate-risk HT patients who cannot participate in center-based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR). HBCR is recommended as an alternative to CBCR in HT patients to improve functional capacity and health-related quality of life. Hybrid cardiac rehabilitation (HCR), a combination of short-term CBCR with HBCR, should be considered in HT recipients and can also be used as an alternative to CBCR to improve functional capacity (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). Mobile health for assessing, promoting, and monitoring physical activity and fitness should be considered in HT recipients (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B).

### Cardiac rehabilitation: indications, benefits, and new approaches [^f31f2e9a]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac rehabilitation consists of comprehensive risk factor reduction with demonstrated effectiveness in combating cardiovascular disease. The American Heart Association defines cardiac rehabilitation as a supervised program to improve cardiovascular health through a combination of exercise, education, and emotional counseling for those who have had a myocardial infarction, heart failure, angioplasty, or heart surgery. Cardiac rehabilitation programs involve evaluations by a team of specialists, structured exercise, and lifestyle risk factor modification, and a focus on long-term goals to improve overall health and reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality. Family physicians play a vital role in ensuring that patients are connected to and complete cardiac rehabilitation training because the program remains underused nationwide. After a coronary heart disease event and cardiac rehabilitation, these programs continue to support patients by helping them adhere to lifestyle modifications.

### Cardiac rehabilitation enabled with health technology: innovative models of care delivery and policy to enhance health equity [^5ac6d10c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Hybrid CR models, which combine both center‐based CR and home‐based CR, may be able to provide the best practical solution, especially when enhanced by appropriate health technology (Figure). While maintaining in‐person safety evaluation and human‐based components of center‐based CR, remote delivery of various other components of CR can occur through home‐based CR. With appropriate use of health technology, this could scale to rural and low‐income communities and vulnerable populations, allowing for increase in CR supply without exacerbating health disparities. For example, at the Johns Hopkins mTECH Center, the mTECH REHAB trial is testing a hybrid CR program that combines initial in‐center CR sessions with home‐based CR delivered through the Corrie Health technology platform, in order to assess change in functional status plus various safety and clinical outcomes in a broad group of patients with an indication for CR. It is anticipated that in addition to improving clinical outcomes, a hybrid CR model could also demonstrate promotion of health equity through appropriate use of health technology.

RISK STRATIFICATION

A priority for home‐based or hybrid CR is patient safety. Current clinical practice patterns may be overly conservative, hindering patient participation in home‐based or hybrid CR programs. In 2012, the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation published an algorithm to stratify patients based on risk of adverse event, where low‐risk criteria include an ejection fraction > 50%, no resting or exercise‐induced dysrhythmias, absence of angina during exercise, a functional capacity of at least 7.0 metabolic equivalents, and lack of cognitive limitations. However, the reported rate of adverse events in CR is very low, with ≈1 event in 400 000 to 800 000 patient hours of exercise. The reported incidence rate of severe adverse events is also low among those participating in home‐based CR, estimated at 1 event in 23 823 patient‐hours of home‐based exercise (with no deaths or hospitalizations), and among which more than half of the patients were technically classified as high‐risk. Moreover, in the HF‐ACTION (Heart‐Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training) trial, where patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%) were randomized to undergo a fully center‐based CR versus hybrid CR program, there was no significant difference in safety outcomes between the 2 groups, although these patients would have been considered high risk based on the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation criterion of low left ventricular ejection fraction. With more technology available to aid home‐based monitoring of vital signs and other cardiovascular risk factors, the risk of adverse events may be even lower with appropriate clinical oversight. Hence, there is a need to develop a modernized risk stratification tool to avoid inappropriate exclusion from home exercise and to allow more patients to benefit from hybrid CR programs.

A risk calculator is needed that can determine which patients require a center‐based CR visit to optimize transitions between the hospital and home setting. In the same way that patients in the hospital have physical therapy assessments in order to determine placement postdischarge, this risk calculator could be used by inpatient clinicians to help determine which low‐risk and low‐to‐moderate–risk patients can safely participate in home‐based or hybrid CR programs, respectively, to ultimately improve CR uptake. Further studies are needed to develop and validate such risk stratification tools.

### Sex differences in cardiac rehabilitation outcomes [^7ad0f07c]. Circulation Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in males and females in the United States and globally. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is recommended by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology for secondary prevention for patients with cardiovascular disease. CR participation is associated with improved cardiovascular disease risk factor management, quality of life, and exercise capacity as well as reductions in hospital admissions and mortality. Despite these advantageous clinical outcomes, significant sex disparities exist in outpatient phase II CR programming. This article reviews sex differences that are present in the spectrum of care provided by outpatient phase II CR programming (ie, from referral to clinical management). We first review CR participation by detailing the sex disparities in the rates of CR referral, enrollment, and completion. In doing so, we discuss patient, health care provider, and social/environmental level barriers to CR participation with a particular emphasis on those barriers that majorly impact females. We also evaluate sex differences in the core components incorporated into CR programming (eg, patient assessment, exercise training, hypertension management). Next, we review strategies to mitigate these sex differences in CR participation with a focus on automatic CR referral, female-only CR programming, and hybrid CR. Finally, we outline knowledge gaps and areas of future research to minimize and prevent sex differences in CR programming.

### Rationale and design of the mTECH-rehab randomized controlled trial: impact of a mobile technology enabled corrie cardiac rehabilitation program on functional status and cardiovascular health [^ef010c9f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an evidence‐based, guideline‐recommended intervention for patients recovering from a cardiac event, surgery or procedure that improves morbidity, mortality, and functional status. CR is traditionally provided in‐center, which limits access and engagement, most notably among underrepresented racial and ethnic groups due to barriers including cost, scheduling, and transportation access. This study is designed to evaluate the Corrie Hybrid CR, a technology‐based, multicomponent health equity‐focused intervention as an alternative to traditional in‐center CR among patients recovering from a cardiac event, surgery, or procedure compared with usual care alone.

Methods

The mTECH‐Rehab (Impact of a Mobile Technology Enabled Corrie CR Program) trial will randomize 200 patients who either have a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction or who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention, heart valve repair, or replacement presenting to 4 hospitals in a large academic health system in Maryland, United States, to the Corrie Hybrid CR program combined with usual care CR (intervention group) or usual care CR alone (control group) in a parallel arm, randomized controlled trial. The Corrie Hybrid CR program leverages 5 components: (1) a patient‐facing mobile application that encourages behavior change, patient empowerment, and engagement with guideline‐directed therapy; (2) Food and Drug Administration‐approved smart devices that collect health metrics; (3) 2 upfront in‐center CR sessions to facilitate personalization, self‐efficacy, and evaluation for the safety of home exercise, followed by a combination of in‐center and home‐based sessions per participant preference; (4) a clinician dashboard to track health data; and (5) weekly virtual coaching sessions delivered over 12 weeks for education, encouragement, and risk factor modification. The primary outcome is the mean difference between the intervention versus control groups in distance walked on the 6‐minute walk test (ie, functional capacity) at 12 weeks post randomization. Key secondary and exploratory outcomes include improvement in a composite cardiovascular health metric, CR engagement, quality of life, health factors (including low‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, weight, diet, smoking cessation, blood pressure), and psychosocial factors. Approval for the study was granted by the local institutional review board. Results of the trial will be published once data collection and analysis have been completed.

Conclusions

The Corrie Hybrid CR program has the potential to improve functional status, cardiovascular health, and CR engagement and advance equity in access to cardiac rehabilitation.

### Global perspectives on heart disease rehabilitation and secondary prevention: a scientific statement from the association of cardiovascular nursing and allied professions, European association of preventive cardiology, and international council of cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation [^a0751d70]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The ICCPR's global audit of CR found that of the countries globally with any CR, in 77% of countries, programmes offer traditional supervised CR. In almost half of countries with CR, at least some programmes offer alternative models (this corresponds to 25% of all countries globally; see below), including 34% of countries with CR offering home-based CR and 23% community-based, with no difference in HICs vs. LMICs. Where home-based is offered, ∼20% of a programme's patients participate in that model. Finally, almost 9% of programmes globally (from 24 countries) offer some form of hybrid model, where patients transition from hospital-based CR to some other form of delivery, which can be highly patient-centred.

To improve access, telehealth CR interventions could be offered to patients who cannot attend traditional centre-based CR programme as well as an adjunct to CR programmes to improve long-term adherence. Detailed reviews of digital approaches to CR provision and challenges to implementation in low-income setting are presented elsewhere.

Global variation in cardiac rehabilitation density

As has been touched on above, despite a robust quality and quantity of evidence of benefit, CR is insufficiently available in every country of the world. The ICCPR's 2020 global audit update revealed 5848 programmes in 111 (54.7%) countries globally. Given the annual capacity in each programme (where available) and incidence of CHD, there is only one CR spot per 12 patients in need each year globally (these figures do not consider HF). There is wide regional variation in CR density, ranging from one CR spot for every four patients in the Americas, to for every 283 patients in South-East Asia and every 529 in Africa. In terms of unmet need on a national level, the greatest need exists in India and China (> 3 million more CR spots/country needed per year), followed by Russia (additional 1.2 million CR spots/year needed). Unfortunately, there are few CR guidelines available in these settings, despite a need to be tailored to local context (Table 2; collated via ICCPR's network in addition to the literature search.)

### Home-based cardiac rehabilitation alone and hybrid with center-based cardiac rehabilitation in heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fd35219f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Outcomes

We evaluated functional capacity and hr‐QoL as primary outcomes, and hospital admissions (all‐cause and cardiac) and all‐cause mortality as secondary outcomes.

Functional capacity was measured by cardiopulmonary exercise test, exercise stress test, 6‐minute walk test or incremental shuttle walk test. When studies assessed functional capacity using both maximal stress (ie, cardiopulmonary exercise test or exercise stress test) and submaximal stress (ie, 6‐minute walk test or incremental shuttle walk test), data from maximal stress were extracted. For uniformity of data, all measures of functional capacity were converted to peak oxygen uptake by using the following formulas: Peak oxygen uptake = 4.948+[0.023×6‐minute walk distance (meters)] or Peak oxygen uptake = 4.19+[0.025×incremental shuttle walk distance (meters)]. 13, 14

For hr‐QOL, studies reported general hr‐QOL, HF‐specific hr‐QOL questionnaires, or both. For those that reported both, we pooled the scores only from HF‐specific questionnaires — Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLWHF), 15 Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), 16 Chronic Heart Failure Questionnaire (CHF Questionnaire), 17 and Heart Failure Functional Status Inventory 18 — to be specific, when possible, for HF. For the remaining studies, we pooled the hr‐QOL tool that was utilized, general or HF‐specific. For uniformity purposes, mean differences of the scores from these distinct questionnaires were standardized by dividing them by their own standard deviation and then reported as standardized mean differences (SMDs). The scores in MLWHF were reverse coded because, unlike other hr‐QOL tools, a decrease in MLWHF score indicates better hr‐QOL.

Risk for all‐cause and cardiac‐specific hospitalizations (HF, revascularization, acute myocardial infarction) were extracted as relative risks.

All‐cause mortality was low overall, and deaths were counted if they occurred during the study period.

Data Extraction

Some studies did not report a direct comparison of the change from baseline between the arms; instead, they only compared postintervention scores. In those cases, mean change from baseline within each study arm was calculated by subtracting mean functional capacity or hr‐QoL score at entrance from the exit value. To err on the conservative side, the higher standard deviation between the entry or the exit results was selected as the standard deviation for the change from baseline within each arm.

### Efficacy and adherence rates of a novel community-informed virtual world-based cardiac rehabilitation program: protocol for theRandomized controlled trial [^34c6fff8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Innovative restructuring of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) delivery remains critical to reduce barriers and improve access to diverse populations. Destination Cardiac Rehab is a novel virtual world technology-based CR program delivered through the virtual world platform, Second Life, which previously demonstrated high acceptability as an extension of traditional center-based CR. This study aims to evaluate efficacy and adherence of the virtual world-based CR program compared with center-based CR within a community-informed, implementation science framework.

Methods

Using a noninferiority, hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation, randomized controlled trial, 150 patients with an eligible cardiovascular event will be recruited from 6 geographically diverse CR centers across the United States. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either the 12-week Destination Cardiac Rehab or the center-based CR control groups. The primary efficacy outcome is a composite cardiovascular health score based on the American Heart Association Life's Essential 8 at 3 and 6months. Adherence outcomes include CR session attendance and participation in exercise sessions. A diverse patient/caregiver/stakeholder advisory board was assembled to guide recruitment, implementation, and dissemination plans and to contextualize study findings. The institutional review board-approved randomized controlled trial will enroll and randomize patients to the intervention (or control group) in 3 consecutive waves/year over 3years. The results will be published at data collection and analyses completion.

Conclusions

The Destination Cardiac Rehab randomized controlled trial tests an innovative and potentially scalable model to enhance CR participation and advance health equity. Our findings will inform the use of effective virtual CR programs to expand equitable access to diverse patient populations.

### Effects of a physical therapist-driven individualized hybrid model of the exercise component of cardiac rehabilitation on patient outcomes: a prospective single group, time-series design [^1a444eb6]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this prospective single group, time-series study was to determine the feasibility, adherence, and effectiveness of an individualized physical therapist (PT)-driven hybrid model of the exercise component of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) that uses a novel intensity-recovery progression protocol (IRPP) and cardiac testing template (CTT) to assess achieved heart rate (HR) intensity, HR recovery, and intensity-recovery total to guide treatment.

Methods

Assessment of a questionnaire, treadmill 6-min walk (6MW), 1-min sit-to-stand (1STS), 1-min step, and 1-min agility square tests were assessed on 100 participants. Compared to traditional CR the 36-visit 1:1 hybrid model was individualized using the IRPP program and CTT.

Results

Adherence was 35% (timely) and 44% (overall) completion. The per-protocol analysis (PPA) and intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis suggest significant improvement in objective assessments baseline to visit 15 (PPA = 11 of 14) (ITT = 13 of 14), baseline to visit 30 (PPA = 12 of 14) (ITT = 12 of 14) and visit 15 to visit 30 (PPA = 9 of 14) (ITT = 10 of 14). Improvement beyond the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was 94.3% in the 6MW and 91.4% in the 1STS.

Conclusions

The PT-driven IRPP program was feasible in terms of adherence and safety, showing significant improvement in a majority of assessments. Analysis of HR using the CTT may help clinical decision making for progression in CR.

### A new era in cardiac rehabilitation delivery: research gaps, questions, strategies, and priorities [^e7280056]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Technology

The role of technology in supporting delivery of CR is increasingly being recognized. In 2013, a mobile technology framework for CR was introduced. Subsequent innovation and the shift toward virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic have accelerated technology adoption in CR. Delivery of CR services at a patient's home using technology is not a replacement for in-person CR, but rather an opportunity to reach more patients or bolster the effects of in-person CR. It offers an alternative to overcome barriers to in-person CR, such as time and travel. Hybrid CR, which combines in-person and remote components, requires further investigation as a promising opportunity for extending reach, overcoming barriers, and improving outcomes. When using technology, it is important that a virtual or remote approach continues to embrace the established standards and best practices of in-person CR.

The use of technology in delivering CR has not been standardized. A plethora of terms are used to describe these delivery platforms: telemedicine, telehealth, eHealth, mobile health, digital health, remote care, and virtual care. A recent systematic review on technology in CR uses the terminology "digital health intervention", referring to use of technologies beyond the telephone, including the internet, wearable devices, and mobile applications. This terminology is consistent with the verbiage of the World Health Organization proposal for shared language to describe the uses of digital technology for health.

The most commonly reported modalities for digital health interventions in CR, as summarized in a recent systematic review, included smartphones or mobile devices (n = 20/31 studies [65%]), web-based portals (n = 18/31 studies [58%]), and email/short message service communication (n = 11/31 studies [35%]). Other technology modalities for CR and CVD care more broadly may include video communication platforms, pedometers and accelerometers, tele-ECG, chest and wrist heart rate sensors, blood pressure monitors, and artificial intelligence. Multiple proprietary commercial mobile applications have emerged to support the expansion of virtual and remote CR services. Future research should identify effective combinations of digital health tools for achieving CR goals; this will likely vary by patient population.

Usual Care

Usual care is defined as medical care that is provided by the patient's clinician team, regardless of study participation status. At our enrolling hospitals, a typical clinical course is as follows: (1) hospital encounter for index cardiac event/surgery/procedure; (2) CR referral order is placed as part of standardized discharge order set; (3) CR center processes referral order, verifies insurance status, and schedules intake session (typical timeline of 2–4 weeks); and (4) CR program is initiated and continued as 30‐minute to 1‐hour exercise sessions guided by an exercise physiologist at a frequency of 2 to 3 sessions per week for up to 36 sessions, until exercise targets are met (typical timeline of 12–14 weeks to complete center‐based CR program). Aside from this typical clinical course, patients randomized to the usual care group will not be referred by the study team to any other specific programs or receive other interventions during their study participation.

### Developing and delivering a hybrid cardiac rehabilitation phase II exercise program during the COVID-19 pandemic: a quality improvement program [^02123b52]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

The feasibility of the home-based component of HCRP2-EP was proven by; the high level of enrolment (91.1% of eligible male patients, 90% monthly median enrolment) (figure 2), the low technological barrier reported with only 4 out of 40 (10%) ineligible patients, and moreover, the high compliance (92%) to the home-based component of HCRP2-EP (figure 3). It should be acknowledged that compliance rates for both home-based and hospital-based were abnormally high when compared with available evidence. We hypothesised this was due to patients having more time available at home due to pandemic restrictions, and a likelihood that only motivated and engaged patients would have chosen to participate in exercise during the pandemic period, among other factors.

In terms of intervention effectiveness, the monthly median percentage of patients who improved their peak exercise capacity more than the departmental target of 10% pre-to-post intervention was 75%, which is above both our institutional target of 70%, and our historical median for the period 2013–2019 of 68%. These results are also in line with what has previously been reported in several studies.

For technology-related critical issues that prevented the planned treatment from being completed, the source of the problem was always on the clinician side (100%) and represented 9.6% of total observed home-based exercises sessions. Overall, 3.2% of total sessions experienced issues with the remote ECG telemonitoring equipment and 6.4% on the telehealth platform. For non-critical issues 10.1% of the sessions experienced issues from patient's side, 2.3% from clinician side and 2.3% from patient and clinician side simultaneously.

### Health care use and expenditures associated with cardiac rehabilitation among eligible Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries [^7e9e53f1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Although 38.5% of eligible beneficiaries were removed from the study cohort due to our Medicare Part D continuous enrollment criteria for the duration of the study period (6 years), we did this because prescription drug expenditures are an important consideration among individuals with heart disease. In our study, at baseline (year 2016), nearly all individuals had medication expenditures (99.9%), ranging from $ > 0 to $611 329, and Part D claims accounted for ≈20% of total medical expenditures overall. If we had kept individuals in our study without continuous Medicare Part D enrollment, a large proportion of the expenditure calculation would have been missed — a main contribution of our study. As CR treatment includes medication education, pharmacist care/support, and access to free medication programs, one systematic review protocol describes examining the potential of CR programs to improve medication adherence in patients with cardiovascular disease.

Not only is CR associated with many health benefits, including reductions in mortality (overall and cardiovascular‐related) and improvements in exercise capacity and quality of life, our study shows an association with reductions in inpatient hospitalizations and expenditures. These reductions in expenditures will be relevant to Medicare and private insurers. However, CR is currently underutilized at the population level; Keteyian et al. found that only 28.6% of eligible patients initiated CR, and we found that only 35.0% of eligible patients participated in CR. CR enrollment and participation are lower than national goals owing to individual‐level, system‐level, and geographic factors. The Million Hearts CR Collaborative has committed to increasing CR participation to 70%. Hospital administrators and CR champions can use strategies from the Million Hearts CR Change Packageto help achieve the national goal for CR participation. Findings from this study could be used by CR leaders to empower health systems and administrators to encourage more CR participation (and sustained participation over 12 sessions). In addition, the cost estimates generated from our study could be used to examine the cost‐effectiveness of in‐person CR compared with virtual or hybrid CR programs, which increased in prevalence in response to the recent COVID pandemic.
