diabates management

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diabetes management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching paradigm shift from glucose-centric to complication-centric care. Then, I should verify foundational lifestyle and behavioral strategies. Next, I will review pharmacologic choices by cardiorenal risk phenotype, including metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors, and I need to check where insulin fits. After that, I should confirm monitoring and individualization principles, including A1C targets and CGM. Then, I will examine implementation science, equity, and access. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight special populations and emerging directions, making sure each assertion is supported by current guidelines or high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the paradigm shift, because if I miss this, downstream choices will be misaligned. Contemporary management prioritizes preventing complications and addressing metabolic drivers like obesity, rather than chasing isolated A1C reductions, and this is reflected in ADA 2025 and AACE 2023 algorithms that embed cardiorenal risk reduction and weight management into first-line pharmacologic decisions, not as afterthoughts [^114opwT2] [^115tN3h7] [^117YGXWK].

> I need to ensure foundational lifestyle and behavioral strategies are front and center, since they underpin all therapy and can be disease-modifying early on. Nutrition therapy should be individualized and culturally tailored, with emphasis on energy deficit for weight loss, and structured DSMES should be offered at diagnosis and reinforced annually or when goals are unmet, using interactive, problem-solving approaches that address psychosocial barriers and build self-efficacy [^1157Df3R] [^114JZZer].

> Wait, let me verify the weight-loss threshold that meaningfully alters diabetes trajectory, because this influences how aggressively I counsel and medicate. Evidence suggests that weight loss of about 15% or more can have disease-modifying effects in type 2 diabetes, improving glycemia and cardiometabolic risk beyond what most glucose-lowering drugs achieve, which supports a weight-centric approach in appropriate candidates [^112cLmUE].

> Next, I should review pharmacotherapy for patients without established ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD, and I need to check whether metformin remains first-line. ADA 2025 and AACE 2023 continue to endorse metformin as initial therapy unless contraindicated, ideally started alongside lifestyle at diagnosis, with timely titration and early addition of agents if targets are not met to avoid therapeutic inertia [^115tN3h7] [^111BMTFs].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach for patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk, because this is where the paradigm most clearly diverges from older algorithms. For these phenotypes, independent of baseline A1C, GLP-1 receptor agonists with proven cardiovascular benefit and/or SGLT2 inhibitors with cardiorenal benefit are preferred, and in many cases should be prioritized even before or alongside metformin, reflecting the complication-centric model [^115tN3h7] [^114rkHe5].

> I will now examine the CKD and heart failure populations, and I need to ensure I am precise about which agents have outcome data. SGLT2 inhibitors with kidney and heart failure benefits are strongly recommended in T2D with CKD or HF, and GLP-1 receptor agonists are reasonable alternatives or adjuncts, with metformin use adjusted for eGFR thresholds and continued as tolerated for glycemic and metabolic effects [^114rkHe5] [^115tN3h7].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with severe hyperglycemia or metabolic decompensation. In symptomatic hyperglycemia, A1C ≥ 10%, or fasting glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL, I should confirm that insulin is often indicated initially to rapidly restore glycemic control, with subsequent de-intensification once stabilized, and I should remember that early, short-term intensive therapy can occasionally lead to remission in select patients, though durability varies [^111gjVNW] [^111amviP].

> Next, I should review monitoring and individualization, and I need to double-check A1C targets and the role of CGM. AACE supports an optimal A1C ≤ 6.5% when safe and achievable, but ADA emphasizes individualization by comorbidity, age, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences, and both increasingly endorse CGM to improve time-in-range and reduce hypoglycemia, with structured SMBG reserved for patients who will use the data to adjust therapy [^117CAmZw] [^114opwT2] [^112Q9k7m].

> I should confirm the implementation science backbone, because without reliable systems, even the best plans fail. Team-based care, registries, decision support, proactive outreach, and integration of DSMES into workflows improve process and outcome metrics, and quality improvement programs that bundle multiple strategies can yield population-level HbA1c improvements of roughly 0.3–0.4%, which is clinically meaningful at scale [^1114hJVh] [^115LGDau].

> Let me consider equity and access, and I need to ensure I am not overlooking cost-related nonadherence. ADA 2025 explicitly recommends routine assessment of financial barriers and, when needed, preferential selection of lower-cost generics such as metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and human insulin, while also leveraging social work and community resources to close gaps, because access and affordability directly shape outcomes [^115JRcg9] [^115Kx4cT] [^1114hJVh].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and settings so I do not overgeneralize. In older adults or those with limited life expectancy, less intensive A1C targets and simplified regimens are appropriate. In youth with T2D, lifestyle-first management is essential. In pregnancy, insulin is standard. And in inpatient care, networked point-of-care glucose and ketone testing with protocolized basal-bolus or CGM-enabled approaches reduces hypoglycemia and errors, while structured education remains foundational in type 1 diabetes across ages [^117Lm1F5] [^114v95zQ] [^113WWwG5] [^112E7Cuf].

> I will now synthesize a practical decision framework, and I should double-check that it aligns with the cited algorithms. Start with person-centered assessment of comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and goals. Choose lifestyle plus metformin for most, but prioritize GLP-1 RA and/or SGLT2 inhibitor in ASCVD, CKD, or HF. Escalate within 3 months if not at goal. Integrate DSMES and address SDOH. And iterate at least annually, documenting shared decision-making and aligning with the patient's values and context [^111BMTFs] [^115tN3h7] [^114opwT2].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that GLP-1 RAs are categorically first-line for everyone with obesity, but I should correct that nuance. While obesity strongly supports choosing GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors for their weight and cardiometabolic benefits, formal first-line positioning still hinges on cardiorenal risk phenotype and patient-specific factors, so I need to frame this as preferred in obesity with comorbidity risk rather than universal first-line for all with obesity [^115tN3h7] [^114opwT2] [^112cLmUE].

> Finally, I need to ensure I am capturing emerging directions and uncertainties so the plan remains forward-looking. Combination GLP-1 RA plus SGLT2 inhibitor therapy is promising but awaits definitive outcome data. Precision phenotyping and early aggressive intervention may enable remission in select patients. And digital therapeutics can augment DSMES, though effectiveness varies and equity in digital access must be addressed proactively [^117YGXWK] [^111amviP] [^113q15Xe].

Diabetes management centers on **individualized, team-based care** [^1114hJVh] that integrates lifestyle, pharmacotherapy, and continuous monitoring to reduce complications and improve quality of life [^116qZT8W] [^112Q9k7m] [^112nAFox]. For type 2 diabetes, start with lifestyle and metformin [^114dK8ee], then add GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors if ASCVD/CKD/HF is present or risk is high [^114rkHe5] [^1166XBdv]; for type 1 diabetes, use **insulin as foundational therapy** with structured education and CGM [^114p1JTF] [^112E7Cuf] [^112Q9k7m]. Address social determinants, use shared decision-making, and implement quality-improvement strategies to close care gaps and sustain outcomes [^1114hJVh] [^115LGDau].

---

## Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle interventions are the cornerstone of diabetes management, with benefits for glycemic control, weight, blood pressure, and lipids [^114dK8ee]:

- **Nutrition therapy**: Individualized meal planning, carbohydrate management, and weight loss strategies are essential [^114bHHbj].
- **Physical activity**: At least 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, plus resistance training, improves insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular health [^117XjXR9].
- **Weight management**: Aim for 5–10% weight loss; ≥ 15% loss can be disease-modifying in type 2 diabetes [^112cLmUE].
- **Behavioral support**: Structured education, motivational interviewing, and ongoing support improve adherence and outcomes [^1157Df3R].

---

## Pharmacologic management

Pharmacotherapy is individualized based on comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences [^116uW7GJ]:

| **Medication class** | **Indication** | **Key considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Metformin | First-line for type 2 diabetes | - Gastrointestinal side effects <br/> - Lactic acidosis risk in renal impairment [^114dK8ee] |
| GLP-1 receptor agonists | - ASCVD <br/> - CKD <br/> - Obesity | - Gastrointestinal side effects <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Cardiorenal benefits [^114rkHe5] [^117XjXR9] |
| SGLT2 inhibitors | - Heart failure <br/> - CKD <br/> - ASCVD | - Genital infections <br/> - Euglycemic DKA <br/> - Cardiorenal benefits [^114rkHe5] [^117XjXR9] |
| Insulin | Type 1 diabetes; advanced type 2 diabetes | - Hypoglycemia <br/> - Weight gain <br/> - Requires education [^116hZUmF] |
| DPP-4 inhibitors | Alternative oral therapy | Neutral weight; low hypoglycemia risk [^111hSmFo] |
| Thiazolidinediones | Alternative oral therapy | - Weight gain <br/> - Edema <br/> - Fractures [^111hSmFo] |

---

## Monitoring and individualized targets

Regular monitoring and individualized targets are essential: **A1C** should be checked at least twice yearly [^notfound], with individualized targets (generally < 7.0% if safe) [^111gjVNW]; **blood pressure** should be targeted to < 130/80 mmHg when tolerated; and **lipid management** should include statin therapy for ASCVD risk [^notfound]. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is recommended for type 1 diabetes and for type 2 diabetes when intensive therapy is used or hypoglycemia is a concern [^notfound].

---

## Management of complications

Comprehensive care addresses microvascular and macrovascular complications: **retinopathy** requires annual eye exams and timely laser or anti-VEGF therapy; **nephropathy** involves ACE inhibitors/ARBs, SGLT2 inhibitors, and regular kidney function monitoring; **neuropathy** management includes gabapentin, pregabalin, or duloxetine; and **cardiovascular disease** should be managed with aggressive risk-factor control and antiplatelet therapy when indicated [^113FAqMC] [^117XjXR9].

---

## Patient education and self-management

Diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) is critical and should be provided at diagnosis and reinforced regularly [^114JZZer]. Key components include **nutrition, physical activity, medication adherence, glucose monitoring, and problem-solving** [^115rHqT7]. Technology-enabled interventions (apps, telemedicine) can enhance engagement and outcomes [^113q15Xe].

---

## Addressing social determinants of health

Social determinants significantly impact diabetes outcomes. Clinicians should routinely assess financial barriers, food insecurity, and access to care, and connect patients with resources to address these issues [^115JRcg9] [^1114hJVh].

---

## Emerging therapies and technologies

Advances include **closed-loop insulin systems** for type 1 diabetes, novel glucose-lowering agents such as GIP/GLP-1 co-agonists, and digital health tools for remote monitoring and education [^112Q9k7m] [^113q15Xe].

---

## Quality improvement and care coordination

Team-based care, registries, and decision support tools improve adherence and outcomes [^1114hJVh]. Quality improvement initiatives targeting clinical inertia and care gaps are essential [^111BMTFs].

---

Diabetes management requires a **comprehensive, individualized approach** that integrates lifestyle, pharmacotherapy, and monitoring, with attention to complications, education, and social determinants. Emerging technologies and quality-improvement strategies further enhance care and outcomes [^117HC5WE].

### Type 1 diabetes structured education: what are the core self-management behaviours? [^112E7Cuf]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Study aims were to (1) describe and compare the way diabetes structured education courses have evolved in the UK, (2) identify and agree components of course curricula perceived as core across courses and (3) identify and classify self-care behaviours in order to develop a questionnaire assessment tool.

Methods

Structured education courses were selected through the Type 1 diabetes education network. Curricula from five courses were examined and nine educators from those courses were interviewed. Transcripts were analysed using framework analysis. Fourteen key stakeholders attended a consensus meeting, to identify and classify Type 1 diabetes self-care behaviours.

Results

Eighty-three courses were identified. Components of course curricula perceived as core by all diabetes educators were: carbohydrate counting and insulin dose adjustment, hypoglycaemia management, group work, goal setting and empowerment, confidence and control. The broad areas of self-management behaviour identified at the consensus meeting were carbohydrate counting and awareness, insulin dose adjustment, self-monitoring of blood glucose, managing hypoglycaemia, managing equipment and injection sites; and accessing health care. Specific self-care behaviours within each area were identified.

Conclusions

Planned future work will develop an updated questionnaire tool to access self-care behaviours. This will enable assessment of the effectiveness of existing structured education programmes at producing desired changes in behaviour. It will also help people with diabetes and their healthcare team identify areas where additional support is needed to initiate or maintain changes in behaviour. Provision of such support may improve glycaemia and reduce diabetes-related complications and severe hypoglycaemia.

### Multiple long-term conditions as the next transition in the global diabetes epidemic [^114wXH1z]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

It is important to understand what these transitions mean for the future of research and public health programmes. The rapid developments in precision medicine, multi-omics, artificial intelligence, and data science will each play a role in clarifying the diabetes-associated pathways and unique modifiable risk factors for prevention and management of MLTCs. However, if MLTCs are the next major transition in the diabetes epidemic, and the key drivers lie at both ends of the age spectrum as we suggest, the most practical priorities will lie in prevention, ongoing or routine care models and coordination, and globally, population monitoring. The key questions for prevention and management are whether the approaches (e.g. lifestyle interventions, self-management, better risk stratification, pharmaceutical interventions; better-integrated care) are distinct from what works for its constituent component or whether distinct, bespoke approaches are needed for MLTCs. The search for promising prevention approaches has centred around lifestyle interventions with physical activity to prevent functional decline and the use of multi-disciplinary teams to target the pharmacological, medical and self-management challenges of MLTCs, but consensus on the degree of effectiveness is still lacking. Observational studies have suggested that weight loss in obese people can have beneficial effects in some concordant and discordant conditions but few weight loss intervention studies have evaluated the impact on MLTCs. Better population monitoring, and with it, the need for more efficient and textured metrics, alongside simple measurements that can be applied internationally, are needed. There is also a need to expand the prevention agenda beyond HICs while improving the ability to monitor the problem using new metrics.

### Personalized versus non-personalized nutritional recommendations / interventions for type 2 diabetes mellitus remission: a narrative review [^115ULkTc]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Perspectives

Together, the findings in this review underline the importance of focusing on individualized approaches and early intervention in diabetes management. It is remarkable how the perception of diabetes, once considered a lifelong condition, has turned towards being potentially curable for some patients. Further research in this area is crucial to gain a comprehensive understanding of the long-term implications of these interventions and their potential to revolutionize T2DM management.

Achieving remission from T2DM is possible for many patients, especially when using personalized and lifestyle-based approaches. This underscores the importance of an early intervention in managing the disease. Both low-calorie and low-carbohydrate diets have demonstrated their effectiveness in promoting weight loss and T2DM remission, although it is important to consider long-term sustainability. Personalized nutrition has proven effective in enhancing blood glucose control by adapting treatments on the basis of individual responses.

These investigations provide valuable insights into T2DM management, emphasizing that achieving disease remission is an attainable goal. Personalized approaches, early intervention, and consideration of physical fitness are key components of disease management, offering the potential to improve patient's quality of life and healthcare resource efficiency.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^113jySzk]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Process

The guidelines and algorithm that follow are derived from two sources. One source is the clinical trials that address the effectiveness and safety of the different modalities of therapy. Here, the writing group reviewed a wide variety of studies related to the use of drugs as monotherapy or in combination to lower glycemia. Unfortunately, the paucity of high-quality evidence in the form of well-controlled clinical trials that directly compare different diabetes treatment regimens remains a major impediment to recommending one class of drugs, or a particular combination of therapies, over another.

The second source of material that informed our recommendations was clinical judgement, that is, our collective knowledge and clinical experience, which takes into account benefits, risks, and costs in the treatment of diabetes. As in all clinical decision making, an evidence-based review of the literature must also be supplemented by value judgements, where the benefits of treatment are weighed against risks and costs in a subjective fashion. While we realize that others may have different judgements, we believe that the recommendations made in this new iteration of our treatment algorithm will guide therapy and result in improved glycemic control and health status over time.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, 2018. A consensus report by the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^114rkHe5]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes convened a panel to update the prior position statements, published in 2012 and 2015, on the management of type 2 diabetes in adults. A systematic evaluation of the literature since 2014 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on lifestyle management and diabetes self-management education and support. For those with obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, medication, and surgical interventions, are recommended. With regards to medication management, for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended. For patients with chronic kidney disease or clinical heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally recommended as the first injectable medication.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^112nAFox]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The epidemic of type 2 diabetes and the recognition that achieving specific glycemic goals can substantially reduce morbidity have made the effective treatment of hyperglycemia a top priority. While the management of hyperglycemia, the hallmark metabolic abnormality associated with type 2 diabetes, has historically taken center stage in the treatment of diabetes, therapies directed at other coincident features, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, hypercoagulability, obesity, and insulin resistance, have also been a major focus of research and therapy. Maintaining glycemic levels as close to the nondiabetic range as possible has been demonstrated to have a powerful beneficial effect on diabetes-specific microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, in the setting of type 1 diabetes; in type 2 diabetes, more intensive treatment strategies have likewise been demonstrated to reduce microvascular complications. Intensive glycemic management resulting in lower A1C levels has also been shown to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications in type 1 diabetes; however, current studies have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of intensive diabetes therapy on CVD in type 2 diabetes.

The development of new classes of blood glucose–lowering medications to supplement the older therapies, such as lifestyle-directed interventions, insulin, sulfonylureas, and metformin, has increased the number of treatment options available for type 2 diabetes. Whether used alone or in combination with other blood glucose–lowering interventions, the increased number of choices available to practitioners and patients has heightened uncertainty regarding the most appropriate means of treating this widespread disease. Although numerous reviews on the management of type 2 diabetes have been published in recent years, practitioners are often left without a clear pathway of therapy to follow. We developed the following consensus approach to the management of hyperglycemia in the nonpregnant adult to help guide health care providers in choosing the most appropriate interventions for their patients with type 2 diabetes.

### The final frontier in diabetes care: implementing research in real-world practice [^115zyVT2]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite extensive evidence related to the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its complications, most people at risk for and people who have diabetes do not receive recommended guideline-based care. Clinical implementation of proven care strategies is of the utmost importance because without this, even the most impressive research findings will remain of purely academic interest. In this review, we discuss the promise and challenges of implementing effective approaches to diabetes prevention and care in the real-world setting. We describe successful implementation projects in three critical areas of diabetes care-diabetes prevention, glycemic control, and prevention of diabetes-related complications-which provide a basis for further clinical translation and an impetus to improve the prevention and control of T2D in the community. Advancing the clinical translation of evidence-based care must include recognition of and assessment of existing gaps in care, identification of barriers to the delivery of optimal care, and a locally appropriate plan to address and overcome these barriers. Care models that promote team-based approaches, rather than reliance on patient-provider interactions, will enhance the delivery of contemporary comprehensive diabetes care.

### Weight management in type 2 diabetes: current and emerging approaches to treatment [^115kMTVq]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a growing global health concern, as is obesity. Diabetes and obesity are intrinsically linked: obesity increases the risk of diabetes and also contributes to disease progression and cardiovascular disease. Although the benefits of weight loss in the prevention of diabetes and as a critical component of managing the condition are well established, weight reduction remains challenging for individuals with type 2 diabetes due to a host of metabolic and psychological factors. For many patients, lifestyle intervention is not enough to achieve weight loss, and alternative options, such as pharmacotherapy, need to be considered. However, many traditional glucose-lowering medications may lead to weight gain. This article focuses on the potential of currently available pharmacological strategies and on emerging approaches in development to support the glycemic and weight-loss goals of individuals with type 2 diabetes. Two pharmacotherapy types are considered: those developed primarily for blood glucose control that have a favorable effect on body weight and those developed primarily to induce weight loss that have a favorable effect on blood glucose control. Finally, the potential of combination therapies for the management of obese patients with type 2 diabetes is discussed.

### Quality improvement strategies for diabetes care: effects on outcomes for adults living with diabetes [^115LGDau]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

How the intervention might work

Each QI strategy has a different mechanism of action that may influence the capability, opportunity and/or motivation of patients, healthcare professionals and healthcare systems (Michie 2011) to provide and act upon evidence‐based recommendations. For example, clinician education approaches typically address knowledge gaps of healthcare professionals (motivation). Patient self‐management typically addresses patients' beliefs about capabilities and skills (capability). Case management typically supports patients to access services appropriately (opportunity).

Given that there are often multiple barriers to evidence‐based diabetes care operating at different levels, QI programmes involving different QI strategies have the potential to address multiple barriers through the different mechanisms of action of the included QI strategies. The key challenge is to determine the main barriers in any given context and map these to the QI strategies likely to address them (French 2012).

The minimal clinically important difference for pharmaceutical interventions in diabetes is a reduction in HbA1c of 0.3% to 0.4% (Oh 2021). Given that QI programmes target populations of people living with diabetes, rather than individuals, and given that the decisions to implement these interventions are typically made by health system leaders responsible for large populations of patients rather than individual clinicians within a specific patient encounter, smaller effect sizes than those seen in clinical trials are both expected and can lead to significant population health improvements (Chambers 2013; Rose 1981).

### Diagnosis and management of diabetes: synopsis of the 2016 American diabetes association standards of medical care in diabetes [^1135EmjL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Description

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) published the 2016 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes (Standards) to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and other interested parties with the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals, and tools to evaluate the quality of care.

Methods

The ADA Professional Practice Committee performed a systematic search on MEDLINE to revise or clarify recommendations based on new evidence. The committee assigns the recommendations a rating of A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence. The E rating for expert opinion is assigned to recommendations based on expert consensus or clinical experience. The Standards were reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee of the ADA Board of Directors, which includes health care professionals, scientists, and laypersons. Feedback from the larger clinical community was incorporated into the 2016 revision.

Recommendations

The synopsis focuses on 8 key areas that are important to primary care providers. The recommendations highlight individualized care to manage the disease, prevent or delay complications, and improve outcomes.

### Advances in the management of type 2 diabetes in adults [^117YGXWK]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

The paradigm of diabetes management has shifted over the past decade from a predominantly glucose-centric approach to approaches that prioritise prevention of diabetes complications and addressing the underlying causes of diabetes and metabolic dysfunction, such as obesity (figure 2). High quality, evidence based management of diabetes therefore requires reducing glucose levels to a safe, patient centred range; using glucose lowering drugs with a strong evidence base for reduction of diabetes complications and excess adiposity, not just lowering levels of HbA 1c; minimising burden of treatment and improving quality of life; and implementing care delivery models that support high quality (effective, efficient, safe, equitable, timely, and person centred) care. Access and affordability remain major barriers, as is the sustainable implementation of effective lifestyle interventions.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose in noninsulin-using type 2 diabetic patients: right answer, but wrong question: self-monitoring of blood glucose can be clinically valuable for noninsulin users [^116aqCMD]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Given the importance of glycemic control in the development of diabetes complications, the plethora of tools now available to monitor the day-to-day trends in glycemia is remarkable. In this regard, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) has been considered a key component of patient management. Arguably, there remains almost universal agreement that SMBG should be available to all diabetic patients regardless of current treatment strategy. However, recently there have been reports that have challenged the current paradigm that all patients should use SMBG and concluded that SMBG for type 2 diabetic patients not on insulin may not be beneficial on glycemic control and must be weighed against the expense and inconvenience. In the counterpoint narrative following the contribution by Malanda et al. Drs. Polonsky and Fisher provide a compelling argument suggesting that while it is evident that implementing SMBG in unstructured ways without training patients and clinicians is likely to be a waste of resources, there are effective and powerful ways to use structured SMBG in insulin-naïve type 2 diabetic patients. -William T.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^114dK8ee]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Tier 1: well-validated core therapies

These interventions represent the best established and most effective and cost-effective therapeutic strategy for achieving the target glycemic goals. The tier one algorithm is the preferred route of therapy for most patients with type 2 diabetes.

Step 1: lifestyle intervention and metformin.

Based on the numerous demonstrated short- and long-term benefits that accrue when weight loss and increased levels of activity are achieved and maintained, as well as the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle interventions when they succeed, the consensus is that lifestyle interventions should be initiated as the first step in treating new-onset type 2 diabetes (Fig. 2). These interventions should be implemented by health care professionals with appropriate training — usually registered dietitians experienced in behavioral modification — and be sensitive to ethnic and cultural differences among populations. Moreover, lifestyle interventions to improve glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels, and to promote weight loss or at least avoid weight gain, should remain an underlying theme throughout the management of type 2 diabetes, even after medications are used. For the 10–20% of patients with type 2 diabetes who are not obese or overweight, modification of dietary composition and activity levels may play a supporting role, but medications are still generally required early in the course of diabetes (seebelow).

The authors recognize that for most individuals with type 2 diabetes, lifestyle interventions fail to achieve or maintain the metabolic goals either because of failure to lose weight, weight regain, progressive disease, or a combination of factors. Therefore, our consensus is that metformin therapy should be initiated concurrently with lifestyle intervention at diagnosis. Metformin is recommended as the initial pharmacological therapy, in the absence of specific contraindications, for its effect on glycemia, absence of weight gain or hypoglycemia, generally low level of side effects, high level of acceptance, and relatively low cost. Metformin treatment should be titrated to its maximally effective dose over 1–2 months, as tolerated (see text box, entitled Titration of Metformin). Rapid addition of other glucose-lowering medications should be considered in the setting of persistent symptomatic hyperglycemia.

### Care management dosage [^111dUZLm]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The care of patients with complex illnesses requires careful management, but systems of care management (CM) vary in their structure and effectiveness.

Objective

To create a framework identifying components of broad-based CM interventions and validate the framework, including using this framework to evaluate the contribution of varying components on outcomes of patients with chronic illness.

Design

We create the framework using retrospective information about CM activities and services over 12 months and categorize it using cluster and factor analysis. We then validate this framework through content and criterion techniques. Content validity is assessed through a Delphi study and criterion validity through relationship of the dosage measures and patterns of care to process and outcomes measures.

Participants

Patients with diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease receiving CM services in a model known as Care Management Plus implemented in primary care.

Results

Six factors of CM activity were identified, including a single dosage summary measure and 5 separate patterns of care. Of these, the overall dosage summary measure, face-to-face time, duration of follow-up, and breadth of services were all related to improved processes for hemoglobin A1c and LDL testing and control. Brief intense patterns of care and high face-to-face care manager time were also related to improved outcomes.

Conclusions

Using this framework, we isolate components of a CM intervention directly related to improved process of care or patient outcomes. Current efforts to structure CM to include face-to-face time and multiple diseases are discussed.

### Advances and counterpoints in type 2 diabetes. what is ready for translation into real-world practice, ahead of the guidelines [^111amviP]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Key takeaways

Recent new guideline recommendations ready to be routinely incorporated into routine practice include the following: ◦ Complication-centric prescribing should take center stage. Treatment plans should no longer 'silo' hyperglycemia as a single treatment target but rather manage it synchronously with the patient's comorbidities and risk factors. ◦ In patients with cardiorenal risk factors, long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) have been shown to provide protection and are recommended as preferred treatments. ◦ A novel algorithm enables treatment decision-making for latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) based on glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) and C-peptide testing
Several key advances in the management of type 2 diabetes are supported by strong evidence that make these ready for use in routine care, despite remaining in a 'holding pattern' before full integration into guidelines. These include: ◦ The pleiotropic benefits of several antidiabetic agents provide important new considerations to treatment decision-making; and, should be employed in treatment selection in the clinic. ◦ Disease remission should be elevated to a primary objective of case management of type 2 diabetes beyond the role it had in past routine care. The inherent resilience of beta cells can be harnessed to help remit hyperglycemia through the use of diet and lifestyle modifications and/or short-term intensive pharmacotherapy.
The underpinnings of type 2 diabetes etiology and progression have been corrected. In particular, ◦ Early type 2 diabetes is no longer considered an intractable ('inexorable') state. Beta cells, in fact, remain robust and resilient through much of the course of the disease, and with support, can resume partial or complete glucoregulation. ◦ Type 2 diabetes is not a single disease across all patients, nor does it arise from the same defects. Accordingly, tailored therapy is imperative. ◦ Precision medicine veers away from management to treatment failure with sequential add-on therapy. Instead, targeted therapy can address the individual drivers of hyperglycemia in each patient without agents that are ineffective in the given patient. ◦ Target attainment is distinctly possible with current treatments, without treatment-emergent hypoglycemia. Intensive glucose control is pivotal for preventing or offsetting diabetes-related long-term outcomes. ◦ With the expanding antidiabetes armamentarium, it is possible to reduce reliance on sulfonylureas and exogenous insulin, which present less desirable benefit: risk profiles (including weight gain, hypoglycemia, and 'wear and tear' on beta cells) than many other currently available options.

### Diabetes prevention: perspectives and actions of one company [^117QwB1V]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), has reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. and globally, highlighting the need for major improvements in treatment strategies for detecting, preventing, and slowing disease progression. Despite escalating treatment costs, diabetes care remains largely substandard, with hospitalizations for late-stage complications in particular placing a major burden on the healthcare system. Although considerable advances have been made in identifying the risk factors of diabetes and developing treatments, goals targeting prevention have remained elusive. Although there is currently no consensus regarding terminology among public health practitioners, the concept of prevention in terms of diabetes care runs the gamut from interventions used to avoid disease in individuals without risk factors (primordial prevention) to prevention of the consequences of established complications (quaternary prevention). Given the worldwide prevalence of diabetes, it is crucial to improve the quality of care for those diagnosed with overt diabetes, as well as those who have been identified as at risk for developing the disease. Earlier screening enables undiagnosed, asymptomatic individuals with diabetes to be identified sooner, managed more effectively, and where necessary, treated with the appropriate pharmacotherapeutic options in a timely manner. All stakeholders (including government, industry, professional, and patient groups) must partner in concert to address these vital issues so that treatment goals ultimately may be realized.

### The American diabetes association (ADA) has been actively involved in the development and dissemination of diabetes care standards, guidelines, and related documents for many years. introduction [^116EALdB]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Grading of scientific evidence.

There has been considerable evolution in the evaluation of scientific evidence and in the development of evidence-based guidelines since the ADA first began publishing practice guidelines. Accordingly, we developed a classification system to grade the quality of scientific evidence supporting ADA recommendations for all new and revised ADA position statements.

Recommendations are assigned ratings of A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence (Table 1). Expert opinion (E) is a separate category for recommendations in which there is as yet no evidence from clinical trials, in which clinical trials may be impractical, or in which there is conflicting evidence. Recommendations with an "A" rating are based on large well-designed clinical trials or well-done meta-analyses. Generally, these recommendations have the best chance of improving outcomes when applied to the population to which they are appropriate. Recommendations with lower levels of evidence may be equally important but are not as well supported. The level of evidence supporting a given recommendation is noted either as a heading for a group of recommendations or in parentheses after a given recommendation.

Of course, evidence is only one component of clinical decision-making. Clinicians care for patients, not populations; guidelines must always be interpreted with the needs of the individual patient in mind. Individual circumstances, such as comorbid and coexisting diseases, age, education, disability, and, above all, patients' values and preferences, must also be considered and may lead to different treatment targets and strategies. Also, conventional evidence hierarchies, such as the one adapted by the ADA, may miss some nuances that are important in diabetes care. For example, while there is excellent evidence from clinical trials supporting the importance of achieving glycemic control, the optimal way to achieve this result is less clear. It is difficult to assess each component of such a complex intervention.

ADA will continue to improve and update the Clinical Practice Recommendations to ensure that clinicians, health plans, and policymakers can continue to rely on them as the most authoritative and current guidelines for diabetes care. Our Clinical Practice Recommendations are also available on the Association's website at.

### Obesity management as a primary treatment goal for type 2 diabetes: time to reframe the conversation [^112cLmUE]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Obesity is now recognised as a disease that is associated with serious morbidity and increased mortality. One of its main metabolic complications is type 2 diabetes, as the two conditions share key pathophysiological mechanisms. Weight loss is known to reverse the underlying metabolic abnormalities of type 2 diabetes and, as such, improve glucose control; loss of 15% or more of bodyweight can have a disease-modifying effect in people with type 2 diabetes, an outcome that is not attainable by any other glucose-lowering intervention. Furthermore, weight loss in this population exerts benefits that extend beyond glycaemic control to improve risk factors for cardiometabolic disease and quality of life. We review the evidence supporting the role of weight loss in the management of type 2 diabetes and propose that many patients with type 2 diabetes would benefit from having a primary weight-centric approach to diabetes treatment. We discuss the logistical challenges to implementing a new weight-centric primary treatment goal in people with type 2 diabetes.

### A systematic review of reviews evaluating technology-enabled diabetes self-management education and support [^113q15Xe]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Since the introduction of mobile phones, technology has been increasingly used to enable diabetes self-management education and support. This timely systematic review summarizes how currently available technology impacts outcomes for people living with diabetes.

Methods

A systematic review of high quality review articles and meta analyses focused on utilizing technology in diabetes self-management education and support services was conducted. Articles were included if published between January 2013 and January 2017.

Results

Twenty-five studies were included for analysis. The majority evaluated the use of mobile phones and secure messaging. Most studies described healthy eating, being active and metabolic monitoring as the predominant self-care behaviors evaluated. Eighteen of 25 reviews reported significant reduction in A1c as an outcome measure. Four key elements emerged as essential for improved A1c: (1) communication, (2) patient-generated health data, (3) education, and (4) feedback.

Conclusion

Technology-enabled diabetes self-management solutions significantly improve A1c. The most effective interventions incorporated all the components of a technology-enabled self-management feedback loop that connected people with diabetes and their health care team using 2-way communication, analyzed patient-generated health data, tailored education, and individualized feedback. The evidence from this systematic review indicates that organizations, policy makers and payers should consider integrating these solutions in the design of diabetes self-management education and support services for population health and value-based care models. With the widespread adoption of mobile phones, digital health solutions that incorporate evidence-based, behaviorally designed interventions can improve the reach and access to diabetes self-management education and ongoing support.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) 2023 type 2 diabetes algorithm — core themes emphasize lifestyle modification and treatment of overweight/obesity as key pillars in prediabetes and diabetes mellitus (DM) care, along with appropriate management of dyslipidemia and hypertension risk factors. A notable new theme is an emphasis on a complication-centric approach, beyond glucose levels, to frame decisions regarding lifestyle/pharmacologic choices, including decisions regarding first-line pharmacologic choices for persons with DM. The algorithm also incorporates access/cost of medications as health equity factors in clinical decision-making, and acknowledges that health care disparities and lack of access to newer medications remain a significant barrier for some persons with DM.

### Twenty-first century behavioral medicine: a context for empowering clinicians and patients with diabetes: a consensus report [^116z5Rjz]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Diabetes is a challenging condition, both to live with and to treat. It exemplifies the role of behavior in numerous ways, starting with how key behaviors directly influence the fundamental disease process of glucose metabolism. It is unique among chronic conditions in the extent to which achieving optimal control requires the coordination of both patients and clinicians. This article has illuminated the importance of clinicians understanding the individual characteristics of their patients and their perspectives in developing mutually accepted treatment goals. It also points to the need to consider contextual factors that impact virtually all of diabetes management. The complexity of diabetes, its impacts on diverse aspects of individuals' activity, its roots in urbanization and a plentiful food supply and other developments of our societies, and its global burden will make it a prime ground for the emergence of these many trends. The recognition of how individual patients and clinicians are reciprocally influenced by their contexts provides the template for exciting advances in health in the rest of the century.

### International diabetes federation guideline for management of postmeal glucose: a review of recommendations [^112ZNrNL]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a significant and growing concern, with over 246 million people around the world living with the disease and another 308 million with impaired glucose tolerance. Depending on the resources of different nations, intervention has generally focused on optimizing overall glycaemic control as assessed by glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values. Nevertheless, increasing evidence supports the importance of controlling all three members of the glucose triad, namely HbA(1c), FPG and postmeal glucose (PMG) in order to improve outcome in diabetes. As part of its global mission to promote diabetes care and prevention and to find a cure, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recently developed a guideline that reviews evidence to date on PMG and the development of diabetic complications. Based on an extensive database search of the literature, and guided by a Steering and Development Committee including experts from around the world, the IDF Guideline for Management of Postmeal Glucose offers recommendations for appropriate clinical management of PMG. These recommendations are intended to help clinicians and organizations in developing strategies for effective management of PMG in individuals with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The following review highlights the recommendations of the guideline, the supporting evidence provided and the major conclusions drawn. The full guideline is available for download at http://www.idf.org.

Decision cycle for person-centered glycemic management in type 2 diabetes — goals of care are to prevent complications and optimize quality of life, and treatment goals and plans should be co-created by the care team and people with diabetes based on their individual preferences, values, and goals. The cycle includes assessing key person characteristics (the individual's priorities; current lifestyle and health behaviors; comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease [CKD], cardiovascular disease [CVD], and heart failure [HF]; clinical characteristics such as age, A1C, and weight; issues such as motivation, depression, and cognition; and social determinants of health), considering specific factors that impact choice of treatment (individualized glycemic and weight goals; impact on weight, hypoglycemia, and cardiovascular and kidney protection; underlying pathophysiology; side effect profiles; complexity of treatment plan including frequency and mode of administration; treatment cost and time to optimize medication use and reduce treatment discontinuation; and access to, availability of medication, and lifestyle choices), and using shared decision-making to create a management plan (ensure access to diabetes self-management education and support [DSMES], explore personal preferences, use person-first strengths-based empowering language, and include motivational interviewing, goal setting, and shared decision-making). Agree on a management plan by specifying SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time limited), then review and agree on the plan regularly, operate in an integrated system of care, and undertake the decision cycle regularly (at least once or twice a year); using a nonjudgmental approach that normalizes lapses in diabetes management may help minimize the person's resistance to reporting problems with self-management.

Wilderness Medical Society Clinical Practice Guidelines for Diabetes Management — background on diabetes mellitus outlines disease mechanisms, prevalence of type 2 diabetes, and treatment distinctions with implications for activity in wilderness settings. Diabetes mellitus is described as a metabolic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose from a lack of insulin secretion, reduced insulin sensitivity, or both, with type 2 diabetes the most common form (90% of individuals with diabetes have type 2 diabetes). Type 1 diabetes is typically diagnosed in children or young adults and results from autoimmune destruction of islet cells causing insulin deficiency; people with type 1 diabetes require treatment with subcutaneous insulin, whereas those with type 2 diabetes may or may not require insulin treatment. The text notes that strenuous exercise and wilderness environments can complicate glycemic control, and that exercise and environmental stressors may interact with commonly used medications, glucose monitoring, and medication delivery.

### Task-sharing interventions for improving control of diabetes in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113nBRKF]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Task-shared interventions for diabetes management mainly comprise non-pharmacological lifestyle interventions and pharmacological components. When delivered by higher cadres of health workers, both the non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions resulted in meaningful reductions in HbA 1c. In general, diabetes self-management education and support have been proven to be effective in glycaemic control. Additionally, diabetes self-management education programmes have been organised in high-income settings using health-care workers such as nurses, pharmacists, and certified diabetes educators. Health systems in LMICs have traditionally been organised around vertical disease management programmes and hence the care processes have mostly centred on physicians. This places a high work burden on physicians and poorly defines the roles of other health-care workers in LMICs. Therefore, it is necessary to restructure and organise roles for non-physician health-care workers and to provide adequate training and supervision for effectively managing diabetes and other chronic non-communicable disease conditions in an integrated team-based care model.

The non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions delivered by pharmacists in the studies included emphasised medication adherence as a key strategy that resulted in better glycaemic outcomes. Similar effects of glycaemic control were shown in studies that emphasised improving adherence to glycaemic medications. Hence, adherence improvement should be considered as a major component of task sharing intervention studies in management of diabetes outcomes in LMICs.

The wide prediction intervals of the effect estimates observed in our study could be attributable to the variation in glycaemic outcomes of task-sharing strategies across different WHO regions. The WHO regions differ in terms of health-care system characteristics and doctor–population ratios. Further, they employ different cadres of health workers for task-sharing interventions. Therefore, careful selection of the cadre of health workers and the capacity for supervision by physicians are important parameters in the scale-up of task-sharing interventions to improve glycaemic outcomes in LMICs.

### Developments in the design and delivery of self-management support for children and young people with diabetes: a narrative synthesis of systematic reviews [^113wUmKV]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Facilitated self-management support programmes have become central to the treatment of chronic diseases including diabetes. For many children and young people with diabetes (CYPD), the impact on glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) and a range of self-management behaviours promised by these programmes remain unrealised. This warrants an appraisal of current thinking and the existing evidence to guide the development of programmes better targeted at this age group.

Methods

Create a narrative review of systematic reviews produced in the last 3years that have explored the impact on CYPD of the four key elements of self-management support programmes: education, instruction and advice including peer support; psychological counselling via a range of therapies; self-monitoring, including diaries and telemetric devices; and telecare, the technology-enabled follow-up and support by healthcare providers.

Results

Games and gamification appear to offer a promising means of engaging and educating CYPD. Psychological interventions when delivered by trained practitioners, appear to improve HbA 1c and quality of life although effect sizes were small. Technology-enabled interactive diaries can increase the frequency of self-monitoring and reduce levels of HbA 1c. Telecare provided synchronously via telephone produced significant improvements in HbA 1c.

Conclusions

The cost-effective flexibility of increasing the reliance on technology is an attractive proposition; however, there are resource implications for digital connectivity in underserved populations. The need remains to improve the understanding of which elements of each component are most effective in a particular context, and how to optimise the influence and input of families, caregivers and peers.

### Emerging therapeutic approaches for the management of diabetes mellitus and macrovascular complications [^116KP62z]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) affects an estimated 25.8 million people in the United States and is the 7th leading cause of death. While effective therapy can prevent or delay the complications that are associated with diabetes, according to the Center for Disease Control, 35% of Americans with DM are undiagnosed, and another 79 million Americans have blood glucose levels that greatly increase their risk of developing DM in the next several years. One of the Healthy People 2020 goals is to reduce the disease and economic burden of DM and improve the quality of life for all persons who have, or are at risk for, DM. Achieving this goal requires a concentrated focus on improving the management of diabetes and in targeting prevention of macrovascular complications.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of diabetes shared medical appointments (SMAs) as implemented in five veterans affairs health systems: a multi-site cluster randomized pragmatic trial [^113yoHaf]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Health burdens and costs of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) — a leading cause of morbidity and mortality — continue to soar. One of three US adults without diabetes at age 45 is projected to develop T2DM. Success of diabetes treatments depends on patients' initiating and sustaining key behaviors — taking medications, eating healthily, being physically active, self-monitoring. Many patients need self-management support. Health systems thus seek models to improve diabetes self-management support and clinical management that are more low-cost and scalable than offering frequent one-on-one visits with providers.

One potentially effective and efficient model for providing integrated medical care and self-management support is diabetes shared medical appointments (SMAs). SMAs bring groups of patients together with an interdisciplinary team of providers for a series of 60–120-min sessions. Session leaders encourage participants to set behavioral goals and steps to meet these goals ("action planning"), discuss key areas of diabetes care, and encourage participants to share experiences and self-management strategies with each other. One team provider has prescribing privileges and meets individually with participants to adjust medications.

Some efficacy trials have found SMAs to be more effective than usual care in improving A1c. – In Edelman et al.'s 2010 trial, group medical visits for adults with both high A1cs and blood pressure improved blood pressure but not A1cs. Meta-analyses have reinforced the efficacy of SMAs, – though one found that their heterogeneity does not allow conclusions about which SMA components are necessary for effectiveness. They emphasized the need now for SMAs to be evaluated as implemented in real-life clinical practice. It is also necessary to examine longer term outcomes after the conclusion of SMAs offered to participants over a limited period, as is the case in most programs. One study examining outcomes 13–18 months after the conclusion of the 2010 Edelman et al. trial found that blood pressure gains relative to the control group were not maintained, but participants had lower rates of hospital inpatient admissions and expenditures. However, most studies to date have examined outcomes immediately after participation in SMAs. More research is needed to understand if benefits are sustained after participants return to usual care.

### The effectiveness of social media-based microlearning in improving knowledge, self-efficacy, and self-care behaviors among adult patients with type 2 diabetes: an educational intervention [^116LKw7D]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a rapidly growing global health concern, demanding effective management strategies that empower patients. Effective diabetes management relies on two key factors: self-care and self-efficacy. Self-care encompasses daily actions like blood sugar monitoring, healthy eating, and exercise, while self-efficacy is a patient's confidence in managing their condition. Self-efficacy is defined as an individual's belief in their ability to perform an action successfully, and it plays a role in the clinical outcome of diabetes management. Both self-care and self-efficacy play integral roles in diabetes management, underscoring the importance of addressing them in comprehensive diabetes interventions. Over 98% of diabetes care is provided by patients and their families, making it essential for patients to have sufficient knowledge and skills in this area. To effectively treat diabetes, patients must have adequate knowledge and skills, and diabetic education aims to improve individual self-efficacy and management ability over their situation. Given the significance of these components mentioned, it can be inferred that patient education is a vital aspect of diabetes care and plays a crucial role in disease management. Different educational methods have varying effects on different groups and individuals, and it is essential to measure these effects. Traditional in-person education methods, while valuable, can be time-consuming and expensive to deliver, limiting their reach.

Choosing specific diabetes interventions and their roles in treating type 2 diabetes

Numerous reviews have focused on the characteristics of the specific diabetes interventions listed below. In addition, meta-analyses and reviews have summarized and compared the glucose-lowering effectiveness and other characteristics of the medications. The aim here is to provide enough information to justify the choices of medications, the order in which they are recommended, and the use of combinations of therapies. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of high-quality studies that provide head-to-head comparisons of the ability of the medications to achieve the currently recommended glycemic levels. The authors highly recommend that such studies be conducted. However, even in the absence of rigorous, comprehensive studies that directly compare the efficacy of all available glucose-lowering treatments and their combinations, we feel that there are enough data regarding the characteristics of the individual interventions to provide the guidelines below.

An important intervention that is likely to improve the probability that a patient will have better long-term control of diabetes is to make the diagnosis early, when the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes are usually less severe. Lower levels of glycemia at the time of initial therapy are associated with lower A1C levels over time and decreased long-term complications.

### How can point-of-care technologies support in-hospital diabetes care? [^113WWwG5]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2023). Medium credibility.

People with diabetes admitted to hospital are at risk of diabetes related complications including hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Point-of-care (POC) tests undertaken at the patient bedside, for glucose, ketones, and other analytes, are a key component of monitoring people with diabetes, to ensure safety. POC tests implemented with a quality framework are critical to ensuring accuracy and veracity of results and preventing erroneous clinical decision making. POC results can be used for self-management of glucose levels in those well-enough and/or by healthcare professionals to identify unsafe levels. Connectivity of POC results to electronic health records further offers the possibility of utilising these results proactively to identify patients 'at risk' in real-time and for audit purposes. In this article, the key considerations when implementing POC tests for diabetes in-patient management are reviewed and potential to drive improvements using networked glucose and ketone measurements are discussed. In summary, new advances in POC technology should allow people with diabetes and the teams looking after them whilst in hospital to integrate to provide safe and effective care.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^116nzvSq]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This consensus statement provides (1) visual guidance in concise graphic algorithms to assist with clinical decision-making of health care professionals in the management of persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve patient care and (2) a summary of details to support the visual guidance found in each algorithm.

Methods

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) selected a task force of medical experts who updated the 2020 AACE Comprehensive Type 2 Diabetes Management Algorithm based on the 2022 AACE Clinical Practice Guideline: Developing a Diabetes Mellitus Comprehensive Care Plan and consensus of task force authors.

Results

This algorithm for management of persons with type 2 diabetes includes 11 distinct sections: (1) Principles for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes; (2) Complications-Centric Model for the Care of Persons with Overweight/Obesity; (3) Prediabetes Algorithm; (4) Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Algorithm: Dyslipidemia; (5) Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Algorithm: Hypertension; (6) Complications-Centric Algorithm for Glycemic Control; (7) Glucose-Centric Algorithm for Glycemic Control; (8) Algorithm for Adding/Intensifying Insulin; (9) Profiles of Antihyperglycemic Medications; (10) Profiles of Weight-Loss Medications (new); and (11) Vaccine Recommendations for Persons with Diabetes Mellitus (new), which summarizes recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Conclusions

Aligning with the 2022 AACE diabetes guideline update, this 2023 diabetes algorithm update emphasizes lifestyle modification and treatment of overweight/obesity as key pillars in the management of prediabetes and diabetes mellitus and highlights the importance of appropriate management of atherosclerotic risk factors of dyslipidemia and hypertension. One notable new theme is an emphasis on a complication-centric approach, beyond glucose levels, to frame decisions regarding first-line pharmacologic choices for the treatment of persons with diabetes. The algorithm also includes access/cost of medications as factors related to health equity to consider in clinical decision-making.

### Exercise management in type 1 diabetes: a consensus statement [^113P6ySw]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is a challenging condition to manage for various physiological and behavioural reasons. Regular exercise is important, but management of different forms of physical activity is particularly difficult for both the individual with type 1 diabetes and the health-care provider. People with type 1 diabetes tend to be at least as inactive as the general population, with a large percentage of individuals not maintaining a healthy body mass nor achieving the minimum amount of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity per week. Regular exercise can improve health and wellbeing, and can help individuals to achieve their target lipid profile, body composition, and fitness and glycaemic goals. However, several additional barriers to exercise can exist for a person with diabetes, including fear of hypoglycaemia, loss of glycaemic control, and inadequate knowledge around exercise management. This Review provides an up-to-date consensus on exercise management for individuals with type 1 diabetes who exercise regularly, including glucose targets for safe and effective exercise, and nutritional and insulin dose adjustments to protect against exercise-related glucose excursions.

### Action on diabetic macular oedema: achieving optimal patient management in treating visual impairment due to diabetic eye disease [^113TpfE8]. Eye (2017). Low credibility.

Proactive clinical management of diabetes and co-morbidities, emphasis on patient-centred care

Given the evidence of benefit and supported by both national and international guidelines, a major focus for the care of people with type 2 diabetes is the achievement and maintenance of optimal glucose control early within the natural history of the condition. The clinical paradigm in managing glucose control centres on individualisation of therapy as there are many effective glucose-lowering agents to choose from when tailoring individual antihyperglycaemic treatment strategies for patients with type 2 diabetes. A stepwise approach is typically adopted, advancing from initial single drug therapy to dual combination and triple drug combination therapy when needed. Insulin therapy is considered a key component of any combination regimen when hyperglycaemia is severe.

Treatment targets and strategies should be individualised based on a patient-centred approach (Table 3). This is reinforced in an updated joint position statement from the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. Personalisation of treatment is recommended, balancing the benefits and risks of glycaemic control, taking account of the potential risk of hypoglycaemia and other adverse effects and the patient's age and health status. Glycaemic control needs to be combined with a comprehensive cardiovascular risk factor reduction programme, to include smoking cessation and the adoption of other healthy lifestyle habits, blood pressure control, and lipid management. Personalised management plans for patients with type 2 diabetes should therefore encompass glycaemic control and effective blood pressure and lipid management

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^1166XBdv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care guidelines

In 2008, the first ADA and European Association of the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus guidelines on management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes stated that metformin, along with lifestyle interventions, should be used as first-line therapy. While the guidelines of pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes in the United States have largely remained the same, recent updates in 2019 and 2020 have added additional components in light of compelling data from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials. According to the ADA 2020 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, metformin remains the preferred first-line pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated by the patient. Other glucose-lowering agents may be added to metformin considering patient preferences, hypoglycemic risk, and comorbidities.

While the ADA still recommends metformin as first-line therapy, the updated Standards of Care have become more outcomes-focused rather than solely concentrating on glycemic control. For this reason, in patients with certain comorbidities such as high-risk for or established ASCVD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease, it is recommended to consider GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c or individualized HbA1c target. In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology, in collaboration with the EASD, went one step further in altering their treatment guidelines. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are now recommended as first-line therapy for patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk in Europe. Metformin should be considered as the first line in patients without CVD and at moderate cardiovascular risk.

### Barriers to self-management of diabetes [^113CgP9D]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

People with diabetes hold major responsibility for the day-to-day management of their chronic condition. The management that, amongst others, includes blood glucose monitoring, medication taking, diet and physical activity, aims at normalizing blood glucose levels. In many individuals, the level of glycaemia, however, frequently exceeds the recommendations. This observation, together with patients' and practitioners' reports, suggests that active self-management is suboptimal. Various reasons, both individual and environment related, contribute to the suboptimal concordance with treatment regimen. The aim of this review is to discuss some of the barriers to optimal diabetes self-management.

### Prioritizing patient experiences in the management of diabetes and its complications: an endocrine society position statement [^114257Ms]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetes can be an arduous journey both for people with diabetes (PWD) and their caregivers. While the journey of every person with diabetes is unique, common themes emerge in managing this disease. To date, the experiences of PWD have not been fully considered to successfully implement the recommended standards of diabetes care in practice. It is critical for health-care providers (HCPs) to recognize perspectives of PWD to achieve optimal health outcomes. Further, existing tools are available to facilitate patient-centered care but are often underused. This statement summarizes findings from multistakeholder expert roundtable discussions hosted by the Endocrine Society that aimed to identify existing gaps in the management of diabetes and its complications and to identify tools needed to empower HCPs and PWD to address their many challenges. The roundtables included delegates from professional societies, governmental organizations, patient advocacy organizations, and social enterprises committed to making life better for PWD. Each section begins with a clinical scenario that serves as a framework to achieve desired health outcomes and includes a discussion of resources for HCPs to deliver patient-centered care in clinical practice. As diabetes management evolves, achieving this goal will also require the development of new tools to help guide HCPs in supporting PWD, as well as concrete strategies for the efficient uptake of these tools in clinical practice to minimize provider burden. Importantly, coordination among various stakeholders including PWD, HCPs, caregivers, policymakers, and payers is critical at all stages of the patient journey.

Standard 6.

A written curriculum reflecting current evidence and practice guidelines, with criteria for evaluating outcomes, will serve as the framework for the DSME entity. Assessed needs of the individual with pre-diabetes and diabetes will determine which of the content areas listed below are to be provided:
Describing the diabetes disease process and treatment options
Incorporating nutritional management into lifestyle
Incorporating physical activity into lifestyle
Using medication(s) safely and for maximum therapeutic effectiveness
Monitoring blood glucose and other parameters and interpreting and using the results for self-management decision making
Preventing, detecting, and treating acute complications
Preventing detecting, and treating chronic complications
Developing personal strategies to address psychosocial issues and concerns
Developing personal strategies to promote health and behavior change

People with diabetes and their families and caregivers have a great deal to learn in order to become effective self-managers of their diabetes. A core group of topics are commonly part of the curriculum taught in comprehensive programs that have demonstrated successful outcomes (,–). The curriculum, a coordinated set of courses and educational experiences, includes learning outcomes and effective teaching strategies. The curriculum is dynamic and needs to reflect current evidence and practice guidelines. Current educational research reflects the importance of emphasizing practical, problem-solving skills, collaborative care, psychosocial issues, behavior change, and strategies to sustain self-management efforts (,–).

The content areas delineated above provide instructors with an outline for developing this curriculum. It is important that the content be tailored to match each individual's needs and adapted as necessary for age, type of diabetes (including pre-diabetes and pregnancy), cultural influences, health literacy, and other comorbidities. The content areas are designed to be applicable in all settings and represent topics that can be developed in basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. Approaches to education that are interactive and patient-centered have been shown to be effective (,–).

These content areas are presented in behavioral terms and thereby exemplify the importance of action-oriented, behavioral goals and objectives. Creative, patient-centered experience-based delivery methods are effective for supporting informed decision-making and behavior change and go beyond the acquisition of knowledge.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose in noninsulin-using type 2 diabetic patients: it is time to face the evidence [^1166v1BH]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Given the importance of glycemic control in the development of diabetes complications, the plethora of tools now available to monitor the day-to-day trends in glycemia is remarkable. In this regard, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) has been considered a key component of patient management. Arguably, there remains almost universal agreement that SMBG should be available to all diabetic patients regardless of current treatment strategy. However, recently there have been reports that have challenged the current paradigm that all patients should use SMBG and concluded that SMBG for type 2 diabetic patients not on insulin may not be beneficial on glycemic control and must be weighed against the expense and inconvenience. In this two-part point-counterpoint narrative, Malanda et al. and Polonsky and Fisher take opposing views on the utility of SMBG to be valuable for individuals with type 2 diabetes not using insulin. In the narrative below, Malanda et al. suggest that the evidence for potentially beneficial SMBG-induced effects on glycemic control, hypoglycemic periods, and potential harms in type 2 diabetic patients who are not treated with insulin does not justify the use of SMBG. Moreover, the use of SMBG is associated with huge costs, which should be better redirected to effective strategies to improve health for this category of patients. -William T.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2009 [^111xUJa7]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a chronic illness that requires continuing medical care and patient self-management education to prevent acute complications and to reduce the risk of long-term complications. Diabetes care is complex and requires that many issues, beyond glycemic control, be addressed. A large body of evidence exists that supports a range of interventions to improve diabetes outcomes.

These standards of care are intended to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payors, and other interested individuals with the components of diabetes care, treatment goals, and tools to evaluate the quality of care. While individual preferences, comorbidities, and other patient factors may require modification of goals, targets that are desirable for most patients with diabetes are provided. These standards are not intended to preclude more extensive evaluation and management of the patient by other specialists as needed. For more detailed information, refer to references–.

The recommendations included are screening, diagnostic, and therapeutic actions that are known or believed to favorably affect health outcomes of patients with diabetes. A grading system (Table 1), developed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and modeled after existing methods, was utilized to clarify and codify the evidence that forms the basis for the recommendations. The level of evidence that supports each recommendation is listed after each recommendation using the letters A, B, C, or E.

### Advances in the management of type 2 diabetes in adults [^117HC5WE]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes, a chronic and progressive cardiometabolic disorder, is a major cause of morbidity, disability, and mortality worldwide. Comprehensive person centred management of diabetes requires attention to glycaemic control and risk factors for cardiovascular disease (hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, and tobacco use), weight management, early detection and treatment of microvascular, macrovascular, and metabolic complications of diabetes and mental health concerns, mitigation of burden of treatment, addressing social determinants of health, and improving quality of life. The past decade has seen multiple developments in each aspect of the management of diabetes. This review focuses specifically on recent advances in the management of hyperglycaemia in diabetes, including drug and non-drug treatments. People with diabetes, caregivers, clinicians, health systems, payers, and policy makers need to appreciate the complexity and cost associated with optimal care of diabetes to meaningfully improve the health and well being of people living with diabetes.

Diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) objectives, standards content, and timing include that "The overall objectives of DSMES are to support informed decision-making, self-care behaviors, problem-solving, and active collaboration with the health care team to improve clinical outcomes, health status, and well-being in a cost-effective manner (2)", and "DSMES should be thought of as an ongoing process — not a one-time occurrence". The National Standards for DSMES include delivery of content addressing "Pathophysiology of diabetes and treatment options", "Healthy coping", "Healthy eating", "Being active", "Taking medication", "Monitoring", "Reducing risk (treating acute and chronic complications)", and "Problem solving and behavior change strategies". Critical time points for DSMES evaluation and referral include "Annually and/or when not meeting treatment goals, whichever is more frequent", "When complicating factors (e.g., health conditions, physical or functional limitations, emotional factors, and basic living needs) that influence self-management develop", and "When transitions in life and care occur". DSMES is person-centered and empowerment-focused, as "DSMES empowers individuals with diabetes by providing them with tools to make informed self-management decisions (4)", "DSMES should be person-centered — placing the person with diabetes and their family and/or support system at the center of the care model as they work in collaboration with health care professionals", and "Person-centered care is respectful of and responsive to individual and cultural preferences, needs, and values".

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^111SjetJ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Type 2 diabetes is epidemic. Its long-term consequences translate into enormous human suffering and economic costs; however, much of the morbidity associated with long-term microvascular and neuropathic complications can be substantially reduced by interventions that achieve glucose levels close to the nondiabetic range. Although new classes of medications and numerous combinations have been demonstrated to lower glycemia, current-day management has failed to achieve and maintain the glycemic levels most likely to provide optimal healthcare status for people with diabetes.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American diabetes association consensus statement on inpatient glycemic control [^114Fwz15]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Although hyperglycemia is associated with adverse patient outcomes, intervention to normalize glycemia has yielded inconsistent results. Indeed, recent trials in critically ill patients have failed to showa significant improvement in mortality with intensive glycemic control or have even shown increased mortality risk. Moreover, these recent RCTs have highlighted the risk of severe hypoglycemia resulting from such efforts. These outcomes have contributed to confusion regarding specific glycemic targets and the means for achieving them in both critically ill and noncritically ill patients.

Recognizing the importance of glycemic control across the continuum of care, the AACE and the ADA joined forces to develop this updated consensus statement on inpatient glycemic management. The central goals were to identify reasonable, achievable, and safe glycemic targets and to describe the protocols, procedures, and system improvements needed to facilitate their implementation. This document is addressed to health care professionals, supporting staff, hospital administrators, and other stakeholders focused on improved management of hyperglycemia in inpatient settings. Consensus panel members extensively reviewed the most current literature and considered the following questions:
Does improving glycemic control improve clinical outcomes for inpatients with hyperglycemia?
What glycemic targets can be recommended in different patient populations?
What treatment options are available for achieving optimal glycemic targets safely and effectively in specific clinical situations?
Does inpatient management of hyperglycemia represent a safety concern?
What systems need to be in place to achieve these recommendations?
Is treatment of inpatient hyperglycemia cost-effective?
What are the optimal strategies for transition to outpatient care?
What are areas for future research?

Grading of scientific evidence.

There has been considerable evolution in the evaluation of scientific evidence and in the development of evidence-based guidelines since the ADA first began publishing practice guidelines. Accordingly, we developed a classification system to grade the quality of scientific evidence supporting ADA recommendations for all new and revised ADA position statements.

Recommendations are assigned ratings of A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence (Table 1). Expert opinion (E) is a separate category for recommendations in which there is as yet no evidence from clinical trials, in which clinical trials may be impractical, or in which there is conflicting evidence. Recommendations with an "A" rating are based on large well-designed clinical trials or well-done meta-analyses. Generally, these recommendations have the best chance of improving outcomes when applied to the population to which they are appropriate. Recommendations with lower levels of evidence may be equally important but are not as well supported. The level of evidence supporting a given recommendation is noted either as a heading for a group of recommendations or in parentheses after a given recommendation.

Table 1
ADA evidence-grading system for clinical practice recommendations

Of course, evidence is only one component of clinical decision-making. Clinicians care for patients, not populations; guidelines must always be interpreted with the needs of the individual patient in mind. Individual circumstances, such as comorbid and coexisting diseases, age, education, disability, and, above all, patients' values and preferences, must also be considered and may lead to different treatment targets and strategies. Also, conventional evidence hierarchies, such as the one adapted by the ADA, may miss some nuances that are important in diabetes care. For example, while there is excellent evidence from clinical trials supporting the importance of achieving glycemic control, the optimal way to achieve this result is less clear. It is difficult to assess each component of such a complex intervention.

ADA will continue to improve and update the Clinical Practice Recommendations to ensure that clinicians, health plans, and policymakers can continue to rely on them as the most authoritative and current guidelines for diabetes care. Our Clinical Practice Recommendations are also available on the Association's website at.

KDOQI clinical practice recommendation 4 — behavioral self-management in diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) — states that '4.1 Self-management strategies should be key components of a multifaceted treatment plan with attention to multiple behaviors: (C)' and specifies monitoring and treatment of glycemia, blood pressure, nutrition, smoking cessation, exercise, and adherence to medicines. 'Due to complexity of the behavioral self-management regimen for diabetes and CKD and high frequency of nonadherence, alternative approaches to traditional education should be considered. (Moderate/Weak)'. The guideline notes that 'Education alone is not sufficient to promote and sustain healthy behavior change, particularly with such a complex regimen', and that 'To our knowledge, no studies have specifically examined adherence of people with diabetes and CKD to self-management regimens'. Evidence summarized indicates 'patients with diabetes had among the lowest rates of adherence across a range of 17 disease states, second only to those with sleep disorders', and that 'A survey of 2,056 adults with diabetes from across the United States found the most frequently reported adherence problem was diet, followed by exercise and blood glucose monitoring'.

### Peer-based behavioural strategies to improve chronic disease self-management and clinical outcomes: evidence, logistics, evaluation considerations and needs for future research [^112EzF96]. Family Practice (2010). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of a chronic disease such as diabetes generally evokes strong emotions and often brings with it the need to make changes in lifestyle behaviours, such as diet, exercise, medication management and monitoring clinical and metabolic parameters. The diagnosis thus affects not only the person diagnosed but also the family members. Chronic illnesses are largely self-managed with approximately 99% of the care becoming the responsibility of patients and their families or others involved in the daily management of their illnesses. While the responsibility for outcomes, such as metabolic control and chronic complications, are shared with the health care team, the daily decisions and behaviours adopted by patients clearly have a strong influence on their future health and well-being. While diabetes self-management education is essential, it is generally not sufficient for patients to sustain behaviours and cope with a lifetime of diabetes. Peers have been proposed as one method for assisting patients to deal with the behavioural and affective components of diabetes and to provide ongoing self-management support. This paper first describes effective behavioural strategies in diabetes, based on multiple studies and/or meta-analyses, and then provides examples of their use by peers or in peer-based programmes in diabetes. A comprehensive search using the MEDLINE and Cinahl databases was conducted. Key search terms included peer mentors, peer leaders, peer educators, lay health workers and community health workers. Studies that clearly identified behavioural strategies used by peers were included.

### Dietary self-management using mobile health technology for adults with type 2 diabetes: a scoping review [^112hZcQb]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Dietary self-management is one key component to achieve optimal glycemic control. Advances in mobile health (mHealth) technology have reduced the burden of diabetes self-management; however, limited evidence has been known regarding the status of the current body of research using mHealth technology for dietary management for adults with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Literature searches were conducted electronically using PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science Core Collection, PsycINFO (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and Scopus. Keywords and subject headings covered dietary management, type 2 diabetes, and mHealth. Inclusion criteria included studies that applied mHealth for dietary self-management for adults with type 2 diabetes and were published in English as full articles.

Results

This review (N = 15 studies) revealed heterogeneity of the mHealth-based dietary self-management or interventions and reported results related to physiological, dietary behavioral, and psychosocial outcomes. Twelve studies applied smartphone apps with varied functions for dietary management or intervention, while three studies applied continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to guide dietary changes. Among 15 reviewed studies, only three of them were two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) with larger sample and 12-month study duration and 12 of them were pilot testing. Nine of 12 pilot studies showed improved HbA1c; most of them resulted in varied dietary changes; and few of them showed improved diabetes distress and depression.

Conclusion

Our review provided evidence that the application of mHealth technology for dietary intervention for adults with type 2 diabetes is still in pilot testing. The preliminary effects are inconclusive on physiological, dietary behavioral, and psychosocial outcomes.

### Impact of technology-based interventions for children and young people with type 1 diabetes on key diabetes self-management behaviours and prerequisites: a systematic review [^115QtPS5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is increasing in prevalence in the UK, affecting over 30,000 children and young people and so diabetes management typically begins early in life. The management of T1DM is complex and involves key self-management behaviours outlined in national recommendations (NICE), including: self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), insulin administration, dietary management and regular physical activity, with the aim of maintaining optimal blood glucose levels. Further, NICE guidance highlights key psychological and clinical (HbA1c) prerequisites to self-management behaviour. A focus on any or all of these components will lead to improved diabetes control.

Technology-based interventions may augment face-to-face interactions with therapeutic staff, thereby offering the potential to reduce the costs and dependence on clinical staff of providing additional services beyond regular clinical visits. Efficacious delivery of policy objectives in clinical care through technology-based mediums could therefore contribute to reducing the economic burden of T1DM. Technology-based interventions also augment standard services, increasing access and availability of evidence-based practices outside clinical settings. This could be a useful adjunct to the usual care of children and young people with T1DM, particularly as increasing independence and self-reliance is a concern amongst this group. Prior non-systematic reviews demonstrate that technology-based interventions promoting diabetes self-management may be acceptable to children and young people with T1DM, and have the potential to improve certain outcomes and behaviours (e.g. HbA1c, blood glucose monitoring).

The purpose of this systematic review is to critically analyse the literature assessing the effectiveness of technology-based interventions for children and young people with T1DM on the diabetes self-management behaviours and prerequisites that are highlighted by current treatment guidelines as being crucial for effective diabetes management. In this way, this review will identify aspects of national guidance which may be effectively promoted to children and young people using technological tools.

### Diabetes UK evidence-based nutrition guidelines for the prevention and management of diabetes [^114bHHbj]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

This article summarizes the Diabetes UK evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of Type 2 diabetes and nutritional management of diabetes. It describes the development of the recommendations and highlights the key changes from previous guidelines. The nutrition guidelines include a series of recommendations for the prevention of Type 2 diabetes, nutritional management of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, weight management, management of microvascular and macrovascular disease, hypoglycaemia management, and additional considerations such as nutrition support, end-of-life care, disorders of the pancreas, care of the older person with diabetes, nutrition provided by external agencies and fasting. The evidence-based recommendations were graded using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodology and, in a small number of topic areas, where strong evidence was lacking, the recommendations were reached by consensus. The Diabetes UK 2011 guidelines place an emphasis on carbohydrate management and a more flexible approach to weight loss, unlike previous guidelines which were expressed in terms of recommendations for individual nutrient intakes. Additionally, the guidelines for alcohol have been aligned to national recommendations. The full evidence-based nutrition guidelines for the prevention and management of diabetes are available from: http://www.diabetes.org.uk/nutrition-guidelines.

### Effects of the proactive interdisciplinary self-management (PRISMA) program on self-reported and clinical outcomes in type 2 diabetes: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^114uTXzo]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

The effectiveness of diabetes self-management ultimately depends on patients' adherence with lifestyle recommendations and treatment. Patients need to understand the principles and importance of self-management activities, which makes diabetes self-management education a key component of diabetes care. Diabetes self-management education can be helpful for patients with type 2 diabetes in managing their condition. It aims not only to enhance the patients' medical understanding but also to improve their intrinsic motivation, belief in their innate ability to achieve goals (self-efficacy), illness perception, self-management skills, and behavior. Moreover, a recent systematic review showed that diabetes self-management education resulted in improved HbA1c. Group-based diabetes self-management education seems to be more effective than usual care and individual education at improving clinical, lifestyle, and psychosocial outcomes.

One example of an evidence-based diabetes self-management education program is the group-based Proactive Interdisciplinary Self-MAnagement (PRISMA) training program. This program is based on the DESMOND (Diabetes Education and Self-Management for Ongoing and Newly Diagnosed) program, which was developed and tested in the UK. DESMOND has proven to be (cost-)effective in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. PRISMA was adapted for use in type 2 diabetes in primary care in the Netherlands and, in a previous study, seemed to improve self-management behavior in terms of dietary behaviors, foot care, and action planning three months posttraining. However, the effects of PRISMA on self-reported and clinical outcomes in a controlled setting are still unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of PRISMA on self-reported (knowledge, skills and confidence for self-management, diabetes self-care behavior, health-related quality of life, and emotional well-being) and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes treated in general practice.

### Maximising engagement, motivation and long term change in a structured intensive education programme in diabetes for children, young people and their families: child and adolescent structured competencies approach to diabetes education (CASCADE) [^117VeU8z]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Effective components of successful programmes incorporate the integration of medical care and educational and psychological interventions. An example of this is relating self management of blood glucose (SMBG) to other aspects of diabetes to demonstrate how information can be used to guide other management behaviours. Multi-component interventions are more successful than those that focus on only one aspect in improving metabolic control, particularly in adolescents. Additionally, there is evidence that diabetes educators show significant improvements in their skills in educating, supporting and counselling patients when using alternative approaches to traditional didactic methods. Therefore interventions must not only deliver knowledge but ensure it can be put into practice. Caring for children and young people with diabetes is fundamentally different to providing services for adults. It is a complex process that must be firmly focused on the child or young person and their family and/or other carers, supported by the skills and experiences of a wide range of health care professionals. Consideration must be given to the physical and emotional needs of the developing and growing individual along with the social constraints of family, friends, early years and school, as well as adapting to different developmental stages over time. A key component of effective chronic care management involving young people and their families or carers is establishing and maintaining the motivation that will enable them to manage the complex juggling act required to achieve effective management of their condition.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^111gjVNW]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Algorithm

The algorithm (Fig. 2) takes into account the characteristics of the individual interventions, their synergies, and expense. The goal is to achieve and maintain A1C levels of < 7% and to change interventions at as rapid a pace as titration of medications allows when target glycemic goals are not being achieved. Mounting evidence suggests that aggressive lowering of glycemia, especially with insulin therapy, in newly diagnosed diabetes can result in sustained remissions, i.e. normoglycemia without need for glucose-lowering medications. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, and patients should be informed that they are likely to require the addition of glucose-lowering medications over time.

The amylin agonists, α-glucosidase inhibitors, glinides, and DPP-4 inhibitors are not included in the two tiers of preferred agents in this algorithm, owing to their lower or equivalent overall glucose-lowering effectiveness compared with the first- and second-tier agents and/or to their limited clinical data or relative expense (Table 1). However, they may be appropriate choices in selected patients.

### A care team-based classification and population management schema for connected diabetes care [^112C6kH2]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite significant advances in the diabetes therapeutic toolkit in the past 15 years, diabetes prevalence, cost to the economy, and population-level outcomes are not improving. There are an estimated 34.2 million people with diabetes in the US (10.5% of the population), the disease cost the country $327 billion in 2017, and a recent study suggested that the percentage of people with diabetes who have achieved cardiovascular risk factor control did not improve between 2005 and 2016. [Note that risk factor control may have improved since 2016, as many diabetes drugs have since shown to be cardioprotective in cardiovascular outcomes trials.] Still, poor access to high-quality diabetes care may be one of the drivers behind these concerning statistics –.

In many ways, the diabetes field has been an early adopter and innovator in the chronic disease digital medicine space. This is due to the high demand (high disease prevalence), high measurability of the primary disease biometric (blood glucose), and high potential for behavior change given the short feedback loop between behavior and outcome (change in blood glucose).

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^116qZT8W]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Glycemic management in type 2 diabetes mellitus has become increasingly complex and, to some extent, controversial, with a widening array of pharmacological agents now available, mounting concerns about their potential adverse effects and new uncertainties regarding the benefits of intensive glycemic control on macrovascular complications. Many clinicians are therefore perplexed as to the optimal strategies for their patients. As a consequence, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a joint task force to examine the evidence and develop recommendations for antihyperglycemic therapy in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. Several guideline documents have been developed by members of these two organizations and by other societies and federations (,–). However, an update was deemed necessary because of contemporary information on the benefits/risks of glycemic control, recent evidence concerning efficacy and safety of several new drug classes, the withdrawal/restriction of others, and increasing calls for a move toward more patient-centered care.

This statement has been written incorporating the best available evidence and, where solid support does not exist, using the experience and insight of the writing group, incorporating an extensive review by additional experts (acknowledged below). The document refers to glycemic control; yet this clearly needs to be pursued within a multifactorial risk reduction framework. This stems from the fact that patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; the aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure and lipid therapy, antiplatelet treatment, and smoking cessation) is likely to have even greater benefits.

These recommendations should be considered within the context of the needs, preferences, and tolerances of each patient; individualization of treatment is the cornerstone of success. Our recommendations are less prescriptive than and not as algorithmic as prior guidelines. This follows from the general lack of comparative-effectiveness research in this area. Our intent is therefore to encourage an appreciation of the variable and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, the specific role of each drug, the patient and disease factors that drive clinical decision making, and the constraints imposed by age and comorbidity. The implementation of these guidelines will require thoughtful clinicians to integrate current evidence with other constraints and imperatives in the context of patient-specific factors.

### Practical strategies to manage obesity in type 2 diabetes [^1168yvjy]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The rising phenomenon of obesity, a major risk factor for the development and progression of type 2 diabetes, is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach to be prevented and managed. Although novel pharmacological measures to combat obesity have achieved unprecedented efficacy, a healthy lifestyle remains essential for the long-term success of any therapeutic intervention. However, this requires a high level of intrinsic motivation and continued behavioural changes in the face of multiple metabolic, psychological and environmental factors promoting weight gain, particularly in the context of type 2 diabetes. This review is intended to provide practical recommendations in the context of a holistic, person-centred approach to weight management, including evidence-based and expert recommendations addressing supportive communication, shared decision-making, as well as nutritional and pharmacological therapeutic approaches to achieve sustained weight loss.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^113FAqMC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive multifactorial care components in diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD): As key components of multifaceted intervention, clinicians should encourage people with diabetes and CKD to adopt healthy lifestyles that include improved nutrition, exercise, and smoking cessation, and interventions should focus on aggressive treatment of CKD stage 1–5; although glycemic control has not been proven beneficial for kidney outcomes, it reduces risks for retinopathy and neuropathy, and treatment of elevated LDL-C improves cardiovascular outcomes in people with diabetes (except for those with LDL-C concentrations between 120 and 190 mg/dL who initiate statin therapy while on hemodialysis therapy); comprehensive care includes management of diabetes according to current standards, achieving glycemic targets with a combination of lifestyle approaches, behavioral self-management, and medicines, attention to screening for common comorbidities and referral to specialists such as those for eye and foot care, and, given the greatly increased CVD risk, managing risk factors with a goal of minimizing CVD.

### Improving care and promoting health in populations: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1114hJVh]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

American Diabetes Association — Diabetes and population health recommendations are as follows. Ensure treatment decisions are timely, rely on evidence-based guidelines, capture key elements within the social determinants of health, and are made collaboratively with people with or at risk for diabetes and caregivers based on individual preferences, prognoses, comorbidities, and informed financial considerations. B Align approaches to diabetes management with evidence-based care models. These models emphasize person-centered team care, integrated long-term treatment approaches to diabetes and comorbidities, and ongoing collaborative communication and goal setting between all team members and with people with diabetes. A Care systems should facilitate in-person and virtual team-based care, include those knowledgeable and experienced in diabetes management as part of the team, and utilize patient registries, decision support tools, proactive care planning, and community involvement to meet needs of individuals with diabetes. B Assess diabetes management, risk factors, and complications (Table 4.1) using reliable and relevant data metrics to improve processes of care and health outcomes, with attention to care costs, individual preferences and goals for care, and treatment burden. B Health systems should adopt a culture of quality improvement, implement benchmarking programs, and engage interprofessional teams to support sustainable and scalable process changes to improve quality of care and health outcomes.
