## Question

Does taking Prempro raise the risk of breast cancer in a 48-year-old woman with a family history of breast cancer (mother diagnosed at 68) and a current mammogram showing heterogeneous dense breast?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether taking Prempro (conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg daily) raises breast cancer risk for a 48-year-old woman with a maternal history of breast cancer (mother diagnosed at 68) and a current mammogram showing heterogeneously dense breasts, and how to interpret that risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about her baseline risk from age, family history, and breast density. Then, I should quantify the incremental risk from combined estrogen–progestin therapy using randomized and epidemiologic data. Next, I will consider how hormone therapy affects mammographic density and interval cancer risk. After that, I should synthesize absolute risk for this patient, including a quick sense-check of the math. Finally, I will review guideline-based counseling, alternative options, and screening or risk-reduction strategies that could mitigate harm while treating menopausal symptoms.

> Let me first confirm the risk factors. She is 48, has a first-degree relative with breast cancer, and has heterogeneously dense breasts; each factor independently raises baseline risk, and risk increases with age through the late 40s and beyond, particularly for ER-positive disease in population trends, so I need to account for the compounding effect rather than viewing any factor in isolation [^112N6x9B] [^117SxKYD]. Wait, I should verify the BI-RADS notation; BI-RADS "3" can mean "probably benign" for assessment categories, but here it appears to refer to the older numeric density scale where category 3 corresponds to "heterogeneously dense", which aligns with the description and is the exposure of interest for interval cancer risk analyses [^113kgrEd].

> I will now examine how family history and density combine. A first-degree family history roughly increases risk by about 1.5–2-fold in many cohorts, and heterogeneously dense tissue confers about a 2-fold or more increase versus fatty breasts; these effects can identify women with higher interval cancer rates even when each factor alone seems modest, so I should treat her baseline as meaningfully above average before adding hormones [^115RX1Vf] [^1113rMV4] [^113kgrEd] [^112PJkYy].

> Next, I should review interval cancers in dense breasts. Hold on, let me verify thresholds; in the BCSC cohort, women with heterogeneously dense breasts and a 5-year risk at or above 2.5% had high interval cancer rates and more advanced-stage interval cancers, which implies reduced screening sensitivity and worse clinical detection dynamics for women like this patient who likely meets or approaches that risk threshold given her age and family history [^113kgrEd].

> Now, I need to quantify the added risk from Prempro specifically. The WHI randomized estrogen-plus-progestin trial of daily CEE 0.625 mg plus MPA 2.5 mg showed an increased invasive breast cancer risk, with an overall relative risk of 1.24 and a larger effect among prior hormone users; among women without prior hormone therapy exposure the RR was 1.09, which still trends upward, and cancers were larger and more often node-positive in the active-treatment arm, so the direction of effect is consistent and clinically relevant even when point estimates are modest in early use [^114qGbVY] [^1148X84h]. I should confirm longer-term follow-up shows persistence of this excess; the extended WHI analyses and pooled interpretations continue to show elevated incidence for combined therapy over time, supporting durability of the signal beyond the intervention phase [^112yXbLo] [^112RqfJM].

> But wait, what about dose, formulation, and duration nuances. The large individual-participant meta-analysis indicates that estrogen–progestin regimens carry greater breast cancer risks than estrogen alone, with risk rising with each year of use and remaining detectable for more than a decade after cessation; absolute excesses are clinically nontrivial after 5–10 years of typical use starting near age 50, even though relative risks vary by pattern and duration of exposure [^114ykGim] [^113EmFhS] [^116vr7k5] [^117Ub2SV]. I should double-check whether different progestins or routes materially change risk; overall, evidence and regulatory summaries suggest risk differences across combinations, doses, or routes are small or not consistently demonstrable, so we should assume class effects for estrogen–progestin regimens when counseling [^111tFY3a] [^116Tuo3p] [^116u5Ykh].

> I will now examine how combined therapy alters mammography performance. Estrogen–progestin in WHI increased percent mammographic density by about 6% at one year versus a decrease on placebo, effects that persisted at two years; because increased density reduces mammographic sensitivity, this pharmacologic density increase compounds the pre-existing masking from heterogeneously dense tissue, raising the likelihood of interval cancers and delayed detection in exactly the subgroup we worry about [^1111SanE] [^115gxgJw]. Hold on, I should also consider interval outcomes by screening interval; while biennial vs annual screening in 50–74 did not increase advanced-stage risk regardless of density or hormone therapy, younger women with extremely dense breasts had more advanced cancers with biennial intervals, so in a 48-year-old at higher risk with dense breasts, a shorter interval may be reasonable to discuss despite trade-offs in false positives [^116UJJmw].

> Let me synthesize the absolute risk for this patient and sense-check the math. If her baseline 5-year risk is around or above 2.5% given age, family history, and density, applying the WHI overall RR of about 1.24 for combined CEE/MPA would raise that to roughly 3.1% over 5 years, which is an absolute increase of about 0.6%; initially I thought the 5-year excess might be 1.2%, but wait, that would be the approximate 10-year cumulative excess if the relative risk persisted similarly, so 0.6% over 5 years and on the order of 1–1.2% over 10 years fits better with the trial and meta-analysis absolute risk estimates, especially since risk accrues with duration [^114qGbVY] [^113EmFhS] [^113kgrEd]. I should confirm that new users can still incur early risk; yes, even 1–4 years of estrogen–progestin use shows a definite excess in pooled analyses, emphasizing that "short-term" does not imply risk-free, particularly in higher-risk baselines [^116vr7k5].

> Next, I should review guideline framing and labeling language for counseling. Regulatory labeling for Prempro and related products consistently advises using estrogens with or without progestins at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and individual risks, and explicitly notes increased invasive breast cancer risk with combined therapy, which should not be used for prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia, reinforcing a cautious, symptom-driven approach in higher-risk women [^111xxkY8] [^111tFY3a] [^116u5Ykh]. Professional guidelines recommend that baseline breast cancer risk be evaluated when considering menopausal hormone therapy, and that in women with elevated risk, clinicians discuss the magnitude and time course of breast cancer risk along with nonhormonal options and lifestyle risk reduction, tailoring regimen and duration if therapy is pursued [^1174zrG3] [^113vHC8Y] [^113zSXNN].

> Let me consider regimen choices and safer alternatives. I should confirm the differential risk by regimen; estrogen-alone did not increase invasive breast cancer in the WHI estrogen-alone trial and in some analyses was associated with lower incidence, but it is only appropriate for women after hysterectomy, whereas estrogen–progestin is required to protect the endometrium in women with a uterus and is the combination that consistently elevates risk, likely reflecting a progestin-driven component, although comparative safety across specific progestins is not firmly established and cannot be relied upon to eliminate risk [^116qw3n9] [^114qGbVY] [^113hUXE6] [^117FRGfX]. If systemic hormones are deferred, nonhormonal therapies for vasomotor symptoms and localized vaginal treatments with minimal systemic absorption can be prioritized; if systemic therapy is necessary in a higher-risk woman with a uterus, minimizing dose, duration, and continuous progestin exposure while monitoring closely may reduce risk, but I need to acknowledge that definitive evidence for a risk-free combined regimen does not exist [^1174zrG3] [^111tFY3a].

> I should now address screening and risk-reduction strategies to mitigate harm if therapy is initiated. Given dense breasts and elevated baseline risk, I would discuss annual rather than biennial mammography in the late 40s and early 50s and consider the pros and cons of adjunctive imaging such as MRI or ultrasound, which can increase detection but also increase false positives and have not demonstrated mortality benefit; shared decision-making is important here, especially because combined therapy may further increase density and masking [^115gxgJw] [^116UJJmw] [^1111SanE]. In parallel, for women meeting elevated-risk thresholds and at low risk for adverse effects, offering risk-reducing medications such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors is recommended by the USPSTF, and this discussion can be integrated with the hormone therapy decision to avoid counteracting effects and to align with her preferences and risk tolerance [^1135EuZb].

> Stepping back, I should confirm the bottom line. Combined CEE 0.625 mg plus MPA 2.5 mg daily does increase breast cancer risk, with relative risks on the order of 1.2–1.3 in randomized data that translate into clinically meaningful absolute excess when baseline risk is already elevated by family history and dense breasts, and the regimen can worsen the masking effect on mammography by increasing density, potentially increasing interval cancers; therefore, if used at all, it should follow a careful, individualized risk–benefit discussion, at the lowest effective dose for the shortest time, with enhanced surveillance and consideration of nonhormonal or alternative strategies where feasible [^114qGbVY] [^1111SanE] [^1174zrG3] [^113kgrEd] [^112RqfJM].

Yes, Prempro (estrogen plus progestin) **increases breast cancer risk** [^112yXbLo] in a 48-year-old woman with a first-degree family history and heterogeneously dense breasts. The WHI [^114qGbVY] showed a **24% higher risk** with combined therapy, and this risk rises with longer use [^114ykGim]. Family history and dense breasts are **independent risk factors** [^112N6x9B]; combined therapy further increases mammographic density [^1111SanE], reducing detection and increasing interval cancers [^113kgrEd]. Use the **lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration [^111tFY3a], and consider [^113vHC8Y] non-hormonal options [^1174zrG3] or estrogen alone [^115ff5dP] if appropriate.

## Breast cancer risk associated with prempro

- The WHI randomized trial [^114qGbVY] found a **24% higher risk** of invasive breast cancer with estrogen plus progestin (CEE 0.625 mg + MPA 2.5 mg) vs placebo (RR 1.24; 41 vs 33 per 10,000 women-years) [^112yXbLo].

- **Risk increases with duration** [^114ykGim] and can persist after stopping therapy [^116vr7k5].

- **Breast cancers on combined therapy** [^114qGbVY] were more likely to be node-positive and advanced at diagnosis.

---

## Influence of family history on breast cancer risk

A **first-degree family history increases risk** [^1113rMV4] by about 1.8-fold [^112N6x9B]. Family history and hormone therapy are independent risks with additive effects [^112N6x9B].

---

## Impact of breast density on breast cancer risk

Heterogeneously dense breasts **independently increase risk** and reduce mammographic sensitivity [^115gxgJw], leading to more interval cancers [^113kgrEd]. Hormone therapy further **increases mammographic density** [^1111SanE], which reduces detection and increases interval cancers [^113kgrEd].

---

## Combined effect of prempro, family history, and breast density

Combined therapy, family history, and dense breasts each independently increase risk; together they **additively increase overall risk**. Combined therapy also increases density [^1111SanE], compounding detection challenges and interval cancer risk [^113kgrEd].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Use the lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration [^111tFY3a] consistent with treatment goals.

- **Consider non-hormonal options** [^113vHC8Y] or estrogen-alone if appropriate [^115ff5dP].

- **Provide individualized counseling** [^113vHC8Y] on risks and benefits, including family history and breast density.

---

## Alternative therapies and risk mitigation strategies

- **Non-hormonal options** (SSRIs, SNRIs, gabapentin, clonidine) can manage vasomotor symptoms without increasing breast cancer risk [^1174zrG3].

- **Lifestyle measures** (weight control, exercise, alcohol moderation) reduce risk [^113zSXNN].

- **If hormone therapy is used**, limit duration and monitor with regular clinical breast exams and imaging [^111tFY3a].

---

Prempro **increases breast cancer risk** [^114ykGim], especially with a first-degree family history and dense breasts. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, consider non-hormonal options, and monitor closely.

### Epidemiology, genetics, and risk evaluation of postmenopausal women at risk of breast cancer [^112N6x9B]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

Breast cancer risk factors have been studied for the past three decades, and the single most important risk factor is age. Hormonally linked adult reproductive and anthropometric risk factors contribute to the etiology of postmenopausal breast cancer. The risk of breast cancer increases among women older than 50 years of age who have benign breast disease, especially those with atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia. Lobular carcinoma in situ increases risk significantly, as do a family history of breast cancer in first-degree relatives and the presence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.

Diet, exercise, and environmental factors play a very small role in overall risk. Mammographic breast density increases relative risk fivefold among women with the highest density, and breast cancer risk is two to three times greater in women with elevated serum levels of estradiol or testosterone. Multivariate risk models allow determination of composite relative risks and cumulative lifetime risk, although improved models for African American women are required.

For postmenopausal women, newer risk models are being developed and validated that include age, breast density, race, ethnicity, family history of breast cancer, a previous breast biopsy, body mass index, age at onset of natural menopause, hormone therapy, and previous false-positive mammography. A simpler model that includes only age, breast cancer in first-degree relatives, and previous breast biopsy performs well for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. As many as 10 million women in the United States are

### Estrogen-plus-progestin use and mammographic density in postmenopausal women: Women's Health Initiative randomized trial [^1111SanE]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2005). High credibility.

Increased mammographic density reduces the sensitivity of screening mammography, is associated with increased breast cancer risk, and may be hormone-related. We assessed the effect of estrogen-plus-progestin therapy on mammographic density in this study.

- **Methods**: In a racially and ethnically diverse ancillary study of the Women's Health Initiative, data from 413 postmenopausal women were examined. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either daily combined conjugated equine estrogens (0.625 mg) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (progestin; 2.5 mg) (n = 202) or a daily placebo (n = 211). The effect of estrogen plus progestin on measured mammographic percent density and abnormal findings was assessed over a 1-year and 2-year period. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided and based on F tests or t tests from mixed-effects models.

- **Results**: Mean mammographic percent density increased by 6.0% at year 1, compared with baseline, in the estrogen-plus-progestin group but decreased by 0.9% in the placebo group (difference = 6.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.3% to 8.5%; P < .001). The mean changes in mammographic density persisted, though slightly attenuated after 2 years, with an absolute increase of 4.9% in the estrogen-plus-progestin group and a decrease of 0.8% in the placebo group (difference = 5.7%, 95% CI = 4.3% to 7.3%; P < .001). These effects were consistent across racial/ethnic groups but were higher among women aged 70–79 years in the estrogen-plus-progestin group (mean increase at year 1 = 11.6%) than in the placebo group (mean decrease at year 1 = 0.1%).

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^114ykGim]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Cases continue to accrue in the prospective studies, but there is no good reason to expect further follow-up would materially alter the main findings for users. To limit biases, the main analyses were restricted to prospective studies, allowed for early menopause decreasing breast cancer risk and bringing forward the age when menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is started, and adjusted for various other potential confounding factors, as other correlates of breast cancer risk might also affect the type or timing of MHT use. Users were included up to no more than 5 years after their last reported MHT use; among them there were, on average, only 1.4 years between the last report about their MHT use and their index date. Some additional use must have occurred during that period, as must some discontinuation, but both have been allowed for, although relative risks (RRs) in users must still have been slightly weakened by discontinuation before the index date. With all these safeguards, the findings are trustworthy for the main patterns of use in the prospective studies.

The clinical relevance of the main findings lies in the magnitude of the absolute risks during and after MHT use for women who start MHT at ages 40–59 years, but the public health relevance depends additionally on the numbers of women previously and currently exposed. Although use of either type of MHT for less than 1 year was associated with little subsequent risk, for women of average weight in developed countries, 5 years of use, starting at age 50 years, would cause an appreciable increase in the probability of developing breast cancer.

### Prempro [^114qGbVY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women.

- **Relative risk of invasive breast cancer**: The relative risk was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo.

- **Breast cancer characteristics**: Invasive breast cancers were larger, more likely to be node positive, and diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status, did not differ between the groups [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].

### Prempro [^115ff5dP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].

Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater and became apparent earlier with estrogen plus progestin therapy compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.

Use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.

All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.

### Outcomes of screening mammography by frequency, breast density, and postmenopausal hormone therapy [^116UJJmw]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Controversy exists about the frequency women should undergo screening mammography and whether screening interval should vary according to risk factors beyond age. The objective of this study was to compare the benefits and harms of screening mammography frequencies according to age, breast density, and postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) use.

This research was designed as a prospective cohort study. Data were collected from January 1994 to December 2008 at mammography facilities in community practice that participate in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) mammography registries. Participants included 11,474 women with breast cancer and 922,624 without breast cancer who underwent mammography at facilities that participate in the BCSC.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The study used logistic regression to calculate the odds of advanced-stage (IIb, III, or IV) and large tumors (> 20 mm in diameter) and the 10-year cumulative probability of a false-positive mammography result by screening frequency, age, breast density, and HT use. The main predictor was screening mammography interval.

Results showed that mammography biennially vs. annually for women aged 50 to 74 years does not increase the risk of tumors with advanced stage or large size, regardless of women's breast density or HT use. However, among women aged 40 to 49 years with extremely dense breasts, biennial mammography vs. annual is associated with an increased risk of advanced-stage cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.89; 95% CI, 1.06–3.39) and large tumors (OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.37–4.18). The cumulative probability of a false-positive mammography result was high among this group.

### Prempro [^116u5Ykh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy also demonstrated an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Studies (14.6)]. In the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of CE and MPA and other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins. Estrogens, with or without progestins, should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.

- **Estrogen-alone therapy**:

	- **Endometrial cancer**: There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

	- **Cardiovascular disorders and probable dementia**: Estrogen-alone therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3), and Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)].

Boxed warning: Use extreme caution when prescribing conjugated estrogens / medroxyprogesterone PO (also known as Premphase, Prempro) in postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older. This is due to the potential risks of dementia and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) associated with these medications.

### Hormone replacement therapy and the risk of breast cancer [^115fTnoy]. Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is given to relieve the climacteric symptoms of menopause. Use of HRT reduced following a report from the Women's Health Initiative linked it to an increased risk of breast cancer. This association has been confirmed in several other studies, including the Million Women Study. The risk of breast cancer is greater for formulations that contain both estrogen and progesterone, compared with estrogen alone. The breast cancer risk associated with HRT is higher for estrogen receptor-positive cancers than for estrogen receptor-negative cancers, and for low-grade cancers compared with high-grade cancers. After cessation of HRT, the increased risk of breast cancer dissipates within 2 years. The rapidity of the decline suggests that a proportion of breast cancers that are hormone dependent will regress if the hormonal stimulation is removed. In evaluating a woman who is considering HRT, factors that have been associated with an increased risk include the initiation of hormone use immediately after menopause, a lean body mass, and high mammographic breast density.

### Management of risk of breast carcinoma in postmenopausal women [^115RX1Vf]. Endocrine-related Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Breast carcinoma is the most frequent tumor in the female population. Many factors can influence the risk of breast cancer; some of them, such as old age and breast cancer 1/2 (BRCA1/BRCA2) gene mutations, are associated with a fourfold increase in risk. A previous diagnosis of atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia or having a first-degree relative with a carcinoma are factors associated with a two- to fourfold increase in risk. A relative risk between 1 and 2 is associated with longer exposure to endogenous hormones as a result of early menarche, late menopause, and obesity, or with recent and prolonged use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), or with behavioral factors such as high alcohol and fat intake.

Is it possible to modify breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women? Risk factors related to lifestyle can be changed, even if it is not clear whether modifying these behavioral factors during the postmenopausal period will influence the overall breast cancer risk. For instance, the influence of exogenous hormones throughout life (both oral contraceptives and HRT) should be evaluated according to the individual risk-benefit ratio.

The problem is even more complex for women who carry genetic mutations and for those who have close relatives with breast cancer, who may be candidates for risk reduction strategies. Prophylactic bilateral mastectomy is still controversial but is frequently offered to or requested by this group of women and may be indicated in BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers. Chemoprevention with tamoxifen and with the new selective estrogen receptor modulators, namely…

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^117FRGfX]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Estrogens have been associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. Yet, emerging clinical and experimental evidence points to progestogens — endogenous progesterone or synthetic progesterone (progestin) — as the primary hormonal driver underlying the seemingly estrogen-associated breast cancer risk. Estrogens may contribute to breast cancer risk indirectly by induction of the progesterone receptor, thus amplifying progesterone signaling. Large studies of hormonal contraceptives suggest that the small increase in breast cancer risk from hormonal contraceptives is mainly attributable to progestins, not estrogens. Estrogen-plus-progestin hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has consistently shown an increase in breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women, whereas estrogen-alone HRT has little impact on breast cancer risk in naturally or surgically menopausal women.

In particular, the long-term follow-up of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trials suggests a benefit of estrogen alone. Recent data further indicate that endogenously elevated estrogen during assisted reproductive technology (ART) exhibits little adverse effect on, or potentially a reduction in, breast cancer risk and recurrence. Also, accumulating evidence suggests that inhibition of progesterone signaling is a critical mechanism underlying the risk-reducing and therapeutic effects of antiestrogens. Estrogen HRT has shown an array of proven benefits, including ameliorating menopausal symptoms and improving bone health. Collective evidence thus suggests that estrogen HRT is likely to offer health benefits.

### Breast cancer risk in relation to the interval between menopause and starting hormone therapy [^112VBue8]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2011). Low credibility.

Although the risk of breast cancer was statistically significantly increased among past users of hormonal therapy (Figure 1), incidence rates declined rapidly after use ceased (Figure 2). In the first two years after hormonal therapy use had ceased, breast cancer risk was still slightly, but statistically significantly, increased (RR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.24; P < 0.001), based on the 1,003 exposed women who developed breast cancer in this analysis. Subsequently, and up to 14 years after hormonal therapy use had ceased, the risk in past users of hormonal therapy remained similar to that of never users (RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.93 to 1.05), based on 1,098 exposed women who developed breast cancer.

### Executive summary of the early-onset breast cancer evidence review conference [^115gxgJw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Dense breasts decrease the sensitivity of mammography because dense breast tissue appears radiopaque, similar to breast cancers, which decreases visual contrast (known as "masking"). In women with extremely dense breasts, mammography has 62% sensitivity for detection of breast cancer, compared with 88% sensitivity for women with fatty breasts. One way to assess delay in diagnosis is to determine the rate of interval cancers — those cancers found between recommended screening intervals following a normal mammogram. No studies evaluating masking due to breast density have exclusively evaluated women with early-onset breast cancer. Most studies included large proportions of women older than age 50 years, though women aged 40–49 years were included. More recent evidence suggests that dense breasts appear to be associated with at least a twofold increased risk of interval cancers as well as a worse prognosis, including larger tumor size and more node-positive disease.

- **Adjunctive screening**: Studies of adjunctive screening of women with dense breasts with ultrasonography and MRI generally noted higher cancer detection rates and earlier diagnoses. However, they also showed an increase in biopsy for benign lesions and increased healthcare costs, and no study demonstrated an improvement in mortality.

- **Recommendations for screening**: The majority of women under age 46 years have dense breasts, so any recommendations for additional screening in this age group would require additional testing in a large number of women whose baseline risk is low. Most organizations, including ACOG and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, do not recommend additional screenings universally for this age group.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^113EmFhS]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

These absolute risks of developing breast cancer during the 20-year age range of 50–69 years are shown in Figure 7. They assume that 6.3% of never users of average weight (i.e. 6.3 in every 100 never users of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT)) would develop breast cancer during this 20-year period (appendix pp 17, 18, 24, 25, 26).

With 5 years of MHT use followed by 15 years of past use, the 20-year risk for estrogen-plus-daily-progestagen would become about 8.3%, representing an absolute increase of 2.0 per every 100 women (one in every 50 users). For estrogen-plus-intermittent-progestagen, the risk would become about 7.7%, signifying an absolute increase of 1.4 per 100 women (one in every 70 users). For estrogen-only, the risk would increase to about 6.8%, an absolute rise of 0.5 per 100 women (one in every 200 users; this excess risk would be more significant in lean women but slight in obese women). About half the excess risk would occur during the first 5 years of MHT use, and the other half would occur during the subsequent 15 years of past use. The 20-year excess risks with 10 years of use from age 50 years would be approximately double those with 5 years of use.

### Hormone therapy use and young-onset breast cancer: A pooled analysis of prospective cohorts included in the Premenopausal Breast Cancer Collaborative Group [^1177zxUj]. The Lancet Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Oestrogen plus progestin hormone therapy is an established risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women. We examined the less well-studied association between exogenous hormones and breast cancer in young women, who might use hormone therapy after gynaecological surgery or to relieve perimenopausal symptoms.

- **Methods**: In this pooled cohort analysis, we investigated the relationship between exogenous hormones and breast cancer in young women using data from 10–13 prospective cohorts from North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The participating cohorts followed up women for incident breast cancer until age 55 years. We used cohort-stratified, multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CI for associations of hormone therapy with incident young-onset breast cancer. We also estimated risk differences based on cumulative risk until age 55 years.

- **Findings**: We included 459,476 women aged 16–54 years (mean 42.0 years [IQR 35.5–49.2]), of whom 8,455 (2%) developed young-onset breast cancer (diagnosed before age 55 years; median follow-up 7.8 years [5.2–11.2]). Overall, 15% of participants reported using hormone therapy, with oestrogen plus progestin hormone therapy (6%) and unopposed oestrogen (5%) being the most common types. Cumulative risk of young-onset breast cancer was 4.1% in non-users. Hormone therapy of any type was not associated with incident young-onset breast cancer (HR 0.96 [95% CI 0.88 to 1.04]), but ever oestrogen hormone therapy use was inversely associated (0.86 [0.75 to 0.98]).

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^117Ub2SV]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

In the oestrogen-progestagen trials (appendix p 30), a total of 864 women developed breast cancer, including 757 in the WHI trial, and there was no apparent discrepancy with the prospective studies. Although the between-group difference in the duration of hormone treatment was only about 3.6 years at cancer diagnosis, there was an increase in risk about as great as in the WHI power calculations, albeit with broad 99% confidence limits (RR 1.26, 99% CI 1.06–1.51; Z = 3.4; p = 0.0007).

- **Limitations**: One limitation of all the available epidemiological evidence is that there is still not long enough follow-up after cessation of prolonged MHT use by women who had started some years of hormonal treatment around the time of menopause. If excess risks in past users are real and persist much longer than 15 years, there will be some additional hazard after age 70 years. Another limitation is that the collaboration sought information only on breast cancer incidence, not mortality, and incidence can depend on the sensitivity and frequency of mammographic screening.

- **Breast cancer detection rates**: Breast cancer detection rates could have been reduced somewhat by the increase in breast density caused by hormonal treatment, or increased somewhat in populations where screening frequency is associated with MHT use, as in the US. The largest prospective study was, however, from the UK, where there is a nationwide mammographic screening programme. In that study, MHT use was not materially associated with screening uptake but was associated with an increase not only in breast cancer incidence (of similar magnitude to that in all prospective studies).

### Menarche, menopause, and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis, including 118 964 women with breast cancer from 117 epidemiological studies [^113sE7gg]. The Lancet Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Analyses of the relative risk (RR) of breast cancer were routinely stratified by the same factors as described above. The effects on the main findings of other potential confounding factors, such as ethnic origin, hormonal contraceptive use, and family history of breast cancer, were also examined. We restricted analyses comparing breast cancer risk in premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women to those aged 45–54 years, as each category is represented in this narrow age band. We used the same stratifications as described above, except that age was stratified by single years. Analyses related to tumor characteristics were stratified by study, center within study, age at diagnosis in single years, and year of birth, and adjusted by parity, age at first birth, BMI, smoking, and alcohol consumption, using the same categories as previously described.

We calculated RRs for breast cancer per 1 year younger at menarche and per 1 year older at menopause using linear regression, with the mean age within each category. Comparisons across different subgroups of women were made using standard χ² tests for heterogeneity, calculated from the change in log likelihood upon addition of extra terms. Significance tests for heterogeneity by tumor subtype were based on analyses within cases only — since controls provide no additional information — and were stratified by age, study, and BMI, adjusted for previously listed variables. Our analyses were conducted using STATA (version 11).

When results for large numbers of subgroups are presented in the figures, 99% confidence intervals (CIs) (or group-specific 99% CIs) are provided, to ta

### Breast density, benign breast disease, and risk of breast cancer over time [^112PJkYy]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Assessing the combined effect of mammographic density and benign breast disease is of utmost importance in designing personalized screening strategies.

- **Methods**: We analyzed individual-level data from 294,943 women aged 50–69 years. These women had participated in at least one mammographic screening within the Spanish Breast Cancer Screening Program across four areas from 1995 to 2015 and were followed up until 2017. We used partly conditional Cox models to assess the association between benign breast disease, breast density, and the risk of breast cancer.

- **Results**: During a median follow-up of 8.0 years, 3697 (1.25%) women were diagnosed with breast cancer, and 5941 (2.01%) had benign breast disease. More than half of the screened women exhibited scattered fibroglandular density (55.0%). The risk of breast cancer independently increased with the presence of benign breast disease and with increased breast density (p for interaction = 0.84). Women with benign breast disease and extremely dense breasts had a threefold elevated risk of breast cancer compared to those with scattered fibroglandular density and without benign breast disease (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.07; 95% CI = 2.01–4.68). Heterogeneous density combined with benign breast disease was associated with nearly a 2.5-fold increased risk (HR = 2.48; 95% CI = 1.66–3.70). Those with extremely dense breasts without benign breast disease had a 2.27 increased risk (95% CI = 2.07–2.49).

- **Conclusions**: Women with benign breast disease had an elevated risk for over 15 years, independently of their breast density category.

### Reassessing the benefits and harms of risk-reducing medication considering the persistent risk of breast cancer mortality in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer [^116moioS]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

The benefits and harms of risk-reducing medications varied by age, prior biopsy, and family history. More than 95% of 35-year-old high-risk women had LCIS on a prior biopsy. Tamoxifen with screening (± MRI) could avoid 191–195 invasive breast cancers and 98–100 breast cancer deaths per 1,000 thirty-five-year-old women with a history of LCIS and a family history of breast cancer. A reduction in 100–102 invasive breast cancers and 19–20 breast cancer deaths per 1,000 women were attributable to risk-reducing tamoxifen alone. The benefits were primarily seen in ER+ disease. However, tamoxifen was associated with five venous thromboembolisms and five endometrial cancers per 1,000 women.

- **Benefits and harms of risk-reducing medication (tamoxifen), screening mammography, and supplemental screening with magnetic resonance imaging**:
	- **In 35-year-old women based on history of breast biopsy and family history of breast cancer**: The majority of 50-year-old high-risk women had a history of proliferative changes without atypia (68%), and a family history (75%). These women could avoid 126–128 invasive breast cancers and 59–60 breast cancer deaths per 1,000 women with tamoxifen and screening (± MRI). However, their endometrial cancers increased to 11 events per 1,000 women.
	- **In high-risk women aged 65 and older based on history of breast biopsy and family history of breast cancer**: Most had a history of proliferative changes without atypia (79%) and no family history (55%). Tamoxifen and screening could avoid up to 60 invasive breast cancers.

### Family history and breast cancer risk among older women in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium cohort [^1113rMV4]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

First-degree family history is a strong risk factor for breast cancer, but controversy exists about the magnitude of the association among older women. This study aims to determine whether first-degree family history is associated with increased risk of breast cancer among older women and identifies whether the association varies by breast density.

A prospective cohort study was conducted between 1996 and 2012 using data from seven Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) registries located in New Hampshire, North Carolina, the San Francisco Bay Area, western Washington state, New Mexico, Colorado, and Vermont. During a mean (SD) follow-up of 6.3 (3.2) years, 10,929 invasive breast cancers were diagnosed in a cohort of 403,268 women aged 65 years and older, with data from 472,220 mammography examinations. The 5-year cumulative incidence of invasive breast cancer was estimated by first-degree family history, breast density, and age groups. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association of first-degree family history with the risk of invasive breast cancer, adjusting for breast density, BCSC registry, race/ethnicity, body mass index, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, and benign breast disease for age groups 65 to 74 years and 75 years and older, separately. Data analyses were performed between June 2016 and June 2017.

The exposure considered was a first-degree family history of breast cancer. The main outcome and measure was incident breast cancer. Results showed that in 403,268 women aged 65 years and older, first-degree family history was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.

### Mammographic breast density and family history of breast cancer [^111iAkuJ]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2003). Low credibility.

The association between mammographic breast density and breast cancer risk may be the result of genetic and/or environmental factors that determine breast density. We reasoned that if the genetic factors that underlie breast density increase breast cancer risk, then breast density should be associated with family history of breast cancer. Therefore, we determined the association between mammographic density and family history of breast cancer among women in the San Francisco Mammography Registry.

Mammographic density was classified using the four BI-RADS criteria: 1 = almost entirely fatty, 2 = scattered fibroglandular tissue, 3 = heterogeneously dense, and 4 = extremely dense. We adjusted for age, body mass index, hormone replacement therapy use, menopause status, and personal history of breast cancer. Compared with women with BI-RADS 1 readings, women with higher breast density were more likely to have first-degree relatives with breast cancer (BI-RADS 2, odds ratio [OR] = 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.96 to 1.89; BI-RADS 3, OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.19 to 2.40; BI-RADS 4, OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.05 to 2.71). Thus, the genetic factors that determine breast density may determine breast cancer risk.

### Breast cancer incidence, 1980–2006: Combined roles of menopausal hormone therapy, screening mammography, and estrogen receptor status [^117SxKYD]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2007). Low credibility.

Breast cancer incidence has been rising since at least 1935–1939, but recent US data reveal a statistically significant decline in breast cancer incidence in 2003 that persisted through 2004. Identifying the specific contributions of the potential causes of this long-term increase and the recent decrease in incidence has been challenging. Marked changes in rates of mammography screening and use of menopausal hormone therapy since 1980 have added further complexity. This study examined the potential association between menopausal hormone therapy use and recent changes in breast cancer incidence.

- **Methods**: Using tumor registry, clinical, pathology, and pharmacy data from Kaiser Permanente Northwest, a large prepaid US health plan, we compared age-specific and age-adjusted breast cancer incidence rates (2-year moving averages) with the use of screening mammography and dispensed menopausal hormone therapy prescriptions between 1980 and 2006. Temporal changes in incidence rates were assessed via joinpoint regression.

- **Results**: A total of 7,386 incident invasive breast cancers were diagnosed in plan members from 1980 through 2006. Overall age-adjusted breast cancer incidence rates per 100,000 women rose 25% from the early 1980s (105.6) to 1992–1993 (131.7) and an additional 15% through 2000–2001 (151.3), then dropped by 18% to 2003–2004 (123.6) and edged up slightly in 2005–2006 (126.2). These patterns were largely restricted to women aged 45 years or older and to estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers. Incidence rates of ER-negative tumors experienced neither of the rise.

### Trends in breast cancer incidence, by race, ethnicity, and age among women aged ≥ 20 years - United States, 1999–2018 [^113C3JJg]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Low credibility.

Some forms of hormone replacement therapy taken for more than five years during menopause can raise breast cancer risk. Previous studies have associated the observed decrease in breast cancer incidence, specifically in the early 2000s, with the first report of the Women's Health Initiative. This report found an increased risk of breast cancer associated with hormone replacement therapy, followed by a decrease in its use among postmenopausal women in the United States. In 2017, the North American Menopause Society announced that "for women aged younger than 60 years or who are within ten years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is most favorable for treatment of bothersome vasomotor symptoms and for those at elevated risk for bone loss or fracture". Women who receive hormone therapy for more than five years might need to monitor any symptoms associated with breast cancer and consult with their healthcare provider if any symptoms are noticed.

From 2008 to 2015, breast cancer screening increased slightly among Hispanic women but declined among other groups, including more than 10% in some groups, such as Asian women. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that women aged 50–74 years who are at average risk for breast cancer should get a mammogram every two years. Women aged 40–49 years, particularly those who have a known first-degree relative (i.e. parent, child, or sibling) with breast cancer, should talk to their physician or other healthcare professionals about starting screening with mammography.

### Different menopausal hormone regimens and risk of breast cancer [^116mE8uJ]. Annals of Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

There are considerable knowledge gaps concerning different estrogen and progestin formulations, regimens, and modes of administration of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) and the risk of breast cancer. Our objective was to assess the different treatment options for menopausal HT and the risk of breast cancer.

This Swedish prospective nationwide cohort study included all women who received ≥ 1 HT prescription during the study period 2005–2012 (290,186 ever-users), group-level matched (1:3) to 870,165 never-users; respectively, 6,376 (2.2%) and 18,754 (2.2%) developed breast cancer. HT, ascertained from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, was subdivided by estrogen and progestogen formulation types, regimens (continuous versus sequential), and modes of administration (oral versus transdermal). The risk of invasive breast cancer was presented as adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals.

Use of estrogen-only therapy was associated with a slight excess breast cancer risk [odds ratio (OR) = 1.08 (1.02–1.14)]. The risk for estrogen plus progestogen therapy was higher [OR = 1.77 (1.69–1.85)] and increased with higher age at initiation [OR = 3.59 (3.30–3.91) in women 70+ years]. In contrast, past use was associated with reduced breast cancer risk. Continuous estrogen/progestin use was associated with higher risk [OR = 2.18 (1.99–2.40) for progesterone-derived; OR = 2.66 (2.49–2.84) for testosterone-derived] than sequential use [OR = 1.37 (0.97–1.92) for progesterone-derived; OR = 1.12 (0.96–1.30) for testosterone-derived].

### Delestrogen [^111MLUBZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consistent with the Women's Health Initiative (WHI clinical trials), observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy and a smaller, but still increased risk, for estrogen-alone therapy after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to > 10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to the risk with estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.

Use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.

### Breast cancer risk among women under 55 years of age by joint effects of usage of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy [^116QKFGL]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

To assess the effects on breast cancer risk of exposure to both oral contraceptives and menopausal hormones, an increasingly common exposure, a case-control study was conducted among women under the age of 55 years in Atlanta, GA. The study involved 1,031 cases and 919 population controls.

Ever use of oral contraceptives was associated with a relative risk of 1.1 (95% CI 0.9–1.4), whereas the relative risk for hormone replacement therapy was 0.9 (95% CI 0.7–1.2). Seventeen percent of the cases versus 19% of the population controls reported exposure to both agents, resulting in a relative risk of 1.0 (95% CI 0.7–1.4) relative to those unexposed to either preparation.

- **Results**: Although there was little variation in risk associated with joint effects by either age or race, there were statistically nonsignificant elevations in risk for this exposure among women who had experienced a natural menopause (relative risk = 2.0, 95% CI 0.7–5.6), were relatively thin (relative risk = 1.5, 95% CI 0.8–3.0), or who had a first-degree relative with breast cancer (relative risk = 2.0, 95% CI 0.6–7.0). When considering the joint effects of longer-term use of both agents, subjects who reported use of oral contraceptives for 10 or more years and hormone replacement for 3 or more years had a relative risk of 3.2 (95% CI 1.4–7.4) compared with nonusers of either preparation.

- **Conclusions**: Although our results must be cautiously interpreted given the small numbers within subgroups, they raise concern and emphasize the need for further evaluation on breast cancer risk due to the increasingly common exposure.

### Breast cancer risk assessment: A guide for clinicians using the NCCN breast cancer risk reduction guidelines [^111VoLXz]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2003). Low credibility.

Breast cancer, a complex and heterogeneous disease, is the most common malignancy diagnosed in women in the United States, with over 180,000 new cases and approximately 44,000 deaths per year. Breast cancer risk is influenced by a large number of factors, including age, family history, reproductive and hormonal history, proliferative breast conditions, physical activity, diet, and environmental exposures. These factors all interact in a complex manner to contribute to the risk of developing breast cancer.

Because the interactions between risk factors are poorly understood at the molecular level, it is difficult to accurately evaluate the breast cancer risk of a given person presenting with an individual constellation of factors. To better define the population at increased risk that may warrant specific intervention, several models exist to estimate a woman's risk for developing breast cancer and for harboring a germline mutation in a cancer susceptibility gene. This article summarizes these models and gives brief guidelines about which model may be preferable given a specific family history.

### Committee opinion: Number 262, December 2001. Risk of breast cancer with estrogen-progestin replacement therapy [^113GuvNb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Recent articles have examined the association between the use of combination estrogen-progestin regimens for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the risk of breast cancer. The objective of this Committee Opinion is to critically evaluate the presented evidence. Although epidemiologic studies suggest that the addition of progestin to estrogens may increase the risk of breast cancer, this increased risk has not been proven. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend that HRT be considered as a treatment to relieve vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary tract atrophy and to assess the risks and benefits of HRT. When considering the use of HRT for longer than 5 years, the clinician and individual patient should weigh the benefits versus the potential side effects and risks for that particular patient.

### Menarche, menopause, and breast cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis, including 118 964 women with breast cancer from 117 epidemiological studies [^115sUpd8]. The Lancet Oncology (2012). High credibility.

The proportion of different types of breast cancer varies by age and menopausal status. For tumours of known oestrogen receptor status, the proportion that is oestrogen receptor-positive increases with age in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. However, at ages 45–54 years, where both premenopausal and postmenopausal women are represented, a sudden decrease occurs at menopause in the proportion of oestrogen receptor-positive tumours. Similarly, the proportion of tumours with lobular histology increases with age, with a sudden decrease around the time of menopause. After adjusting by single years of age and other potential confounding factors, the heterogeneity at ages 45–54 years between premenopausal and postmenopausal women is highly significant for both oestrogen receptor status (heterogeneity p = 0.003) and tumour histology (heterogeneity p < 0.0001).

	- Oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and lobular histology are shown for age groups < 40 years, 40–44 years, 45–54 years, 55–59 years, 60–64 years, and ≥ 65 years, plotted against the mean age of women with breast cancer in each age group.

In analyses restricted to postmenopausal women, the relative risk of breast cancer increased by a factor of 1.029 (1.025–1.032, p < 0.0001) for every year older at menopause. The findings were stratified by study, year of birth, age, parity and age at first birth, height, BMI, smoking, and alcohol consumption.

### Mammographic density, response to hormones, and breast cancer risk [^117Bz6CP]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Percent mammographic density (PMD) is a strong risk factor for breast cancer that changes in response to hormone exposure. We have examined the magnitude of the association of hormone exposure with PMD according to subsequent breast cancer risk.

- **Methods**: In three case-control studies, with 1,164 patient cases and 1,155 controls nested in cohorts of women screened with mammography, we examined the association of PMD measured in the baseline mammogram with the risk of breast cancer in the following 1 to 8 years (mean, 3 years), according to the use of oral contraceptives (OCs) in premenopausal women, menopause, and hormone therapy (HT) in postmenopausal women. All statistical comparisons are adjusted for age and other risk factors.

- **Results**: In premenopausal women who later developed breast cancer (patient cases), PMD was 5.3% greater in past users of OCs than in nonusers (P = 0.06). In controls, OC users had 2% less density than nonusers (P = 0.44; test for interaction P = 0.06). The difference in PMD between premenopausal and postmenopausal women for patient cases was 8.5% (P < .001) and for controls, 3.9% (P = 0.01; test for interaction P = 0.03). In postmenopausal women, PMD was 6% greater in patients who used HT than in never users (P < .001). Controls who used HT had 1.6% greater PMD (P = 0.26) than never users (test for interaction P = 0.001). Differences in PMD resulted mainly from differences in the dense area of the mammogram.

- **Conclusion**: Differences in PMD associated with differences in hormone exposure were greater in women who later developed breast cancer.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^113hUXE6]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Users of systemic hormone therapy who started around the time of menopause were at greater risk of invasive breast cancer than apparently similar never users. Excess risks were greater among past users, but some risk persisted for more than a decade after menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use ceased. There was little excess risk after use of MHT for less than 1 year, but there were definite excess risks associated with just 1–4 years of use, and progressively greater risks with longer use. For a given duration of use, the excess risk among users of MHT was greater for ER+ than for ER– disease. The risk was greater for oestrogen-progestagen than for oestrogen-only preparations, particularly if progestagen use was daily rather than intermittent. Risks did not differ substantially between the main oestrogenic constituents or by whether oestrogens were administered orally or transdermally. There appeared to be little risk, however, from topical vaginal oestrogen preparations, which limit systemic exposure. For the oestrogen-progestagen preparations, risks did not generally differ between different progestagenic constituents, including micronized (natural) progesterone, but appeared to be somewhat lower for combinations containing dydrogesterone.

Ovarian function ceases with menopause; thereafter, oestrogen levels fall substantially, and progesterone levels fall to near zero. Endogenous oestrogen synthesis in postmenopausal women occurs mainly in adipose tissue, catalyzed by the enzyme aromatase. Postmenopausal oestrogen levels therefore correlate strongly with the amount of adipose tissue.

### Medroxyprogesterone acetate [^113uxu29]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller, increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to over 10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy.

Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater and became apparent earlier with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations or routes of administration.

- **Abnormal mammograms**: The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.

All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.

- **Endometrial cancer risk**: An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^112Fd8Bs]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Study identification and data collection**: This collaboration began in 1992. Since then, potentially eligible epidemiological studies have been sought regularly through computer-aided literature searches, manual searches of review articles, written communications, and discussions at scientific meetings. Eligible studies, both published and unpublished, aimed to collect individual information for postmenopausal women on the type and timing of MHT use and on body-mass index (BMI). After 2001, these studies included at least 1000 cases. By January 1, 2018, 59 eligible studies had been identified, and 58 are included (one retrospective, but no prospective, study was unable to provide data on individual participants). Randomized trials involved too few cases to be eligible by these criteria, but trials of the main MHT preparations are reviewed separately, as are some trials of anti-oestrogen drugs.

- **Prospective studies**: These were included using a nested case-control design, with up to four randomly selected controls per case of invasive breast cancer matched on age, year of birth, and region. All analyses included only postmenopausal women, defined as those with a known age at natural menopause (or at bilateral oophorectomy) or unknown age at menopause but at least 55 years old (since 90% of women with natural menopause were postmenopausal by age 55). This excluded younger women with a hysterectomy and unknown age at menopause.

Individual information was sought on sociodemographic, reproductive, and anthropometric factors, as well as on the last reported MHT use.

### Reassessing the benefits and harms of risk-reducing medication considering the persistent risk of breast cancer mortality in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer [^112rzBce]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Risk assessment tools, such as the BCSC Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Calculator, can be used to estimate a woman's 5-year risk of developing breast cancer. In this study, we analyzed the benefits and harms for women with a ≥ 3% 5-year risk of developing breast cancer based on the BCSC risk calculator, indicating a high risk of developing breast cancer according to guidelines.

We also provided results for several subgroups based on the prevalence of individual risk factors in the population, detailed in the data supplement. These subgroups included:

- **35-year-olds with a history of LCIS and family history of breast cancer**
- **50-year-olds with a history of nonproliferative/proliferative changes without atypia and a family history**
- **65-year-olds with a history of nonproliferative/proliferative changes without atypia and no family history of breast cancer**:

- **Strategies**:

We examined the benefits and harms for five strategies:

1. Annual mammography screening (with DBT) alone
2. Five years of risk-reducing medication combined with annual screening
3. Annual screening with supplemental MRI
4. Risk-reducing medication combined with annual screening and MRI
5. No screening, MRI, or risk-reducing medication

An annual interval was defined as 9–18 months between examinations. We considered tamoxifen for all women in the primary analysis, as it is the only risk-reducing medication approved for premenopausal women. We considered the effects of AI in postmenopausal women aged 50 and 65 years.

### Association of menopausal hormone therapy with breast cancer incidence and mortality during long-term follow-up of the Women's Health Initiative randomized clinical trials [^112yXbLo]. JAMA (2020). High credibility.

The influence of menopausal hormone therapy on breast cancer remains unsettled, with discordant findings from observational studies and randomized clinical trials. The objective of this study is to assess the association of prior randomized use of estrogen plus progestin or prior randomized use of estrogen alone with breast cancer incidence and mortality in the Women's Health Initiative clinical trials.

Long-term follow-up was conducted for two placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials that involved 27,347 postmenopausal women aged 50 through 79 years. These women had no prior breast cancer and a negative baseline screening mammogram. They were enrolled at 40 US centers from 1993 to 1998, with follow-up extending through December 31, 2017.

- **Interventions**: In the trial involving 16,608 women with a uterus, 8,506 were randomized to receive 0.625 mg/day of conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) plus 2.5 mg/day of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and 8,102 to receive a placebo. In the trial involving 10,739 women with prior hysterectomy, 5,310 were randomized to receive 0.625 mg/day of CEE alone and 5,429 to receive a placebo. The CEE-plus-MPA trial was stopped in 2002 following a median intervention duration of 5.6 years, and the CEE-only trial was stopped in 2004 following a median intervention duration of 7.2 years.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was breast cancer incidence (protocol-prespecified primary monitoring outcome for harm). Secondary outcomes included deaths from breast cancer and deaths following a breast cancer diagnosis.

Among the 27,347 postmenopausal women who were randomized in both trials, the baseline mean (SD) age…

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^1172ubhQ]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Published findings on breast cancer risk associated with different types of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) are inconsistent, with limited information on long-term effects. This study brings together the epidemiological evidence, both published and unpublished, on these associations and reviews the relevant randomized evidence.

Principal analyses used individual participant data from all eligible prospective studies that had sought information on the type and timing of MHT use. The main analyses are of individuals with complete information on this. Studies were identified by searching numerous formal and informal sources from January 1, 1992, to January 1, 2018. Users were included up to 5 years (mean 1.4 years) after last-reported MHT use. Logistic regression yielded adjusted risk ratios (RRs) comparing particular groups of MHT users versus never users.

During prospective follow-up, 108,647 postmenopausal women developed breast cancer at a mean age of 65 years (SD 7); 55,575 (51%) had used MHT. Among women with complete information, mean MHT duration was 10 years (SD 6) for current users and 7 years (SD 6) for past users. The mean age was 50 years (SD 5) at menopause and 50 years (SD 6) at starting MHT. Every MHT type, except vaginal oestrogens, was associated with excess breast cancer risks, which increased steadily with duration of use and were greater for oestrogen-progestagen than oestrogen-only preparations. Among users, these excess risks were definite even during years 1–4 (oestrogen-progestagen RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.52–1.69).

### Long-acting, progestin-based contraceptives and risk of breast, gynecological, and other cancers [^114MwpEB]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Low credibility.

Long-acting, reversible contraceptives, particularly progestin-based forms, provide convenient, long-lasting, and highly effective female contraception. They include intrauterine devices, subdermal implants, and depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate injections. The use of these contraceptives has increased substantially over the past 20 years. Their advantages include long durations of action, ranging from a few months (injections) up to seven years (intrauterine devices) and suitability when taking estrogen is contraindicated or undesirable.

Long-term combined oral contraceptive pill use substantially reduces endometrial and ovarian cancer risks, but recent users have slightly increased risks of breast and cervical cancers. As the use of long-acting, reversible contraceptives increases, it is important that we understand the potential effects on future cancer rates. There are currently few data on the effects of these contraceptives on cancer risk despite their increasing use.

A 2023 meta-analysis reported a 20% to 30% increased risk of breast cancer for premenopausal women who used progestogen-only contraceptives, regardless of type, with risk not returning to baseline until 10 or more years after last use. Two studies specifically investigating the use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system and ovarian cancer found a 40% to 50% reduction in risk. Similarly, a pooled analysis reported that the use of depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate was associated with a 35% reduction in ovarian cancer risk. Studies of other cancers have been limited.

### Perceived risk of breast cancer among women at average and increased risk [^114o7cLf]. Journal of Women's Health (2005). Low credibility.

The accuracy of a woman's perception of her risk of developing breast cancer has gained importance as more options for primary prevention become available for those at increased risk. Conversely, women at average risk who perceive themselves as at increased risk may suffer from avoidable anxiety or unnecessary treatment. This study examined characteristics associated with the perception of breast cancer risk among women at average and increased risk.

- **Methods**: We included 1700 women aged 40–74 years without a history of breast cancer. The outcome variable was a woman's perceived lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. The Gail model was used to categorize a woman's actual risk as average or high. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess a woman's perception that her risk was higher than average for those whose Gail score indicated average risk (≥ 1.67% 5-year risk).

- **Results**: Of the women at average risk, 72% accurately perceived their risk, whereas only 43% of those at high risk did so. Among women at average risk, those who were younger, had a family history of breast cancer, had no history of childbirth, or had more frequent exposure to lay media information about breast health were more likely to overestimate their future risk. Among women at increased risk, younger women and those with a family history of breast cancer were more likely to accurately perceive their increased risk.

### Breast cancer after use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone: Analyses of data from 2 Women's Health Initiative randomized clinical trials [^1148X84h]. JAMA Oncology (2015). High credibility.

Use of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) continues in clinical practice, but reports are conflicting concerning the longer-term breast cancer effects of relatively short-term use.

- **Objective**: To report the longer-term influence of menopausal HT on breast cancer incidence in the 2 Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized clinical trials.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A total of 27,347 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years were enrolled at 40 US centers from 1993 to 1998 and followed up for a median of 13 years through September 2010.

- **Interventions**: A total of 16,608 women with a uterus were randomized to conjugated equine estrogens (0.625 mg/d [estrogen]) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg/d [progestin]) (E+P) or placebo with a median intervention duration of 5.6 years. Additionally, 10,739 women with prior hysterectomy were randomized to conjugated equine estrogens alone (0.625 mg/d) or placebo with a median intervention duration of 7.2 years.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Time-specific invasive breast cancer incidence rates and exploratory analyses of breast cancer characteristics by intervention and post-intervention phases in the 2 HT trials.

- **Results**: In the E+P trial, hazard ratios (HRs) for the influence of combined HT on breast cancer were lower than 1 for 2 years (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47–1.08) and steadily increased throughout the intervention, becoming significantly increased for the entire intervention phase (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01–1.53). In the early post-intervention phase (within 2.75 years from intervention), there was a sharp decrease in breast cancer incidence.

### Prempro [^116qw3n9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].

After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26% of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade and other features, did not show significant differences.

### Executive summary of the early-onset breast cancer evidence review conference [^116xP1kB]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Past or present use of hormonal contraception

There have been conflicting data regarding the effect of hormonal contraception on breast cancer risk. A large meta-analysis in 1996 revealed a small increased risk of breast cancer among women with recent oral contraceptive use (RR 1.07, SD 0.02, P < 0.001). Similar findings were noted in a large cohort study in 2017 (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.14–1.26). The absolute risk was quite small, with one additional breast cancer diagnosis for every 7,690 women using hormonal contraception each year. In both studies, breast cancer risk returned to baseline 5–10 years after discontinuing hormonal contraception. Most studies do not suggest an increased risk of breast cancer among women using a levonorgestrel intrauterine system (IUS) or depo-medroxyprogesterone injections. There are limited data regarding the etonogestrel implant, but no study at the time of writing has demonstrated an increased breast cancer risk.

The risks of hormonal contraception must be weighed against the health, social, and economic consequences of unplanned pregnancy, as well as the many noncontraceptive benefits of hormonal contraception. The maternal mortality rate in the United States in 2015 was 26.4 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies, which is comparable with the rate of excess breast cancer diagnoses (13 [95% CI 10–16]/100,000 person years) related to hormonal contraception suggested by the 2017 cohort study. Hormonal contraception, particularly oral contraceptives, significantly decreases the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers. There are no screening guidelines that specify this association.

- **Estrogen plus progestin therapy**: Estrogen plus progestin therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3), and Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)].

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI) in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 5.6 years of treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogen (CE) [0.625 mg] combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) [2.5 mg], relative to placebo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Studies (14.6)].

The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of the WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 4 years of treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) combined with MPA (2.5 mg), relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Studies (14.7)].

### Prempro [^112RqfJM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies enrolled approximately 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women into two substudies. The aim was to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral conjugated estrogens (CE, 0.625 mg) alone or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, 2.5 mg) compared to a placebo in preventing certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), silent MI, and CHD death. Invasive breast cancer was the primary adverse outcome. A "global index" included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE plus MPA or CE-alone on menopausal symptoms.

- **WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy**: The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the "global index". The absolute excess risk of events included in the "global index" was 19 per 10,000 women-years.

	- For those outcomes in the WHI "global index" that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers. Meanwhile, the absolute risk reductions per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer fractures.

### Menarche, menopause, and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis, including 118 964 women with breast cancer from 117 epidemiological studies [^1173tsdg]. The Lancet Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Although a woman's age at menarche does not coincide precisely with the onset of breast development, the two are highly correlated. Breast cancer is almost unknown before menarche and extremely rare soon afterwards, making it effectively impossible to study the short-term effects of the hormonal changes associated with menarche by comparing breast cancer risk in women of identical ages before and soon after menarche.

These findings confirm that a young age at menarche and an old age at menopause increase breast cancer risk. Many factors known to affect breast cancer risk, including childbearing patterns, height, and BMI, are also associated with both women's age at menarche and their age at menopause. To ensure as much comparability as possible between women with breast cancer and controls, and thus to minimize potential confounding, analyses were stratified by these factors, and by study, age, year of birth, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Additional adjustment by ethnic origin, hormonal contraceptive use, and family history of breast cancer altered the excess relative risk estimates by less than 1%. The associations did not vary materially by women's personal characteristics, other than BMI among postmenopausal women.

This meta-analysis of individual-participant data includes almost all available epidemiological evidence for the association between menarche and menopause and breast cancer risk. Large numbers of cases were required to assess reliably whether the associations differ by tumor type and by characteristics of the affected women. Combining individual data from many studies enhances the analysis' validity and reliability.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^116vr7k5]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Among women who developed breast cancer in the prospective studies, the mean age at menopause was 50 years (SD 5), the mean age at first MHT use was 50 years (SD 6), and the mean duration of MHT use was 10 years (SD 6) in current users and 7 years (SD 6) in past users. Hysterectomy largely determined MHT type; the proportions of women reported to have undergone the procedure were 2,710 (7%) of 37,951 for oestrogen-progestagen users, but 31,187 (84%) of 37,213 for oestrogen-only users.

RRs were consistently greater for oestrogen-progestagen than oestrogen-only preparations; they were greater in current than in past users and increased steadily with duration of use. For each MHT type, there was a significant excess risk even during years 1–4 (mean: year 3) of use: the RRs were 1.60 (95% CI 1.52–1.69) for oestrogen-progestagen and 1.17 (1.10–1.26) for oestrogen-only MHT. During years 5–14 (mean: year 9) of use, the RRs were 2.08 (2.02–2.15) for oestrogen-progestagen and 1.33 (1.28–1.37) for oestrogen-only MHT. In past users, excess duration-dependent risks persisted for more than a decade after stopping MHT use. There is little information about breast cancer risk associated with past use that had ceased more than 15 years previously.

### Prempro [^111tFY3a]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy demonstrated an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [see warnings and precautions (5.2), and clinical studies (14.6)]. In the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of CE and MPA and other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins. Estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.

- **Estrogen-alone therapy**:

	- **Endometrial cancer**: There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding [see warnings and precautions (5.2)].

	- **Cardiovascular disorders and probable dementia**: Estrogen-alone therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia [see warnings and precautions (5.1, 5.3), and clinical studies (14.6, 14.7)].
