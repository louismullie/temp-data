## Question

what about in cirrhosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what about in cirrhosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and pathophysiology to anchor the discussion. Then, I should verify the natural history and staging, especially compensated versus decompensated disease. Next, I will examine the major complications and their prognostic implications. After that, I need to review diagnostic strategies, including noninvasive fibrosis assessment and when to biopsy. Then, I will appraise management principles, including etiologic therapy, portal hypertension management, nutrition/frailty, and palliative care. Finally, I should consider special populations, emerging concepts, and synthesize a practical clinical takeaway with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals. Cirrhosis is the histologic endpoint of chronic liver injury characterized by regenerative nodules surrounded by fibrous bands, which disrupts hepatic architecture, impairs hepatocyte function, and causes portal hypertension; importantly, fibrogenesis is dynamic and, in some cases, reversible with treatment of the underlying disease, which reframes cirrhosis as a modifiable process rather than purely irreversible scarring [^114Qe73z] [^112by3m1].

> Wait, let me verify the natural history and staging because prognosis hinges on this. Compensated cirrhosis is typically asymptomatic with preserved synthetic function, whereas decompensated cirrhosis is defined by clinically overt complications such as ascites, variceal hemorrhage, or overt hepatic encephalopathy; median survival drops from over 12 years in compensated disease to less than 1.5 years after the first decompensating event, underscoring the inflection point in trajectory and the need for early intervention and transplant evaluation [^117VKS9P] [^116RrfDX].

> I will now examine the major complications and their prognostic weight. Portal hypertension drives variceal bleeding, ascites, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, while hepatic encephalopathy reflects neurocognitive dysfunction from portosystemic shunting and ammonia toxicity; acute kidney injury, particularly hepatorenal syndrome, and acute-on-chronic liver failure with multi-organ failure carry very high short-term mortality and mandate intensive monitoring and organ support in appropriate settings [^117CdrSP] [^117Bkzte].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis; I should confirm the recommended diagnostic approach. Noninvasive fibrosis assessment with elastography and blood-based scores is preferred initially to detect significant fibrosis or cirrhosis, reserving liver biopsy for cases where staging will change management or when noninvasive tests are inconclusive; this balances accuracy with safety and avoids unnecessary invasive procedures [^112MRk9T] [^112MRk9T].

> Next, I should review management principles, starting with etiologic therapy, because removing the driver of injury is the most effective antifibrotic strategy. Viral hepatitis cure, alcohol abstinence, metabolic risk modification, and autoimmune disease control can halt and sometimes reverse fibrosis, reducing portal pressures and decompensation risk; this is foundational and should be pursued aggressively in all patients [^116DVk6V] [^112by3m1].

> I need to check portal hypertension management next. Nonselective beta-blockers remain first-line for primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding and may reduce decompensation risk in compensated patients with clinically significant portal hypertension; endoscopic variceal ligation is indicated for medium/large varices or when beta-blockers are contraindicated, and serial surveillance is essential given the dynamic nature of variceal progression [^115doYWW] [^117VKS9P].

> Let me consider nutrition, frailty, and sarcopenia because these strongly modulate outcomes. I should confirm that all patients with cirrhosis be screened for malnutrition and frailty at baseline and reassessed periodically, with more frequent checks in decompensated disease; personalized nutrition prescriptions, resistance exercise, and multidisciplinary care improve muscle mass, physical function, and survival, and should be integrated early rather than as an afterthought [^113UxMUy] [^116oiBQ2] [^116SNAah].

> But wait, what if the patient is decompensated and symptomatic; I should verify palliative care integration. Palliative care should begin at diagnosis and continue alongside disease-directed therapy, with structured symptom assessment, advance care planning, and caregiver support; this improves symptom control, alignment with goals, and may reduce readmissions and aggressive care near the end of life [^112TdW7N] [^116Jb1ZZ] [^114N3siz].

> I should double-check special populations and emerging concepts so I don't miss nuances. In pediatrics, etiologies differ and imaging-based fibrosis assessment is central; in surgical candidates, perioperative risk stratification with noninvasive fibrosis testing and Child-Pugh/MELD is standard; sex-based differences suggest males have higher risks of decompensation and HCC, warranting tailored surveillance; and cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction with dynamic shifts from inflammation to immunoparesis explains infection susceptibility and informs immunomodulatory strategies under study [^115KpChE] [^112AdVJB] [^116CHG61] [^116z88x2].

> Let me reconsider the practical clinical takeaway to ensure it is actionable. Cirrhosis is a staged, dynamic disease in which early detection of fibrosis, aggressive etiologic therapy, portal hypertension risk stratification, nutrition and frailty interventions, and early transplant evaluation in those who decompensate are the pillars of care; missing cirrhosis or delaying these steps worsens outcomes, whereas proactive, multidisciplinary management can delay or prevent decompensation and improve survival and quality of life [^116DVk6V] [^117VKS9P] [^113UxMUy].

Cirrhosis is the **end-stage of chronic liver disease** [^116DVk6V], characterized by fibrosis, regenerative nodules, and portal hypertension, with progression from compensated to decompensated disease marked by ascites, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, and jaundice [^117VKS9P]. Diagnosis relies on **noninvasive elastography** [^112MRk9T] and blood tests [^112MRk9T], reserving biopsy for uncertainty [^112MRk9T]. Management centers on treating the cause (e.g. alcohol, hepatitis, NAFLD) [^116DVk6V], preventing complications with beta-blockers, variceal ligation, lactulose/rifaximin, and albumin [^117VKS9P] [^116xRUQ9] [^115tjxyP], and considering transplant when decompensated [^116XgxvK]. Prognosis is stage-dependent: median survival exceeds 12 years in compensated disease but drops to less than 1.5 years after decompensation [^117VKS9P]; **early detection and etiologic therapy** can slow or reverse fibrosis [^112by3m1] [^112AWFvj].

---

## Pathophysiology

Cirrhosis arises from **chronic liver injury** [^116DVk6V] — alcohol, hepatitis B/C, NAFLD, autoimmune hepatitis, or metabolic diseases — leading to hepatocyte injury, inflammation, and activation of hepatic stellate cells, which deposit extracellular matrix and collagen, causing fibrosis [^112by3m1]. Fibrosis distorts architecture, impairs blood flow, and causes portal hypertension, driving complications such as varices, ascites, and encephalopathy [^114Qe73z].

---

## Clinical presentation

Cirrhosis is staged as **compensated** (asymptomatic or minimal symptoms) or **decompensated** (overt complications) [^117VKS9P]:

| **Stage** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Compensated | - Asymptomatic <br/> - Fatigue <br/> - Mild hepatomegaly <br/> - Normal or mildly abnormal labs [^116DVk6V] |
| Decompensated | - Ascites <br/> - Variceal bleeding <br/> - Hepatic encephalopathy <br/> - Jaundice <br/> - Sarcopenia <br/> - Poor prognosis [^117VKS9P] |

---

## Diagnosis

- **Noninvasive tests**: Transient elastography (FibroScan) [^112MRk9T] and blood-based scores (APRI, FIB-4) are first-line to detect fibrosis/cirrhosis [^117Qbmga].
- **Liver biopsy**: Reserved for diagnostic uncertainty or atypical disease [^112MRk9T].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound, CT, or MRI assess liver morphology, portal hypertension, and complications (e.g. HCC) [^115KpChE].

---

## Complications

Major complications include:

- **Portal hypertension**: Variceal bleeding, ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^114Qe73z].
- **Hepatic encephalopathy**: Cognitive impairment, asterixis, coma [^115tjxyP].
- **Hepatorenal syndrome**: Functional renal failure from hemodynamic changes [^116ApKgT].
- **Hepatocellular carcinoma**: Annual incidence 1–4% in cirrhosis [^114MXFzg].
- **Malnutrition and sarcopenia**: Common and prognostically important [^113UxMUy].

---

## Management

Management is **multidisciplinary** and stage-specific:

- **Treat the underlying cause**: Alcohol cessation, antiviral therapy, metabolic control [^116DVk6V].
- **Prevent complications**: Nonselective beta-blockers for varices, variceal ligation, lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy, albumin for ascites/HRS [^notfound].
- **Nutrition**: High-protein diet, branched-chain amino acids, and exercise to combat sarcopenia [^notfound].
- **Liver transplantation**: Indicated for decompensated cirrhosis or early HCC within Milan criteria [^116XgxvK].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on stage and complications: compensated cirrhosis has a median survival > 12 years, whereas decompensated disease drops to < 1.5 years [^117VKS9P]. MELD and Child-Pugh scores guide prognosis and transplant prioritization [^116RrfDX]. Early detection and etiologic therapy can **reverse fibrosis** and improve outcomes [^112by3m1] [^112AWFvj].

---

Cirrhosis is a **progressive, reversible** [^112by3m1] disease with high morbidity and mortality; **early diagnosis, etiologic treatment, and complication prevention** are essential to improving survival and quality of life [^116DVk6V].

### Liver cirrhosis [^115LY9oj]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Cirrhosis is an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in more developed countries, being the 14th most common cause of death worldwide but fourth in central Europe. Increasingly, cirrhosis has been seen to be not a single disease entity, but one that can be subclassified into distinct clinical prognostic stages, with 1-year mortality ranging from 1% to 57% depending on the stage. We review the current understanding of cirrhosis as a dynamic process and outline current therapeutic options for prevention and treatment of complications of cirrhosis, on the basis of the subclassification in clinical stages. The new concept in management of patients with cirrhosis should be prevention and early intervention to stabilise disease progression and to avoid or delay clinical decompensation and the need for liver transplantation. The challenge in the 21st century is to prevent the need for liver transplantation in as many patients with cirrhosis as possible.

### Beyond "cirrhosis": a proposal from the international liver pathology study group [^114yXjmu]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

"Cirrhosis" is a morphologic term that has been used for almost 200 years to denote the end stage of a variety of chronic liver diseases. The term implies a condition with adverse prognosis due to the well-known complications of portal hypertension, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure. However, recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic liver diseases have changed the natural history of cirrhosis significantly. This consensus document by the International Liver Pathology Study Group challenges the usefulness of the word cirrhosis in modern medicine and suggests that this is an appropriate time to consider discontinuing the use of this term. The role of pathologists should evolve to the diagnosis of advanced stage of chronic liver disease, with emphasis on etiology, grade of activity, features suggestive of progression or regression, presence of other diseases, and risk factors for malignancy, within the perspective of an integrated clinicopathologic assessment.

Cirrhosis is a common chronic condition with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Optimal medical management involves a multidisciplinary approach, but coordination between medical specialties needs to be improved. This clinical perspective discusses care coordination interventions that have been successful in other disease states and how they could be applied to the management of cirrhosis.

### Reversal of liver cirrhosis: a desirable clinical outcome and its pathogenic background [^112AWFvj]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis is the final stage of chronic liver damage of various etiologies. It used to be considered an irreversible lesion, but enormous advances in our understanding of hepatic cellular and molecular biology in the past 2 decades have challenged this view. There is now substantial evidence that cirrhosis can be a reversible process. This concept is supported by an increasing number of clinical reports showing the disappearance of cirrhotic lesions from liver biopsies taken from patients cured of their liver disease. The reversal of cirrhosis usually occurs in patients with short-lived liver disease, after the successful treatment of the underlying liver damage. Recently, however, we observed the spontaneous reversal of cirrhosis after the loss of hepatitis B viremia in 2 men, 21 and 28 years old, who had developed cirrhosis as young children. Several questions and controversial issues concerning the definition of advanced cirrhosis, the limitations of liver biopsy (eg, sampling, interpretation error), and the applicability of noninvasive methods to the assessment of fibrosis, are being addressed. Future prospects include the possibility of antifibrotic therapy to prevent fibrosis or favor its degradation.

### Malnutrition, frailty, and sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113UxMUy]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Cirrhosis — definitions of malnutrition, frailty, and sarcopenia are provided with consensus operationalization for clinical practice. Malnutrition is a clinical syndrome resulting from an imbalance of nutrients that causes measurable adverse effects on tissue/body form, function, and/or clinical outcome. Frailty is a clinical state of decreased physiologic reserve and increased vulnerability to health stressors, with physical frailty representing impaired muscle contractile function manifested as decreased physical function, decreased functional performance, and disability. Sarcopenia is a progressive and generalized skeletal muscle disorder associated with adverse outcomes, and in patients with cirrhosis is operationalized as the phenotypic manifestation of loss of muscle mass.

### Management of the major complications of cirrhosis: beyond guidelines [^111bSgeR]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Along with a growing understanding of the pathophysiology of cirrhosis and its complications, new therapies and management strategies have emerged in recent years. Many of these advances have helped inform the current EASL clinical practice guidelines 1 on the management of some of the key complications of cirrhosis, such as ascites, variceal bleeding and infection. However, there are still some aspects of management where the evidence base is less clear, and/or where opinions amongst practitioners remain divided. Some of these more controversial areas are explored in this section, wherein we present evidence culminating in a suggested management approach based on expert opinion and extending beyond the current guidelines.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^112TdW7N]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Palliative care definitions in decompensated cirrhosis state that palliative care can be provided at any stage of a serious illness and concurrently with disease-directed and curative treatments (including organ transplants), and over the past decade the body of evidence supporting palliative care has expanded to include persons with nonmalignant conditions, such as cirrhosis. Table 1 illustrates the conceptual distinctions between primary and specialty palliative care, where specialty palliative care refers to care delivered by specialists with advanced palliative care skills such as board-certified palliative care physicians or palliative-certified nurses, social workers, pharmacists, and chaplains, whereas primary palliative care describes care aligned with the principles of palliative care that can be delivered by any medical professional. Advance care planning (ACP) is a component of palliative care that involves the iterative and longitudinal process of medical decision making for patients and their families over the course of their illness trajectory, and includes identifying surrogate decision makers, illness education and prognostic disclosure, and formal documentation of goals for medical and end-of-life care (EoLC) through advance directives that center on the goals, values, and preferences of patients and their families. Within the table, ACP timing is described as Any time a need is identified and reimbursement is noted as Can be reimbursed with ACP billing codes: 99497 (first 30 min) + 99498 (additional 30 min).

### AASLD practice guideline on imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^117Qbmga]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to evaluation of fibrosis (general principles), AASLD 2025 guidelines recommend to consider incorporating imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment into the initial fibrosis staging process in adult patients with chronic liver disease, as it is more accurate than blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^116Jb1ZZ]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Advance care planning (ACP) in cirrhosis — AASLD practice guidance — states that ACP is an iterative process that should start with a diagnosis of cirrhosis and preferably occur before hepatic decompensation and loss of decision-making capacity, and that goals-of-care discussions should be prioritized when LT is being considered or if death is anticipated within 6 months; ACP steps include evaluate decision making capacity, ask about who should be present for the conversation, explain the goals of the conversation, get permission to have the conversation, evaluate disease understanding, provide prognostic information, explore preferences and values, document preferences and surrogate decision maker, and revisit the conversation regularly.

### Acute-on-chronic liver failure clinical guidelines [^113KZZoB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients with cirrhosis and chronic liver disease, acute-on-chronic liver failure is emerging as a major cause of mortality. These guidelines indicate the preferred approach to the management of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. In instances where the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, key concept statements were developed using expert consensus. These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable and should be viewed as the preferred, but not only, approach to clinical scenarios.

### Understanding the complexities of cirrhosis [^111Kdreb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Cirrhosis and its related complications remain a prominent global health concern despite advances in understanding and treating the disorder. Early diagnosis and intervention strategies may reduce the impact of cirrhosis; however, it can be difficult for initial point-of-care health care providers to identify and refer patients with cirrhosis due to lack of knowledge and resources. This review examines current diagnostic strategies for cirrhosis and cirrhosis-related complications and the potential benefits of multidisciplinary care for patients with the disorder.

Methods

A PubMed search of the medical literature was conducted to identify current diagnostic methods and standards and ascertain the impact of multidisciplinary care on patients with cirrhosis.

Findings

Screening of patients at risk for cirrhosis has been recommended by several professional and governmental organizations. Unfortunately, identification of early-stage cirrhosis remains challenging despite development of novel calculations for risk (eg, aspartate transaminase-to-platelet count ratio) that use values from common, noninvasive laboratory tests to determine the extent of liver disease. Abnormal liver function test results and alterations in serum liver enzyme markers (eg, alanine and aspartate transaminases) may suggest cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver disease; however, they are not definitive. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis and staging of cirrhosis, but its cost, invasiveness, and risk of complications have prompted the development of noninvasive tests (eg, elastography). Primary care physicians should be aware of the signs and symptoms of cirrhosis-related complications, particularly portal hypertension, and refer patients to specialists for further evaluation when warranted.

Implications

Patients at risk for cirrhosis should be screened and the underlying etiologic factor(s) of the liver disease treated or appropriately managed when possible. Primary care physicians should be aware of the signs and symptoms of cirrhosis and its related complications and adopt a low threshold for referral to a specialist when the condition is suspected. An integrated, multidisciplinary approach to care between specialists and primary care physicians may improve early detection of cirrhosis and its related complications and strengthen management strategies.

cirrhosisListen to pronunciationA type of chronic, progressive liver disease in which healthy liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue. The scar tissue blocks the flow of blood through the liver and keeps it from working as it should. Symptoms of cirrhosis may not appear until the liver is badly damaged. Causes of cirrhosis include chronic alcohol use disorder, chronic hepatitis infections, and certain autoimmune conditions and genetic disorders. People with cirrhosis have a higher risk of developing liver cancer.

Regarding specific circumstances for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (management), EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to monitor organ function, particularly liver, kidney, brain, lung, coagulation, and circulation frequently and carefully throughout hospitalization, as acute-on-chronic liver failure is a dynamic condition. Individualize monitoring and management according to specific circumstances, mainly patient's age and comorbidities.

### Liver cirrhosis [^114Qe73z]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Cirrhosis is defined as the histological development of regenerative nodules surrounded by fibrous bands in response to chronic liver injury, which leads to portal hypertension and end-stage liver disease. Recent advances in the understanding of the natural history and pathophysiology of cirrhosis, and in treatment of its complications, have resulted in improved management, quality of life, and life expectancy of patients. Liver transplantation remains the only curative option for a selected group of patients, but pharmacological treatments that can halt progression to decompensated cirrhosis or even reverse cirrhosis are currently being developed. This Seminar focuses on the diagnosis, complications, and management of cirrhosis, and new clinical and scientific developments.

### AGA clinical practice update on palliative care management in cirrhosis: expert review [^114aoLXf]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Palliative care management in cirrhosis — best practice advice statements 1–5 emphasize care delivery, communication, and symptom and caregiver assessment. Care with palliative care principles should be provided to any patient with advanced serious chronic illness or life-limiting illness such as cirrhosis, irrespective of transplant candidacy; this care should be based on needs assessment instead of prognosis alone, delivered concurrently with curative or life-prolonging treatments, and tailored to stage of disease. Care inclusive of palliative care principles may be delivered by healthcare providers from any specialty within any healthcare setting. Providers caring for persons with cirrhosis should evaluate the severity of symptoms within physical, psychological, social, and spiritual domains related to their liver disease, its treatment, and prognosis. Across the spectrum of cirrhosis, excellence in communication is integral to high-quality advance care planning, goals of care conversations, and the cultivation of prognostic awareness with patients and caregivers. Routine care for patients with cirrhosis, and particularly those with decompensated disease, should include assessment of caregiver support and screening for caregiver needs.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^115UXPmD]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — purpose and scope states that there are approximately 800,000 hospitalizations a year for cirrhosis complications in the United States, and 7%–8% of these patients require intensive care at an estimated cost of $2 billion but without standardized intensive care protocols. Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a term often applied to patients with chronic liver disease with or without cirrhosis with hepatic and extrahepatic organ failures, most of whom require intensive care, and the document provides guidance and a data-supported approach for the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of patients with cirrhosis and ACLF as well as cirrhosis and critical illness; it differs from the AASLD Guidelines in that it was developed by consensus of an expert panel with oversight provided by the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee because there are an insufficient number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) available to support meaningful systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The introduction describes traditional stages of cirrhosis as a compensated phase with no complications and a decompensated phase that manifests with complications of portal hypertension, notes that there is a more rapid phase, and states that in cirrhosis precipitating events leading to hepatic and extrahepatic organ failures (e.g., neurologic, respiratory, circulatory, renal) may be liver related or non–liver related (e.g., surgery), and often the precipitant is not identified.

When to refer for transplant

LT is the definitive treatment for selected patients with DC and should be considered when the severity of liver disease incurs a likelihood of poor survival or impaired quality of life. A UK clinical guideline outlining the process of LT assessment, including who and how to refer, has recently been published. To summarise, the over-riding principles of LT in the UK are that anticipated life expectancy after LT must exceed that without. A UK Model for End-stage liver disease (UKELD) score of 49 is the equipoise at which the predicted 1 year mortality without LT matches that after LT and is therefore the current minimum listing threshold for elective LT in those with irreversible decompensation.

In the absence of variant conditions, we recommend that referral for LT is considered when a patient with chronic liver disease develops the typical features of DC (ie, jaundice, ascites, variceal bleeding or HE) and UKELD ≥ 49. Early referral is preferable because a patient can become too unwell for LT, if the referral is made too late. The referring clinician should consider first whether the decompensation is potentially reversible (for example with abstinence, in the case of alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), or with antivirals in untreated chronic viral hepatitis). If not, is the patient suitable for LT? Contraindications to LT include coexisting significant extrahepatic comorbidity (with predicted mortality of > 50% at 5 years), presence of extrahepatic sepsis, active malignancy and some previous extrahepatic malignancies. Some contra-indications can be temporary or relative, so if a patient is not currently suitable for LT, consider whether they may be suitable following treatment or an intervention (eg, nasogastric feeding in a patient with severe sarcopenia). If there is any doubt, advice should be sought from the LT unit.

ARLD is the leading indication for LT in the UK. Detailed recommendations for LT referral in ARLD in the UK are beyond the scope of this practice guidance. These have recently been revised. To summarise, it is recommended that patients with decompensated ARLD should be referred to consider their suitability for LT if they still have evidence of decompensation after optimal management and 3 months validated abstinence from alcohol and are otherwise suitable candidates for LT, in line with The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance. Contraindications to LT in ARLD include active ongoing alcohol use, drinking alcohol while on the waitlist and during the period of transplant evaluation, and a history of repeated non-adherence to advice to abstain from alcohol.

### Cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction: distinctive features and clinical relevance [^114s4mS5]. Journal of Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

The term cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction refers to the main syndromic abnormalities of immune function, immunodeficiency and systemic inflammation that are present in cirrhosis. The course of advanced cirrhosis, regardless of its aetiology, is complicated by cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction and this constitutes the pathophysiological hallmark of an increased susceptibility to bacterial infection, distinctive of the disease. Cirrhosis impairs the homeostatic role of the liver in the systemic immune response. Damage to the reticulo-endothelial system compromises the immune surveillance function of the organ and the reduced hepatic synthesis of proteins, involved in innate immunity and pattern recognition, hinders the bactericidal ability of phagocytic cells. Systemic inflammation, in form of activated circulating immune cells and increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, is the result of persistent episodic activation of circulating immune cells from damage-associated molecular patterns, released from necrotic liver cells and, as cirrhosis progresses, from pathogen-associated molecular patterns, released from the leaky gut. Cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction phenotypes switch from predominantly "pro-inflammatory" to predominantly "immunodeficient" in patients with stable ascitic cirrhosis and in patients with severely decompensated cirrhosis and extra-hepatic organ failure (e.g. acute-on-chronic liver failure), respectively. These cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction phenotypes represent the extremes of a spectrum of reversible dynamic events that take place during the course of cirrhosis. Systemic inflammation can affect the functions of tissue somatic cells and modify the clinical manifestation of cirrhosis. The best characterized example is the contribution of systemic inflammation to the haemodynamic derangement of cirrhosis, which correlates negatively with prognosis.

### Malnutrition, frailty, and sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1173s43j]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) practice guidance — malnutrition, frailty, and sarcopenia in cirrhosis describes scope and methodology: it is the first AASLD practice guidance for these conditions, developed by consensus of an expert panel with guidance statements based on formal review and analysis of the literature and oversight by the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee. The document differs from AASLD guidelines, which are supported by systematic reviews, formal rating of evidence and recommendation strength, and meta-analysis using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation system, whereas this guidance was developed by consensus and formal literature review. The committee selected a guidance format because randomized controlled trials were not sufficient to support a guideline, and the goal was to offer clinicians pragmatic recommendations implementable immediately in clinical practice to target malnutrition, frailty, and sarcopenia. It also notes that cirrhosis is a major predisposing condition for the development of malnutrition, frailty, and sarcopenia.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^112hVa6M]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (diagnosis), EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to establish the diagnosis of acute-on-chronic liver failure in patients with cirrhosis and acute decompensation (defined as the acute development or worsening of ascites, overt encephalopathy, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, nonobstructive jaundice, and/or bacterial infections) when organ failures involving high short-term mortality develop.

### Liver cirrhosis [^116DVk6V]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Cirrhosis is widely prevalent worldwide and can be a consequence of different causes, such as obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, high alcohol consumption, hepatitis B or C infection, autoimmune diseases, cholestatic diseases, and iron or copper overload. Cirrhosis develops after a long period of inflammation that results in replacement of the healthy liver parenchyma with fibrotic tissue and regenerative nodules, leading to portal hypertension. The disease evolves from an asymptomatic phase (compensated cirrhosis) to a symptomatic phase (decompensated cirrhosis), the complications of which often result in hospitalisation, impaired quality of life, and high mortality. Progressive portal hypertension, systemic inflammation, and liver failure drive disease outcomes. The management of liver cirrhosis is centred on the treatment of the causes and complications, and liver transplantation can be required in some cases. In this Seminar, we discuss the disease burden, pathophysiology, and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of cirrhosis and its complications. Future challenges include better screening for early fibrosis or cirrhosis, early identification and reversal of causative factors, and prevention of complications.

Information for people with cirrhosis

People diagnosed with cirrhosis should be followed up in clinic by a specialist with an expertise in the management of patients with liver disease.

At the time of diagnosis, patients should be provided with information on their condition in a way they are able to understand. This could include verbal information, tailored videosand information leaflets that patients can use to support self-care, bearing in mind that some patients may not be able to read or understand written information. They should also be sign-posted to patient support groups such as the British Liver Trust, where they can access a wide range of practical information and support.

Patients should be actively involved in decisions around the management of their cirrhosis. They should be made aware of red flag symptoms or complications to look out for and be given lifestyle advice on how to help prevent further liver damage. The rationale for screening, surveillance and primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding (if applicable) should be discussed, including whether surveillance is appropriate. They should also be able to discuss the likely course of their disease and prognosis, if they wish, accepting that there is a degree of uncertainty.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^116fERSi]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain is highly prevalent in patients with cirrhosis and is associated with poor health‐related quality of life and poor functional status. However, there is limited guidance on appropriate pain management in this population, and pharmacologic treatment can be harmful, leading to adverse outcomes, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, renal injury, falls, and hepatic encephalopathy. Chronic pain can be categorized mechanistically into three pain types: nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic, each responsive to different therapies. By discussing the identification, etiology, and treatment of these three mechanistic pain descriptors with a focus on specific challenges in patients with cirrhosis, we provide a framework for better tailoring treatments, including nonpharmacologic therapies, to patients' needs.

### Missed diagnosis of cirrhosis in the inpatient setting [^1172CQ3o]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Cirrhosis accounts for a large number of deaths in the United States and worldwide, leading to an increasing burden on the healthcare system. Cirrhosis is, however, a progressive disease with different potential complications related to liver dysfunction and portal hypertension. Often, patients may present with complications of cirrhosis without having been diagnosed previously. It is pertinent that clinicians recognize these signs to place patients on an appropriate course of management to help delay or avoid further disease progression while avoiding deleterious outcomes and unnecessary utilization. We will discuss the epidemiology of liver disease, cirrhosis, and its complications (hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and varices). In this study, we will discuss the rationale and impact of missing these diagnoses on the healthcare system and patient.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^113zpL2C]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Imaging findings exploring brain structure, function, and neurochemistry corroborate and further clarify the role of the CNS in central sensitization. Structural MRI studies show differences in gray matter volume for pain processing regions in individuals with chronic pain. Functional MRI data show increased neural connectivity in pain processing regions associated with clinical painand decreased connectivity following successful pain treatment. In addition, proton MRI spectroscopy shows increased excitatory and decreased inhibitory neurotransmitter levels in pain processing regions associated with chronic pain. Taken together, these results suggest that CNS dysfunction is an important mechanistic driver of pain pathophysiology.

Although chronic pain conditions can involve an interplay of nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic elements, identifying patients who may have higher degrees of nociplastic pain is helpful for treatment purposes, especially in cirrhosis, in which appropriate analgesic use is a complex decision. In general, nonpharmacologic therapies (e.g. exercise, psychological therapies, integrative therapies) are emphasized for the treatment of nociplastic pain, as oral analgesics are of limited efficacy in chronic pain, generally, and opioids may make pain in conditions such as FM worse through opioid‐induced hyperalgesia. Nociplastic pain conditions are also associated with increased sensitivity to medications and related adverse effects. Furthermore, the comorbid symptoms associated with nociplastic pain provide additional treatment targets.

Using what is known about the clinical features, diagnostic methods, and first‐line treatments of nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain conditions, generally, we can provide a framework for applying these principles to patients with cirrhosis, highlighting considerations specific to liver pathology.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^114Kcsj1]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The development of ascites is a landmark in the natural history of cirrhosis. Therefore, it should be considered an important time point at which an individual patient's suitability for liver transplantation which is a definitive treatment of ascites and its complications, should be determined. Over the years, there has been a substantial improvement in care of patients with cirrhosis, including those with ascites. A study involving over 780 000 hospitalisations of patients with cirrhosis demonstrated an improvement in inpatient survival over a decade despite higher age and more medically complex disease. This was remarkably consistent across several cirrhosis complications, suggesting improved cirrhosis care beyond general improvements in inpatient care. Future research should focus on areas of need and questions where there is no high-quality evidence to guide the management of ascites.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^116Y1Zki]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy is defined as brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunting. Symptoms include nonspecific cognitive impairment, personality changes and changes in consciousness. Overt (symptomatic) hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of cirrhosis that is associated with a poor prognosis. Patients with hepatic encephalopathy may present to healthcare providers who do not have primary responsibility for management of patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, we developed a series of 'consensus points' to provide some guidance on management.

Methods

Using a modified 'Delphi' process, consensus statements were developed that summarize our recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Points on which full consensus could not be reached are also discussed.

Results

Our recommendations emphasize the role of all healthcare providers in the identification of cognitive impairment in patients with cirrhosis and provide guidance on steps that might be considered to make a diagnosis of overt hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, treatment recommendations are summarized. Minimal hepatic encephalopathy can have a significant impact on patients; however, in most circumstances identification and management of minimal hepatic encephalopathy remains the responsibility of specialists in liver diseases.

Conclusion

Our opinion statements aim to define the roles and responsibilities of all healthcare providers who at times care for patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. We suggest that these recommendations be considered further by colleagues in other disciplines and hope that future guidelines consider the management of patients with cirrhosis and with a 'suspicion' of cognitive impairment through to a formal diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy.

AASLD 2021 cirrhosis — Frailty assessment guidance — All patients with cirrhosis should be assessed for frailty with a standardized tool at baseline and longitudinally, and all patients with cirrhosis should be counseled on the risks and adverse clinical consequences of frailty regardless of their baseline frailty status. There are insufficient data to recommend the use of one frailty tool over another; we recommend that selection of the standardized frailty tool in clinical practice should depend upon the relative need for efficiency versus objectivity of assessment within that clinical scenario. In patients with compensated cirrhosis, annual frailty assessment may be sufficient, whereas patients with decompensated cirrhosis may benefit from more frequent (every 3–6 months) assessment.

### Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure: part I. diagnosis and evaluation [^114Huvyo]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States, with the majority of preventable cases attributed to excessive alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis often is an indolent disease; most patients remain asymptomatic until the occurrence of decompensation, characterized by ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding from portal hypertension. Physical examination of patients with cirrhosis may reveal a variety of findings that necessitate a hepatic- or gastrointestinal-based work-up to determine the etiology. Some patients already may have had laboratory or radiographic tests that incidentally uncovered signs of cirrhosis and its comorbidities. No serologic or radiographic test can accurately diagnose cirrhosis. A significant correlation has been demonstrated between persistently elevated liver function tests and biopsy-proven underlying hepatic disease; thus, a more targeted serologic work-up is indicated in patients whose liver function test results are persistently abnormal. Unnecessary medications and surgical procedures should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis. Referral for liver biopsy should be considered only after a thorough, non-invasive serologic and radiographic evaluation has failed to confirm a diagnosis of cirrhosis; the benefit of biopsy outweighs the risk; and it is postulated that biopsy will have a favorable impact on the treatment of chronic liver disease.

### Treatment of pain in cirrhosis: advice to caregivers of those with rock livers [^113QTqJB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

When one considers the significant role of the liver in medication absorption and metabolism, clinicians must appreciate the important ramifications for medication dosing and monitoring in patients with cirrhosis. For many medications, dose adjustments may be necessary to minimize toxicities or avoid adverse effects from drug accumulation. Clinicians could be well served if they can understand in some detail how pharmacokinetic properties are altered in cirrhosis.

Methods

A PubMed search of the English medical literature starting with 1980 using keywords cirrhosis, pain management, and analgesics was performed, and additional papers were found using references from the first round of papers.

Findings

Patients with cirrhosis often have significant reductions in first-pass metabolism, altered volumes of distribution, and marked reductions in both renal and hepatic elimination of drugs. These factors may contribute to much higher levels of drug exposure compared to the general population. In terms of drug dosing, FDA labeling is often ambiguous and even incongruous with observed pharmacokinetic changes.

Implications

This article may provide guidance for clinicians to optimize pain management in people living with cirrhosis.

Key Message

Current FDA labeling for dosing analgesic drugs in patients with cirrhosis is either vague or not consistent with findings from newer pharmacokinetic research. With this review, we hope to provide insight and guidance to clinicians on how to dose-adjust medications commonly utilized in pain management in these patients.

### Advances and challenges in cirrhosis and portal hypertension [^111CAGzv]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Over the last decades, new knowledge on the pathophysiology, diagnostic methods, and therapy of cirrhosis and portal hypertension have significantly improved the management of this disease, with a marked reduction in mortality related to some of its complications, particularly variceal bleeding. However, in a recent analysis based on over 100,000 cases, 30-day mortality following discharge for any decompensation of cirrhosis was equal to or even higher than that observed 10 years prior, suggesting that the burden of mortality was merely shifted to the immediate postdischarge period. Among the major determinants of mortality are inflammation in acute-on-chronic liver failure (associated with different complications of end-stage liver disease) and HCC (not discussed in the present paper), both of which have been the subject of extensive research but remain unsatisfactorily resolved.

To achieve a substantial improvement in survival, every step of the management process of patients with ACLD should be addressed and optimized (Fig. 2). An early diagnosis of cirrhosis, i.e. within the compensated stage, and an accurate risk stratification are key to the following steps. Indeed, in the author's opinion, the use of resources at this initial step (e.g. initiation of HCC surveillance, endoscopic screening of varices needing treatment in patients at high risk, prevention of decompensation by appropriate non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapy) is largely justified by the expected survival benefits.

### The cardiohepatic axis in cirrhosis [^116jPkVV]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Unmet Needs and Future Directions

The lack of effective pharmacologic interventions and reliable biomarkers for early detection of cirrhosis-induced cardiac dysfunction can largely be explained by gaps in our current understanding of the distinct pathophysiology behind this disease. In addition, this entity diverges substantially from traditional forms of heart failure and, as described previously, conventional heart failure therapies have shown limited success. This highlights the need for further research tailored specifically to this population.

The latent nature and subsequent stressor-induced clinical manifestation of this condition suggests a maladaptive remodeling process that initially preserves function but later becomes unstable. Research aimed at optimizing cardiac energy metabolism, ATP generation, and substrate flexibility may offer novel therapeutics to enhance cardiac resilience in cirrhosis.

Additionally, emerging data highlight the central role of fibrogenesis in the development of this condition and may serve as a promising therapeutic target. Recent studies utilizing advanced cardiac and hepatic imaging have revealed that myocardial fibrosis closely mirrors liver fibrosis in cirrhosis, with strong correlations to systemic markers of collagen turnover and inflammation.

Furthermore, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis have been identified as key mediators of myocardial injury in cirrhosis, highlighting potential avenues for discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Studies have linked the development of cirrhosis-induced cardiac dysfunction with the activation of nuclear factor-κB and subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-1β, which up-regulate inducible nitric oxide synthase and subsequent nitric oxide release. As in the previous text, cirrhotic patients exhibit chronically elevated nitric oxide levels, and excess nitric oxide has been linked with promoting inotropic and chronotropic incompetence. Measuring serum biomarkers associated with these pathways may aid in early detection of cirrhosis-induced cardiac dysfunction by reflecting underlying inflammatory and oxidative activity, though more research is needed. Galectin-3, a β-galactoside-binding lectin, has emerged as a novel biomarker in this condition. Growing evidence suggests an association with Galectin-3 and the pathogenesis of both systolic and diastolic function. Further, serum levels of Galectin-3 have been found to be significantly increased in patients with cirrhosis. Functionally, Galectin-3 serves as a proinflammatory mediator, stimulating the production of TNF-α. Additionally, Galectin-3 has been shown to up-regulate the expression of fibrillar collagen, which as described in the previous text, is closely linked to diastolic dysfunction. Further research is needed in identifying biomarkers associated with cirrhosis-induced cardiac dysfunction, which offer diagnostic and/or prognostic value. With respect to therapeutic options, preclinical studies utilizing agents targeting these pathways, including antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic agents have shown promise and warrant further investigation.

### Patient information: what is cirrhosis? [^114MXFzg]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Cirrhosis occurs when scar tissue replaces normal liver tissue, causing permanent liver damage. Cirrhosis affects about 2. 2 million people in the US. The most common causes of cirrhosis in the US are alcohol use disorder, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and hepatitis C. However, because there are now medications that can cure hepatitis C infection, the current leading causes of newly diagnosed cirrhosis in the US are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol use disorder. Less common causes of cirrhosis include hepatitis B infection, diseases that cause buildup of iron or copper in the liver, diseases that cause bile duct destruction, α1 antitrypsin deficiency, and autoimmune hepatitis. Signs and Symptoms of Cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis frequently have no signs or symptoms for many years.

Physical signs of cirrhosis may include yellow-colored skin and eyes, dilated blood vessels on the face, male breast enlargement, distended blood vessels across the abdomen, atrophy of the testicles, red-colored palms, white-colored nails, and decreased body hair. Common symptoms of cirrhosis include muscle cramps, itching, poor sleep, and sexual dysfunction. Hepatorenal syndrome: kidney failure caused by cirrhosis Hepatocellular carcinoma: liver cancer, which affects 1% to 4% of patients with cirrhosis How Is Cirrhosis Diagnosed. Cirrhosis can be diagnosed by elastography, a noninvasive test that measures liver stiffness, or by biopsy of the liver. Some patients are first diagnosed when they develop a complication of cirrhosis, such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis C and hepatitis B infection should be treated with antiviral medications.

Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma with an abdominal ultrasound and blood testing for α-fetoprotein every 6 months can lead to early detection and increased cure rates if liver cancer is detected. Evaluation for liver transplant should be considered for patients with complications of cirrhosis. Walter KL. What Is Cirrhosis. JAMA. 2023; 330:

### Sleep-wake abnormalities in patients with cirrhosis [^115v5C8D]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

A considerable proportion of patients with cirrhosis exhibit insomnia, delayed sleep habits, and excessive daytime sleepiness. These have been variously attributed to hepatic encephalopathy and impaired hepatic melatonin metabolism, but the understanding of their pathophysiology remains limited and their treatment problematic. Sleep is regulated by the interaction of a homeostatic and a circadian process. The homeostatic process determines sleep propensity in relation to sleep-wake history, thus the need to sleep increases with the duration of the waking period. The circadian process, which is marked by the 24-hour rhythm of the hormone melatonin, is responsible for the alternation of high/low sleep propensity in relation to dark/light cues. Circadian sleep regulation has been studied in some depth in patients with cirrhosis, who show delays in the 24-hour melatonin rhythm, most likely in relation to reduced sensitivity to light cues. However, while melatonin abnormalities are associated with delayed sleep habits, they do not seem to offer a comprehensive explanation to the insomnia exhibited by these patients. Fewer data are available on homeostatic sleep control: it has been recently hypothesized that patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy might be unable, due to excessive daytime sleepiness, to accumulate the need/ability to produce restorative sleep. This review will describe in some detail the features of sleep-wake disturbances in patients with cirrhosis, their mutual relationships, and those, if any, with hepatic failure/hepatic encephalopathy. A separate section will cover the available information on their pathophysiology. Finally, etiological treatment will be briefly discussed.

### Liver cirrhosis in children-the role of imaging in the diagnostic pathway [^115KpChE]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cirrhosis is the common end point of chronic liver disease and a consequence of recurrent cellular damage with induction of diffuse fibrosis paralleled by nodular regeneration. With progression of cirrhosis, scar tissue replaces normal liver parenchyma, which results in loss of hepatic function and portal hypertension over time. The clinical presentation depends on the stage of disease and whether manifestations are compensated. Some children with cirrhosis attract clinical attention with mild symptoms such as hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, elevated liver function tests or jaundice. Others present acutely ill with liver failure and signs of decompensation including ascites, variceal bleeding, pulmonary hypertension and, in some cases, hepatic encephalopathy. Acute-on-chronic illnesses, especially, can result in rapid deterioration.

Despite a recently published population-based study from Canada that reported an increasing incidence of pediatric cirrhosis over the past two decades, liver cirrhosis in children is still rare. A low index of suspicion in the usual clinical setting together with a long silent clinical course in many children explains why the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis is often delayed and only made after progressive parenchymal changes have already manifested. Nevertheless, advanced fibrosis or even cirrhosis in children is still considered a dynamic process that can be slowed, stopped or reversed if the underlying disease is adequately treated.

Among the most frequent diseases potentially resulting in cirrhosis in neonates and young children are biliary atresia and certain inherited metabolic disorders. In older children and adolescents, the main underlying diagnoses are autoimmune disorders, chronic viral hepatitis, Wilson disease, alpha-1-deficiency, cardiac causes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Medical imaging techniques fulfill complex tasks in the management of patients with cirrhosis. At first presentation, imaging has a part in the initial diagnostic work-up, but the underlying diagnosis is often made based on clinical grounds incorporating laboratory findings, histopathology and genetic testing. Image-guided liver biopsy aids the diagnostic process with information on histology. Medical imaging methods have proven particularly useful for noninvasive evaluation of disease progression and identification of complications which directs treatment. Accordingly, imaging-based grading of fibrosis has been included in clinical guidelines and recommendations. Finally, imaging is an important part of evaluating patients for liver transplantation, representing the only curative treatment option for children and adolescents with end-stage liver disease.

### Albumin in decompensated cirrhosis: new concepts and perspectives [^116xRUQ9]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The concept of compensated and decompensated cirrhosis

Cirrhosis is characterised by a prolonged asymptomatic period of persistent liver inflammation, extracellular matrix remodelling and relentless deposition of collagen in the liver tissue. This fibrosis together with focal hyperplasia and proliferation of hepatocytes eventually disrupts the hepatic architecture leading to characteristic regenerative nodules. During this period, the disease remains undiagnosed unless patients seek medical attention for another reason or are screened for liver disease because of risk factors. Besides the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, complications develop when the disruption of the liver architecture is severe enough to markedly increase portal pressure. The most common clinical presentation is ascites/oedema or, less frequently, bleeding from gastro-oesophageal varices. Late complications include jaundice, coagulopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, bacterial infections and acute kidney injury, particularly hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Complications, after their first appearance, recur with increasing frequency and most patients die over a median period of about 2 years unless liver transplantation is performed. The disease stage preceding the occurrence of complications is known as compensated cirrhosis, as opposed to the decompensated stage during which patients develop complications. In addition to the array of complications related to portal hypertension, complexity of cirrhosis is amplified by the development of an acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). ACLF is a clinical syndrome characterised by rapid onset of failure of the liver and/or extrahepatic organs, including kidneys, systemic circulation or brain, within the context of an acute decompensation (AD) of the disease as defined by the development of ascites, encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding and/or bacterial infection. ACLF often occurs in patients with prior history of decompensated cirrhosis but also develops without of previous decompensation. It is associated with high short-term (1 month) mortality rate, being the most frequent cause of death of cirrhosis.

Often, the first approach to symptom management may be nonpharmacological, such as behavioral intervention, physical therapy, or other modalities that address multiple symptoms. Underlying causes of symptoms should be identified and managed first. Symptom management should consider best practices, disease stage, and patient goals and preferences, and evaluation and management of symptoms should be interdisciplinary, when possible, including nursing, social work, and chaplaincy.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^114Hq3D6]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic pain in cirrhosis is common, poorly characterized, and uniquely morbid. Reported by 40%–79% of patients with cirrhosis, it is a key driver of poor functional status and quality of life.–Patients with cirrhosis and chronic pain also have significantly greater health care use. Pain management in cirrhosis can be complex because of challenges in diagnosis and medical management. Unfortunately, there is limited guidance outlining optimal pain therapies in this population. Recent guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease for palliative care and symptom management in decompensated cirrhosis recommend consulting experts in palliative care, psychiatry, and physical therapy, but pain is common across the spectrum of disease severity, and access to these supportive services can be difficult in many settings. Furthermore, pain phenotypes, each requiring specific treatments, have been poorly characterized in cirrhosis. Thus, proper evaluation and diagnosis are crucial to minimize unnecessary pharmacotherapy and maximize clinical and patient reported outcomes in patients with cirrhosis. Herein, we will define chronic pain mechanistically and discuss the identification, etiology, and treatment options for each type of pain with a focus on unique challenges in patients with cirrhosis.

### Management of sepsis in patients with cirrhosis: current evidence and practical approach [^113gYvsW]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sepsis in patients with cirrhosis is associated with high mortality. An impaired immune response accounts for the increased infection risk observed in these patients. Hemodynamic and systemic changes suggestive of sepsis may be observed in patients with cirrhosis in the absence of infection; therefore, diagnosis and treatment of sepsis may be delayed. The optimal management of the critically ill patient with sepsis and cirrhosis has not been well established and is generally extrapolated from consensus guidelines and expert recommendations made for management of patients without cirrhosis with sepsis. Despite the lack of strong evidence, we propose a contemporary pragmatic approach to sepsis management in patients with cirrhosis, including the choice of fluids, vasopressors, and antibiotics.

Compensated versus decompensated cirrhosis: the burden of advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD)

According to the largest study available thus far, cirrhosis represents the fourth cause of death due to non-communicable diseases worldwide, with the total number of deaths from cirrhosis and liver cancer having steadily risen by approximately 50 million per year over the last two decades. This large mortality rate is due, to some extent, to a late diagnosis. A decades-long asymptomatic stage during which no overt sign of the disease is noticed is characteristic of CLD. Indeed, even after the onset of cirrhosis, the disease can remain asymptomatic, or 'compensated', for a long time. Nevertheless, during this time, portal hypertension progressively develops, usually accompanied by a decline in hepatocellular function.

Portal hypertension is the major driver in the transition from the compensated to the 'decompensated' stage of cirrhosis, defined by the presence of clinical complications, including ascites, bleeding from gastroesophageal varices, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. Further decompensating episodes are often triggered by bacterial infections, and are associated with a very high mortality risk. From a prognostic point of view, compensated and decompensated cirrhosis are dramatically different, and can be considered as two separate diseases. Furthermore, within these two major stages, several sub-stages with varying risk of further decompensation and death can be identified (Fig. 1). Knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms driving the transition within these stages is key in the current management of cirrhosis. Besides its negative impact on life expectancy, cirrhosis implies several other burdens, including a marked increase in healthcare costs due to hospitalization and treatment (estimated at approximately $2.5 billion per year in the US), loss of productivity (estimated at $10.6 billion per year in the US), and a marked reduction in quality of life. These burdens are almost exclusively caused by complications during the decompensated stage.

### Translating an understanding of the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis to novel therapies [^112by3m1]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

The response to injury is one of wound healing and fibrogenesis, which ultimately leads to fibrosis. The fibrogenic response to injury is a generalized one across virtually all organ systems. In the liver, the injury response, typically occurring over a prolonged period of time, leads to cirrhosis (although it should be pointed out that not all patients with liver injury develop cirrhosis). The fact that many different diseases result in cirrhosis suggests a common pathogenesis. The study of hepatic fibrogenesis over the past 2 decades has been remarkably active, leading to a considerable understanding of this process. It clearly has been shown that the hepatic stellate cell is a central component in the fibrogenic process. It also has been recognized that other effector cells are important in the fibrogenic process, including resident fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived cells, fibrocytes, and even perhaps cells derived from epithelial cells (ie, through epithelial to mesenchymal transition). A key aspect of the biology of fibrogenesis is that the fibrogenic process is dynamic; thus, even advanced fibrosis (or cirrhosis) is reversible. Together, an understanding of the cellular basis for liver fibrogenesis, along with multiple aspects of the basic pathogenesis of fibrosis, have highlighted many exciting potential therapeutic opportunities. Thus, although the most effective antifibrotic therapy is simply treatment of the underlying disease, in situations in which this is not possible, specific antifibrotic therapy is likely not only to become feasible, but will soon become a reality. This review highlights the mechanisms underlying fibrogenesis that may be translated into future antifibrotic therapies and to review the current state of clinical development.

Introduction

The prevalence of cirrhosis continues to rise, and cirrhosis is increasingly diagnosed at an earlier stage. As a result, potentially challenging clinical scenarios, such as surgery, pregnancy, invasive procedures, anticoagulation and travel in patients with cirrhosis, are encountered more frequently in practice.

Factors that contribute to frailty and sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis are described and categorized for ease of clinical implementation as malnutrition, cirrhosis-related, other systems-related, physical inactivity, and environmental/organizational factors. Cirrhosis-related and other systems-related factors, along with physical inactivity and environmental/organizational factors, contribute to malnutrition which then leads to frailty and sarcopenia; these factors can also contribute directly to frailty and sarcopenia independently of malnutrition and can contribute to frailty or sarcopenia within or independent of the malnutrition pathway. Frailty and sarcopenia can contribute to each other through impaired muscle contractile function that can accelerate loss of muscle mass. These clinical phenotypes ultimately lead to adverse health outcomes including hepatic decompensation, increased health care use, worse health-related quality of life, adverse posttransplant outcomes, and increased overall risk of death.

### Clinical implications of inflammation in patients with cirrhosis [^113cwoQW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction refers to the concurrent systemic inflammation and immunoparesis evident across the disease spectrum of chronic liver disease, ranging from the low-grade inflammatory plasma milieu that accompanies compensated disease to the intense high-grade inflammatory state with coexistent severe immune paralysis that defines acute decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure. Systemic inflammation plays a crucial role in the disease course of cirrhosis and is a key driver for acute decompensation and the progression from compensated to decompensated cirrhosis. Severe systemic inflammation is fundamental to the development of organ dysfunction and failure and, in its most extreme form, acute-on-chronic liver failure. Systemic inflammation propagates the development of hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury. It may also be involved in the pathogenesis of further complications such as hepatocellular carcinoma and mental illness. Those patients with the most profound systemic inflammation have the worst prognosis. Systemic inflammation exerts its negative clinical effects through a number of mechanisms including nitric oxide-mediated increased splanchnic vasodilation, immunopathology, and metabolic reallocation.

Cirrhosis-related pathways to frailty and sarcopenia include an altered catabolic state that imbalances energy needs and intake, reduced circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) with accelerated muscle breakdown, and ammonia-mediated myotoxicity. Cirrhosis itself leads to frailty and sarcopenia; altered protein metabolism of BCAAs that are essential for supporting glutamine synthesis and extrahepatic ammonia detoxification results in reduced levels of circulating BCAAs and accelerated muscle breakdown; impaired hepatic ammonia clearance plus increased portosystemic shunting increases systemic ammonia with pathologic muscle effects; and ammonia is myotoxic via decreased protein synthesis, increased autophagy, proteolysis, and mitochondrial oxidative dysfunction in skeletal muscle.

American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2021 practice guidance — clinical and research assessment of frailty and sarcopenia in cirrhosis states that in clinical settings, we recommend systematic assessment of frailty and/or sarcopenia in all patients with cirrhosis using a standardized instrument, and given the ease, low cost, and repeatability of frailty metrics, we recommend routine assessment of frailty using a standardized tool (Table 2) — in all ambulatory patients with cirrhosis. Frailty testing may be particularly useful in the ambulatory setting and when intermediate-term and long-term longitudinal assessments are needed to assess natural progression or response to treatment, whereas sarcopenia testing may be particularly useful for patients in whom administration of tests of frailty is not feasible or is impractical (e.g., because of acute severe illness or inability to participate in testing such as in very young children). In research studies of patients with cirrhosis evaluating interventions related to malnutrition and/or muscle dysfunction, we recommend assessment of both frailty and sarcopenia, when possible, to more comprehensively capture the impact of interventions on these complementary endpoints.

### Novel perspectives in the management of decompensated cirrhosis [^114YNAkD]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

The current approaches to the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis are based on targeted strategies aimed at preventing or treating specific complications of the disease. The improved knowledge of the pathophysiological background of advanced cirrhosis, represented by a sustained systemic inflammation strictly linked to a circulatory dysfunction, provides a novel paradigm for the management of these patients, with the ambitious target of modifying the course of the disease by preventing the onset of complications and multiorgan failure; these interventions will eventually improve patients' quality of life, prolong survival and reduce health-care costs. Besides aetiological treatments, these goals could be achieved by persistently antagonizing key pathophysiological events, such as portal hypertension, abnormal bacterial translocation from the gut, liver damage, systemic inflammation, circulatory dysfunction and altered immunological responses. Interestingly, in addition to strategies based on new therapeutic agents, these targets can be tackled by employing drugs that are already used in patients with cirrhosis for different indications or in other clinical settings, including non-absorbable oral antibiotics, non-selective β-blockers, human albumin and statins. The scope of the present Review includes reporting updated information on the treatments that promise to influence the course of advanced cirrhosis and thus act as disease-modifying agents.

### Drug treatments to prevent first decompensation in cirrhosis [^115doYWW]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cirrhosis is a prevalent condition affecting more than 100 million people globally and carrying significant morbidity and mortality related to the development of portal hypertension and hepatic decompensation. Current treatment is primarily targeted at identifying chronic liver disease early and preventing the progression of fibrosis by treating the underlying etiology of liver disease. Treatment options for patients with advanced fibrosis are limited, and the only drug class approved for the prevention of hepatic decompensation remains nonselective beta-blockers. There are several pharmacological therapies being developed in both preclinical and clinical trials to explore their efficacy in preventing first hepatic decompensation. Most studies evaluate primary endpoints reflective of disease severity and portal hypertension, such as changes in HVPG or fibrosis stage based on histology or imaging. While many drugs are being investigated, much work is still needed to identify treatment targets with effective outcomes to move the needle in the field of cirrhosis management. This narrative review will address the current state of cirrhosis therapies, including potential new therapeutic targets, and provide direction on future advancements that will improve our current treatment paradigm and lead to better outcomes for those burdened with cirrhosis.

### Cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction [^116z88x2]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

The term cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction (CAID) comprises the distinctive spectrum of immune alterations associated with the course of end-stage liver disease. Systemic inflammation and immune deficiency are the key components of CAID. Their severity is highly dynamic and progressive, paralleling cirrhosis stage. CAID involves two different immune phenotypes: the low-grade systemic inflammatory phenotype and the high-grade systemic inflammatory phenotype. The low-grade systemic inflammatory phenotype can be found in patients with compensated disease or clinical decompensation with no organ failure. In this phenotype, there is an exaggerated immune activation but the effector response is not markedly compromised. The high-grade systemic inflammatory phenotype is present in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, a clinical situation characterized by decompensation, organ failure and high short-term mortality. Along with high-grade inflammation, this CAID phenotype includes intense immune paralysis that critically increases the risk of infections and worsens prognosis. The intensity of CAID has important consequences on cirrhosis progression and correlates with the severity of liver insufficiency, bacterial translocation and organ failure. Therapies targeting the modulation of the dysfunctional immune response are currently being evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of biomarkers predicting decompensation in patients with compensated cirrhosis [^117MhE2L]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Given that decompensation heralds a pivotal change in the disease trajectory of cirrhosis, there is an urgent unmet need to discover biomarkers that can predict its occurrence, in order to help prevent its onset. The ideal biomarker should demonstrate biological plausibility, high sensitivity and specificity, generalisability, undergo validation, be minimally invasive as well as easy to measure, demonstrate stability, and crucially, for healthcare services be affordable. When performing biomarker research, it is imperative to use appropriate terminology, and while addressing prediction of decompensation, one is actually referring to prognostic biomarkers which identify the likelihood of a clinical event or disease progression.

While liver disease scoring systems have been developed over time, such as the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CP) Score and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), they have generally focused on predicting mortality as opposed to decompensation, and often underperform in contexts other than those in which they were initially developed. While a range of other prognostic biomarkers have emerged over recent years, few have been incorporated into clinical practice. This is likely due to a lack of clarity over which biomarkers are truly superior, whether they actually outperform existing scores and the high heterogenicity in published studies.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to identify which biomarkers have the strongest evidence for determining future decompensation in compensated cirrhosis, to help guide future research and highlight potential therapeutic targets.

### Interaction of inflammation and portal hypertension in cirrhosis progression [^113r4umh]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Decompensated cirrhosis describes an advanced clinical stage with clinical complications, such as ascites, variceal bleeding or hepatic encephalopathy, associated with considerable mortality. Portal hypertension is the main risk factor for developing decompensation in patients with compensated cirrhosis, whereas systemic inflammation is the key driving force for organ failure, that is, for acute-on-chronic liver failure in later stages of cirrhosis. As portal hypertension and systemic inflammation coexist in patients with cirrhosis, an improved understanding of their interaction and dynamic role in distinct stages of cirrhosis is an important step forward towards the development of urgently needed therapeutic interventions. Based on emerging evidence from clinical and translational studies, a novel concept of different predominant pathomechanisms of decompensated cirrhosis is presented, which includes portal hypertension-predominant, systemic inflammmation-predominant and mixed portal hypertension-systemic inflammation phenotypes. A comprehensive set of biomarkers and surrogates of portal hypertension and systemic inflammation might assist clinicians in identifying a predominance of one over the other cirrhosis phenotype. As survival rates of patients with decompensated cirrhosis have remained detrimental without liver transplantation over the past decades, future studies should build on this knowledge to develop effective portal hypertension and systemic inflammation-directed therapies for this underserved population.

### Periodontal disease and cirrhosis: current concepts and future prospects [^1114U3zn]. Egastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The benefit of referral for treatment of periodontal disease and its impact on progressive liver disease

Based on our review, evidence links periodontitis to liver disease, but it is crucial to translate this into practical outcomes for everyday practice. Our analysis of current data reveals indications that treating periodontitis could be advantageous. Two recent research studies have highlighted a mortality advantage associated with periodontal disease treatment in patients with cirrhosis. It is imperative to replicate these studies using larger cohorts comprising patients with liver disease and cirrhosis to further validate these findings. Additionally, in a recent small trial, periodontal disease-directed therapy improved endotoxemia, inflammation and microbial dysbiosis in patients with cirrhosis. There was also an associated improvement in quality of life and cognition in those with prior hepatic encephalopathy. These studies highlight the potential positive impact of treating underlying periodontal disease in patients with liver disease.

Principles of the management of periodontal disease: current standard of care

There are no globally implemented guidelines for the treatment of periodontal disease in patients with chronic liver disease. Approaches to therapy in this population should generally follow current treatment guidelines.

Given the associations between periodontal disease and liver disease, it is recommended that all patients with liver disease adhere to routine oral care schedules with dental practitioners. During dental assessment, all patients should undergo a basic periodontal examination, including assessing gingival topography, probing pocket depth, recession and attachment level. This examination also includes an assessment of the subgingival area's health, measuring parameters such as bleeding on probing, suppuration and clinical furcation status, while also detecting endodontic-periodontal lesions. Additionally, a routine dental examination is also recommended to assess caries, contact relationships, the condition of dental restorations and prosthetic appliances, as well as any additional tooth- or implant-related concerns.

Within this framework, "Primary prevention" refers to routine screening to identify patients with sarcopenia or frailty, "Secondary prevention" refers to the initiation of therapy in patients diagnosed with sarcopenia or frailty, and "Tertiary prevention" refers to the intensification of therapy in patients with sarcopenia or frailty not responding to first-line therapy, with the ultimate goal to prevent the occurrence of adverse health outcomes attributable to malnutrition, frailty, and sarcopenia.

### The burden of minimal hepatic encephalopathy: from diagnosis to therapeutic strategies [^116ErXuK]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Definition and epidemiology

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complex neurological syndrome, typical of liver cirrhosis, which produces a wide and complex spectrum of nonspecific neurological and psychiatric manifestations. In its mild expression, i.e. minimal HE (MHE), this condition alters the performance of psychometric tests, working memory, psychomotor speed, and visuospatial ability, as well as electrophysiological and other functional brain measures, without, however, any evidence of clinical manifestations. MHE is a frequent complication of liver disease and is considered as one of its most debilitating manifestations, severely affecting the life of patients and caregivers. Furthermore, cognitive impairment associated with cirrhosis results in the use of more healthcare resources in adults in comparison with other manifestations of liver disease.

Depending on the population studied and the diagnostic tool used, MHE occurs in 20–80% of patients with cirrhosis, MHE is considered as a preclinical stage of HE and is part of a wide spectrum of typical neurocognitive alterations in liver cirrhosis, particularly involving the areas of attention, alertness, response inhibition, and executive functions. Although these typical characteristics of MHE reduce the safety and quality of life (QoL) of patients with cirrhosis, together with their caregivers, they are difficult to detect from the clinical point of view. Moreover, cirrhotic patients with sleep disorders also show deficits in executive functions and in specific activities such as driving, which are dangerous for themselves and for others. As low-grade HE is difficult to diagnose (grade I), a recent classification, introducing the term "covert", has been established that combines MHE and Grade I HE. The aim is to simplify the clinical pattern thereby easily and uniformly diagnosing the presence of clinically overt HE (OHE), as reported in Fig. 1. The term "covert" has been debated since the condition is not really unapparent (latent, subclinical, minimal), but is simply not overt, obvious and severe or clinically unquestionable. The operative characteristics of MHE and covert HE (CHE) are reported in Table 1.

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 1: compensated cirrhosis [^116RrfDX]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Liver disease and liver cancer together caused 2.5% of deaths in England in 2018. Over half of these deaths occur in those of working age. Liver-related deaths have increased by over 400% since 1970, and the number of hospital admissions for liver disease has increased by half over the last decade. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, premature mortality from all major causes of liver disease increased further in 2020, with mortality highest in the most deprived areas. Good outpatient management is crucial in preventing hospital admissions and keeping people living with cirrhosis well.

Cirrhosis is defined by widespread disruption of normal liver structure by fibrosis, caused by chronic progressive conditions affecting the liver; most commonly alcohol-related steatotic liver disease (ALD), followed by metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) (previously termed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)). The diagnosis is generally made based on one, or a combination, of clinical findings, imaging, endoscopy, non-invasive tests (such as enhanced liver fibrosis test or transient elastography (TE)) and/or histology.

An asymptomatic compensated phase is followed, in the presence of ongoing liver damage, by a decompensated phase, marked by the development of overt clinical signs, most frequently ascites, bleeding, encephalopathy and jaundice. The Baveno group have developed a six-stage model of cirrhosis, reflecting the degree of portal hypertension (see figure 1). Mortality in the compensated phase (stages 0–2), a median of 10-year duration, is 1%, compared with 40%, 65% and 80% at 1, 2 and 5 years, respectively, for those progressing to decompensated cirrhosis. The Child-Pugh class (A–C)is referred to in parts of this guidance. While initially developed to estimate postoperative mortality, Child-Pugh score (5–15) and associated class are widely used to describe the severity of liver disease and are associated with prognosis. Child-Pugh class A and Child-Pugh class C indicate compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, respectively. Patients with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis may have compensated or decompensated disease. More recently developed scores such as the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD)and UK Model for End Stage Liver Disease (UKELD)provide better prognostic value and so are used to predict mortality following a range of interventions in patients with cirrhosis, as well as eligibility for liver transplant (see part 2).

Pathophysiology

Chronic hepatocyte injury is characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and ultimately cirrhosis. Cirrhosis thus results from distortion of hepatic architecture and increased resistance to portal venous flow secondary to progressive fibrotic replacement of hepatocytes. Portal hypertension and loss of metabolic functions are the main factors that determine the clinical manifestations of cirrhosis.

The most important clinical manifestations of portal hypertension are varices and ascites. An increased pressure gradient from the post-hepatic venous system opens collateral portosystemic shunts in the esophagogastric and anorectal regions, umbilical vein, and retroperitoneum. As this process advances, visceral congestion increases, ascites accumulates, varices enlarge, and portal venous flow decelerates, or even reverses. Diminished delivery of hepatotrophic factors further impairs hepatic function via ongoing hepatocyte loss.

In surgical patient, hepatic dysfunction translates into an increased risk of infection, hemorrhage, thrombosis, and a prolonged half-life of numerous drugs (e.g. opioids and benzodiazepines). The associated imbalance of neuroendocrine mediators (e.g. vasopressin, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and nitric oxide) also potentiates sodium and fluid retention, resulting in a background hyperdynamic circulation with splanchnic venous congestion and systemic vasodilation.

In emergency surgery, stress response to the underlying condition, anesthesia, and surgical trauma increase the risk of hepatic decompensation and associated multi-system failure. Changes in hepatic perfusion with shock and fluid shifts further compromise hepatocellular synthetic and excretory functions. In addition, endotoxemia from gram-negative sepsis potentiates platelet aggregation and creates a state of low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Renal system

Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with hypersecretion of vasopressin acts as compensatory mechanisms to preserve arterial pressure and replenish effective circulating volume when blood is pooled in the splanchnic territory. With the progression of cirrhosis, avidity for water and sodium increases, and dilutional hyponatremia results from water retention. In advanced cases, exacerbation of these abnormalities leads to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). HRS is characterized by rapid decline in renal function with low urinary excretion of sodium due to severe renal vasoconstriction and diminished or absent cortical perfusion. This syndrome is potentially reversible, but carries an extremely poor prognosis.

Strong recommendations are offered when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects. Conditional recommendations are offered when trade-offs are less certain — either because of low-quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced. Quality of evidence levels are defined as High: We are very confident that the true effect closely aligns with that of the estimate of the effect; Moderate: We have a moderate level of confidence in the estimate of effect. It is likely that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect; Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect may be different from the estimate of effect; and Very Low: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

### Non-invasive markers for hepatic fibrosis [^1114v4R5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Review

Liver fibrosis is defined as the building up of excessive amount of extracellular matrix, also known as scar tissue, in the liver parenchyma. While reviewing fibrosis as a component of the pathogenesis of a disease, it is important to remember that the process of fibrogenesis is also a component of the normal healing response to various kinds of injury. In the liver, this healing process normally involves the recruitment of immune and/or inflammatory cells to the site of injury, secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, reorganization of the ECM and possible regeneration of the hepatic tissue. When the damage to the liver is chronic, excess fibrous connective tissue accumulates. In time, this process eventually distorts the normal parenchymal structure of the liver and impairs its function. As chronic liver disease progresses, hepatic fibrosis is accompanied by the formation of septae and nodules that intervene with the portal blood flow, leading to hypertension and formation of distinctive cirrhotic architecture. At all stages of the fibrogenesis, the stress exerted on the liver parenchyma is exemplified by subsequent activation of the immune system accompanied by increased levels of certain cytokines and growth factors, which augment fibrogenesis. In proinflammatory fibrotic microenvironment, constant stimulation of hepatocellular regeneration could predispose to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However disruptive, hepatic fibrosis even early cirrhosis can be reversed by suppression of the fibrotic response.

Injury and wounding in the liver ultimately lead to cirrhosis in many patients (although not all patients), and are the result of many different diseases. The fact that various diseases result in cirrhosis suggests a common pathogenesis. Study over the past 2 decades has shed considerable light on the pathogenesis of fibrosis and cirrhosis. A growing body of literature indicates that the hepatic stellate cell is a central component in the fibrogenic process. Stellate cells undergo a transformation during injury that has been termed activation. Activation is complex and multifaceted, but one of its most prominent features is the synthesis of large amounts of extracellular matrix, resulting in deposition of scar or fibrous tissue. The fibrogenic process is dynamic; it is noteworthy that even advanced fibrosis (or cirrhosis) is reversible. The best antifibrotic therapy is treatment of the underlying disease. For example, eradication of hepatitis B or C virus can lead to the reversal of fibrosis. In situations in which treating the underlying process is not possible, specific antifibrotic therapy is desirable. A number of specific antifibrotic therapies have been tried, but have been met with poor or mediocre success. However, elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for fibrogenesis, with particular emphasis on stellate cell biology, has highlighted many putative novel therapies. This article emphasizes mechanisms underlying fibrogenesis, and reviews current antifibrotic therapies as well as potential future approaches.

### A practical approach to the diagnosis and management of hepatic encephalopathy [^1166ngzT]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A Practical Approach to the Diagnosis and Management of Hepatic Encephalopathy] Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of decompensated cirrhosis that can be reversed with treatment. Frequent episodes of recurrence are common, impacting patients, caregivers and healthcare systems, increasing morbidity and mortality statistics and resulting in grave financial consequences. Uptake and adherence to formal recommendations for HE diagnosis and management are low. There is an unmet need to advocate for the use of these recommendations in a more pragmatic form. Clinicians from multiple disciplines, dedicated to raising liver disease awareness, convened in a roundtable format to review and discuss the latest HE guidelines and relevant peer-reviewed literature on HE. The result was this clinical care publication on the screening, diagnosis and management of HE which seeks to facilitate clinicians' recognition and diagnosis of HE, apply a pathway of care for HE that addresses steps for initial management, long-term maintenance and prevention; it also addresses practical recommendations concerning situations encountered in HE. Resources are provided to address the different needs of the three key players in HE: patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals.

### Diabetes and cirrhosis: current concepts on diagnosis and management [^112pK49C]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is often associated with cirrhosis as comorbidities, acute illness, medications, and other conditions profoundly alter glucose metabolism. Both conditions are closely related in NAFLD, the leading cause of chronic liver disease, and given its rising burden worldwide, management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in cirrhosis will be an increasingly common dilemma. Having diabetes increases cirrhosis-related complications, including HCC as well as overall mortality. In the absence of effective treatments for cirrhosis, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus should be systematically screened as early as possible for NAFLD-related fibrosis/cirrhosis using noninvasive tools, starting with a FIB-4 index followed by transient elastography, if available. In people with cirrhosis, an early diagnosis of diabetes is critical for an optimal management strategy (ie, nutritional goals, and glycemic targets). Diagnosis of diabetes may be missed if based on A1C in patients with cirrhosis and impaired liver function (Child-Pugh B-C) as anemia may turn the test unreliable. Clinicians must also become aware of their high risk of hypoglycemia, especially in decompensated cirrhosis where insulin is the only therapy. Care should be within multidisciplinary teams (nutritionists, obesity management teams, endocrinologists, hepatologists, and others) and take advantage of novel glucose-monitoring devices. Clinicians should become familiar with the safety and efficacy of diabetes medications for patients with advanced fibrosis and compensated cirrhosis. Management is conditioned by whether the patient has either compensated or decompensated cirrhosis. This review gives an update on the complex relationship between cirrhosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus, with a focus on its diagnosis and treatment, and highlights knowledge gaps and future directions.

### Malnutrition, frailty, and sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^117YKRsi]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Cirrhosis-related interventions — disease-specific measures state that "when possible, the cause of underlying chronic liver disease should be addressed". "Eradication of chronic HCV is associated with a reduction in systemic inflammation, although levels of inflammatory biomarkers among individuals with advanced fibrosis remained elevated above levels measured in individuals who are not infected with HCV".

Background

Hepatic drug clearance is a complex process that is dependent on hepatic blood flow, intrinsic hepatic clearance and fraction of unbound drugs in blood. Within the liver, phase I and II metabolism are responsible for the processing of different medications. Furthermore, biliary excretion is an important means for drug elimination. In cirrhosis, many of these processes may be affected which, in turn, will impact the overall metabolism and clearance of medications. In addition, the presence of portal systemic shunting, concurrent renal impairment and hepatic toxicity of certain medications could alter their effectiveness and adverse effects. Therefore, in patients with cirrhosis, assessment of liver function and portal-systemic shunt would be ideal to properly adjust drug doses. However, due to the complexity of hepatic drug elimination, it is difficult to develop a universal method of dose adjustment.

Child–Pugh classification has been used to assess prognosis of chronic liver disease, primarily in cirrhosis. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommend to characterize the pharmacokinetics of medications that undergo extensive hepatic metabolism or with narrow therapeutic index during drug development. The Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is used to predict survival in cirrhosis and reflects the severity of liver and kidney dysfunction. Despite their roles in liver function evaluation, both scoring systems may not accurately reflect the liver's ability to metabolize medications. Furthermore, it remains unclear if the application of these methods to adjust medication doses would have an impact on efficacy and safety outcomes of various hepatically metabolized medications.

Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins have demonstrated significant benefits on cardiovascular (CV) mortality and morbidity in the general population. Recently, more attention has been focused on statins' potential hepatic benefits and their use in patients with cirrhosis, with an increasing number of studies showing improvement in portal hypertension and clinical outcomes. These have been extensively summarized in recent systematic reviews. Nonetheless, currently the only indication of statins in cirrhosis remains cardiovascular disease prevention.
