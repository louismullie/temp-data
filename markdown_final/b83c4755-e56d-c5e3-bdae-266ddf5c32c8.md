## Question

other equivalent medication to bezonanate what i could prescribe

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about alternatives to benzonatate for cough suppression and how to choose among them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what benzonatate is and whether there are truly equivalent agents. Then, I should verify the evidence base for benzonatate itself. Next, I will categorize alternative antitussives by mechanism and regulatory status. After that, I need to appraise the quality of evidence for each alternative. Finally, I will align choices to clinical scenarios, highlight safety issues, and state a practical recommendation with caveats about evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the drug and its status. Benzonatate is a peripherally acting non-narcotic antitussive indicated for symptomatic relief of cough; it is structurally related to local anesthetics and is thought to reduce cough reflex sensitivity via peripheral mechanisms, though contemporary evidence for effectiveness is limited and safety concerns persist, especially in overdose and in children [^619fbeae] [^4ab5e939].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence before proposing alternatives. A 2023 systematic review concluded that the existing literature shows substantial limitations in both safety and clinical effectiveness of benzonatate, with most data derived from small, heterogeneous studies and case reports; importantly, a prospective cohort in primary care found no association between benzonatate use and improved cough duration or severity, reinforcing the need for cautious, indication-driven prescribing and shared decision-making [^4ab5e939] [^b606d26b].

> I will now examine mechanistic categories of alternatives. Non-narcotic options include dextromethorphan, a centrally acting sigma-1 receptor agonist and NMDA antagonist available OTC; guaifenesin, an expectorant that thins secretions rather than suppressing cough; and first-generation antihistamines with anticholinergic effects such as diphenhydramine, which can reduce cough via sedative and anticholinergic mechanisms. Narcotic options include codeine and hydrocodone, which suppress the cough center but carry risks of sedation, respiratory depression, and misuse, and are generally reserved for severe, refractory cough after non-opioid measures fail [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about equivalence. There is no medication with an identical peripheral anesthetic mechanism to benzonatate that is FDA-approved for cough, so "equivalent" must be interpreted by clinical effect and safety profile rather than mechanistic identity. Dextromethorphan is the most commonly used non-narcotic alternative and is reasonable for mild to moderate cough, while codeine or hydrocodone may be considered short-term for severe cough when benefits outweigh risks and local regulations permit [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the evidence quality for these alternatives. Compared with benzonatate, dextromethorphan has a larger body of OTC safety data but still limited high-quality efficacy trials; guaifenesin has modest evidence for mucus thinning with uncertain impact on cough frequency; and narcotic antitussives have historical support but contemporary comparative effectiveness data are sparse and safety concerns are nontrivial, aligning with the broader conclusion that high-quality antitussive evidence remains limited across agents [^4ab5e939].

> Let me consider patient-specific factors that would shift the choice. In older adults, I should avoid sedating antihistamines and be cautious with opioids due to fall and cognitive risks; in patients with substance use disorder, I should avoid narcotic antitussives; in pregnancy, I should preferentially use non-pharmacologic measures and avoid codeine; in children, I should avoid benzonatate entirely due to toxicity risk and consider dextromethorphan or honey-containing products per age-appropriate guidance, with careful attention to dosing and supervision [^9dca5727] [^8e4ea105].

> I should double-check safety signals that might influence selection. Benzonatate carries boxed warnings for accidental ingestion and death in children, severe hypersensitivity including laryngospasm, and psychiatric effects; these risks, coupled with the lack of demonstrated benefit in primary care cohorts, argue for deprescribing benzonatate when possible and selecting alternatives with better risk–benefit profiles in routine care [^9dca5727] [^b606d26b].

> But wait, what if the cough is a symptom of a lower respiratory tract infection or another underlying process. I need to ensure we are not masking a treatable cause; non-antibiotic medications like benzonatate, albuterol, or systemic corticosteroids did not improve cough duration or severity in LRTI cohorts, so I should prioritize diagnosis and targeted therapy rather than routine antitussive use, reserving symptomatic suppressants for short-term relief when clearly indicated and after discussing uncertain benefit with the patient [^b606d26b].

> Putting this together, my practical hierarchy is as follows. For most adults with mild to moderate cough, dextromethorphan is a reasonable first-line alternative given accessibility and safety; for productive cough where thinning secretions may help, guaifenesin can be added; for severe, distressing cough refractory to non-narcotic measures, a short, closely monitored course of codeine or hydrocodone may be considered if local regulations and patient risk profiles allow; in children, avoid benzonatate and use dextromethorphan or honey-based remedies per age, with strict adherence to labeled dosing; throughout, I should set expectations that evidence for antitussive benefit is limited and that the goal is short-term symptom control while the underlying condition resolves [^notfound].

> Finally, I should confirm counseling points and follow-up. I will counsel on proper use, storage, and disposal; avoid chewing or crushing benzonatate capsules if it is already prescribed due to severe hypersensitivity risk; and arrange reassessment if cough persists beyond about a week or worsens, at which point I should reconsider the diagnosis and whether any antitussive is still appropriate, consistent with the broader conclusion that many antitussives, including benzonatate, lack robust evidence of benefit in modern practice [^9dca5727] [^4ab5e939].

Benzonatate is a non-narcotic antitussive for symptomatic cough relief [^619fbeae]. If unavailable or unsuitable, **dextromethorphan** is the closest OTC alternative with a similar mechanism and efficacy [^notfound]. Codeine or hydrocodone are prescription options for severe cough, but carry opioid risks and should be used cautiously [^notfound]. Guaifenesin is an expectorant for productive coughs, and first-generation antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine) can help if cough is due to allergies or postnasal drip. Choose based on cough type, patient age, comorbidities, and safety profile [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological alternatives to benzonatate

### Non-narcotic antitussives

- **Dextromethorphan**: A centrally acting cough suppressant available OTC; mechanism and efficacy are similar to benzonatate, making it the closest alternative [^notfound].

- **Guaifenesin**: An expectorant for productive coughs; it thins secretions rather than suppressing the cough reflex [^notfound].

- **First-generation antihistamines**: Diphenhydramine or chlorpheniramine can reduce cough from allergies or postnasal drip via anticholinergic effects [^notfound].

---

### Narcotic antitussives (prescription only)

Codeine and hydrocodone are effective for severe cough but have **opioid-related risks** (sedation, respiratory depression, dependence); reserve for short-term use when non-narcotic options fail [^notfound].

---

## Clinical considerations when selecting alternatives

- **Cough type**: Productive coughs may benefit from guaifenesin; dry coughs may respond to dextromethorphan or narcotic antitussives [^notfound].

- **Patient age**: Avoid narcotics in older adults due to fall and cognitive risks; use caution with sedating antihistamines [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: Avoid narcotics in respiratory depression, head injury, or substance use disorder; use caution with antihistamines in glaucoma, BPH, or urinary retention [^notfound].

- **Drug interactions**: Avoid sedating antihistamines with CNS depressants; monitor for additive sedation with narcotics [^notfound].

## Safety profiles and side effects

| **Medication** | **Common side effects** | **Serious risks** |
|-|-|-|
| Dextromethorphan | - Dizziness <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Drowsiness | - Serotonin syndrome with MAOIs <br/> - Abuse potential |
| Guaifenesin | - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Dizziness | Minimal |
| Diphenhydramine | - Sedation <br/> - Dry mouth <br/> - Urinary retention | - Anticholinergic toxicity <br/> - Falls in elderly |
| Codeine/hydrocodone | - Sedation <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Constipation | - Respiratory depression <br/> - Dependence <br/> - Overdose |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Use **non-narcotic options first** (dextromethorphan, guaifenesin, antihistamines) and reserve narcotics for refractory cases with careful monitoring [^notfound]. Reassess within 1–2 weeks; discontinue if ineffective or adverse effects occur.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line**: Dextromethorphan for dry cough; guaifenesin for productive cough.

- **Second-line**: First-generation antihistamines for allergic or postnasal drip cough.

- **Reserve**: Codeine or hydrocodone for severe, refractory cough with close monitoring.

- **Avoid**: Narcotics in older adults, patients with respiratory depression, head injury, or substance use disorder.

---

Dextromethorphan is the **closest alternative** to benzonatate, with guaifenesin and first-generation antihistamines as additional options; narcotic antitussives are reserved for refractory cases due to safety concerns.

### Benzonatate safety and effectiveness: a systematic review of the literature [^4ab5e939]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the available literature regarding the treatment effects and efficacy of benzonatate needed to better inform patients, providers, and regulators evaluating its role in modern medical therapies.

Data Sources

Comprehensive literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), Cochrane Library, and Scopus for original research articles evaluating the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety profile of benzonatate from January 1956 through August 2022.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The identified studies were screened for relevance and then assessed for inclusion through a full-text review, data extraction, and quality assessment by multiple reviewers using the online software Covidence.

Data Synthesis

The selection process resulted in 37 articles consisting of 21 cohort studies, 5 experimental studies, and 11 case studies and series. Initial clinical studies exploring potential therapeutic benefits collected data from very small populations and limited clinical settings. Safety is primarily assessed in terms of toxicity due to overdose or inappropriate use. Quality assessment raised concerns for high degrees of biases primarily related to the limited sample size, data collection, generalizability, and study design.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

This review reveals substantial limitations within existing evidence pertaining to the safety and clinical effectiveness of benzonatate and thus, a need for large observational studies or randomized trials to better characterize its role and value in modern medical practice.

Conclusions

Rising safety concerns should bring closer scrutiny upon the prescription of benzonatate whose approval is founded upon evidence that would not stand up to current regulatory review.

### Benzonatate exposure trends and adverse events [^8e4ea105]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Adverse events (AE), including death, occur in children with benzonatate use. This study aims to understand recent trends in benzonatate exposure and clinical consequences in pediatric patients.

Methods

This retrospective analysis of data from IQVIA pharmacy drug dispensing, National Poison Data System, National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance Project, FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, and the medical literature evaluated exposure trends and medication-related AEs with benzonatate. Trends for comparator narcotic and nonnarcotic antitussive medications were analyzed where possible for context.

Results

During the study period, pediatric benzonatate prescription utilization increased but remained low compared with pediatric utilization of dextromethorphan-containing prescription antitussive medications. Among the 4689 pediatric benzonatate exposure cases reported to US poison control centers from 2010 to 2018, 3727 cases (80%) were for single-substance exposures. Of these, 3590 cases (77%) were unintentional exposures and most involved children 0 to 5 years old (2718 cases, 83%). Cases involving intentional benzonatate exposure increased among children 10 to 16 years old with a more pronounced increase for multiple-substance exposures. Most benzonatate cases involving misuse or abuse were for children 10 to 16 years old (59 cases, 61%). The proportion of cases with serious adverse effects was low. There were few cases annually of serious AEs with benzonatate in children.

Conclusions

There were rising patterns of unintentional ingestion of benzonatate in children 0 to 5 years old and intentional benzonatate ingestion in children 10 to 16 years old. Rational prescribing and improved provider and caregiver awareness of benzonatate toxic effects may reduce risks associated with benzonatate exposure.

### Benzonatate [^9dca5727]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Hypersensitivity

Severe hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, laryngospasm and cardiovascular collapse) have been reported which are possibly related to local anesthesia from sucking or chewing the capsule instead of swallowing it. Severe reactions have required intervention with vasopressor agents and supportive measures.

Psychiatric Effects

Isolated instances of bizarre behavior, including mental confusion and visual hallucinations, have also been reported in patients taking Benzonatate capsules in combination with other prescribed drugs.

Accidental Ingestion and Death in Children

Keep benzonatate capsules out of reach of children. Accidental ingestion of benzonatate capsules resulting in death has been reported in children below age 10. Signs and symptoms of overdose have been reported within 15–20 minutes and death has been reported within one hour of ingestion. If accidental ingestion occurs, seek medical attention immediately (see OVERDOSAGE).

### Caffeine and sodium benzoate [^f7ec287a]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Caffeine and Sodium Benzoate Injection has been used in conjunction with supportive measure to treat respiratory depression associated with overdosage with CNS depressant drugs (e.g., narcotic analgesics, alcohol). However, because of questionable benefit and transient action, most authorities believe caffeine and other analeptics should not be used in these conditions and recommend other supportive therapy.

### Corticosteroids, antitussives, and inhalers for lower respiratory tract infections in US primary care: a prospective cohort study [^b606d26b]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Physicians often prescribe medications other than antibiotics to address symptoms in patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), but their frequency and effectiveness have been poorly studied.

Objective

To describe use of non-antibiotic medications in adult outpatients with LRTI, and whether their use is associated with reduced duration or severity of illness.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Participants

Adult outpatients 18 to 75 years with acute cough and at least one lower or systemic respiratory symptom suspected of having a LRTI.

Main Measures

The percentage of patients given non-antibiotic medications and propensity score matched analysis of association of systemic corticosteroids, benzonatate, and albuterol inhaler on duration of cough, severity of cough, receipt of an antibiotic, and need for an unscheduled follow-up visit.

Key Results

Of 718 patients, 690 had baseline severity data, 517 had diary data for duration, and 499 had data for severity. Benzonatate (23.2%), an albuterol inhaler (19.1%), and a systemic corticosteroid (18.6%) were commonly prescribed. In univariate analysis, receipt of benzonatate, an albuterol inhaler, or any antitussive was associated with greater baseline severity of cough. Receipt of benzonatate was also associated with greater overall duration and severity of cough. Receipt of a systemic corticosteroid was associated with a greater likelihood of receiving an antibiotic (54.7% vs. 24.2%, p < 0.001). In the propensity score matched analysis, there was no association between receiving a systemic corticosteroid, an albuterol inhaler, or benzonatate and the duration of cough, severity of cough, or need for an unscheduled follow-up visit. Receiving a systemic corticosteroid was associated with an increased likelihood of also getting an antibiotic (adjusted odds ratio 1.37).

Conclusions

Despite having no evidence of benefit and well-known harms, systemic corticosteroids and benzonatate were commonly prescribed. Adequately powered pragmatic trials in primary care settings are badly needed to provide appropriate data to guide practice.

### Benzonatate overdose presenting as cardiac arrest with rapidly narrowing QRS interval [^8a145491]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Benzonatate is a local anesthetic-like sodium channel antagonist that is widely prescribed as an antitussive. While it may be reasonable to assume that patients would present with a prolonged QRS interval following benzonatate overdose, the published literature does not support this. We report a case of a patient presenting following a benzonatate overdose with a prolonged QRS on her initial electrocardiograph (ECG) rhythm strip with rapid normalization of QRS duration.

Case Report

A 14-year-old girl presented in cardiac arrest following a benzonatate overdose. The patient was found in cardiac arrest within minutes of last being known well. Bystanders immediately provided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and she was in asystole on emergency medical services (EMS) arrival. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was obtained following administration of intraosseous epinephrine and naloxone. EMS obtained an ECG rhythm strip following ROSC demonstrating a sinus rhythm with a QRS duration of 160 ms. Over the ensuing 30 minutes, there was progressive narrowing of the QRS. A 12-lead ECG obtained on arrival in the emergency department (ED) 44 minutes later demonstrated a QRS duration of 94 ms. Initially, EMS ECG rhythm strips were unavailable and an isolated benzonatate ingestion was considered less likely as ECG intervals were normal. Benzonatate exposure was later confirmed with a urine benzonatate concentration, which was 8.5 mcg/mL. The patient made a full recovery.

Discussion

Cases of pediatric benzonatate overdose with rapid development of cardiac arrest and full recovery have been previously reported. In this case, evidence of cardiac sodium channel blockade was demonstrated with a prolonged QRS interval on initial ECG rhythm strip analysis. However, unlike previous cases, rapid resolution of QRS prolongation occurred in this case. While transient QRS prolongation may be observed, finding a normal QRS interval should not discount the possibility of benzonatate overdose.

### Effect of sodium benzoate vs placebo among individuals with early psychosis: a randomized clinical trial [^b8f956a8]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Study Interventions

Participants received either 500 mg of BZ twice daily (1000 mg/d total) or microcrystalline cellulose in matched gelatin capsule (placebo) for 12 weeks. This dose was selected based on the original study of BZ in people with chronic schizophrenia, in which a significant reduction in symptoms compared with placebo without significant adverse events was reported. Participants were being treated as clinically indicated by early psychosis services or community care teams in 1 of 5 public mental health services in southeast Queensland. Participants were clinically assessed at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 and received an AUD $40 (US $28.34) retail shop gift card at the end of weeks 2, 6, and 12 (total reimbursement, AUD $120 [US $85.01]).

The investigational products were manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice in a Therapeutic Goods Administration–licensed facility. Participants returned all unused study medication (ie, unopened blister packs or capsules not taken) and empty blister packs to research personnel. All unused supplies of study medication were accounted for and documented by the designated research pharmacist. Treatment adherence was determined by calculating the mean number of pills taken per day across the 12 week study and dividing this by 2 (the daily protocol dosage). Those who had taken more than 80% of capsules were assessed as adherent.

Randomization and Blinding

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated randomization table, stratified by the 5 sites. A separate randomization table was generated for each site, and each list ensured randomization occurred in blocked groups of 4. The allocation sequence was generated by an independent statistician, and the dispensing of study medication was supervised by an independent research pharmacist. All participants, clinical teams, investigators, and the study statistician were masked to treatment assignment for the duration of the study.

### Effect of sodium benzoate vs placebo among individuals with early psychosis: a randomized clinical trial [^af1c5c64]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

There was no significant improvement of total PANSS score in participants with early psychosis after 12 weeks of adjunctive treatment with 1000 mg of BZ per day compared with placebo. Overall, there was no improvements in any of the subscales of PANSS nor in any of the secondary clinical measures. The findings did not change in the planned per-protocol analyses. Our findings provide no support for the hypothesis that BZ is an effective adjunctive treatment for first-episode psychosis.

The lack of efficacy is in contrast to the findings from 2 previous studies. Our protocol differed from these studies on at least 2 key issues. Our sample consisted of people who were relatively young (mean age, 21 years) with recent-onset disorder, while the previous studies were based on participants with longer durations of psychosis and/or treatment resistance. Furthermore, while the previous studies were restricted to participants with schizophrenia, our sample included a broader range of diagnoses; however, most of our participants (83 [84%]) had schizophrenia. Approximately 75% of people with early psychosis achieve symptomatic remission, with affective psychosis having a better prognosis than nonaffective psychosis. This is consistent with the substantial symptomatic improvements in both the adjunctive BZ and placebo groups in this study.

### Benzoyl peroxide development, pharmacology, formulation and clinical uses in topical fixed-combinations [^de9cab69]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) is a commonly used and highly effective topical treatment for acne that is available in concentrations from 2.5–10%. The compound is not associated with bacterial resistance, and published acne treatment guidelines recommend BPO in conjunction with the long-term use of both topical and systemic antibiotics. A number of combination products containing antibiotics, BPO and/or retinoids are available and useful for tailoring treatment to the needs of each patient over the course of what is often a chronic condition. Fixed combinations of BPO and antibiotics or retinoids address multiple pathogenetic factors by using agents with complementary, but different modes of action. These agents are convenient to use and may improve adherence to therapy by simplifying the regimen for the patient. However, BPO is associated with dose-dependent irritation and dryness. Therefore, formulations containing lower concentrations of BPO (2.5%) minimize irritation, which may improve tolerability and maximize treatment outcomes.

### Effect of sodium benzoate vs placebo among individuals with early psychosis: a randomized clinical trial [^c6a11980]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design

Cadence BZ was a multicenter, randomized clinical trial of either BZ at 1 g/d or placebo, adjunctive to receiving usual clinical care within public mental health early psychosis and other services. The study was approved by the Metro South Human Research Ethics Committee and registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. The protocol and the statistical analysis plan have been previously published, (Supplement 1). All participants provided written informed consent. The trial was conducted from August 2015 to July 2018. Data analysis and reporting was done in accordance to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

Help-seeking individuals were eligible to participate if they were aged between 15 and 45 years, met diagnostic criteria for a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) psychotic disorder (schizophrenia, schizophreniform psychosis, delusional disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis not otherwise specified) with illness onset within the last 2 years, had received antipsychotic medications for at least 1 continuous month within the 2-year period of illness, and had a PANSS total score of at least 55. Diagnosis was confirmed with the Diagnostic Interview for Psychosis. Participants were eligible to participate if they had the capacity to consent and were able to follow the study instructions and procedures. Exclusion criteria were known allergies to BZ or to food preservatives in general; comorbid physical illnesses requiring additional treatments or hospitalizations; inability to communicate in English; currently pregnant, lactating or planning to become pregnant during the study period; concomitant participation in another clinical trial; and inability to understand and follow the study instructions and procedures.

### Nitrogen scavengers: history, clinical considerations and future prospects [^d1fa1c76]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

8 Current Clinical Situation Regarding Use of Nitrogen Scavengers

Sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate are available in both oral and intravenous formulations, yet neither of these have been officially licensed as a drug. Instead, they are classified as chemicals only for research purposes, meaning they are not subject to the same regulatory oversight as licensed pharmaceutical products. As already mentioned above, a combination of benzoate and phenylacetate, each at 10% concentrations, exists as a licensed drug. Furthermore, it is practice in some metabolic centers to concomitantly use the chemical preparations of both compounds for intravenous application, which, according to anecdotal evidence, is likewise effective. In the given situation, healthcare providers must offer specific information when administering sodium benzoate or sodium phenylacetate to patients in clinical practice. Despite its widespread and longstanding use, especially in the management of UCDs, the history of sodium benzoate's introduction has largely been empirical, based on its effectiveness observed in clinical settings rather than through formal drug development processes. This lack of formal licensing has, unfortunately, not prompted the pharmaceutical industry to develop a licensed formulation of sodium benzoate. As a consequence, healthcare providers and patients continue to rely on unlicensed chemical forms, which may lead to inconsistencies in quality control, dosing, and patient safety. The absence of a licensed, commercially available product has remained a significant gap in the therapeutic options for UCDs, even though sodium benzoate has proven to be a valuable tool in managing ammonia toxicity.

The situation is quite different for the other compounds. Sodium and glycerol phenylbutyrate are licensed as pharmaceutical drugs for oral administration in large parts of the world, both of which are approved for use in the treatment of UCDs. Sodium phenylacetate, due to its strong odor, is only available as a drug for injection. Several licensed formulations have undergone rigorous regulatory approval, ensuring consistency in quality, safety, and efficacy. They provide flexibility in treatment, catering to different patient needs, and are considered a standard, clinically validated approach to managing ammonia toxicity. The availability of phenylbutyrate‐based formulations in licensed, regulated forms marks a significant advancement in UCD therapy compared to sodium phenylacetate, ensuring both healthcare providers and patients can rely on the drug for safe and effective management with satisfactory compliance.

### Use of pill glide to encourage transition from liquid to solid dosage formulations [^1d27352c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Situation

Patient I is a 15 year old female with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency prescribed L-arginine 1.5g three times daily and sodium benzoate 4.2g three times daily. By taking her medication and controlling her diet she is able to lead a normal life and does well at school. However she struggles with the palatability of her medication and has not been able to transition to solid dosage forms. She has therefore been stabilised on an unlicensed sodium benzoate liquid and has L-arginine capsules which she takes by opening and dispersing the contents in water. This creates problems for the patient because the volume of sodium benzoate liquid that she needs is very large. This means it has been difficult to come to collect supplies from our pharmacy due to the volume that needs to be carried and transported in one go, and also makes going away on holiday difficult. In addition, the liquid version is more expensive than other options so being able to convert to tablets would be a cost saving measure.

Background

Previous attempts to encourage her to take tablets and alternative options such as licensed sodium phenylbutyrate granules have failed. A recommendation was therefore made by the pharmacist to try using Pill Glide swallowing spray as an aid to help her learn to swallow sodium benzoate tablets, in conjunction with nurse-led teaching. Pill Glide is a flavoured spray that helps patients swallow tablets and capsules more easily. It comes in a number of flavours that patients can choose from and can be used for as long as it is beneficial.

Outcome

Patient I found the spray useful in helping her to swallow sodium benzoate tablets and swallow her L-arginine capsules whole and has now successfully transitioned from using sodium benzoate liquid. This has benefitted the patient by reducing the need collect and transport large volumes of liquid, and by helping her to transition to adulthood. Importantly it has also enabled a significant cost saving, with a saving of £367/month by switching her from liquid sodium benzoate to sodium benzoate tablets and Pill Glide.

Lessons Learned

Pill Glide is a useful potential option to help patients who struggle to take solid dosage forms. Liquid medicines are usually much more expensive than tablets and capsules, and therefore helping children with chronic conditions to transition to taking tablets and capsules could be an important cost-saving measure. In addition it could improve compliance in taking medicines where there is no liquid form available or where patients find liquid forms unpalatable. The option of Pill Glide has now been rolled out to other specialties such as renal and respiratory patients where there may also be cost savings and patient benefits for those who find transitioning to solid dosage forms difficult.

### Deciding the dose to prescribe [^0bb39849]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2004). Low credibility.

The dose of a medicine prescribed is so much a part of everyday practice and prescribing guidance that it might appear a surprising subject for a symposium. In reality, however, many questions about choosing doses are unresolved. Here we summarise the talks given at our March 2004 symposium — Deciding the dose to prescribe — incorporating views raised in discussion.

### Topical benzoyl peroxide for acne [^b63bb7f6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne is a common, economically burdensome condition that can cause psychological harm and, potentially, scarring. Topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO) is a widely used acne treatment; however, its efficacy and safety have not been clearly evaluated.

Objectives

To assess the effects of BPO for acne.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to February 2019: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that compared topical BPO used alone (including different formulations and concentrations of BPO) or as part of combination treatment against placebo, no treatment, or other active topical medications for clinically diagnosed acne (used alone or in combination with other topical drugs not containing BPO) on the face or trunk.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. Primary outcome measures were 'participant global self-assessment of acne improvement' and 'withdrawal due to adverse events in the whole course of a trial' 'Percentage of participants experiencing any adverse event in the whole course of a trial' was a key secondary outcome.

Main Results

We included 120 trials (29,592 participants randomised in 116 trials; in four trials the number of randomised participants was unclear). Ninety-one studies included males and females. When reported, 72 trials included participants with mild to moderate acne, 26 included participants with severe acne, and the mean age of participants ranged from 18 to 30 years. Our included trials assessed BPO as monotherapy, as add-on treatment, or combined with other active treatments, as well as BPO of different concentrations and BPO delivered through different vehicles. Comparators included different concentrations or formulations of BPO, placebo, no treatment, or other active treatments given alone or combined. Treatment duration in 80 trials was longer than eight weeks and was only up to 12 weeks in 108 trials. Industry funded 50 trials; 63 trials did not report funding. We commonly found high or unclear risk of performance, detection, or attrition bias. Trial setting was under-reported but included hospitals, medical centres/departments, clinics, general practices, and student health centres. We reported on outcomes assessed at the end of treatment, and we classified treatment periods as short-term (two to four weeks), medium-term (five to eight weeks), or long-term (longer than eight weeks). For 'participant-reported acne improvement', BPO may be more effective than placebo or no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 1.45; 3 RCTs; 2234 participants; treatment for 10 to 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence). Based on low-certainty evidence, there may be little to no difference between BPO and adapalene (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.10; 5 RCTs; 1472 participants; treatment for 11 to 12 weeks) or between BPO and clindamycin (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.34; 1 RCT; 240 participants; treatment for 10 weeks) (outcome not reported for BPO versus erythromycin or salicylic acid). For 'withdrawal due to adverse effects', risk of treatment discontinuation may be higher with BPO compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.55 to 2.93; 24 RCTs; 13,744 participants; treatment for 10 to 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence); the most common causes of withdrawal were erythema, pruritus, and skin burning. Only very low-certainty evidence was available for the following comparisons: BPO versus adapalene (RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.94 to 3.64; 11 RCTs; 3295 participants; treatment for 11 to 24 weeks; causes of withdrawal not clear), BPO versus clindamycin (RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.90 to 4.11; 8 RCTs; 3330 participants; treatment for 10 to 12 weeks; causes of withdrawal included local hypersensitivity, pruritus, erythema, face oedema, rash, and skin burning), erythromycin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.26; 1 RCT; 60 participants; treatment for 8 weeks; withdrawal due to dermatitis), and salicylic acid (no participants had adverse event-related withdrawal; 1 RCT; 59 participants; treatment for 12 weeks). There may be little to no difference between these groups in terms of withdrawal; however, we are unsure of the results because the evidence is of very low certainty. For 'proportion of participants experiencing any adverse event', very low-certainty evidence leaves us uncertain about whether BPO increased adverse events when compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.70; 21 RCTs; 11,028 participants; treatment for 10 to 12 weeks), with adapalene (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.00; 7 RCTs; 2120 participants; treatment for 11 to 24 weeks), with erythromycin (no participants reported any adverse events; 1 RCT; 89 participants; treatment for 10 weeks), or with salicylic acid (RR 4.77, 95% CI 0.24 to 93.67; 1 RCT; 41 participants; treatment for 6 weeks). Moderate-certainty evidence shows that the risk of adverse events may be increased for BPO versus clindamycin (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.58; 6 RCTs; 3018 participants; treatment for 10 to 12 weeks); however, the 95% CI indicates that BPO might make little to no difference. Most reported adverse events were mild to moderate, and local dryness, irritation, dermatitis, erythema, application site pain, and pruritus were the most common.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence suggests that BPO as monotherapy or add-on treatment may be more effective than placebo or no treatment for improving acne, and there may be little to no difference between BPO and either adapalene or clindamycin. Our key efficacy evidence is based on participant self-assessment; trials of BPO versus erythromycin or salicylic acid did not report this outcome. For adverse effects, the evidence is very uncertain regarding BPO compared with adapalene, erythromycin, or salicylic acid. However, risk of treatment discontinuation may be higher with BPO compared with placebo or no treatment. Withdrawal may be linked to tolerability rather than to safety. Risk of mild to moderate adverse events may be higher with BPO compared with clindamycin. Further trials should assess the comparative effects of different preparations or concentrations of BPO and combination BPO versus monotherapy. These trials should fully assess and report adverse effects and patient-reported outcomes measured on a standardised scale.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^58856149]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Outpatient taper management — algorithm directs clinicians first to ask, "Would the patient benefit from transitioning to a longer-acting BZD?", and if yes to "Transition to longer-acting BZD" by "Estimate equivalent dose", "Transition one dose at a time, over 1–2 weeks", and "Adjust dose based on patient response"; otherwise "Determine initial dose reduction", with "Typical initial dose reduction: 5–10% every 2–4 weeks; Generally not more than 25% every 2 weeks", then "Monitor withdrawal symptoms", use the branch "No or mild withdrawal symptoms" to "Consider similar pace for next dose reduction", and employ supportive steps including "Offer adjunctive interventions/medications as appropriate", "Consider switching to a longer-acting BZD", "Consider maintaining on lower dose if further dose reductions are not tolerated", and "If paused, consider slower taper when ready to resume", while ensuring to "Engage in shared decision making process with the patient (and care partner[s]) whenever possible".

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^77d18fb2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine dose conversion and transition emphasizes that determining the equivalent dose of an alternative BZD is inexact and can vary across patients; many conversion tools exist, but unlike with opioid medications no precise strategies for conversion exist; widely available equivalent doses were established based on average diazepam doses and patient experience should be considered when converting because some patients may require higher or lower doses than the reported equivalent; transition to an alternative BZD may be more successful if those doses are slowly transitioned over 1–2 weeks rather than 1–2 days.

### Prescribing and deprescribing guidance for benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use in adults with depression, anxiety, and insomnia: an international scoping review [^8580fc67]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The switch to a long-acting agent, diazepam in particular, was commonly acknowledged as an option with variation in the 'when' and 'how' of the BZD substitution approach. Some guidelines did not make this recommendation due to a scarcity of evidence. Furthermore, accurate benzodiazepine conversion (i.e. diazepam milligram equivalence) for individual patients still remain a challenge that may be improved upon by further research.

Another area of contention in the prescriptive management of BZD withdrawal is the use of alternative pharmacotherapies as either adjuncts or to substitute the BZD entirely. Previous reviews have identified some agents such as carbamazepine and melatonin for their use in this setting — though results are mixed and not fully devoid of risk itself. The documents we reviewed were quite divided in either their recommendations or even acknowledgement of these pharmacologic options as viable strategies. This is likely explained by the limited number of randomised controlled trials and lower quality heterogenous evidence variably supporting their use, as reviewed in further detail elsewhere. Furthermore, the fact that there were many such agents without clear guidance on 'when' (what stage of withdrawal), 'how' (dosing and duration) and 'where' (i.e. institutional or outpatient setting) to use them does not yet offer clinicians much confidence in their routine adoption as a strategy for BZD discontinuation.

A final area of interest relevant to deprescribing is the barely investigated, often patient driven, approach toward BZD formulation altering which may include tablet shaving or water dilution methods which was observed by Ashton as far back as 1994. This is conceptually akin to crude hyperbolic dose reductions or 'micro' tapers, which have been previously discussed regarding antidepressant tapering. Only one document that we reviewed descriptively covered this practice. While not clearly an acknowledged evidence-based strategy yet, future guidelines and guidance committees on BZD and BZRA medication would do well to acknowledge the reality of this practice and make recommendations on it regardless of the state of evidence. Pharmaceutical compounding as a routine alternative to problematic protracted low-dose withdrawal situations may be expected to yield a more standardised, clinician supervised and ultimately successful approach for refractory patients, but could be cost-limiting or inaccessible for many of these individuals.

### "Should patients with substance use disorders Be prescribed benzodiazepines? " No [^3ea3f2a4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) should not use benzodiazepines to treat anxiety, insomnia, or anything else, for the same reasons that they should not drink any alcohol or use other drugs, regardless of their primary drug used. Once the addiction "switch" is thrown on, it never again goes off. This question has additional relevance today because in 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration put black box warnings on all benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics about the serious risks associated with their concomitant use. Anxiety is not a benzodiazepine-deficiency disease. It is possible to treat anxiety and insomnia without medicines of any kind, and it is possible to use medicines other than benzodiazepines for these common and serious mental disorders. Although many patients with SUDs are eager to use benzodiazepines, using alternatives is often effective and it does not put the patient's recovery in jeopardy. The standard I propose here is based on the experience of many people with SUDs who have tried and failed to use benzodiazepines for anxiety.

### Benzhydrocodone and acetaminophen [^611d4ce3]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

2.4 Conversion from Other Opioids to Benzhydrocodone and Acetaminophen Tablets

There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of Benzhydrocodone and Acetaminophen tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour Benzhydrocodone and Acetaminophen tablets dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour Benzhydrocodone and Acetaminophen tablets dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose.

Conversion from Hydrocodone Bitartrate/Acetaminophen to Benzhydrocodone and Acetaminophen tablets

Patients can be converted from immediate-release hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen to a dosing regimen of Benzhydrocodone and Acetaminophen tablets as shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Conversion from Hydrocodone bitartrate/Acetaminophen to Benzhydrocodone and Acetaminophen Tablets

2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Individually titrate Benzhydrocodone and Acetaminophen tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Benzhydrocodone and Acetaminophen tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.

If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Benzhydrocodone and Acetaminophen tablets dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

Total dosage of Benzhydrocodone and Acetaminophen tablets and any concomitant acetaminophen-containing products should not exceed 4000 mg of acetaminophen in a 24-hour period.

### Substitution therapy for alcoholism: time for a reappraisal? [^9f83cc22]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

A number of compounds already in use as medications for various indications substitute for ethanol at clinically relevant brain pathways, in particular, at gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Nevertheless, although substitute medications have been recognized for heroin and tobacco dependence, patients with alcohol dependence are rarely offered an analogous approach. Benzodiazepines may have paradoxical effects, and abuse and dependence are known. Baclofen (GABA(B) agonist) has not been associated with dependence or misuse and has been effective in several trials in preventing relapse, although research is required to establish the optimal dosing regimen. GABA-ergic anticonvulsants, helpful in treating withdrawal, have yet to emerge as effective in relapse prevention. Clomethiazole and sodium oxybate, the latter having been shown to be effective in relapse prevention, have incurred a reputation for dependence and abuse. However, data have emerged showing that the risk of abuse of sodium oxybate is lower than many clinicians had foreseen. For a condition where existing therapies are only effective in a proportion of patients, and which has high morbidity and mortality, the time now seems right for reappraising the use of substitute prescribing for alcohol dependence.

### Using visual prompts to aid analgesia prescribing [^8d84dd42]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The "pain ladder" or "analgesic ladder" was devised by the World Health Organisation to describe the steps to take when prescribing analgesia. It was originally applied to the management of cancer pain and is now widely used by medical professionals for all types of pain. It describes three steps when managing pain:

Prompt administration of a non-opioid eg paracetamol
If pain persists, administer an additional weak opioid eg codeine
Then administer strong opioids eg morphine until the patient is pain free.

Opioid prescribing has well known common adverse effects for the patient including constipation and nausea. These side effects can be managed with appropriate concurrent prescribing of laxatives and antiemetics alongside opioids. Often these concurrent medications are not prescribed until the patient is actively complaining of symptoms. At GWH it is seen as good practice to prescribe these medications early to limit patient discomfort and distress.

The aim of this project was to improve both the quality and safety of analgesia prescribing at GWH. Within such a vast area two points were chosen to focus on that could be measured. Firstly, with regards to quality, are laxatives being prescribed alongside opioids? And secondly, with regards to safety, are doctors accurate when converting opioids to its morphine equivalent?

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^b652617c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations
When considering the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing, clinicians should screen patients for non-prescription use of BZDs and use of other substances that may interact with BZDs or impact the tapering process.
When the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits, clinicians should initiate a conversation with patients about tapering (or discontinuation if patients are unlikely to be physically dependent). Clinicians should elicit information from patients about their expectations and concerns about the tapering process and discuss them. Clinicians should discuss alternatives for managing the underlying condition(s) for which the BZD was initially prescribed that may be more effective and carry less risk compared to BZDs (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or CBT for anxiety disorders, CBT-I for primary insomnia).
The goal of tapering may be discontinuing the BZD medication or reducing the BZD dose to the lowest effective dose where the risks no longer outweigh the benefits. Clinicians should reassess risks and benefits throughout the tapering process to inform decision-making.
Although many patients who have been taking BZDs for a short period of time (e.g. less than a month) are able to discontinue the medication without a taper, clinicians can consider a short taper. A short taper may be indicated if clinicians have concerns for clinically significant withdrawal (e.g. due to the pharmacological properties of the BZD, patient age, comorbidities, other substance use, prior history of withdrawal) or patients express concerns about discontinuing the medication.
Many healthcare systems may not be able to manage the volume of patients who would benefit from BZD tapering. As such, clinicians and healthcare systems may need to triage patients, prioritizing those at higher risk of harm related to continued BZD use. See " Implementing this Guideline " for further discussion.

The Tapering Process

Recommendations for the Tapering Process

6 Clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper. The pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
7 Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).
8 Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
9 Clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Implementation Considerations
Prior to beginning a taper, clinicians should conduct a thorough medication and health review, with particular attention to other psychoactive medications and conditions that may be impacted during the taper.
Clinicians should design the overall tapering strategy to minimize harms, considering the risk of harm related to continued BZD use and the risk of harms related to tapering the BZD (e.g. withdrawal symptoms, recurrence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed).
Clinicians should consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (i.e. 5%) for the first reduction to assess a patient's initial response, unless there are imminent safety concerns.
For patients who are likely to have strong physical dependence (e.g. those who have been taking a high dose for more than a year), clinicians should consider a slower taper. For the first reduction, consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (e.g. 5%). For further reductions, clinicians should adjust based on patients' initial response, considering reduction of 5 to 10% every 6–8 weeks, or slower as appropriate.
Clinicians can consider the higher end of the dose reduction range (i.e. 10–25%) for patients who are unlikely to have significant physical dependence (i.e. patients who have been taking a lower dose of BZD for a shorter period of time [e.g. less than 3 months]) but for whom tapering is indicated.
When developing tapering strategies, clinicians should consider patients' current BZD dose and half-life, frequency and duration of BZD use, co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, and responses to previous missed doses and any prior BZD tapering attempts. Clinicians should also consider patient concerns and anxiety around tapering.
When patients are taking multiple doses of BZDs each day, clinicians should carefully consider which dose to reduce first. For example, first reducing earlier doses may be appropriate if insomnia is a greater concern, whereas first reducing later doses may be more appropriate if daytime anxiety is a greater concern.
Tapering strategies, including dosing frequency, should account for the pharmacokinetic properties of the BZD to avoid sharp declines in BZD receptor occupancy.
Clinicians should monitor patients for symptoms of withdrawal and recurrence with each dose reduction. Virtual or telephonic check-ins can be leveraged for this purpose.
Clinicians should monitor patients for post-acute signs and symptoms of withdrawal for 2–4 weeks after full discontinuation of the BZD. Clinicians should manage any ongoing symptoms, as appropriate (see " Management of Protracted Withdrawal "), and regularly monitor patients until symptoms are resolved. Telehealth, including audio-only check-ins, may help facilitate monitoring.
Clinicians should consider pausing or slowing the pace of the taper and/or making smaller dose reductions for patients experiencing significant symptoms related to the BZD taper.
The BZD tapering process can be more difficult for patients as they approach the point of discontinuation. Clinicians should proactively consider smaller dose reductions and/or slowing the pace of dose reductions as the taper progresses.
If patients are unable to tolerate further BZD dose reductions, clinicians can consider — in partnership with patients, their care partners, and other members of the care team — maintaining patients on the lower BZD dose with regular risk–benefit assessments consistent with Recommendation 1.
In some limited instances when patients are experiencing intolerable symptoms, returning to the prior BZD dose and pausing the taper until symptoms stabilize may be appropriate.
In limited instances when necessary for patient safety, inpatient and medically managed residential settings may use more rapid tapering strategies (see "Tapering with Very Long-Acting Agents").

### Hyaluronidase (Amphadase) [^8a37c1d1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Important Precautions Regarding Amphadase

Instruct patients that Amphadase®is being used to increase the dispersion and absorption of fluids or other injected drugs, as appropriate to the intended use.

Instruct patients that there may be mild local injection site signs and symptoms, such as redness, swelling, itching, or pain localized to the site of injection.

What Patients Should Know About Adverse Reactions

The most frequently reported adverse reactions have been mild local injection site reactions such as redness, swelling, itching, or pain.

Anaphylactic-like reactions, and allergic reactions, such as hives, have been reported rarely in patients receiving hyaluronidases.

Patients Should Inform Their Doctors If Taking Other Medications

You may not receive furosemide, the benzodiazepines, phenytoin, dopamine and/or alpha agonists with Amphadase®. These medications have been found to be incompatible with hyaluronidase.

If you are taking salicylates (e.g., aspirin), steroids (e.g., cortisone or estrogens), or antihistamines your doctor may need to prescribe larger amounts of hyaluronidase for equivalent dispersing effect.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^05fd2368]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Safety concerns for inherited patients — assumption of prescribing, referrals, and non-abandonment indicate that clinicians sometimes inherit patients who have been prescribed high-dose and/or long-term BZDs. Clinicians can attempt to consult with prior prescribers and other relevant physical and mental health providers, and clinicians should follow the recommendations in this Guideline when assuming responsibility for new patients, including assessing the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing. Patients may require extra time to understand the rationale behind a recommendation for tapering and buy into the tapering plan. If clinicians are not comfortable assuming responsibility for these prescriptions, they can consider referring these patients to another provider or a more intensive level of care, as appropriate, with a bridging prescription to prevent abrupt discontinuation of the BZD medication. It is critical that patients at risk of BZD withdrawal are not abandoned, and alternatively, clinicians may consider initiating a taper without patient agreement.

Benzodiazepine–opioid co-prescribing — core recommendations: Because all patients co-prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) and opioids are at increased risk of respiratory depression, clinicians should assess the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing with every related clinical encounter or prescription renewal and at least every 3 months (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should offer to provide or prescribe opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g., naloxone) for all patients co-prescribed BZDs and opioids (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should consider additional strategies for mitigating risks, including using the lowest effective doses of BZD and opioid analgesic medications and optimizing non-opioid interventions to manage pain.

### Benzodiazepines revisited – will we ever learn? [^cbf9998b]. Addiction (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

To re-examine various aspects of the benzodiazepines (BZDs), widely prescribed for 50 years, mainly to treat anxiety and insomnia. It is a descriptive review based on the Okey Lecture delivered at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, in November 2010.

Methods

A search of the literature was carried out in the Medline, Embase and Cochrane Collaboration databases, using the codeword 'benzodiazepine(s)', alone and in conjunction with various terms such as 'dependence', 'abuse', etc. Further hand-searches were made based on the reference lists of key papers. As 60,000 references were found, this review is not exhaustive. It concentrates on the adverse effects, dependence and abuse.

Results

Almost from their introduction the BZDs have been controversial, with polarized opinions, advocates pointing out their efficacy, tolerability and patient acceptability, opponents deprecating their adverse effects, dependence and abuse liability. More recently, the advent of alternative and usually safer medications has opened up the debate. The review noted a series of adverse effects that continued to cause concern, such as cognitive and psychomotor impairment. In addition, dependence and abuse remain as serious problems. Despite warnings and guidelines, usage of these drugs remains at a high level. The limitations in their use both as choice of therapy and with respect to conservative dosage and duration of use are highlighted. The distinction between low-dose 'iatrogenic' dependence and high-dose abuse/misuse is emphasized.

Conclusions

The practical problems with the benzodiazepines have persisted for 50 years, but have been ignored by many practitioners and almost all official bodies. The risk-benefit ratio of the benzodiazepines remains positive in most patients in the short term (2–4 weeks) but is unestablished beyond that time, due mainly to the difficulty in preventing short-term use from extending indefinitely with the risk of dependence. Other research issues include the possibility of long-term brain changes and evaluating the role of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, in aiding withdrawal.

### Improving viable low cost generic medication prescription rate in primary care pediatric practice [^3d2166f4]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Strategy

PDSA cycle 1: The stakeholders met every other week for one to two hours and started to work on methods to increase the generic prescription rates based on PDSA cycle. It was decided that nursing staff and physicians would prescribe new medications as generic equivalents, and nursing staff would try to switch the brand name medications to generic equivalents when they refilled medications for the patients.

PDSA cycle 2: The effect of first cycle was very minimal, and hence the team reviewed the brand names most prescribed across all providers and made a recommendation that the best groups to target would be the stimulant medications, asthma medications, and allergy medications. The HIT team was then requested to add the available generics for all stimulant medications, asthma medications, allergy medications, and antibiotics in the EMR.

PDSA cycle 3:The staff and providers experienced difficulty in finding the appropriate generic names in the EMR, and hence HIT was requested to rename the generics and clearly mark for ease of use, for example amphetamine-dextroamphetamine extended release "generic for Adderall XR".

PDSA cycle 4: A clinic flow protocol was developed wherein nurses changed each brand name stimulant to a generic every time they refilled a medicine. The protocol stated the most appropriate medications for certain brand names. The physicians and nurses were also urged to discuss with the patients the substitution process and answer any questions from parents. Quarterly reports were obtained from the HIT about their progress.

Ever since they were launched, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been regarded as profligate prescription interventions and have become a favourite target for pharmacy advisers. Now that they are cheap, with generic omeprazole 20 mg daily costing £1.88 per month (£24.51 per annum) in the UK, it is time to ask whether this status should be reviewed, whether there are areas where the message should be reversed and whether there are any circumstances in which the extra cost of branded PPIs or combined preparations is justified. Equally, with the recognition of an extended toxicity profile, is prescribing profligacy not an economic but a safety issue?

### Prescribing and deprescribing guidance for benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use in adults with depression, anxiety, and insomnia: an international scoping review [^34b0ab8e]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Insomnia was the only condition where these agents had a clear first line pharmacologic indication for their use. Non-pharmacological treatment approaches such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT-I) generally took precedence over pharmacotherapy in most of the major guidelines reviewed, and while this was not quantified in our data-charting, this has become standard knowledge among well-informed clinicians. Overall, the Z-Drugs were preferable to BZD for treatment of insomnia in nearly all documents that offered significant guidance. The use of these agents, like other conditions, was typically intended for short-term use and, again, most frequently in treatment durations no longer than 4 weeks. Most likely, this is not only due to potential dependency but also because of the uncertain but possible deleterious effect of these agents on restorative sleep quality over the long-term. Of further interest for the future of insomnia pharmacotherapy guidelines is the emergence of newer agents such as dual orexin receptor antagonists which are under-represented in older guidelines and still unavailable in some countries. These agents have shown similar early efficacy and potentially superior cognitive safety to Z-Drugs, a relevant consideration in the treatment of older adults.

The focus of BZD deprescribing, especially among older adults, has become more prominent in Western and European nations especially in recent years given an aging demographic trend and the known risks of these agents in this population. Barriers and enablers of BZD deprescribing success are being increasingly understood from the exploration of the patient and prescriber experiences. Use of findings from implementation science studies, surrounding the patient-care context around BZD use, are likely to yield higher quality evidence-based deprescribing interventions to inform future guideline recommendations. Until then, our results indicate some level of both consensus and discrepancy among documents that offer significant medication-related guidance on BZD deprescribing.

In terms of general consensus, gradual dose reduction and shared decision making are universally acknowledged as foundational strategies for successful deprescribing. However, the rate of gradual dose reduction offered was inconsistent despite commonalities in prescribing principles (i.e. tapering slower as doses become lower). While not explicitly examined in this review, it is nonetheless important to acknowledge that psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy, increase the success of gradual dose reduction for discontinuation of BZD/BZRA in both insomnia and anxiety disorders.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^3318806c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Background — benzodiazepines (BZDs) are FDA‑approved for conditions such as anxiety and panic disorders, social phobia, insomnia, and seizures but are associated with increased risks including falls, motor vehicle accidents, cognitive impairment, delirium, overdose, and death, particularly with concurrent central nervous system depressants like alcohol or opioids; physical dependence is expected and abrupt discontinuation can cause serious and potentially life‑threatening withdrawal symptoms, and the risk–benefit balance of prescribing may shift as patients and co‑medications change, while clinicians in palliative and end‑of‑life care are not the intended audience for this guideline.

Eligibility criteria

Documents that were included were those defined or identified as either 'clinical practice guidelines' or 'clinical guidance documents' addressing pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders, insomnia, or unipolar depressive disorders in adults. Additionally, we included guidelines and guidance documents that were non-specific to any conditions but that remained primarily specific to BZD/BZRA related issues (BZD use disorder or deprescribing/tapering). 'Clinical practice guideline' was defined as "a collectively written document where recommendations are made, through a pre-specified evidence-based recommendation process, to an audience by a professional society, association, or group of affiliated experts on a topic relating to medical practice" (adapted from the Institute of Medicine definition). Alternatively, a 'guidance document' was originally defined by us as that which was "derived through a consultation process at a jurisdictional level to establish standards of care". Discussions were held about the difference between these types of documents between the screening reviewers to establish an informal working consensus based on an understanding of these approximate definitions before the full-text screening stage. It was agreed upon that consensus articles, disease state algorithms and other specific types of "review" articles could be eligible for inclusion if they avoided the other exclusion criteria, because they still offered important information on expert opinion and guidance for BZD/BZRA use. As such, these types of documents were categorised as "guidance" documents rather than "guidelines" per se.

Notable other record exclusions were all other review articles on BZD/BZRA or for the conditions under study, those documents specific to other psychiatric conditions such as psychotic disorders or bipolar disorders as well as those specific to pediatric or adolescent populations. Additionally, duplicate guidelines published in multiple journals, guidelines that have since been replaced by a newer version or those that offered specific prescribing guidance for a different class of medication (i.e. antidepressants) were also excluded.

5.1	Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including XANAX, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe XANAX concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of XANAX than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking XANAX, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when XANAX is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2	Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

The use of benzodiazepines, including XANAX, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

Before prescribing XANAX and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of XANAX, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of XANAX along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.

### Prescribing and deprescribing guidance for benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use in adults with depression, anxiety, and insomnia: an international scoping review [^e9add315]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Over thirty years of prescriptive guidance on BZD and BZRA, from groups of international clinician experts on anxiety disorders, unipolar depressive disorders, and insomnia, demonstrate that these agents are still clearly not recommended as routine 1st line agents or for longer-term use (i.e. beyond 4 weeks) in most patients. Recommendations on their use have not generally changed but the lack of explicit direction on prescribing details, noted in many documents, can be further elaborated on in future iterations of guidelines.

A renewed focus on deprescribing of these agents within the past 10-years has elucidated areas of attention for research work to inform future guideline development panels. The shifting of deprescribing practices involving BZD from a clinical 'art' to a clinical 'science' based practice should be a continued focus for guideline committees, with attention to comparing dose reduction strategies, the use or non-use of diazepam (or other long-acting BZD), the use or non-use of adjunctive pharmacotherapies and the value of 'micro' tapers using either compounded products or patient directed alteration of available dosage forms.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1292995d]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering guideline — scope and exclusions states that the Guideline focuses on whether and how to taper benzodiazepine (BZD) medications, including assessing risks and benefits, partnering with patients, level of care, and tapering strategies with withdrawal management. It pertains to patients taking BZDs regularly and at risk of physical dependence and withdrawal, and addresses population-specific considerations including co-prescribed BZDs and opioids, SUD, other psychiatric disorders, older adults, and pregnant and lactating patients. It is not applicable to patients who are prescribed BZDs but are not taking them regularly, nor to those prescribed BZDs for a short period of time (e.g., for under 2 weeks for the management of agitation, acute anxiety, or alcohol withdrawal); non-BZD medications acting on GABA receptors and children and adolescents (i.e., < 18 years old) are beyond the scope.

Rationale

Many patients with psychiatric disorders are able to taper from BZDs in outpatient settings, but some may require a more intensive level of care. BZD tapering may exacerbate or cause recurrence of psychiatric symptoms that may warrant more intensive clinical oversight. Clinicians should consider any underlying psychiatric conditions and relevant treatment history, prior to beginning a BZD taper. Clinicians can consider using the LOCUS for guidance determining the appropriate treatment setting for patients with psychiatric disorders (see Box 9).

Box 9 Level of Care Utilization System: Levels of Care

For more information, see

Patients who have used BZDs for a long time may be reluctant to taper the medication due to fear of experiencing adverse effects related to discontinuation. As BZD tapering can lead to rebound psychiatric symptoms (e.g. anxiety, insomnia), clinicians should optimize evidence-based treatments for any co-occurring psychiatric disorders prior to initiating a BZD taper or concurrently if clinically indicated (e.g. due to significant imminent risks related to continued BZD use). Non-BZD therapies such as SSRIs, CBT, and other evidence-based interventions may be appropriate alternatives to BZD for many patients (see Appendix 4). – Clinicians should also consider evidence-based suicide screening such as the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) or Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ) tool for patients at risk.

Clinicians should educate patients regarding potential rebound psychiatric symptoms and how they will be managed and offer or refer for appropriate mental health services. As discussed in the " Adjunctive Interventions During the Tapering Process ", providing behavioral interventions during the BZD taper is associated with successful discontinuation of BZD. –

Patients with PTSD

The VA recommends that clinicians avoid prescribing BZDs to patients with symptoms of PTSD and provides guidance on alternative treatments for management of anxiety and insomnia in these patients.BZDs are ineffective for the treatment of PTSD; they do not reduce the core symptoms of PTSD or improve PTSD-related sleep dysfunction. BZD use is associated with an increased risk of substance use, depression, and aggression; increased PTSD severity; and decreased efficacy of trauma-focused psychotherapy. When tapering BZD in patients with PTSD, clinicians should consider that withdrawal from BZDs can worsen existing PTSD symptoms (e.g. increased anxiety, rage, increased nightmares, intrusive thoughts, hyperalertness). The CGC noted that clinicians can consider consulting with psychiatric specialists to develop a tapering strategy that minimizes these risks.

Generic medication use — patient strategies focus on addressing acceptance and perceptions, with limited success for broad educational campaigns. Targeting the underlying barriers may promote use, and once patients have used a generic drug through generic substitution they seem much more likely to accept one in the future. Targeted education about standards and bioequivalence may stimulate more value‑conscious decisions, but population‑based educational interventions have shown limited success and must be crafted carefully. Large‑scale public awareness or advertising campaigns might help alter perceptions about generics but have not been rigorously studied.

5.1	Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including Halcion, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe Halcion concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of Halcion than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking Halcion, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Halcion is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2	Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

The use of benzodiazepines, including Halcion, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

### Relative bioavailability, intranasal abuse potential, and safety of benzhydrocodone / acetaminophen compared with hydrocodone bitartrate / acetaminophen in recreational drug abusers [^b2977c56]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Attempts to reduce abuse of hydrocodone-containing combination analgesics have included restricting access by rescheduling these controlled substances from schedule III to the more restrictive schedule II classification, changing product labeling by adding warnings for prescribers, creating new guidelines that recommend shorter courses of therapy (usually ≤ 3 days and rarely > 7 days), and implementing prescription monitoring plans. The development of abuse-deterrent forms of IR hydrocodone combination products would afford an additional strategy to reduce abuse and diversion of these products. In the extended-release (ER) class of opioids, which account for only approximately 10% of all opioid prescriptions, there are a number of hydrocodone-, oxycodone-, and morphine-containing formulations that have been approved with abuse-deterrent product labeling. Given the widespread prescribing and availability of IR opioids and that abusers report a preference for IR over ER opioids due to their fast onset and ease of product manipulation, there is an unmet need for IR opioids with abuse-deterrent features.

Benzhydrocodone is a hydrocodone prodrug that has been combined with acetaminophen (APAP) in a novel IR compound, benzhydrocodone/APAP. Chemically, benzhydrocodone is a new molecular entity formed by a covalent bond between hydrocodone and benzoic acid. The pharmacologically inactive prodrug benzhydrocodone is designed to quickly and effectively release its active hydrocodone component through esterase metabolism in the intestinal tract following oral administration. However, in vitro stability and human pharmacokinetic studies indicate that bypassing presystemic metabolism, as occurs with nonoral administration, results in significantly reduced conversion to hydrocodone. While this means that benzhydrocodone is still susceptible to oral abuse, it may be a poor candidate for nonoral routes of abuse.

Here we report results of a trial to assess the relative bioavailability, IN abuse potential, and safety of benzhydrocodone/APAP compared with commercially available hydrocodone/APAP in nondependent recreational opioid users.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^2a4619b3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Adjunctive pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine tapering — evidence scope and guidance: Considerable disagreement exists in the literature on the utility of pharmacological interventions as an adjunct to BZD tapering, and existing clinical guidelines that endorse adjunctive medications do not offer clear guidance on implementation. A Cochrane review was unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness and safety of various medications because the quality of the evidence was low or very low and with a high risk of bias. The systematic literature review for this CPG review yielded 28 RCTs on various adjunctive pharmacological interventions, including over-the-counter aids such as melatonin. Although a few small studies have suggested carbamazepine might have limited effectiveness to reduce anxiety and withdrawal symptoms, the CPG agreed there is no robust evidence that carbamazepine facilitates discontinuation and, thus, it is not recommended as an adjunct medication for BZD withdrawal management. Buspirone had the most evidence in the systematic literature review.

Patient engagement and follow-up during benzodiazepine prescribing — the document states that BZD prescription renewals are opportunities to review risks and benefits and to educate about limiting duration, noting that clinical benefits can decrease within a few weeks while risks continue or increase. Because of these risks, the CGC recommends that clinicians assess the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing with each new prescription and prescription renewal, and virtual or telephonic follow-up visits can be leveraged for this purpose; for newly initiated BZD prescriptions, clinicians should conduct risk–benefit assessments within 1 month of writing the script or sooner.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)

Can I use SSRI medication to manage repetitive behaviours in a child with a diagnosis of ASD?

Repetitive behaviours are a core diagnostic component of ASD and, consequently, commonly observed among individuals with autism of all ages. These behaviours can take different forms: broadly speaking, while for some they comprise 'functional' behaviours, such as the pursuit of interests, for others they may be less purposeful, such as ritualistic and repetitive motor behaviours. The decision to treat is fundamentally determined by the degree to which the behaviour impacts on wellbeing and/or the ability to develop other skills.

Treatment of repetitive behaviours will largely be from a psychological/behavioural perspective. In some circumstances, however, these may be ineffective, or otherwise difficult to implement; in such cases, medication may be considered. The Cochrane Review of 2013, which considered the use of SSRIs in the management of 'core' symptoms of ASD, found no evidence to support their use for ritualistic behaviours. A more recent systematic review similarly concluded that there is no evidence for the use of SSRI or other medications in the management of ritualistic behaviours.

This notwithstanding, when examining individual studies, there is certainly some evidence to suggest that certain SSRIs, guanfacine, risperidone- a D2, 5-HT2 and NE alpha-2 receptor antagonist and buspirone – a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist may be effective. Given these data, it may be reasonable to consider an SSRI when other non-pharmacological treatment options have failed given that these are used widely in clinical practice and so safety data are available, although some ASD clinical trials have raised the higher risk of side effects in this population (see; and references to individual studies therein). If SSRI are ineffective, or poorly tolerated, risperidone, guanfacine or buspirone may be considered as an alternative; however, particular caution is advised in relation to their use, which must be under specialist supervision.

At the outset it is essential that any trial of medication has (i) a clear titration schedule and (ii) well-defined outcome measures. It is important to bear in mind that medication may take several months to alleviate symptoms. In accordance with the Stopping The Over-Medication of children and young People (STOMP with a learning disability, autism or both) and Supporting Treatment and Appropriate Medication in Paediatrics (STAMP) frameworks, medication should be discontinued if it does not help, and, among responders, should be monitored and discontinued when appropriate.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and benzodiazepines — prescribing and tapering: The VA recommends that clinicians avoid prescribing BZDs to patients with symptoms of PTSD, noting that BZDs are ineffective for the treatment of PTSD and do not reduce the core symptoms of PTSD or improve PTSD-related sleep dysfunction; BZD use is associated with an increased risk of substance use, depression, and aggression, increased PTSD severity, and decreased efficacy of trauma-focused psychotherapy; when tapering in PTSD, clinicians should consider that withdrawal from BZDs can worsen existing PTSD symptoms including increased anxiety, rage, increased nightmares, intrusive thoughts, and hyperalertness, and the CGC noted that clinicians can consider consulting with psychiatric specialists to develop a tapering strategy that minimizes these risks.

Assessment of risk of bias

Following training and calibration, reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to assess risk of bias by using a modified version of the Cochrane endorsed Risk of Bias 2.0 tool (RoB 2.0) — the gold standard tool for assessing limitations in trials that may bias results. This tool assesses the risk of bias of trials across five domains: bias due to randomisation (for example, random sequence generation, allocation concealment), bias due to deviations from the intended intervention (for example, lack of blinding leading to imbalances in co-interventions across trial arms), bias due to missing outcome data (for example, attrition), bias due to measurement of the outcome (for example, unblinded outcome assessment), and selective reporting (for example, selective reporting of outcome measures on the basis of results). We additionally considered bias due to the timing of identification or recruitment of participants for cluster randomised trials and bias due to period and carryover effects for crossover-by-cluster trials.

To assess the risk of bias due to deviations from the intended intervention, we considered the effect of assignment rather than adherence to the intervention, as this effect is likely to be the observed effect in clinical settings and of the greatest interest to evidence users. We considered trials without masking of patients, healthcare providers, and investigators to be at high risk of bias for deviations from the intended intervention owing to the potential for differential care across trial arms. For example, we hypothesised that knowledge among healthcare providers that they are part of a randomised trial concerning the discontinuation of BSH could lead them to advise patients to stop using BSH regardless of the intervention to which participants have been randomised. Likewise, such information could make patients more likely to attempt to discontinue BSH independent of the intervention to which they have been randomised.

Our modified version of the RoB 2.0 tool includes the same domains, but with revised response options (that is, definitely low risk of bias, probably low risk of bias, probably high risk of bias, and definitely high risk of bias) and, in response to evidence suggesting that the original RoB 2.0 tool has poor inter-rater reliability, detailed guidance tailored to factors relevant for this review (for example, removing guidance for assessing risk of bias of adhering to the intervention, listing important co-interventions to consider). Reviewers resolved disagreements by discussion or by consultation with a third reviewer, if necessary.
