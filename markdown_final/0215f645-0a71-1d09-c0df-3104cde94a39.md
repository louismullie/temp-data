## Question

Newborn respiratory distress murmur absent blood pressure left arm and leg and right arm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a newborn with respiratory distress, an absent murmur, and absent blood pressure in the left arm and leg and the right arm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immediate priorities for stabilization and whether this is a shock state. Then, I should verify the most likely cardiac etiologies given the triad of respiratory distress, absent murmur, and absent peripheral pulses. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and the role of the ductus arteriosus in masking or unmasking disease. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach, including pulse oximetry, four-limb blood pressure, and echocardiography. Finally, I will outline urgent management, including prostaglandin, inotropes, and transfer, and consider special scenarios like interrupted aortic arch or total anomalous pulmonary venous return, while double-checking for pitfalls in measurement and interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical severity and immediate priorities. Respiratory distress in a newborn with absent peripheral pulses and no audible murmur suggests critical hemodynamic compromise rather than a benign process, and I should treat this as a neonatal emergency with airway, breathing, and circulation support while initiating a sepsis workup and obtaining vascular access, because delays worsen outcomes in duct-dependent lesions and shock states [^0727c8b6] [^c5219ff0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the murmur. I initially thought "no murmur rules out structural heart disease", but wait, that would be a mistake in neonates. Severe left-sided obstructive lesions can be silent because pulmonary vascular resistance remains high and flow across the obstruction is limited, so the absence of a murmur does not exclude critical disease such as coarctation of the aorta, interrupted aortic arch, or critical aortic stenosis, especially when pulses are absent and there is respiratory distress suggesting low cardiac output or pulmonary edema [^1770ae33] [^3fa8ac58] [^c5219ff0].

> I will now examine the most likely etiologies. Given absent pulses in all extremities with respiratory distress, I should prioritize duct-dependent systemic outflow obstruction such as interrupted aortic arch or severe coarctation, and also consider critical aortic stenosis with shock, where the murmur may be soft or absent and the infant presents with acidosis and poor perfusion. Less likely but important, total anomalous pulmonary venous return with obstruction can present with severe respiratory distress and circulatory collapse, though pulses may be present early and the murmur is often not prominent [^c5219ff0] [^3fa8ac58] [^74ebe953].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology so I don't miss the window for prostaglandin. In duct-dependent systemic obstruction, patency of the ductus arteriosus maintains perfusion to the lower body. As the ductus begins to close in the first days of life, systemic perfusion drops, precipitating shock, metabolic acidosis, and respiratory distress from pulmonary edema, which explains why symptoms often escalate at 24–72 hours of life. Prostaglandin E1 can reopen the ductus and restore perfusion while definitive therapy is arranged [^c5219ff0] [^3fa8ac58].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and make sure I order the right tests without delay. I need simultaneous preductal and postductal pulse oximetry to look for a significant gradient suggesting right-to-left shunting, obtain four-limb blood pressures using standardized technique with appropriate cuff sizes, and arrange emergent echocardiography by a pediatric cardiologist to define arch anatomy, valve function, and intracardiac lesions. Chest radiography can show cardiomegaly or pulmonary venous congestion but is not diagnostic for arch obstruction, and routine labs should include a blood gas to assess acidosis and lactate [^517d4aff] [^025150c3] [^0a346a2f] [^e4a05edf].

> Hold on, I should verify the reliability of four-limb blood pressure in neonates before I interpret any gradient. Normal neonates can have arm-to-leg differences up to about 20 mmHg due to measurement variability, so a gradient greater than 20 mmHg is suspicious but not diagnostic for coarctation, and echocardiography remains the gold standard. If pulses are absent, that clinical finding overrides subtle BP gradients and mandates urgent cardiology imaging [^8ddebc73] [^3fa8ac58].

> I need to ensure I do not anchor on sepsis alone. While sepsis workup is appropriate, the combination of absent pulses and respiratory distress in a newborn should trigger immediate consideration of duct-dependent systemic obstruction and prostaglandin therapy without waiting for cultures, because every hour of delay increases the risk of end-organ injury and circulatory collapse [^c5219ff0].

> Let me think about immediate management steps and confirm dosing. I should start prostaglandin E1 at 0.05–0.1 mcg/kg/min, secure airway and provide respiratory support as needed, establish two reliable IV lines, begin inotropic support such as dopamine or epinephrine if there is shock, correct acidosis, and arrange urgent transfer to a pediatric cardiac center. If the infant is already intubated, I should avoid excessive PEEP that can compromise venous return in a duct-dependent circulation [^c5219ff0] [^0727c8b6].

> But wait, what if the echocardiogram shows total anomalous pulmonary venous return with obstruction rather than an arch anomaly. In that scenario, the respiratory distress is from pulmonary venous hypertension and edema, and the murmur is often inconspicuous. Management still requires urgent surgical consultation and stabilization, but prostaglandin will not help and could worsen pulmonary edema by increasing shunt, so I should confirm the anatomy with echo before escalating prostaglandin if the clinical picture does not fit classic coarctation [^74ebe953].

> I should double-check for pitfalls in pulse oximetry interpretation. A preductal–postductal saturation difference greater than about 3% is abnormal and should prompt cardiology evaluation, but in duct-dependent systemic obstruction the saturations may be similar if the right arm is also perfused via collaterals or if there is mixed venous desaturation from shock, so I must integrate the whole clinical picture and not rely on oximetry alone to exclude critical disease [^517d4aff] [^f17d93ba].

> In summary, I need to act on the triad of respiratory distress, absent murmur, and absent pulses as critical congenital heart disease until proven otherwise. Immediate stabilization, prostaglandin if duct-dependent systemic obstruction is suspected, and emergent echocardiography are the cornerstones, while remembering that the absence of a murmur does not reassure in this context and that delays in recognizing duct-dependent lesions can be catastrophic [^c5219ff0] [^3fa8ac58] [^1770ae33].

---

This constellation — respiratory distress, absent murmur, and absent blood pressure in the left arm and leg with preserved right arm pressure — is most consistent with **coarctation of the aorta** (CoA) or an **interrupted aortic arch** (IAA), both critical left-sided obstructive lesions that present with shock and respiratory distress when the ductus closes [^3fa8ac58] [^c5219ff0]. The absent murmur is not reassuring in neonates, as severe obstruction may be silent [^1770ae33]. Immediate **echocardiography** is required to confirm the diagnosis and guide urgent prostaglandin E1, inotropic support, and transfer to a pediatric cardiac center for definitive repair [^c5219ff0] [^3fa8ac58].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The key differentials for a neonate with respiratory distress, absent murmur, and absent left-sided pulses include:

| **Diagnosis** | **Pathophysiology** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) | Narrowing of the aortic arch distal to the left subclavian, causing upper-body hypertension and lower-body hypoperfusion | - Respiratory distress from heart failure <br/> - Absent or weak femoral pulses <br/> - Right arm BP > lower extremity BP by > 20 mmHg <br/> - Murmur may be absent in severe cases [^3fa8ac58] [^99557d83] |
| Interrupted aortic arch (IAA) | Complete discontinuity of the aortic arch, requiring ductal flow to the lower body | - Severe respiratory distress and shock <br/> - Absent femoral pulses <br/> - Murmur often absent <br/> - Metabolic acidosis [^c5219ff0] |
| Critical aortic stenosis | Severe LV outflow obstruction with low cardiac output | - Respiratory distress <br/> - Weak pulses <br/> - Murmur may be soft or absent <br/> - ECG: LV hypertrophy [^notfound] |
| Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) | Underdeveloped left heart with duct-dependent systemic flow | - Cyanosis <br/> - Respiratory distress <br/> - Weak pulses <br/> - Murmur often absent [^notfound] |

---

Given the absent left arm and leg pulses with preserved right arm pressure, **CoA or IAA is most likely**, as both classically produce differential perfusion with upper-extremity hypertension and lower-extremity hypotension [^3fa8ac58] [^99557d83].

---

## Pathophysiology

In CoA or IAA, the aortic obstruction reduces antegrade flow to the lower body; when the ductus arteriosus closes, lower-body perfusion drops, causing shock, metabolic acidosis, and respiratory distress from pulmonary edema. The murmur may be absent because turbulent flow is limited by low cardiac output and high pulmonary vascular resistance in the newborn [^1770ae33].

---

## Clinical evaluation

- **Vital signs**: Document preductal (right arm) and postductal (lower extremity) blood pressures; a systolic gradient > 20 mmHg is suspicious for CoA [^99557d83].
- **Pulses**: Palpate femoral, popliteal, and dorsalis pedis pulses; absent or delayed femoral pulses with strong brachial pulses support CoA/IAA [^3fa8ac58].
- **Respiratory exam**: Tachypnea, retractions, nasal flaring, and grunting indicate respiratory distress from heart failure or pulmonary edema [^0727c8b6].
- **Cardiac exam**: Murmur may be absent; listen for a soft systolic ejection murmur or a single S2, and assess for gallop or rub [^1770ae33].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Echocardiography**: Gold standard to define arch anatomy, gradient, associated lesions (e.g. VSD, bicuspid aortic valve), and ventricular function [^3fa8ac58] [^c5219ff0].
- **Electrocardiography**: May show right ventricular hypertrophy from systemic hypertension or LV hypertrophy in critical aortic stenosis.
- **Chest radiography**: Cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema may be present but are nonspecific [^e4a05edf].
- **Pulse oximetry**: Preductal-postductal saturation differences may be subtle or absent in isolated CoA; not reliable for screening in this context [^6f719894].

---

## Immediate management

- **Stabilization**: Secure airway, provide oxygen, establish IV/IO access, and start prostaglandin E1 (0.05–0.1 mcg/kg/min) to maintain ductal patency and restore lower-body perfusion [^c5219ff0].
- **Inotropic support**: Add dopamine or epinephrine if shock persists despite prostaglandin [^notfound].
- **Transfer**: Urgent transfer to a pediatric cardiac center for definitive surgical or catheter intervention [^3fa8ac58].

---

## Prognosis

Early diagnosis and intervention yield excellent outcomes; delayed recognition risks end-organ injury, NEC, and mortality. Long-term surveillance for recurrent obstruction, hypertension, and neurodevelopmental outcomes is essential [^3fa8ac58].

---

This presentation is most consistent with **coarctation of the aorta or interrupted aortic arch**. Immediate echocardiography and initiation of prostaglandin are critical to restore perfusion and prevent circulatory collapse [^c5219ff0].

Heart murmurs are common in healthy infants, children, and adolescents. Although most are not pathologic, a murmur may be the sole manifestation of serious heart disease. Historical elements that suggest pathology include family history of sudden cardiac death or congenital heart disease, in utero exposure to certain medications or alcohol, maternal diabetes mellitus, history of rheumatic fever or Kawasaki disease, and certain genetic disorders. Physical examination should focus on vital signs; age-appropriate exercise capacity; respiratory or gastrointestinal manifestations of congestive heart failure; and a thorough cardiovascular examination, including features of the murmur, assessment of peripheral perfusion, and auscultation over the heart valves. Red flags that increase the likelihood of a pathologic murmur include a holosystolic or diastolic murmur, grade 3 or higher murmur, harsh quality, an abnormal S2, maximal murmur intensity at the upper left sternal border, a systolic click, or increased intensity when the patient stands. Electrocardiography and chest radiography rarely assist in the diagnosis. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist is recommended for patients with any other abnormal physical examination findings, a history of conditions that increase the likelihood of structural heart disease, symptoms suggesting underlying cardiac disease, or when a specific innocent murmur cannot be identified by the family physician. Echocardiography provides a definitive diagnosis and is recommended for evaluation of any potentially pathologic murmur, and for evaluation of neonatal heart murmurs because these are more likely to be manifestations of structural heart disease.

The finding of a cardiac murmur on the initial newborn examination is common but may be a source of anxiety for practitioners due to worries about missing critical congenital heart defects (CHDs). This article aims to provide an approach to this common finding, in particular, reviewing the evidence base behind features of the history, examination and subsequent non-specialist investigations which may increase the likelihood of CHDs. The aim of this structured approach is to give clinicians confidence in dealing with this common clinical finding, to be able to pick out those infants most at risk of having critical CHDs.

### Management of asymptomatic cardiac murmurs in term neonates [^e381383c]. Pediatric Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Approximately 2% of newborn infants are noted to have cardiac murmur on routine postnatal examination. Our aim was to look at current evidence and practice in the management of asymptomatic cardiac murmur in term neonates. We performed a systematic literature review and a telephone survey of all neonatal units in the United Kingdom (UK). The systematic review of the literature did not support the routine practice of four-limb blood pressure (BP), chest X-ray (CXR), and electrocardiogram (ECG) in the assessment of asymptomatic cardiac murmur in term neonates. The survey had participation from 132 (68%) of 193 neonatal units in the UK. In an asymptomatic term neonate with cardiac murmur, 124 (94%) units perform pulse oximetry, 100 units (76%) measure four-limb BP, 36 units (27%) perform a CXR, and 52 units (39%) perform an ECG. Eight-six units (65%) have availability of in-house echocardiography services provided mainly by paediatricians with cardiology interest in special care units and neonatologists in neonatal intensive care units. Currently there is wide variation in practice in the management of asymptomatic cardiac murmur in term neonates. There is no evidence to support the routine use of four-limb BP, CXR, and ECG in the assessment of asymptomatic cardiac murmur in term neonates. Based on the evidence available, both structured clinical examination (including determining presence and quality of bilateral femoral pulses) and universal use of pulse oximetry are most important in identifying CHD in asymptomatic term neonates with cardiac murmur before discharge home.

Congenital heart disease — history, symptoms, and signs indicating pediatric echocardiography include cyanosis, failure to thrive, exercise-induced chest pain or syncope, respiratory distress, murmurs, congestive heart failure, abnormal arterial pulses, or cardiomegaly; these may suggest categories of structural congenital heart disease including intracardiac left-to-right or right-to-left shunts, obstructive lesions, regurgitant lesions, transposition physiology, abnormal systemic or pulmonary venous connections, conotruncal anomalies, coronary artery anomalies, functionally univentricular hearts, and other complex lesions, including abnormal laterality (heterotaxy/isomerism), and abnormalities on other tests (fetal echocardiography, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, chromosomal analysis) also prompt targeted echocardiographic assessment.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: how to spot serious heart disease in the newborn [^1770ae33]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is common and important as it remains a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and appreciable mortality. Prenatal diagnosis, the presence of a murmur, cyanosis, tachypnoea and/or poor or differential peripheral pulses raise the suspicion of CHD aided by differential pre/postductal saturations. Yet even serious CHD may not be considered when such clues are absent. Nevertheless, there are clinical cues which may alert the clinician to the possibility of a significant CHD which may lead to an early and accurate diagnosis and appropriate intervention to achieve best results. This paper addresses these issues which become especially difficult if caring for infants away from facilities provided by tertiary centres. Tachypnoea on the first postnatal day is generally non-cardiac in origin. Exceptions include large arteriovenous fistulae and/or 'pump' (ventricular) failure. In addition, attention is drawn to two important confounding factors in the newborn, namely the patency of the ductus arteriosus and the initially high pulmonary vascular resistance, both of which alter and may mask the clinical findings of a serious cardiac abnormality. An appreciation of the physiological changes that occur in early infancy will aid the clinician's understanding of CHD as it affects the newborn.

### Congenital heart disease diagnosed with echocardiogram in newborns with asymptomatic cardiac murmurs: a systematic review [^92f863a7]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first systematic review to evaluate the usefulness of Echo for the diagnosis of CHD among newborns with ANCM. We found that approximately 1% of the cohort from the included studies had ANCM, and more than one third were diagnosed as having CHD using Echo. Moreover, the incidence of cardiac murmurs was influenced by the frequency and time of examination as well as the experience and skills of the physicians. Initial screening for murmurs was performed before the first discharge in most of the studies. In the study by Rein et al. cardiac auscultations were performed daily. The level of expertise of the physicians who performed the initial assessments varied (i.e. pediatric residents to neonatologists). Initial cardiac evaluations for newborns consisted of cardiac auscultation, obtaining family history of CHD, and screening with a pulse oximeter, the last of which was added in 2012. Primary cardiac murmur evaluations and Echo were performed simultaneously, except in one outpatient clinic-based study. Regardless of low diagnostic potential, electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, and four-limb blood pressure measurements were performed as additional assessment methods for cardiac murmurs in four studies. In this systematic review, Echo was performed by pediatric cardiologists in all but one study, in which Echo was performed by a neonatologist.

### Variability of four limb blood pressure in normal neonates [^8ddebc73]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the variation in blood pressure (BP) between limbs in normal neonates. To assess whether comparison of arm and leg BP in neonates is reproducible enough to allow the difference to raise suspicion of coarctation of the aorta.

Methods

Infants recruited from the postnatal wards and the postnatal murmur clinic underwent echocardiography and BP measurement in each limb using a Dinamap Compact T 482210. The method of BP measurement was guided by a telephone survey of 40 UK neonatal units.

Results

Forty healthy neonates underwent echocardiography and all had a normal aortic arch. BP was measured in 39. In three, BP in the arms was 20 mm Hg higher than in the legs. This gave a specificity of comparison of the upper and lower limb BPs of 92 (36/39) or a false positive rate of 8% (3/39). The standard deviation in BPs was 15.7 mm Hg between arms, 14.5 mm Hg between legs, and 11 mm Hg when the nearest arm and leg were compared.

Conclusions

With current measurement techniques, normal neonates may have a wide variation in BP between limbs. A difference of 20 mm Hg in isolation is more likely to be due to random variability in measurement than to coarctation of the aorta. If coarctation of the aorta is suspected, it can only be excluded or confirmed by echocardiography.

### Heart murmurs in children: evaluation and management [^dd24d35d]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Up to 8.6% of infants and 80% of children have a heart murmur during their early years of life. The presence of a murmur can indicate conditions ranging from no discernable pathology to acquired or congenital heart disease. In infants with a murmur, physicians should review the obstetric and family histories to detect the possibility of congenital heart pathologies. Evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist is indicated for newborns with a murmur because studies show that neonatal murmurs have higher rates of pathology than in older children, and neonatal murmur characteristics are more difficult to evaluate during examination; referral is preferred over echocardiography. All infants, with or without a murmur, should have pulse oximetry screening to detect underlying critical congenital heart disease. In older children, most murmurs are innocent and can be followed with serial examinations if there are no findings of concern. Findings in older children that warrant referral include diastolic murmurs, loud or harsh-sounding murmurs, holosystolic murmurs, murmurs that radiate to the back or neck, or signs or symptoms of cardiac disease. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist is indicated when a pathologic murmur is suspected. Electrocardiography, chest radiography, and other tests should not be reflexively performed as part of all murmur evaluations because these tests can misclassify a murmur as innocent or pathologic, and they are not cost-effective. Emerging technologies include phonocardiography interpretation of murmurs and artificial intelligence algorithms for differentiating innocent from pathologic murmurs.

### Newborn respiratory distress [^0727c8b6]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Newborn respiratory distress presents a diagnostic and management challenge. Newborns with respiratory distress commonly exhibit tachypnea with a respiratory rate of more than 60 respirations per minute. They may present with grunting, retractions, nasal flaring, and cyanosis. Common causes include transient tachypnea of the newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, meconium aspiration syndrome, pneumonia, sepsis, pneumothorax, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, and delayed transition. Congenital heart defects, airway malformations, and inborn errors of metabolism are less common etiologies. Clinicians should be familiar with updated neonatal resuscitation guidelines. Initial evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination. The clinician should monitor vital signs and measure oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry, and blood gas measurement may be considered. Chest radiography is helpful in the diagnosis. Blood cultures, serial complete blood counts, and C-reactive protein measurement are useful for the evaluation of sepsis. Most neonates with respiratory distress can be treated with respiratory support and noninvasive methods. Oxygen can be provided via bag/mask, nasal cannula, oxygen hood, and nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Ventilator support may be used in more severe cases. Surfactant is increasingly used for respiratory distress syndrome. Using the INSURE technique, the newborn is intubated, given surfactant, and quickly extubated to nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Newborns should be screened for critical congenital heart defects via pulse oximetry after 24 hours but before hospital discharge. Neonatology consultation is recommended if the illness exceeds the clinician's expertise and comfort level or when the diagnosis is unclear in a critically ill newborn.

### Clinical practice guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^025150c3]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Neonatal blood pressure (BP) measurement — technique and cuff sizing — should follow normative assessments in the right upper arm with the infant supine; the cuff bladder length should encircle 80% to 100% of the arm circumference and a width‑to‑arm circumference ratio of 0.45 to 0.55 is recommended. Oscillometric devices used in neonates should be validated and programmed with an initial inflation value appropriate for infants (generally ≤ 120 mm Hg). Auscultation becomes feasible once the infant's upper arm can accommodate the smallest auscultatory cuff; measurements are best when the infant is calm, and multiple readings may be needed if the first is inadequate.

Targeted neonatal echocardiography in NICUs — patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature neonates: Suggestive clinical concerns include murmur, bounding pulses with active precordium, wide pulse pressure, hypotension and/or metabolic acidosis during transition, worsening ventilation and efficacy of oxygenation, pulmonary hemorrhage, and screening to detect clinically silent large PDA in high-risk patients (< 27 wk gestational age). Specific goals are to confirm diagnosis, evaluate PDA size, shunt direction, and flow pattern, and evaluate signs of shunt magnitude.

### The management of respiratory distress in the moderately preterm newborn infant [^752da1d7]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2011). Low credibility.

Respiratory distress in a moderately preterm baby often presents diagnostic and management challenges to the attending paediatrician. Many of these babies will require little or no intervention, but it is known that early intervention in babies with acute respiratory distress often prevents further complications. Most current research evidence relates to extremely preterm newborns, yet moderately preterm infants are numerically far more common. This article explores the differential diagnosis of respiratory distress in this population and presents an evidence based approach to treatment.

### When pneumonia does not respond to antibiotics: a challenging neonatal diagnosis [^74ebe953]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical examination findings may not be obvious or specific. Synchronisation of the aortic and pulmonary components of the second heart sound (S2), culminating in a loud, single S2 may occur with obstructed TAPVC, while hepatomegaly may be marked in the obstructed infracardiac subtype. Conversely, unobstructed TAPVC may be associated with exaggerated splitting of the S2 (A2 — P2) with a loud P2 and tricuspid flow murmur, all reflecting volume and pressure loading of the right heart.

Several routine investigations may raise the index of suspicion for TAPVC. A chest X-ray will routinely be performed in the infant with respiratory distress. Pulmonary venous congestion in the absence of cardiomegaly is compatible with obstructed TAPVC and gets worse with time, while in non-obstructed cases, pulmonary oedema with a dilated right atrium and right ventricle (resulting in marked cardiomegaly) is observed. A blood gas taken from an umbilical venous catheter (UVC) may appear erroneously saturated (but should not be dismissed) and may be a subtle clue to the presence of infracardiac TAPVC. As a rightward QRS axis is the norm in early neonatal life, a 12-lead ECG provides little useful supplementary information (box 5).

### The newborn examination: part I. emergencies and common abnormalities involving the skin, head, neck, chest, and respiratory and cardiovascular systems [^6c8dd485]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The routine newborn assessment should include an examination for size, macrocephaly or microcephaly, changes in skin color, signs of birth trauma, malformations, evidence of respiratory distress, level of arousal, posture, tone, presence of spontaneous movements, and symmetry of movements. A newborn with one anatomic malformation should be evaluated for associated anomalies. Total and direct bilirubin levels should be measured in newborns with jaundice, and a complete blood count should be obtained in those with pallor or a ruddy complexion. Neurosurgical consultation is necessary in infants with craniosynostosis accompanied by restricted brain growth or hydrocephalus, cephaloceles, or exophytic scalp nodules. Neck masses can be identified by their location and include vascular malformations, abnormal lymphatic tissue, teratomas, and dermoid cysts. Most facial nerve palsies resolve spontaneously. Conjunctivitis is relatively common in newborns. Infants with chest abnormalities may need to be evaluated for Poland's syndrome or Turner's syndrome. Murmurs in the immediate newborn period are usually innocent and represent a transition from fetal to neonatal circulation. Because cyanosis is primarily secondary to respiratory or cardiac causes, affected newborns should be evaluated expeditiously, with the involvement of a cardiologist or neonatologist.

### Blood pressure screening for critical congenital heart disease in neonates [^6f719894]. Pediatric Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Pulse oximetry (POx) screening for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) in neonates is less effective in identifying aortic arch obstruction than in detecting other forms of CCHD. This study was performed to assess the use of neonatal blood pressure (BP) screening to detect CCHD. A retrospective review of BP and POx measurements performed at the age of 24 h or before discharge in asymptomatic term neonates was undertaken. The charts of infants readmitted younger than 30 days with a diagnosis of CCHD also were reviewed to identify infants with a missed diagnosis. The screening process was completed for 10,012 of 10,436 infants. Because of an abnormal initial result, 164 neonates required a repeat screening (139 due to abnormal BP). A total of 12 infants failed the BP screening component, and 1 infant failed both the BP and Pox components. The average final right arm-to-leg BP gradient was 25 mmHg in these 13 babies. For nine infants, CCHD was excluded by echocardiography. Three patients were normal at their 1-year well-child exam, and one patient was lost to follow-up evaluation. No infants were identified who had been discharged home with a missed diagnosis of CCHD. Neonatal BP screening to detect CCHD was responsible for more inappropriately performed screenings, repeated screenings, and screening failures than the POx component of the screening protocol and had a highest possible positive predictive value of 1 in 13. These data suggests that BP screening at the time of routine newborn hospital discharge is of limited value in the detection of unrecognized CCHD.

### Neonatal respiratory distress: a practical approach to its diagnosis and management [^a12e3b5d]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Respiratory disorders are the most frequent cause of admission to the special care nursery both in term and preterm infants. Pediatricians and primary care providers may encounter newborn infants with respiratory distress in their office, emergency room, delivery room, or during physical assessment in the newborn nursery. The authors have proposed a practical approach to diagnose and manage such infants with suggestions for consulting a neonatologist at a regional center. Their objective is that practicing pediatricians should be able to assess and stabilize such infants, and transfer to or consult a neonatologist, cardiologist, or pulmonologist after reading this article.

Introduction

Baby girl C was born at 41 +2 weeks, weighing 2.8 kg, by vaginal delivery after induction of labour. This was the 24-year-old mother's first pregnancy, which was uncomplicated, with normal routine antenatal scans and serology. Her membranes ruptured 17 h prior to delivery: liquor was clear and there was no maternal peripartum pyrexia.

After delivery, initial bradycardia responded rapidly to airway manoeuvres and intermittent positive pressure ventilation, and the Apgar score was 10 at 10 min.

The baby was given to her mother and had her first breast feed. There were no concerns and mother and baby were transferred to the postnatal ward.

The routine newborn examination at 8 h of age revealed a pink baby with warm peripheries and easily felt peripheral pulses. There were no signs of respiratory distress. No added heart sounds or murmurs were heard on auscultation and the baby was declared fit for discharge. Pulse oximetry screening was not performed.

The newborn check is completed to confirm the fitness of a baby for discharge and to screen for congenital abnormalities, specifically, developmental dysplasia of the hip, congenital cataracts, cryptorchidism and congenital heart disease (CHD).

In 2005, a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) review of newborn screening for CHD concluded that the current system performs poorly, but that pulse oximetry screening may provide a promising adjunct to clinical examination alone. In the HTA model, only 32% of babies with life-threatening CHD would be diagnosed by clinical examination alone.

There is good evidence to explain why the routine newborn examination is suboptimal in identifying all cases of CHD. Half the babies in the postnatal ward with CHD have no distinctive murmur, while cyanosis may be difficult to detect clinically, particularly in non-Caucasian ethnic groups.

### When pneumonia does not respond to antibiotics: a challenging neonatal diagnosis [^f17d93ba]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2014). Low credibility.

Routine pulse oximetry screening can detect cases of critical CHD missed by antenatal ultrasonography and newborn examination, and thus by preventing circulatory collapse has potential benefits for neonatal mortality and long-term morbidity. As of now there is no national protocol for pulse oximetry screening of newborns, but one possible method is suggested here (box 1).

Box 1
Proposed method of routine saturation measurement, based on American Academy of Paediatrics algorithm: Screening for Critical Congenital Heart Defects

Screening should be performed at the time of the routine newborn examination. Variation in the length of inpatient stay for mother and baby will necessitate a pragmatic approach to the time of screening.
Probe should be placed sequentially on either foot (postductal), and on the right hand (preductal). There is data to suggest that measuring preductal and postductal saturations can increase detection of congenital heart disease. A preductal and postductal difference of > 3% should be considered abnormal.
Baby should be awake but not struggling, and have regular breathing
Record for at least 2 min
Oxygen saturations should be ≥ 95%
Saturations of 90–94% should prompt a paediatric assessment and a repeat measurement in 4–6 h.
Saturations below 90% should prompt a paediatric assessment and admission for further investigation, including echocardiography.

On the postnatal ward at 14 h of age, the midwife called the paediatrician to review the baby due to poor feeding. The mother reported the baby had not fed well since birth and did not want to suckle at the breast or bottle, though she had passed urine and meconium.

On examination, the baby was grunting and had intercostal recession with nasal flaring. Observations revealed a temperature of 37.5°C with a heart rate of 140 bpm and respiratory rate of 70 breaths per minute. No murmur was heard and the femoral pulses were easily palpable. Abdominal examination was unremarkable with no hepatomegaly. Tone was normal and the anterior fontanelle soft.

### Respiratory distress of the term newborn infant [^ad6828b4]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Respiratory distress is recognised as any signs of breathing difficulties in neonates. In the early neonatal period respiratory distress is common, occurring in up to 7% of newborn infants, resulting in significant numbers of term-born infants being admitted to neonatal units. Many risk factors are involved; the increasing number of term infants delivered by elective caesarean section has also increased the incidence. Additionally the risk decreases with each advancing week of gestation. At 37 weeks, the chances are three times greater than at 39–40 weeks gestation. Multiple conditions can present with features of respiratory distress. Common causes in term newborn infants include transient tachypnoea of the newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, meconium aspiration syndrome, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate and pneumothorax. Early recognition of respiratory distress and initiation of appropriate treatment is important to ensure optimal outcomes. This review will discuss these common causes of respiratory distress in term-born infants.

### Diagnosis, imaging and clinical management of aortic coarctation [^3fa8ac58]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a well-known congenital heart disease (CHD), which is often associated with several other cardiac and vascular anomalies, such as bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus and aortic arch hypoplasia. Despite echocardiographic screening, prenatal diagnosis of C o A remains difficult. Most patients with CoA present in infancy with absent, delayed or reduced femoral pulses, a supine arm-leg blood pressure gradient (> 20mm Hg), or a murmur due to rapid blood flow across the CoA or associated lesions (BAV). Transthoracic echocardiography is the primary imaging modality for suspected CoA. However, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred advanced imaging modality for non-invasive diagnosis and follow-up of CoA. Adequate and timely diagnosis of CoA is crucial for good prognosis, as early treatment is associated with lower risks of long-term morbidity and mortality. Numerous surgical and transcatheter treatment strategies have been reported for CoA. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice in neonates, infants and young children. In older children (> 25kg) and adults, transcatheter treatment is the treatment of choice. In the current era, patients with CoA continue to have a reduced life expectancy and an increased risk of cardiovascular sequelae later in life, despite adequate relief of the aortic stenosis. Intensive and adequate follow-up of the left ventricular function, valvular function, blood pressure and the anatomy of the heart and the aorta are, therefore, critical in the management of CoA. This review provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art clinical diagnosis, diagnostic imaging algori thms, treatment and follow-up of patients with CoA.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Coarctation of the aorta — clinical features and examination of unrepaired adults emphasize upper–lower extremity blood pressure differences, pulse delays, and characteristic murmurs. Hypertension is described in the right arm relative to the legs unless there is an anomalous right subclavian artery, and a pulse delay between the right arm and femoral or popliteal arteries may be present. Murmurs or bruits can be heard in the left interscapular area or over parasternal regions due to collaterals, and auscultation should assess for findings suggesting bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, or aortic regurgitation (AR).

The imaging evaluation of the neonate in respiratory distress has been described since the most early days of pediatric radiology but advances in diagnosis and treatment have changed the patient population presenting with these conditions and altered the imaging findings. In this article, the range of conditions that cause neonatal respiratory distress is depicted, including congenital lung malformations and lung disease in both preterm and full-term infants. An updated approach to the imaging of these conditions is reviewed, with a focus on changes that have resulted from advances in treatment and diagnosis.

Synthesis of screening for CHD

Table 2 shows a summary of the initial and additional cardiac evaluations performed in each study. In most of the studies, the first cardiac evaluations were performed within five days of birth by pediatricians. Since 2012, screening newborns using a pulse oximeter has become standard practice. Except in one study, additional assessments using Echo were performed by a pediatric cardiologist during the neonatal period before discharge (an additional assessment using Echo performed in an outpatient setting was excluded). Additionally, some studies used chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and four-limb blood pressure to further evaluate cardiac murmurs.

Incidence of ANCM and CHD according to the type of cardiac murmurs

From the eight studies, the incidence of ANCM ranged from 0.6 to 8.6%, and the CHD incidence among infants with ANCM ranged from 2.6 to 74.1% (Table 3). We evaluated CHD incidence according to cardiac murmur designation in three studies. The incidence of CHD in newborns with pathologic murmurs was higher than in those with benign or possible pathologic murmurs.

### Is routine preoperative 2-dimensional echocardiography necessary for infants with esophageal atresia, omphalocele, or anorectal malformations? [^a50c106d]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Infants with esophageal atresia (EA), omphalocele, and anorectal malformation (ARM) often have associated congenital heart disease. Recognition of significant cardiac defects, which compromise patient well-being in the perioperative period, is essential before going to the operating room. However, urgent echocardiography may be unavailable, and surgery may therefore be delayed in some cases. We wished to determine if routine echocardiography is necessary for neonates with these diagnoses, or if appropriate patients could be selected.

Methods

Retrospective review of all infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with EA, omphalocele, or ARM for 5 years (2003–2008). Clinically relevant findings in the cardiovascular examination (murmur, tachycardia, abnormal 4 limb blood pressure, cyanosis, shock), abnormalities in respiratory examination (intubation, tachypnea, desaturations), or abnormal chest x-ray (cardiomegaly, abnormal pulmonary vasculature) were documented. Cardiac defects were categorized according to their clinical impact as major or minor to differentiate those disorders which may influence timing of surgical intervention.

Results

Eighty-six infants were identified (33 EA, 21 omphalocele, 32 ARM). Thirty-seven (42.9%) patients had congenital heart disease on echocardiography evaluation, of which 11 (12.7%) were classified as major and 26 (30.2%) were minor. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of abnormal clinical and radiologic combined assessment for a major cardiac defect were 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76–1), 64% (95% CI, 0.61–0.64), 28% (95% CI, 0.22–0.29), and 100% (95% CI, 0.94–1.00), respectively.

Conclusions

Normal clinical and radiologic examination predicted absence of a significant cardiac abnormality on echocardiography in 100% of cases. We conclude that routine echocardiography before embarking on surgical intervention may not always be necessary but should be reserved for infants with abnormal clinical and/or radiologic findings.

### Neonatal murmurs: are senior house officers good enough? [^5ab0a2cf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2003). Low credibility.

Aim

To show that, given appropriate guidelines, senior house officers (SHOs) have the clinical skills required to assess neonatal murmurs.

Methods

Neonatal SHOs identified babies with a cardiac murmur at routine neonatal examination. The SHOs assessed whether the murmur was significant or innocent and decided between immediate further assessment or echocardiogram as an outpatient.

Results

A total of 112 babies had murmurs at routine neonatal examination. The incidence of cardiac murmurs was 13.8 per 1000. Twelve babies were referred for immediate further assessment. Eleven had structurally abnormal hearts. One had a normal heart with pulmonary hypoplasia. One hundred babies were referred, and 78 attended for outpatient follow up. Of these, the SHO assessed nine babies as having a significant murmur and 69 as having an innocent murmur. Twenty two babies failed to attend for follow up; all were thought to have innocent murmurs. Of the nine murmurs assessed as significant, four were confirmed as such and five were found to be innocent. Of the 91 murmurs assessed as innocent, 63 were proven to be innocent, six had abnormalities on echocardiogram, and 22 defaulted to follow up. Five of the serious murmurs were small ventricular septal defects, which had resolved by 6 months of age; the other had mild pulmonary stenosis. None of these babies were clinically symptomatic at outpatient review.

Conclusion

Given appropriate guidelines, SHOs have the skills to assess the significance of, and decide on appropriate management for, neonatal murmurs. Electrocardiograms and chest radiographs are not necessary.

### Can cardiologists distinguish innocent from pathologic murmurs in neonates? [^a0d785cd]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical assessment of murmurs in neonates, as performed by pediatric cardiologists, and to identify clinical features that predict the presence of congenital heart disease (CHD) in this population.

Study Design

Neonates (n = 201) referred for outpatient evaluation of a heart murmur were enrolled consecutively. After a clinical evaluation, the cardiologist documented whether the murmur was "likely innocent" or "likely pathologic". The cardiologist repeated his/her assessment after an electrocardiogram. Echocardiography served as the gold standard.

Results

The median age was 12 days (range, 2–31 days). CHD was present in 113 of 201 (56%). Clinical assessment alone identified patients with CHD with a sensitivity of 80.5% (95% CI, 73.2–87.8), specificity of 90.9% (95% CI, 84.9–96.9), positive predictive value of 91.9% (95% CI, 86.6–97.3), and negative predictive value of 78.4% (95% CI, 70.4–86.4). The addition of an electrocardiogram did not improve these test characteristics. Features that were predictive of CHD were murmur quality (P < .0001), location (P = 0.02), and timing (P = 0.04). No patients requiring catheter or surgical intervention were missed by clinical assessment.

Conclusions

The prevalence of CHD in this referral population was high. Clinical assessment detected all complex CHD, although some simple lesions were missed. Murmur quality, location, and timing were predictive of CHD.

Study selection

Study selection was independently decided by two reviewers based on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion among the reviewers. Any remaining disagreements were referred to a third author to achieve a consensus. In addition, study selection included two screening levels. The two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified studies. Subsequently, the investigators retrieved the articles identified by the reviewers for full-text review. Thereafter, the reviewers assessed the reports to ensure that they met the inclusion criteria.

Identification of relevant studies

Figure 1 shows a flow diagram of how the relevant studies were identified. In total, 825 studies were identified by searching four databases and manually searching relevant bibliographies: In total, 786 studies were identified by searching 4 databases and manually searching relevant bibliographies as follows: 182 studies from MEDLINE, 128 from EMBASE, 100 from Cochrane Library, 376 from Web of Science, and 39 by manual searching. We excluded 156 duplicate studies and 610 studies that did not satisfy the inclusion criteria and/or met the exclusion criteria. After reviewing the full texts of the remaining 20 studies, eight studies were further excluded for the following reasons: participants included symptomatic newborns (n = 4) or preterm infants (n = 4) (Additional file 2). Thus, a total of 12 studies were included in the analysis.

Data extraction and screening methods

Two reviewers independently identified potential studies and extracted detailed information from each article according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 6 and the PRISMA screening process (Fig. 1).

The extracted data included indexing information about the article, such as the first author's name, year of publication, and country where the study was performed; study design; clinical setting; total number of participants; patient demographic information, such as sex and mean age; and findings from initial screenings for CHD, additional examinations for CHD, and echocardiograms. For ANCM, the measured outcome varied among studies. The following designations of abnormal cardiac sounds were extracted from the studies: benign murmurs, possible pathologic murmurs, and pathologic murmurs.

Figure 27.
Volume rendered image of an ascending to descending aortic conduit from anterior (left) and lateral (right) views to repair a coarctation utilizing gadolinium enhanced 3D imaging by CMR.

If not detected prenatally or with pulse oximetry screening, neonates with coarctation of the aorta may present in clinical distress with significant metabolic acidosis and respiratory failure at the time of ductal closure. The lesion may be ductal dependent, requiring prostaglandin infusion and other supportive measures for resuscitation and survival of the patient until more definitive treatment can be undertaken. Accurate detailed diagnosis is essential prior to any intervention. Echocardiography is the first line imaging modality and may be all that is needed in infants with simple coarctation or associated intracardiac defects. If portions of the aorta proximal or distal to the coarctation or branching vessels are not well visualized, CMR can provide full anatomical details and may be superior to echocardiography.

Coarctation may also present later in childhood or early adulthood, usually in the setting of referral for hypertension or heart murmur and diminished lower extremity pulses. Depending on the age of the patient, chest X-ray may demonstrate rib notching such as when significant large collateral vessels may be present. When a native coarctation of the aorta is first diagnosed in an older child or adult by echocardiography, CMR is then used to define the anatomical and hemodynamic severity in preparation for treatment by surgery or in the cardiac cath lab. Echocardiography may demonstrate the unusual arch anatomy and abnormal Doppler flow patterns through the obstruction, but due to limited acoustic windows, may not allow for full visualization of the coarctation or its proximal and distal segments, aortic arch branching abnormalities, or the presence and magnitude of associated collateral vessels which are all important pieces of clinical information to aid in determining the appropriate method of intervention.

Very low birth weight newborn — blood pressure monitoring limitations are noted for invasive and noninvasive methods. With intra-arterial monitoring, "The absence or distortion of the dichrotic notch should suggest dampening of the waveform and erroneous readings," and "risks such as painful insertion (with a peripheral arterial line), infection, the introduction of emboli, and formation of thrombus are considerations when using these lines." For cuffs, "The accuracy of noninvasive cuff BP readings can be confounded by the size and fit of the cuff on the infant's limb, the infant's position (prone or supine), and the infant's state of arousal," and "Moreover, cuff BP readings are not continuous."

### Respiratory distress in the newborn | AAFP… [^c94e7551]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of respiratory distress in the newborn includes apnea, cyanosis, grunting, inspiratory stridor, nasal flaring, poor feeding, and tachypnea. There may also be retractions in the intercostal, subcostal, or supracostal spaces. Respiratory distress occurs in approximately 7 percent of infants. Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn Transient tachypnea of the newborn is the most common cause of neonatal respiratory distress, constituting more than 40 percent of cases. 1 A benign condition, it occurs when residual pulmonary fluid remains in fetal lung tissue after delivery. Prostaglandins released after delivery dilate lymphatic vessels to remove lung fluid as pulmonary circulation increases with the first breath. When fluid persists despite these mechanisms, transient tachypnea of the newborn can result. Risk factors include maternal asthma, 2 male sex, macrosomia, maternal diabetes, 3 and cesarean delivery.

The clinical presentation includes tachypnea immediately after birth or within two hours, with other predictable signs of respiratory distress. Symptoms can last from a few hours to two days. Chest radiography shows diffuse parenchymal infiltrates, a "wet silhouette" around the heart, or intralobar fluid accumulation 5.

### Congenital heart disease diagnosed with echocardiogram in newborns with asymptomatic cardiac murmurs: a systematic review [^f0e437e5]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review selected CHD evaluated the usefulness of Echo in identifying CHD in newborn babies with ANCM. No systematic review has yet reported on the incidence of CHD or echocardiographic outcomes in newborns with ANCM.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The inclusion criteria for published studies in this review were based on the PICOT (population/patient, intervention, comparison, outcome, and time) study design questions according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were included if they met the following criteria:
included newborns with asymptomatic cardiac murmurs diagnosed by health professionals using echocardiogram,
CHD was determined based on initial screening and additional screening methods, such as physical exam, family history, and echocardiogram performed by physicians,
study designs included all kinds of clinical trials, such as prospective and retrospective cohort studies, observational studies, case control studies, and case reports, that explored the differential diagnosis from ANCM to CHD based on first and second screenings in full term newborns.

The following studies were excluded: animal studies; reviews, comments, editorials, conference abstracts or papers, letters, and notes; studies without a specified number of cases, that did not perform echocardiogram, or that included symptomatic patients; cases of preterm newborn babies or babies > 28 days old; and studies not in English.

Search strategy

We searched the literature published before 4 March 2019. No restrictions were imposed in terms of publication language, time, or status. We did not restrict publication date because we aimed to maximize the number of potential studies included. Electronic database searches used both free text queries and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases, we performed a systematic review of publications reporting CHD diagnosed with Echo in newborns with cardiac murmurs. Moreover, a grey literature search strategy was adapted, as appropriate, other than the major databases in order for data retrieval as many as possible with the study objectives. The goal of the search strategy was to retrieve all relevant articles related to the topic. For management of the searched literature, Endnote version X7 (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY) was used. The details of the search strategies used are provided as an appendix to this review (Additional file 1).

### The neonatal chest X-ray [^e4a05edf]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

The chest X-ray is the most valuable imaging modality in the assessment of the neonate with respiratory distress. Whilst many of the radiological appearances are relatively non-specific, integration of the clinical features with the X-ray appearances will help the clinician arrive at the correct diagnosis in most cases. In a minority of infants, particularly those with a congenital malformation of the chest or airways other imaging modalities may be required. This paper will describe the radiological appearances of the most important causes of neonatal respiratory distress and highlight those situations where more complex investigations are necessary.

### Respiratory distress in the newborn [^7d7c7581]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The most common etiology of neonatal respiratory distress is transient tachypnea of the newborn; this is triggered by excessive lung fluid, and symptoms usually resolve spontaneously. Respiratory distress syndrome can occur in premature infants as a result of surfactant deficiency and underdeveloped lung anatomy. Intervention with oxygenation, ventilation, and surfactant replacement is often necessary. Prenatal administration of corticosteroids between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation reduces the risk of respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn when the risk of preterm delivery is high. Meconium aspiration syndrome is thought to occur in utero as a result of fetal distress by hypoxia. The incidence is not reduced by use of amnio-infusion before delivery nor by suctioning of the infant during delivery. Treatment options are resuscitation, oxygenation, surfactant replacement, and ventilation. Other etiologies of respiratory distress include pneumonia, sepsis, pneumothorax, persistent pulmonary hypertension, and congenital malformations; treatment is disease specific. Initial evaluation for persistent or severe respiratory distress may include complete blood count with differential, chest radiography, and pulse oximetry.

### Congenital heart disease diagnosed with echocardiogram in newborns with asymptomatic cardiac murmurs: a systematic review [^3d1f97bc]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Recently, Echo is being widely used for heart anatomy imaging and cardiac function evaluation in newborns with normal cardiac structure; thus, guidelines for the use of Echo in newborns with ANCM are warranted. In this systematic review, cardiac murmurs were the most common abnormal findings after physical examinations in newborns and we found that > 37% of newborns with ANCM had moderate to severe CHD diagnosed using Echo. Thus, Echo is a useful non-invasive tool for the detection of cardiac problems in newborns with cardiac murmurs and is an easy diagnostic procedure for CHD. Our study suggests that utilization of Echo in newborns with ANCM would be helpful in early CHD detection, which could in turn improve clinical outcomes.

### Beyond the usual suspects: neonatal fever and desaturation [^5dff26c4]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

A 1‐month‐old infant presenting with fever, dyspnea and desaturation poses a significant diagnostic challenge. The patient in question is notably fragile, with underdeveloped immune functions and the potential for developmental defects that have not yet been detected.

The diagnostic challenge is further intensified in cases where the child is an immigrant, born as a result of an unmonitored pregnancy, born prematurely and with low birth weight. The attending physician must act quickly while carefully untangling the complicated web of different possible diagnoses.

### Newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease: a new algorithm and other updated recommendations: clinical report [^517d4aff]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) newborn screening algorithm — updates specify that the lower limit of an acceptable oxygen saturation "should be ≥ 95% in BOTH the pre- AND post-ductal measurements," because allowing saturation "to be 95% in either the right arm OR a lower extremity can lead to confusion and misinterpretation," and that "there should be only 1 retest for indeterminate results, instead of 2." Modeling data indicate that removing the second retest has "a minimal effect on the false-positive rate," and the changes "simplify the screening process" and "would not be expected to decrease the sensitivity of screening," with the possibility that "the revised algorithm may potentially increase the screen's sensitivity"; modifying the threshold requirement "does not have a clinically significant effect on retesting rates."

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) — diagnostic testing features detail that on clinical examination, "If the PDA is moderate or large, the presence of a continuous machinery-type murmur, heard best at the left infraclavicular area, and increased pulses are almost diagnostic." When pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is present, "only a systolic murmur may be heard," and "A wide pulse pressure is present when the PDA is large and there is a large left-to-right shunt." In a large ductus with PAH, "the oxygen saturation in the upper and lower extremities may be helpful in diagnosis of a large PDA with right-to-left shunt at the ductal level." The electrocardiogram (ECG) "may be normal if the ductus is small or may show left atrial enlargement and LV hypertrophy" with left-to-right shunt, and "RV hypertrophy may be present if there is PAH." Echocardiography "with color Doppler in the parasternal short-axis view is diagnostic of a PDA," and although Doppler can estimate pressure, "in cases of significant elevation of PVR, echocardiography may not be diagnostic, and cardiac catheterization and angiography may be indicated." Chest x-ray "may or may not show cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings," with signs that "may point to the presence of a significant PDA," and calcification suggests rupture risk. During catheterization, it is important to evaluate shunt and PVR, angiography can define ductal anatomy, and "the PDA can be treated in the catheterization laboratory," while "CT scan or MRI of the chest usually are not necessary to diagnose a PDA."

### Congenital heart disease diagnosed with echocardiogram in newborns with asymptomatic cardiac murmurs: a systematic review [^b3cb7d8c]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Among the included studies, only one study described an algorithm in which Echo was performed in all newborns with pathologic murmurs regardless of symptoms and in some newborns with innocent murmurs present > 48 h after birth. Cardiac murmur is the most common reason for referral to a cardiologist and shows a relatively higher Echo diagnostic yield than other indications, such as palpitation or chest pain. Moreover, abnormal echocardiographic findings are most frequently observed within the first year of life among pediatric patients with cardiac murmurs. Although Echo is the gold standard for the diagnosis of CHD and is easily accessible in developed countries, there is no consensus on whether to use Echo in newborns with ANCM. Nevertheless, a few physicians have performed Echo in full term newborns with ANCM. Although there are issues with cost-effectiveness and technical accessibility, Echo is currently widely used, even in the NICU, by neonatologists. New approaches for the utilization of Echo in newborns with ANCM are warranted.

Early diagnosis and timely management of CHD in newborns are critical to improve clinical outcomes. With the increase in artificial fertilization and preterm births, CHD incidence is expected to increase in the future. A thorough cardiac evaluation with careful auscultation before hospital discharge should be performed to screen for CHD. Because accuracy of the assessment of pathologic murmurs varies among physicians, a stepwise approach to evaluating cardiac murmurs is required. Considering the difficulties in distinguishing pathologic murmurs from innocent murmurs in newborns, the use of Echo in newborns with ANCM is recommended to prevent further cardiac complications. If access to Echo is limited, early referral to a pediatric cardiologist may be another option.

All studies included in this review were observational studies. A meta-analysis was impossible because of the study designs. However, this systematic review applied a comprehensive and structured search strategy to four different databases. Two reviewers independently performed quality assessment, thereby reducing selection and publication bias.

### Major heart defects: the diagnostic evaluations of first-year-olds [^a3238687]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most frequently observed congenital defects in the human population, representing up to 40% of all congenital malformations. The incidence of CHD varies from 4 to 50 cases per 1000 live births, but when minor ventricular septal defects are also included, the incidence rises to 75 cases per 1000 live births. The aetiology of CHDs is complex, with genetic and environmental factors known to play a part. Indeed, most defects likely have an underlying multifactorial aetiology. Approximately 20–25% of CHDs have a precise genetic cause. Most CHDs can be prenatally detected, and the overall success of prenatal CHD diagnoses has generally improved. Foetal echocardiography displays high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of major CHDs. However, some children are born with prenatally undetected CHDs that are diagnosed only after birth. Of the total number of CHDs, 35% are considered severe or critical, and these defects can be health- and life-threatening. Therefore, it is crucial to diagnose these defects as soon as possible. Symptoms of heart disease may develop slowly or very rapidly and worsen in the maternity hospital or at home. In critical and severe CHDs, the most common symptom is the development of hypoxemia and heart failure. In other defects, the most common symptoms are pulmonary symptomatology, failure to thrive, or murmur. CHDs have an incidence of 2–75 per 1000 live births. Moreover, although the association between the first CHD manifestations and the different stages of childhood is less frequently studied, this information is very important for paediatricians.

Thus, the aim of this work was to identify clinical symptoms and determine the individual risk periods for CHD manifestation.

Assessment, resuscitation, and care of the newborn infant immediately after birth — As recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Heart Association, there should be 2 care providers present at every birth, at least 1 with primary responsibility for the newborn, and of the 2 care providers at least 1 should have training, skills, and equipment to perform full resuscitation in accordance with the Neonatal Resuscitation Program. Temperature, heart rate, skin color, peripheral circulation, respiration, level of consciousness, tone, and activity should be monitored and recorded at least once every 30 minutes until the infant's condition has remained stable for 2 hours. Infants who receive extensive resuscitation (eg, positive-pressure ventilation for more than 30 to 60 seconds) should be transferred to a medical facility for close monitoring and evaluation, and any infant with respiratory distress, continued cyanosis, or other signs of illness should be immediately transferred to a medical facility.

### Congenital heart disease diagnosed with echocardiogram in newborns with asymptomatic cardiac murmurs: a systematic review [^7dc40356]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death in newborns. CHD prevalence in newborns has increased globally, especially in Asia, from 0.6 per 1000 live births to 9.410 per 1000 live births, according to several recent reports. Despite antenatal screening processes using fetal echocardiogram (Echo), more than 50% of newborns with CHD are unrecognized at birth. As undiagnosed CHD can lead to life-threatening cardiovascular collapse and cardiac arrest, which are the primary causes of death in infants, screening newborns' cardiac health is vital.

Cardiac assessments, including physical examinations, have been performed for newborns after birth; however, the use of Echo for diagnosing CHD, especially in newborns with asymptomatic, non-syndromic cardiac murmurs (ANCM), has been a subject of debate. Echo, which pediatricians use to evaluate heart function, uses sound waves to produce pictures of the movement of different parts of the heart; thus, it has become the gold standard for diagnosis of CHD in pediatric patients with cardiac murmurs and its use has expanded with advances in technology. Almost all pediatricians agree with performing Echo for newborns with cardiorespiratory symptoms, such as cyanosis and tachypnea; chromosome abnormalities, including Down syndrome; or other non-cardiac anomalies to rule out CHD. The appropriate criteria for the use of Echo in children and adolescents with cardiac murmurs are well established; however, guidelines for the use of Echo in newborns with ANCM have not yet been reported. Cardiac murmurs are commonly found in newborns and are one of the major signs of potential CHD. Moreover, pediatric cardiac murmur is the primary reason for referral and further evaluations. Therefore, CHD detection in newborns with ANCM is necessary for early diagnosis and timely treatment.

Recently, it has become easy to implement Echo in neonatal care. Previous studies reported variable CHD incidence in newborns with ANCM; however, there is no consensus on the use of Echo for early detection of CHD in newborns with ANCM. In this systematic review, we aimed to identify the incidence of CHD diagnosed with Echo and determine whether Echo should be used in the proper management of CHD in newborns with ANCM.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Problems and pitfalls — key considerations in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD)–related pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are that patients with severe ACHD-related PAH do not have loud murmurs on auscultation because the RV pressure is similar to the LV pressure and associated anomalies such as PS should be excluded; all potential triggers for PAH, including noncongenital cardiac triggers, should be sought and therapies for noncongenital triggers should be maximized; diagnosis and therapy hinge on accurate and definitive cardiac catheterization with additional imaging modalities often of assistance; oxygen-responsive hypoxemia may occur and should be treated; and pregnancy is contraindicated in women with CHD-PAH.

### Congenital heart disease diagnosed with echocardiogram in newborns with asymptomatic cardiac murmurs: a systematic review [^facdfd35]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

More than 50% of newborns with congenital heart disease (CHD) are unrecognized at birth; however, the use of echocardiogram (Echo) for diagnosing CHD in newborns with asymptomatic, non-syndromic cardiac murmurs (ANCM), has not been systematically reviewed yet. We aimed to identify the incidence of CHD diagnosed with Echo and systematically review whether Echo should be recommended in this patient group.

Methods

The methodology utilized in this systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses framework. Using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases, we performed a systematic review of publications reporting CHD diagnosed with Echo in newborns with cardiac murmurs. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Study Quality Assessment Tools developed by the National Institutes of Health.

Results

Of the 630 studies screened, six cohort studies, four cross-sectional studies, and two case reports were included in this review. The incidence of cardiac murmurs ranged from 0.6–8.6%. Among the 1928 newborns with ANCM, 719 (37.3%) were diagnosed with Echo as having CHD, and ventricular septal defect was the most common congenital malformation. More than 50% of the newborns showed moderate CHD necessitating outpatient cardiology follow-up, and 2.5% had severe CHD requiring immediate interventions, such as cardiac catheterization and heart surgery.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, a high incidence of CHD in newborns with ANCM was detected using Echo. This indicates that the use of Echo for diagnosing CHD in healthy newborns with cardiac murmurs could be helpful in earlier detection of CHD, thereby improving clinical outcomes for newborns with severe CHD.

Ebstein's anomaly — clinical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and chest x-ray features: Patients with mild disease may show minimal findings other than a murmur; the jugular venous pressure is often normal even with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) due to a large compliant right atrium, central cyanosis may occur from a right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or atrial septal defect (ASD), the first sound is loud with 1 or more systolic clicks, and the murmur of TR is holosystolic at the lower left sternal border and increases on inspiration. Characteristic ECG findings include very tall and peaked P waves ("Himalayan P waves"), a QR pattern often seen in lead V1 that may extend to V4, and QRS duration that is usually prolonged with a right bundle-branch block pattern that is often "splintered," followed by inverted T waves. Chest x-ray may be nearly normal in mild cases but in more severe cases shows severe enlargement, with right atrial enlargement prominent with a "globular" cardiac contour and clear lung fields, and the great arteries are usually small with an aortic root that is inconspicuous or absent.

Tricuspid atresia/single ventricle — presentation and clinical examination note that those with no prior operation or with only a systemic-to–pulmonary artery shunt or cavopulmonary shunt can present with cyanosis, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, complete AV block, stroke, worsening exercise ability, bacterial endocarditis, or thromboembolism. Patients who have not had a Fontan operation usually will have cyanosis, clubbing, increased precordial activity, and a single S2; murmurs may include continuous murmurs of aortopulmonary shunts, systolic murmurs of AV valve regurgitation, systolic murmurs of LV or RV outflow obstruction, and diastolic murmurs of semilunar valve regurgitation. Those with ventricular dysfunction may have an S3, jugular venous distention, and hepatomegaly; brachial pulses may be absent on the side of a prior Blalock-Taussig shunt and in the left arm after a subclavian flap procedure for coarctation; scoliosis is common.

Synthesis of echocardiographic outcomes

Of the 1928 asymptomatic newborns with cardiac murmurs who underwent Echo and were included in our study, 719 (37.3%) were diagnosed as having CHD. We classified CHD into four categories according to the anatomical region that produced the murmur: shunt lesions, right side heart lesions, left side heart lesions, and connection lesions (Table 4). Among the newborns with CHD, 56.5% had shunt lesions. The most common CHD was ventricular septal defect (VSD).

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^6682d11b]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Right-sided heart failure (RHF) physical examination — patients with severe RHF may appear emaciated, tachypneic, and cyanotic, and typically have elevated jugular venous pressure with a prominent V wave from tricuspid regurgitation (TR); atrial fibrillation is common. Increased jugular venous pressure with inspiration (Kussmaul sign) may also be seen with a noncompliant right ventricle (RV). The abdominojugular reflex test, defined as a sustained rise of > 3 cm in the jugular venous pressure for at least 15 seconds with calm spontaneous respiration, may unmask subtle venous hypertension. For RHF secondary to pulmonary hypertension (PH), a prominent pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) may be heard, whereas in congenital heart disease (CHD) P2 may be soft or even absent when there is a structural or postsurgical abnormality of the pulmonic valve (PV). A low-amplitude holosystolic murmur of TR may be present, the Carvallo sign may distinguish TR from mitral regurgitation, and in repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) a to-and-fro murmur of combined pulmonic stenosis (PS) and insufficiency may occur at the upper left sternal border with radiation to the lungs.

### Role of pulse oximetry in examining newborns for congenital heart disease: a scientific statement from the AHA and AAP [^ea8e1c9a]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this statement is to address the state of evidence on the routine use of pulse oximetry in newborns to detect critical congenital heart disease (CCHD).

Methods and Results

A writing group appointed by the American Heart Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics reviewed the available literature addressing current detection methods for CCHD, burden of missed and/or delayed diagnosis of CCHD, rationale of oximetry screening, and clinical studies of oximetry in otherwise asymptomatic newborns. MEDLINE database searches from 1966 to 2008 were done for English-language papers using the following search terms: congenital heart disease, pulse oximetry, physical examination, murmur, echocardiography, fetal echocardiography, and newborn screening. The reference lists of identified papers were also searched. Published abstracts from major pediatric scientific meetings in 2006 to 2008 were also reviewed. The American Heart Association classification of recommendations and levels of evidence for practice guidelines were used. In an analysis of pooled studies of oximetry assessment performed after 24 hours of life, the estimated sensitivity for detecting CCHD was 69.6%, and the positive predictive value was 47.0%; however, sensitivity varied dramatically among studies from 0% to 100%. False-positive screens that required further evaluation occurred in only 0.035% of infants screened after 24 hours.

Conclusions

Currently, CCHD is not detected in some newborns until after their hospital discharge, which results in significant morbidity and occasional mortality. Furthermore, routine pulse oximetry performed on asymptomatic newborns after 24 hours of life, but before hospital discharge, may detect CCHD. Routine pulse oximetry performed after 24 hours in hospitals that have on-site pediatric cardiovascular services incurs very low cost and risk of harm. Future studies in larger populations and across a broad range of newborn delivery systems are needed to determine whether this practice should become standard of care in the routine assessment of the neonate.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: neonatal hypertension [^2b3dc523]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Neonatal hypertension is a rare but well recognised condition, especially in newborns needing invasive monitoring in the intensive care unit. Recognition of newborns with hypertension remains challenging because of natural variability in blood pressure with postconceptional age and the lack of reference data for different gestational ages. Investigation of neonates with hypertension can be challenging in light of the myriad differing aetiologies. This may be simplified by a systematic approach to investigation. There remains a relative paucity of data to guide the use of pharmacological therapies for hypertension in neonates. Clinicians rely on empirical management protocols based on experience and expert opinion. Much of the information on dosing regimens and protocols has simply been derived from the use of antihypertensive agents in older children and in adults, despite fundamental pathophysiological differences.

Conclusion

In conclusion, murmur and cyanosis are the most common manifestations of prenatally undetected CHDs. Except for prenatally undiagnosed critical and severe defects, some cases with a persistent arterial ductus required operational solution, and cardiac symptoms were caused by persistent foetal circulation. Cyanotic lesions were diagnosed significantly earlier than defects with heart murmur. The majority of children with major heart defects were diagnosed as neonates.

### Respiratory distress in an infant: an uncommon cause for a Common complaint [^f19039a2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Respiratory distress and tachycardia are common presenting complaints in infants and young children, and evaluation typically focuses on respiratory infections. Tachydysrhythmias causing heart failure are rare and can be difficult to diagnose in young children, but are reversible if recognized and treated early.

Case Report

We discuss a 7-week-old female infant who presented with respiratory distress and persistent tachycardia. Evaluation revealed severe cardiac dysfunction with an underlying atrial flutter discovered on electrocardiography after adenosine administration. Rate control by synchronized electrocardioversion resulted in resolution of symptoms and restoration of cardiac function, confirming the diagnosis of atrial flutter-induced cardiomyopathy. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Persistent or inappropriate tachycardia in a young child should not be dismissed and underlying dysrhythmia should be considered.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) clinical presentation — Symptoms are non-specific and mainly related to progressive right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, with initial symptoms typically triggered by exertion and including shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, angina and syncope; less commonly patients describe dry cough and exercise-induced nausea and vomiting, while symptoms at rest occur only in advanced cases and abdominal distension and ankle oedema mainly develop with progressing RV failure. Physical signs include left parasternal lift, an accentuated pulmonary component of the second heart sound, an RV third heart sound, a pansystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation and a diastolic murmur of pulmonary regurgitation; in advanced disease elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, ascites, peripheral oedema and cool extremities are seen, and wheeze and crackles are usually absent. Clinical examination may suggest an underlying cause of PH, with telangiectasia, digital ulceration and sclerodactyly seen in scleroderma, inspiratory crackles pointing towards interstitial lung disease, spider naevi, testicular atrophy and palmar erythema suggesting liver disease, and when digital clubbing is encountered PVOD, cyanotic CHD, interstitial lung disease or liver disease should be considered.

### Congenital heart disease diagnosed with echocardiogram in newborns with asymptomatic cardiac murmurs: a systematic review [^163f7a8e]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

CHD incidence varied greatly among the studies, which could be attributable to CHD prevalence variations between different countries. Information on antenatal ultrasound screening for CHD according to the country where the study was conducted was not available. Only one study reported that the lower CHD incidence in their study compared to previous studies could be attributed to active prenatal detection of most of the major and critical cases of CHD. The incidence of CHD among full term newborns with ANCM found in this systematic review (37.3%) was much higher than the updated prevalence of CHD at birth. Among the subtypes of CHD, shunt lesions such as VSD, atrial septal defect (ASD), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) were most frequently observed, which is consistent with the worldwide prevalence of CHD at birth.

With regard to the severity of CHD in newborns, three studies classified CHD severity as follows: mild, moderate, and severe. Of the 267 newborns with CHD in the three studies, 3.4% were diagnosed as having severe CHD and thus required immediate interventions, such as heart surgery or interventional catheterization, before hospital discharge. In this systematic review, even though acyanotic severe heart diseases, such as large VSD, ASD, and PDA as well as critical aortic or pulmonary stenosis, were not included, 2.5% had severe CHD. The majority of the newborns had moderate CHD requiring outpatient cardiology follow-up.

Cardiac murmurs heard in the first few days of life are mostly associated with physiologic variants, such as peripheral pulmonary stenosis, and typically disappear within 3 to 6 months of life. Cardiac murmurs due to CHD are more easily auscultated after the decrease in pulmonary resistance that occurs after several weeks of life. Nevertheless, we observed a high CHD incidence in the included studies that performed initial cardiac evaluations within five days of life. Generally, pathologic murmurs that are described as louder than 2/6 in intensity, diastolic, and pansystolic and are associated with rubs, clicks, or gallops are relevant to CHD; however, we observed that CHD includes not only pathologic murmurs but also innocent murmurs, such as ANCM. While pathologic murmurs are associated with a higher CHD incidence, newborns with innocent murmurs showed a CHD incidence rate of 0.6–70%.

### Screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^6c86730a]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests for pediatric hypertension — Best practice is to measure blood pressure by auscultation of the upper right arm with an appropriately sized cuff at 3 different visits, and some organizations suggest that the diagnosis should be confirmed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), which uses portable devices that record blood pressure measurements at regular intervals (usually every 20 to 30 minutes) over 12 to 24 hours; the right arm is preferred in children because standardized blood pressure tables reflect right arm readings.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^6d63443f]. Neonatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, more specifically with respect to surfactant therapy, indications, respiratory distress syndrome, ECG-RDS 2023 guidelines recommend to administer rescue surfactant early in the course of the disease.
Consider administering surfactant in worsening infants with respiratory distress syndrome with FiO2 requirements > 0.30 on CPAP ≥ 6 cmH₂O or if lung ultrasound suggests surfactant need.

### Clinical practice guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^99557d83]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Secondary causes — cardiac, including coarctation: Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital abnormality of the aortic arch characterized by discrete narrowing of the aortic arch, generally at the level of the aortic isthmus; it is usually associated with HTN and right arm BP that is 20 mm Hg (or more) greater than the lower extremity BP, and repair in infants is often surgical while adolescents may be treated with angioplasty or stenting.

### Oxygen saturation as a screening test for critical congenital heart disease: a preliminary study [^1fc331e6]. Pediatric Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the utility of arm and leg oxygen saturation as a candidate screening test for the early detection of ductal-dependent left heart obstructive disease. We measured arm and leg oxygen saturation in 2876 newborns admitted to well baby nurseries and 32 newborns with congenital heart disease. Fifty-seven newborns in the well baby nurseries (0.02%) had an abnormal test (leg saturation less than 92% in room air or 7% lower saturation in the leg than in the arm). Four of the 57 had critical congenital heart disease, including 1 with coarctation of the aorta. Of the 32 newborns with congenital heart disease, 11/13 (85%) with left heart obstructive disease had abnormal oxygen saturation tests, as did 15/19 (79%) with other forms of congenital heart disease. Pulse oximetry deserves further study as a screening test for critical congenital heart disease.

### Crouzon syndrome: association with absent pulmonary valve syndrome and severe tracheobronchomalacia [^b205041f]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2002). Low credibility.

Airway obstruction is common among patients with craniosynostosis. We describe an infant with a clinical and genetic diagnosis of Crouzon syndrome who presented with respiratory distress and heart murmur in early neonatal life. Cardiac evaluation revealed absent pulmonary valve syndrome. She needed intubation at age 1 month, and repeated trials of extubation failed because of marked respiratory distress, stridor, and severe expiratory obstruction and wheezing. Correction of her cardiac anomaly did not relieve her respiratory distress; only after endobronchial stenting and tracheostomy was it possible to gradually wean her from mechanical ventilation. This case report demonstrates and discusses the different causes of airway obstruction in Crouzon syndrome and the morbidity and mortality that can result from pulmonary involvement in this craniosynostotic syndrome. It also demonstrates the difficult therapeutic challenge created by the combination of cardiopulmonary abnormalities in Crouzon patients.
