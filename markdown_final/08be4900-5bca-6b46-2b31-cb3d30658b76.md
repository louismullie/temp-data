## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how acute inflammatory responses manifest when lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, or macrophages predominate, and what clinical and pathological patterns distinguish these scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core immunology of each leukocyte subset and its typical kinetics in acute inflammation. Then, I should verify exemplar diseases where each cell type predominates and extract the clinical and histopathologic signatures. Next, I will synthesize comparative patterns and highlight overlaps and exceptions. Finally, I will consider diagnostic implications and note any caveats where the literature is conflicting or evolving, ensuring I anchor each point to appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the foundational framework: acute inflammation is a coordinated, time-dependent recruitment of innate and adaptive cells, with neutrophils typically arriving early, followed by monocytes that differentiate into macrophages, and lymphocytes arriving later to shape adaptive responses. This sequence underpins why different diseases show different predominant infiltrates depending on timing and pathogenesis [^8caab9a0].

> Now, I will examine lymphocyte-predominant acute inflammation. Wait, let me verify the exemplars: viral myocarditis and pericarditis, autoimmune hepatitis, and certain drug-induced liver injuries show T-cell–rich infiltrates, while COVID-19 ARDS features profound lymphopenia systemically but can show dense interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates in the lung, and Japanese encephalitis classically produces lymphocytic CSF pleocytosis. I should also remember that acute cellular rejection in heart and lung transplants is defined by mononuclear infiltrates, essentially lymphocytes and macrophages, which functionally sit in the lymphocyte-predominant spectrum even if not purely lymphocytic [^030ac059] [^6bcf373d] [^707442b2] [^3ed3b086] [^80f56ae6] [^6c19c995] [^74e1783b] [^d09659f4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about monocyte predominance. I need to check the canonical examples: COVID-19 severe disease is driven by a myeloid-centric hyperinflammation with classical monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages in the lung, and takotsubo syndrome shows a myocardial macrophage infiltrate with M1 polarization in the acute phase. Chronic granulomatous vasculitides like Takayasu arteritis also feature monocyte/macrophage–rich infiltrates, and in ischemic stroke, Ly6C-high monocytes dominate early recruitment and differentiate into macrophages that participate in both injury and repair. I should confirm that these patterns reflect both recruitment and local proliferation/differentiation of monocytes into macrophages [^e85fb3b3] [^464b1df2] [^8e2e1a56] [^c62967c4].

> Next, I should review neutrophil-predominant acute inflammation. Let me think about prototypical settings: bacterial pneumonia and sepsis, acute lung injury/ARDS of diverse etiologies, and acute pancreatitis all show abundant neutrophils with protease and ROS-mediated tissue injury. I should double-check that ARDS cohorts consistently show neutrophilia in BAL and that pancreatitis pathophysiology hinges on neutrophil-driven systemic inflammatory response with potential secondary infection risk [^15b0084f] [^6863b2ea].

> I will now examine macrophage-predominant patterns. But wait, what if macrophage richness simply reflects monocyte differentiation over time rather than a distinct starting point? That is often true, yet some entities show a particularly macrophage-rich histology in the acute window, such as necrotizing autoimmune myositis with macrophage-rich infiltrates and specific autoantibodies, and certain infectious granulomas where macrophage/histiocyte aggregates form early. I should confirm that these macrophage-predominant phenotypes still align with acute tissue injury even if the inflammatory wave began earlier with neutrophils or monocytes [^dc641038] [^26b3c710].

> Let me synthesize comparative patterns, and I need to ensure I capture both timing and pathogenesis. Lymphocyte-predominant acute inflammation often signals antigen-driven, T-cell–mediated processes such as viral infection, autoimmunity, or alloimmune rejection, with tissue injury mediated by cytotoxicity and cytokines rather than proteases. Monocyte/macrophage predominance reflects early innate amplification, phagocytosis, and cytokine storms, with M1 polarization linked to ongoing injury and M2 polarization emerging in resolution. Neutrophil predominance typifies early innate defense and sterile or infectious tissue injury with protease/ROS damage and NETs, often transitioning to macrophage-rich cleanup within days [^8caab9a0] [^464b1df2] [^e85fb3b3].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought COVID-19 ARDS was purely neutrophil-predominant, but I should correct that. Severe COVID-19 shows a myeloid-driven process with immature neutrophils and monocytes in blood and lung, alongside lymphopenia, so the lung infiltrate is mixed myeloid with a relative monocyte/macrophage predominance in some compartments rather than classic neutrophil-only alveolitis. This mixed myeloid pattern helps distinguish COVID-19 ARDS from classic bacterial ARDS in some analyses [^e85fb3b3] [^28789813].

> Next, I should review diagnostic implications so I don't overgeneralize. In interstitial lung disease, BAL lymphocytosis above 25% suggests granulomatous or cellular NSIP patterns, whereas BAL neutrophilia above 50% supports ARDS, aspiration, or suppurative infection. In liver disease, plasma cell–rich portal infiltrates point toward autoimmune hepatitis, while T-cell–predominant lobular hepatitis suggests drug-induced injury. In the heart, mononuclear infiltrates with myocyte damage define acute cellular rejection, whereas neutrophils should prompt consideration of ischemic injury or antibody-mediated rejection. In the CNS, lymphocytic pleocytosis supports viral or autoimmune meningitis, while neutrophils suggest bacterial disease. These cytologic anchors refine differential diagnoses when integrated with clinical context [^5661b485] [^707442b2] [^3ed3b086] [^74e1783b] [^6c19c995].

> I should double-check key caveats so we avoid misclassification. Timing matters: early neutrophilia may evolve into macrophage-rich inflammation within 48–72 hours. Chronic inflammatory milieus can alter acute recruitment, amplifying neutrophil influx via monocyte-derived signals. And some diseases straddle categories, like COVID-19 with concurrent lymphopenia and myeloid hyperactivation, or ischemic myocardium where healing infiltrates can mimic rejection. Thus, cell predominance must be interpreted alongside tempo, etiology, and tissue-specific patterns [^4d7e1a11] [^e85fb3b3] [^1ece0892].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical takeaways are precise: lymphocyte predominance flags antigen-driven, T-cell–mediated processes such as viral myocarditis, autoimmune hepatitis, drug hypersensitivity, and transplant rejection. Monocyte/macrophage predominance signals myeloid hyperinflammation as in COVID-19 ARDS, takotsubo myocarditis, and granulomatous vasculitides. Neutrophil predominance indicates early innate injury from infection, aspiration, or sterile insults with protease/ROS damage. Macrophage predominance often reflects monocyte differentiation in later phases or specific entities like necrotizing myositis. Recognizing these patterns guides targeted diagnostics and therapy, from immunomodulation in T-cell–mediated disease to myeloid-directed strategies in hyperinflammation [^030ac059] [^e85fb3b3] [^464b1df2] [^8caab9a0].

Acute inflammation shows distinct cellular patterns: **lymphocyte predominance** reflects viral or autoimmune processes (e.g. COVID-19, autoimmune hepatitis, viral myocarditis) [^80f56ae6] [^707442b2] [^030ac059]; **monocyte predominance** indicates monocyte-driven hyperinflammation (e.g. severe COVID-19, macrophage activation syndromes) [^e85fb3b3] [^d63a2017]; **neutrophil predominance** signals bacterial infection or sterile tissue injury (e.g. pneumonia, ARDS, pancreatitis) [^8caab9a0] [^6863b2ea]; and **macrophage predominance** reflects late-phase or chronic inflammation with tissue repair (e.g. granulomatous disease, chronic infections, fibrosis) [^26b3c710] [^c62967c4]. These patterns guide diagnosis and therapy by linking cell type to underlying mechanisms and disease course [^5661b485].

Clinical implications: lymphocyte predominance suggests **antigen-driven immunity**; therapies may target T/B cells or cytokines (e.g. corticosteroids, IVIG, biologics) [^c8e74553].

---

## Monocyte-predominant acute inflammation

Monocyte predominance reflects **innate hyperinflammation**, often with monocyte-derived macrophages and cytokine storms [^e85fb3b3].

- **Severe COVID-19**: Classical monocytes drive hypercytokinemia and organ damage; monocyte subsets are perturbed [^e85fb3b3] [^3b2564b7].
- **Macrophage activation syndromes**: Marked monocytosis and macrophage activation with hyperferritinemia and cytokine storm [^50ad5736].
- **Takayasu arteritis**: Large-vessel granulomatous inflammation with monocytes/macrophages and giant cells [^8e2e1a56].

Clinical implications: monocyte predominance signals **myeloid-driven hyperinflammation**; consider IL-1/IL-6 blockade, corticosteroids, or JAK inhibition [^9cb598c4].

---

## Neutrophil-predominant acute inflammation

Neutrophil predominance is the hallmark of **bacterial infection** and **sterile tissue injury**, with rapid recruitment and protease/ROS-mediated damage [^8caab9a0].

- **ARDS**: Neutrophil influx with hyaline membranes and diffuse alveolar damage [^notfound].
- **Acute pancreatitis**: Neutrophil-driven pancreatic and systemic inflammation with organ failure [^6863b2ea].

Clinical implications: neutrophil predominance indicates **bacterial infection** or **sterile injury**; treat with antibiotics, source control, and supportive care; consider neutrophil-targeted therapies in select contexts [^notfound].

---

## Macrophage-predominant acute inflammation

Macrophage predominance reflects **late-phase or chronic inflammation** with tissue repair, fibrosis, or granuloma formation [^c62967c4].

- **Granulomatous diseases**: Tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and leprosy show macrophage-rich granulomas with multinucleated giant cells [^notfound].
- **Chronic infections**: Histiocytic infiltrates with foamy macrophages are seen in chronic bacterial or fungal infections [^c62967c4].
- **Fibrosis**: M2 macrophages drive collagen deposition and fibrosis in lung, liver, and kidney [^24e56d37].

Clinical implications: macrophage predominance suggests **chronic or granulomatous disease**; consider antimicrobials, corticosteroids, or antifibrotic agents depending on etiology [^7d0da8b1].

### Leukocyte function in asthma and COPD… [^b258e468]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Leukocyte Function in Asthma and COPDClinicalTrials. gov ID
- Total Number of Inflammatory Cells Recovered in Sputum
- Sputum was induced via inhalation of hypertonic saline as previously described, and was processed for differential counts of inflammatory cells.
- Number of Matrix Metalloproteases MMP1.
- MMPs determined using paired antibody quantitative ELISAs The aim of this study is to examine the inflammatory mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung disease, in particular to compare the inflammatory profile seen in asthma and COPD. Evidence for inflammation in asthma and COPD is based on the finding of increased numbers of macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs and respiratory secretions of these patients. The inflammatory cells produce proteases, as well as, reactive oxidant species resulting in a protease/anti-protease imbalance which favours lung destruction.

The aim is to examine the inflammatory mediators released by inflammatory cells in order to determine whether there are differences between non-smoking subjects, smoking subjects and patients with asthma or COPD. Monocytes are precursors of alveolar macrophages, and both monocytes and neutrophils are recruited to the lung from the blood via the action of specific chemoattractants. We have evidence that in inflammation there are higher levels of these chemoattractants. Therefore these cells might also demonstrate the same changes seen in alveolar macrophages from these patients. We also aim to assess the role of the macrophage precursor and neutrophils in the blood. We will also assess lymphocyte/monocyte interaction. We will do this as the lymphocyte may be involved in the initial recruitment of inflammatory cells.

We will also assess the role of cytokines involved with monocyte/macrophage/neutrophil migration in induced sputum as well as the role of induced sputum in the migration of monocytes and neutrophils into the lung. Our aim is to link the initial changes in blood to the changes causing disease in the lungs. We aim to examine cellular responses in four groups of subjects, namely non-smoking controls, smokers without clinical evidence of COPD or asthma, smokers with COPD asthmatic patients.

### Outcomes of inflammatory bowel disease in patients with eosinophil-predominant colonic inflammation [^90b59a7b]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterised by acute intestinal mucosal inflammation with chronic inflammatory features. Various degrees of mucosal eosinophilia are present along with the typical acute (neutrophil-predominant) inflammation. The effect of intestinal eosinophils on IBD outcomes remains unclear.

Methods

This is a retrospective study. Archived intestinal mucosal biopsy specimens of treatment-naïve IBD patients were examined by two pathologists. The number of eosinophils per high-power field was counted, and the mucosal inflammation was classified according to the eosinophilic inflammatory patterns. Clinical outcomes during the follow-up period were recorded.

Results

142 treatment-naïve IBD patients were included. Mean age was 39 years. 83% of patients had ulcerative colitis, and median follow-up was 3 years. 41% of patients had disease flare(s) and 24% required hospitalisation. Eosinophil count was not associated with risk of disease flare or hospitalisation. Patients with neutrophil-predominant inflammation (> 70% neutrophils) had greater risk of disease flare(s): 27(55%) versus 24(36%) and 7(28%) in patients with mixed and eosinophil-predominant inflammation, respectively (p = 0.04). Overall, patients with neutrophil-predominant inflammation were more likely to have a disease flare; HR: 2.49, 95% CI (1.0 to 5.6). Hospitalisation rate was higher in patients with neutrophil-predominant inflammation: 17(35%) compared to 17(19%) in patients with eosinophil-rich inflammation (p = 0.04). Kaplan–Meier analysis showed higher flare-free survival in patients with eosinophil-predominant inflammation compared to mixed and neutrophil-predominant inflammation.

Conclusion

IBD patients with eosinophil-predominant inflammation phenotype might have reduced risk of disease flares and hospitalisation. Larger prospective studies to assess IBD outcomes in this subpopulation are warranted.

Chronic urticaria (CU) pathophysiology — cellular mediators and infiltrates are described as follows: Mast cells are the major histamine-releasing cells and can be increased in lesional skin; basophils are present with functional abnormalities in some patients; other inflammatory cells, often forming a predominantly lymphocytic mixed infiltrate, are common; and urticaria lesions can be triggered by IgE-mediated and non–IgE-mediated mechanisms.

Extensive evidence supports a pathogenic role for both local and systemic inflammation in acute coronary syndromes. However, several important questions remain unanswered. Is the observed inflammatory process a precursor or a consequence of coronary plaque rupture? Is the inflammatory component of unstable coronary disease a potential therapeutic target? Finally, do infectious agents have a pathogenic role in coronary atherosclerosis and acute coronary syndromes?

Figure 2
Autocrine macrophage activation. The hallmark of pathogenesis of macrophage activation syndrome, as can be seen in COVID-19, is the overproduction of IL-1β by tissues macrophages. IL-1β, as well as other proinflammatory cytokines, acts through autocrine stimulation on macrophages leading to a vicious cycle of cytokine production and hyperinflammation. gp130, glycoprotein 130; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; R, receptor; TLR, toll-like receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.

In a small fraction of septic patients, proinflammatory phenomena predominate and a more specific treatment might be associated with better outcomes.

IL-6 blockade is frequently administered to patients with cancer in the context of immune checkpoint-inhibitor-induced immune-related adverse events, particularly in steroid resistant ones, as well as to dampen cytokine-release syndrome which can complicate chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy. ICI-related pneumonitis and SARS-CoV-2 induced ARDS have overlapping features, sharing a clinical and radiological presentation. ICI-induced pneumonitis, cytokine release syndrome and viral ARDS result from uncontrolled severe acute inflammation. Acute lung injury results from inflammatory monocyte and macrophage activation in the pulmonary luminal epithelium which lead to a release of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-1 and TNF-α.

In addition to acute inflammation, IL-6 stimulates T cell proliferation and it has a critical role: it exerts a negative impact on the ability of pulmonary dendritic cells to prime naive T cells, thus downplaying the adaptive immune response. Corticosteroids are standard frontline therapy for ICI-induced pneumonitisand they have been tested in SARS-CoV-2 induced ARDS in order to suppress the cytokine storm. Their use remains controversial as they do not prolong survival. IL-1 blockade has been assessed data from a phase III randomized controlled trial of the anti-IL-1 monoclonal antibody, anakinra, in septic patients with features of MAS, showed significant survival benefit, without increased adverse events. Ongoing trials of cellular therapies for treatment of ARDS could be expanded to treatment of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cellular therapy using mesenchymal stromal cells from allogeneic donors is being evaluated in patients with ARDS, as it reduces non-productive inflammation and affects tissue regeneration (NCT02804945; NCT03608592).

### Inflammation and its resolution as determinants of acute coronary syndromes [^58d4955f]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Inflammation contributes to many of the characteristics of plaques implicated in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes. Moreover, inflammatory pathways not only regulate the properties of plaques that precipitate acute coronary syndromes but also modulate the clinical consequences of the thrombotic complications of atherosclerosis. This synthesis will provide an update on the fundamental mechanisms of inflammatory responses that govern acute coronary syndromes and also highlight the ongoing balance between proinflammatory mechanisms and endogenous pathways that can promote the resolution of inflammation. An appreciation of the countervailing mechanisms that modulate inflammation in relation to acute coronary syndromes enriches our fundamental understanding of the pathophysiology of this important manifestation of atherosclerosis. In addition, these insights provide glimpses into potential novel therapeutic interventions to forestall this ultimate complication of the disease.

### Revision of the 1990 working formulation for the standardization of nomenclature in the diagnosis of heart rejection [^14dce502]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2005). Medium credibility.

Acute cellular rejection — differential clues from inflammatory cells indicate that the presence of neutrophils (except in the most severe form of rejection) should raise the question of an alternative process such as healing ischemic injury, antibody-mediated (humoral) rejection or infection, and plasma cells are also not typically present in acute cellular rejection and suggest a Quilty lesion, healing ischemic injury (often in response to allograft coronary disease) or a lymphoproliferative disorder (plasmacytoid lymphocytes).

### Sex differences in autoimmune disease from a pathological perspective [^6828ea9b]. The American Journal of Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Autoimmune diseases affect approximately 8% of the population, 78% of whom are women. The reason for the high prevalence in women is unclear. Women are known to respond to infection, vaccination, and trauma with increased antibody production and a more T helper (Th)2-predominant immune response, whereas a Th1 response and inflammation are usually more severe in men. This review discusses the distribution of autoimmune diseases based on sex and age, showing that autoimmune diseases progress from an acute pathology associated with an inflammatory immune response to a chronic pathology associated with fibrosis in both sexes. Autoimmune diseases that are more prevalent in males usually manifest clinically before age 50 and are characterized by acute inflammation, the appearance of autoantibodies, and a proinflammatory Th1 immune response. In contrast, female-predominant autoimmune diseases that manifest during the acute phase, such as Graves' disease and systemic lupus erythematosus, are diseases with a known antibody-mediated pathology. Autoimmune diseases with an increased incidence in females that appear clinically past age 50 are associated with a chronic, fibrotic Th2-mediated pathology. Th17 responses increase neutrophil inflammation and chronic fibrosis. This distinction between acute and chronic pathology has primarily been overlooked, but greatly impacts our understanding of sex differences in autoimmune disease.

### A prognostic model incorporating relevant peripheral blood inflammation indicator to predict postherpetic neuralgia in patients with acute herpes zoster [^f3ad0aef]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Pain is the predominant clinical manifestation of HZ. The pain intensity during the acute phase is positively correlated with the severity of nerve injury, which directly influences PHN incidence. In this study, PHN incidence significantly differed between the high- and low-NRS-11 groups (50% vs 25%, P < 0.05). This indicated that acute phase NRS-11 is also a pivotal risk factor for PHN. A higher NRS-11 score usually indicates more reactivation of varicella zoster virus, which results in a more severe inflammatory response and nerve fiber damage, and then augments the PHN likelihood. Fujiwara et al further examined the association between pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale score ≥ 30) in the acute phase of HZ and PHN development, but no significant correlation was noted.

PHN primarily manifests as neuropathic pain, and its exact pathogenesis remains complex. Immune-mediated inflammation plays a crucial role in neuropathic pain development by generating nerve cell-damaging pro-inflammatory cytokines and molecules, thereby leading to persistent pain. The intricate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines regulates neuropathic pain development.

Several new composite parameters reflecting inflammatory indices including NLR, PLR, LMR, CAR, and SII have recently been used to evaluate the body's inflammatory response. These parameters have been considered novel, accurate inflammatory biomarkers in many chronic or acute inflammation-related diseases. In the present study, these inflammatory indices, along with traditional clinicopathological variables were subjected to univariate and multivariate analyses, ultimately revealing PLR as an independent risk factor for PHN. This is the first study identifying PLR as an inflammatory marker in HZ and underscoring its utility in PHN prediction. An elevated PLR indicates a relatively decreased lymphocyte, whereas increased platelet counts. Lymphocytes reflect cell-mediated adaptive immunity.T lymphocytes are the primary components of lymphocytes and account for 65–75% of the total lymphocytes in peripheral blood. In the HZ pathogenesis, the body's defense chiefly relies on cellular immune responses, and the T lymphocyte's function is pivotal in maintaining normal immune function.T lymphocytes decreased and immune function was impaired in HZ patients, which accelerated VZV reactivation and resulted in neuropathic pain. Platelets, a typical blood cell component, are produced by mature megakaryocytes in bone marrow responsible for the systemic inflammatory response and immune regulation in the body.

The role of biopsy

Although no formal guidelines are so far available, a biopsy of the bone lesion is usually performed, mainly to exclude other causes. In CNO bone biopsy shows signs of inflammation in the absence of infection. The composition of cellular infiltrates at the sites of inflammation is strictly correlated to the "age" of biopsied lesions. Neutrophils are predominant in early lesions, whereas lymphocytes, macrophages and plasma cells can be detected during the later course of the inflammatory. The final stage of the lesion is characterized by the predominance of fibrosis. The cultures of the biopsy are always negative.

Although histological findings are specific, the main role of the biopsy is to rule out malignancy such as histiocytosis, Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, leukemia and lymphoma. All these disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis of persistent bone pain in all age groups.

Recently, Jansson et al. proposed a clinical score that could facilitate the diagnosis and treatment process, especially with respect to the decision on whether to carry out invasive procedures required for diagnosis of these diseases. Even if the Jansson Score is not still widely validated, it is suggested that patients with a score > 39 could not undergo biopsy. Our practical approach is to perform a biopsy in all patients with poor general conditions, persistent and significant elevation of acute phase reactants and/or hematological abnormalities (anemia, alteration in leukocyte or platelet counts), and all those patients with unifocal or atypical (i.e. skull) bone involvement. In these cases, the biopsy may be performed in the most accessible lesion. On the contrary, the decision to perform the biopsy can be postponed in those patients with good general conditions, with slight elevation of acute phase reactants, involvement of multiple and/or typical and bone sites, typical radiological findings and favorable response to Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) treatment (Fig. 2). In any case, further studies are needed to clarify the role of biopsy; to now the decision to perform the biopsy remains a physician related decision based on his expertness and knowledge toward CNO diagnosis.

### Assessment of right ventricular function in the research setting: knowledge gaps and pathways forward. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^6c251410]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Assessment of inflammation in right ventricular failure (RVF) — rationale, current knowledge, gaps, and pathways forward: Inflammation is an integral contributor to the development of both acute and chronic RVF, and strategies aimed at decreasing RV inflammation may prevent or delay the progression from adaptive to maladaptive RV remodeling and result in improved outcomes; monitoring RV inflammation may serve as a "biomarker" of RV function and/or treatment response. Inflammation, among other processes, likely contributes to RV fibrosis and contractile dysfunction, with influx of inflammatory cells and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules observed rapidly (within 2 h) after onset of right ventricular pressure overload (RVPO), an influx of neutrophils and M1 macrophages in the RV outflow tract within 18 hours in animal pulmonary embolism (PE) models, and secretory M2 macrophages predominating 6 weeks after acute RVPO; in chronic RVPO, abundant proinflammatory cytokine expression is noted, although the degree of inflammation appears to be less than in RVF from acute RVPO. Key knowledge gaps include that whether inflammation is a cause or a consequence of RVF is unknown and that initiators of RV inflammation and links to fibrosis, apoptosis, and metabolic dysfunction need to be identified; a better understanding of effects of established and novel pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapies and specific antiinflammatory strategies on acute and chronic RV inflammation is needed. Pathways for progress include further characterization of inflammatory processes in the RV using biopsy and novel imaging.

### Revision of the 1990 working formulation for the standardization of nomenclature in the diagnosis of heart rejection [^74e1783b]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2005). Medium credibility.

Acute cellular rejection grading — definitions specify Grade 0 R as having "no evidence of mononuclear (lymphocytes/macrophages) inflammation or myocyte damage," Grade 1 R (mild, low-grade) that "may manifest in one of two ways" with perivascular and/or interstitial mononuclear cells that "respect myocyte borders, do not encroach on adjacent myocytes, and do not distort the normal architecture," or "one focus of mononuclear cells with associated myocyte damage"; Grade 2 R (moderate, intermediate-grade) requires "two or more foci of mononuclear cells (lymphocytes/macrophages) with associated myocyte damage," with foci "distributed in one or more than one biopsy fragment," "intervening areas of uninvolved myocardium" between foci, and "Low-grade (Grade 1R) rejection" that "can be present in other biopsy pieces"; Grade 3 R (severe, high-grade) is "a diffuse inflammatory process… involving multiple biopsy fragments," where "In most cases, the majority of biopsy fragments are involved," and "Multiple areas of associated myocyte damage are present."

### Suppurative inflammation with microabscess and pseudocyst formation is a characteristic histologic manifestation of cutaneous infections with rapid-growing Mycobacterium species [^1b4b7436]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Mycobacterial infections of the skin classically cause a granulomatous tissue reaction. We have observed a suppurative pattern of inflammation associated with infections by rapid-growing Mycobacterium species in immunocompromised patients. We report 6 cases in skin and soft tissue with an unusual but consistent lack of a predominance of granulomatous inflammation. Of the 6 cases, 4 had predominantly (approximately 75%) suppurative inflammation, 1 case predominantly demonstrated (approximately 75%) a mix of acute and chronic inflammation, and 1 case showed an approximately equal contribution of suppurative and granulomatous inflammation. All 6 cases showed abscess formation and numerous acid-fast bacilli (AFB) on AFB stain and were confirmed by tissue culture. Of these 6 cases, 2 had microabscesses with central pseudocysts harboring microorganisms. Five patients were taking oral prednisone, and 1 had an uncharacterized immunodeficiency. These cases highlight the need for awareness of this unusual manifestation of infection with rapid-growing Mycobacterium species, particularly in immunocompromised patients.

The Pathologic Axes of MS and Their Modifiers

The pathologic processes associated with MS have been discussed in detail in several recent reviews. In this study, we are briefly reviewing the main pathologic axes of MS, which are (1) acute inflammation, (2) chronic parenchymal and interstitial inflammation, (3) white and gray matter demyelination, (4) axonal degeneration, (5) neuronal loss, and (6) remyelination. We hypothesize that the clinical heterogeneity in MS is caused by differing activity along these key pathologic axes, both across patients with MS and within individual patients over time.

(1) Inflammation is the key driver of MS pathology and can be separated into acute and chronic. Acute inflammation consists of bulk invasion of monocytes and lymphocytes into white matter (WM) and to a lesser degree in deep gray matter, with concomitant activation of local microglia and astrocytes. The ensuing demyelination leads to the formation of acute focal WM lesions, characterized by dense infiltration with myelin-laden macrophages, and in lower numbers, lymphocytes, as well as substantial axonal damage.(2) Chronic inflammation manifests as diffuse glial activation at the rim of chronic active lesions, which can reach considerable distances into normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and as predominantly lymphocytic inflammation in the meninges and perivascular spaces. Meningeal inflammation is typically diffuse but may also form follicle-like structures. Chronic inflammation is considered compartmentalized; however, persistent blood-brain barrier abnormalities suggest that chronic inflammation is not completely independent of systemic influence. (3) The main inflammatory assault in MS is directed against myelin, which leads to focal demyelination in white and gray matter. A low-grade form of demyelination can occur at the rim of chronic active lesions, which leads to slow expansion and eventually lesion confluency. Although MS has been previously believed to affect WM only, the area of cortical and deep gray matter demyelination in secondary progressive MS (SPMS) can exceed that of WM lesions. With the exception of loss of myelin, cortical lesions lack the pathologic signatures of WM lesions such as blood-brain barrier breakdown, immune cell infiltration, perivascular cuffs, astrogliosis, loss of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and complement activation.(4) Axonal damage is abundant in acute MS lesions and becomes less frequent in chronic active and chronic silent lesions. One pathologic study has suggested that axonal injury is invariably associated with inflammation and that ongoing axonal damage is absent in patients in whom inflammation has declined to baseline levels. Several other studies posit that demyelinated axons degenerate independent of inflammation because of loss of trophic support by the myelin sheathand enhanced energy demand with eventual mitochondrial decompensation.(5) Neuronal loss in the neocortex is widespread in MS, ranging between 25% and 40%, although less prominent than in classical neurodegenerative diseases. It is unclear how much cortical demyelination contributes to neuronal loss, with some studies reporting enhanced neuronal loss in demyelinated cortical lesions compared with normal-appearing gray matter, while others describing significant but equivalent levels of neuronal loss in lesional and nonlesional neocortex. Synaptic density in the remaining neurons is substantially decreased, as is neuronal activity measured by functional MRI. Neuroaxonal damage is believed to be the major determinant of disability. (6) Finally, remyelination is a major repair process in the CNS, which is believed to protect damaged axons, restores axonal conduction, and prevents long-term axonal damage; remyelination is sparse in most (67%) and extensive in a minority (20%) of patients with MS. It is more pronounced in early MS, although robust active remyelination can be observed in patients with MS of all ages. It differs between anatomic locations, with the most extensive remyelination in cortical lesions, a lower degree of subcortical and periventricular lesions and near absence of remyelination in cerebellar lesions. In this context, a recent single nucleus RNA-sequencing study of brain tissue from patients with MS and controls has uncovered 3 distinct oligodendrocyte response patterns. These patterns were determined by individual patient effects only and were not associated with patient metadata such as age, disease duration, and disease category.

### Inflammatory muscle diseases [^dc641038]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on inflammatory myopathies:

- **Definition**: Inflammatory myopathies are a group of immune mediated muscle diseases defined by inflammatory changes on muscle biopsy and clinically by progressive muscle weakness; principal subtypes are dermatomyositis, polymyositis, necrotizing autoimmune myositis, inclusion body myositis, and overlap myositis.
- **Pathophysiology**: Dermatomyositis is driven by complement mediated microvascular injury with perifascicular ischemia and a type I interferon signature. Polymyositis and inclusion body myositis feature antigen driven cytotoxic CD8 positive T cell invasion of muscle fibers that aberrantly express major histocompatibility complex class I antigens. Necrotizing autoimmune myositis shows extensive myofiber necrosis with macrophage predominance and specific autoantibodies, whereas inclusion body myositis uniquely combines inflammation with proteostatic failure, mitochondrial abnormalities, and protein aggregation.
- Risk factors: Risk factors are subtype specific: dermatomyositis in adults is associated with an increased risk of cancer in the first 3–5 years after onset; necrotizing autoimmune myositis is linked to prior viral exposures, connective tissue disease, cancer, and statin exposure and is frequently associated with antibodies against SRP or against HMG-CoA reductase; inclusion body myositis predominates after fifty years of age and shows associations with particular HLA genotypes.
- **Disease course**: All subtypes cause proximal weakness that impairs rising and stair climbing; dermatomyositis has characteristic photosensitive skin findings that may precede weakness, necrotizing autoimmune myositis presents acutely or subacutely with very high CK levels, and inclusion body myositis has an insidious, asymmetric course with early distal involvement, selective quadriceps and forearm atrophy, frequent falls, and prominent dysphagia. ILD, arthralgia, and systemic symptoms occur with certain autoantibody syndromes.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: 10-year survival across inflammatory myopathies is now > 90% but varies by subtype and comorbidity. Dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and necrotizing autoimmune myositis are often treatment responsive with potential functional recovery when treated early; inclusion body myositis is typically refractory to immunosuppression and progresses to severe disability despite near normal life expectancy.

### Lights and shadows of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in acute myocarditis [^030ac059]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute myocarditis (AM) is a "multifaceted disease" characterized by a large variety of acute manifestations, potentially followed by unpredictable sequelae ranging from dilated cardiomyopathy to recurrent arrhythmias. Although relatively common in clinical practice, AM is underdiagnosed in the community due to the low sensitivity of conventional diagnostic tools such as ECG, cardiac biomarkers, and viral serology. The use of endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is controversial, given the lack of standardized protocols and the high prevalence of sampling errors related to the common patchy distribution of myocardial inflammation.

In this complex scenario, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was immediately perceived as a potentially "revolutionary" non-invasive tool, with a unique capacity to characterize the typical hallmarks of myocardial inflammation (Fig. 1). Ghelani et al. for example, reported a retrospective study among a population of 514 patients demonstrating a fivefold increase (from 5.2 to 28.1%) in the utilization of CMR in AM over a 10-year period from 2006 to 2015, with a significant parallel decline in the rate of EMB.

Fig. 1
Freehand drawing schematically representing tissue targets of CMR in acute myocarditis. A typical inferior-lateral left ventricular involvement with subepicardial spread is depicted. In most cases, the process derives from a viral infection that induces myocardial necrosis (or apoptosis) and triggers an immunoreactive response, with subsequent vasoactive phenomena and tissue oedema (freehand drawing by Bettina Conti, MD, Sapienza University of Rome)

Current diagnostic criteria (Lake Louise criteria; LLc) are based on the application of a recommended standardized protocol that aims to identify typical signs of the inflammatory cascade, which consist of oedema, regional hyperemia, and cellular death. These criteria have been extensively validated in the literature, and despite suboptimal diagnostic accuracy of about 78%, are commonly applied in clinical routine. Promising novel T1/T2 mapping techniques have recently been introduced that provide quantitative measurements of tissue changes, minimizing subjectivity and errors common in conventional threshold-based post-processing methods.

This document analyses lights and shadows of CMR imaging in the diagnostic and prognostic assessment of AM and evaluates the improvement provided by the introduction of T1/T2 mapping techniques into clinical routine.

### Inflammation, immunity, and antigen persistence in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infectionImmunity and inflammaion in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^93f45b08]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 infection is known to result in a range of symptoms with varying degrees of acute-phase severity. In a subset of individuals, an equally diverse collection of long-term sequelae has been reported after convalescence. As survivorship and therefore the number of individuals with 'long-COVID' continues to grow, an understanding of the prevalence, origins, and mechanisms of post-acute sequelae manifestation is critically needed. Here, we will explore proposed roles of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response in the onset, severity, and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 post-acute sequelae. We discuss the potential roles of persistent virus and autoantigens in this syndrome, as well as the contributions of unresolved inflammation and tissue injury. Furthermore, we highlight recent evidence demonstrating the potential benefits of vaccination and immunity in the resolution of post-acute symptoms.

### The COVID-19 puzzle: deciphering pathophysiology and phenotypes of a new disease entity [^862d6cab]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 continues to spread worldwide, with devastating consequences. While the medical community has gained insight into the epidemiology of COVID-19, important questions remain about the clinical complexities and underlying mechanisms of disease phenotypes. Severe COVID-19 most commonly involves respiratory manifestations, although other systems are also affected, and acute disease is often followed by protracted complications. Such complex manifestations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates the host response, triggering wide-ranging immuno-inflammatory, thrombotic, and parenchymal derangements. We review the intricacies of COVID-19 pathophysiology, its various phenotypes, and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 host response at the humoral and cellular levels. Some similarities exist between COVID-19 and respiratory failure of other origins, but evidence for many distinctive mechanistic features indicates that COVID-19 constitutes a new disease entity, with emerging data suggesting involvement of an endotheliopathy-centred pathophysiology. Further research, combining basic and clinical studies, is needed to advance understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms and to characterise immuno-inflammatory derangements across the range of phenotypes to enable optimum care for patients with COVID-19.

### Coronavirus disease-19 and cardiovascular disease: a risk factor or a risk marker? [^00edb96c]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 causes the clinical syndrome of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) which has become a global pandemic resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. While the virus primarily affects the respiratory system, it also causes a wide variety of complex cardiac manifestations such as acute myopericarditis, acute coronary syndrome, congested heart failure, cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrhythmias. There are numerous proposed mechanisms of cardiac injury, including direct cellular injury, pro-inflammatory cytokine storm, myocardial oxygen-demand mismatch, and systemic inflammation causing multi-organ failure. Additionally, medications commonly used to treat COVID-19 patients have various cardiovascular side effects. We aim to provide a succinct review about the pathophysiology and cardiac manifestations of COVID-19, as well as treatment considerations and the various adaptations made to the current healthcare structure as a result of the pandemic.

### Coronary artery involvement in pediatric Takayasu's arteritis: case report and literature review [^8e2e1a56]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Takayasu's arteritis (TA) is a chronic vasculitis that predominantly affects the aorta, its main branches, and the pulmonary arteries. Although it is the third most common vasculitis worldwide, the cause is largely unknown. The classic patient phenotype is an Asian woman who is between 20 to 30 years old. It is relatively uncommon in North America and Europe, with a female to male predominance of 8.5:1. In pediatrics the disease typically presents between the ages of 10 and 20 years old, but it has presented as early as 24 months of age. The delay in diagnosis from initial disease manifestation can be 2–11 years in adults and sometimes longer in children.

In general, TA is viewed as having two phases, an acute inflammatory phase and a chronic fibrotic phase. The acute phase is characterized by a lymphocytic infiltrate with occasional giant cells of the media and fibroblast proliferation causing thickening of the intima of large vessels. Inflammation transitions to fibrosis during the chronic phase. Elastic tissue in vessel walls is replaced by collagen resulting in thickening of all three layers of the vessel. The intima may become rigid, and aneurysmal formation can occur secondary to mural stress on the vessel wall.

Although, the exact pathogenesis of TA is not well understood, several lines of evidence support the important role of cellular autoimmunity. The vaso vasorum is thought to act as a gateway allowing the accumulation of cellular infiltrate into the vessel walls via upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules and adventitial neovascularisation. The cellular infiltrate is characterized by a mixture of lymphocytes, predominately CD4+ T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, giant cells and B cells. Pro-inflammatory T-cell cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IFN-γ, have been identified in the peripheral circulation in TA patients, both expressed in sera and by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. TNF-α is an important contributor to granuloma formation and has also been identified in aortic tissue of patients with TA, therefore implicating TNF-α as a possible therapeutic target.

### Takotsubo syndrome: pathophysiology, emerging concepts, and clinical implications [^464b1df2]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory Mechanisms

There is growing evidence to support the presence of myocardial inflammation in the acute phase of takotsubo syndrome. Although this will, in part, be a reaction to the precipitating event, it may be both cause and effect. Furthermore, a maladaptive persistent subacute or chronic inflammation may contribute to long term cardiac dysfunction.

In a multicenter study (TERRIFIC, NCT02897739), patients with takotsubo syndrome had greater retention of ultra-small superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide in both ballooning and non-ballooning left ventricular segments during the acute phase. As ultra-small superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide are predominantly phagocytosed by activated tissue-resident macrophages, the main cellular protagonists of the myocardial cellular inflammation in acute takotsubo syndrome appear to be macrophages, whereas acute myocarditis is principally lymphocyte-mediated. Additionally, serum interleukin-6 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 concentrations as well as classic CD14 ++ CD16 monocytes are increased, whereas intermediate CD14 ++ CD16 + and non-classic monocytes are reduced in patients with takotsubo syndrome. At 5 months of follow-up, enhancement with ultra-small superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide was no longer detectable in the myocardium, although persistent elevations in serum interleukin-6 concentrations and reductions in intermediate CD14 ++ CD16 + monocytes were present. Therefore, takotsubo syndrome is characterized by a myocardial macrophage inflammatory infiltrate, changes in the distribution of monocyte subsets, and an increase in systemic proinflammatory cytokines. Many of these changes persisted for at least 5 months, suggesting a low-grade chronic inflammatory state. Furthermore, post-mortem examination of human hearts from patients who died during the acute phase of the condition demonstrated that these macrophages are predominantly of the M1 pro-inflammatory type as opposed to the reparative M2 type. The presence of M1 macrophages and the persistence of the intermediate (CD14 ++ CD16 +) monocyte subset at 5 months follow-up are strongly indicative of a less reparative and more pro-inflammatory state compared to similar stages of patients with acute myocardial infarction. It remains unclear, however, if this inflammatory activation is causative or consequential to takotsubo syndrome. Irrespective of this, these findings offer explanation for the low-grade chronic inflammatory substrate with subsequent evolution of acute takotsubo into long term heart failure.

### Post-stroke inflammation-target or tool for therapy? [^c62967c4]. Acta Neuropathologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Recruitment of circulating monocytes to the ischemic brain equals that of neutrophils and is regulated by adhesion molecules, chemokines, and cytokines. CD11b + Ly6C high CCR2 + monocytes appear to be the predominant cell type recruited after both pMCAO and tMCAO. Recruitment after tMCAO takes place in a CCR2-dependent manner, while this appears not to be the case after pMCAO. Histologically, CD11b + and CD45 + macrophage-like cells are observed both in the infarct and peri-infarct from 6 to 48 h after pMCAO. From 3 to 7 days after occlusion the infarct becomes infiltrated with CD11b +, CD45 +, and ED1 + macrophages, reminiscent of phagocytic 'foam cells' that are prominent in the infarct. Interestingly, when in the brain the Ly6C high CCR2 + monocytes change their phenotype by downregulating Ly6C expression, upregulating F4/80, and then expressing arginase-1 and the chitinase-like protein YM-1, thereby developing into M2 phenotype macrophages. This occurs from 1 to 3 days after pMCAO. Histologically, Ym1 + and CD206 + cells have been shown to be abundant within the infarct core at 24 h, and to be even more numerous at 7 days, along with cells expressing the lysosomal marker CD68. This is in line with a role in infarct resolution and repair.

Although monocytes/macrophages have been reported to exacerbate ischemic brain damage in the acute phase after tMCAO, blocking the infiltration of Ly6C high monocytes (and neutrophils) using a CCR2 antagonist worsened the outcome after tMCAO, which was ascribed to CCR2 antagonism altering the polarization of infiltrated macrophages. Monocytes/macrophages have been suggested to exert beneficial effects in the sub-acute phase after a stroke, by preventing hemorrhagic transformation, emphasizing that inhibition of monocyte recruitment might be damaging if done at the wrong time point. To add to the complexity, it appears that subsets of CD11b + CD45 high macrophages express different pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines at different time points after pMCAO, raising the potential to modulate this expression and to stimulate the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1Ra. The emerging understanding of how macrophages are stimulated by the ischemic environment to adopt distinct phenotypes or exert different functions might reveal new therapeutic strategies for controlling inflammation after ischemic injury.

Recent studies have also implicated lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of acute stroke. Since it is largely unknown as yet how these cells affect inflammation in the ischemic brain, the reader is referred to existing reviews on this topic.

### New-onset and relapsed liver diseases following COVID-19 vaccination: a systematic review [^c8e74553]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute cellular rejection of the liver

Acute cellular rejection of the liver (ACRL) was the sixth most-common disease (eight cases) reported following COVID-19 vaccination from our review (six new onset and two relapsed cases) (see Table 1). The median interquartile range (IQR) age of this group was 59.5 (52.5–64.7), with a male predominance in ACRL patients diagnosed after COVID-19 vaccination in most of the studies [n = 5, 62.5%], and all patients belonged to the White (Caucasian) ethnicity (n = 8, 100%). The median (IQR) time between the COVID-19 vaccination and time of presentation was 11 (7.5–17.2) days. Four of these eight ACRL cases were reported following Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination and four of these eight ACRL cases were reported after Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. All of the ACRL cases had previous medical history related to the liver [non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-related cirrhosis (n = 3), alcohol-related cirrhosis (n = 2), history of acute cellular rejection (n = 2), autoimmune cirrhosis (n = 1), cryptogenic cirrhosis (n = 1), cirrhosis (n = 1), end-stage liver disease (n = 1), hepatitis C virus (n = 1), and hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 1)]. Liver biopsy for the ACRL cases shown typical features consistent with acute liver rejection [mixed portal inflammation of predominantly mixed activated lymphocytes, bile duct injury, and endotheliitis] (n = 7, 87.5%). Patients who experienced ACLR post-COVID-19 vaccination were more likely to have raised liver enzymes (n = 6), raised bilirubin (n = 5), and thrombocytopenia (n = 2). Most prescribed pharmacotherapy agents in patients who suffered ACRL post-COVID-19 vaccination were the steroids (n = 12), IVIG (n = 2), immunosuppressants (n = 4) [tacrolimus(n = 2), everolimus (n = 1) and cyclosporine (n = 1)], and mycophenolate mofetil (n = 2). All patients who experienced ACRL after COVID-19 vaccination recovered (n = 8, 100%).

### COVID-19 immunopathology: from acute diseases to chronic sequelae [^03a40be3]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

The clinical manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mainly targets the lung as a primary affected organ, which is also a critical site of immune cell activation by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, recent reports also suggest the involvement of extrapulmonary tissues in COVID-19 pathology. The interplay of both innate and adaptive immune responses is key to COVID-19 management. As a result, a robust innate immune response provides the first line of defense, concomitantly, adaptive immunity neutralizes the infection and builds memory for long-term protection. However, dysregulated immunity, both innate and adaptive, can skew towards immunopathology both in acute and chronic cases. Here we have summarized some of the recent findings that provide critical insight into the immunopathology caused by SARS-CoV-2, in acute and post-acute cases. Finally, we further discuss some of the immunomodulatory drugs in preclinical and clinical trials for dampening the immunopathology caused by COVID-19.

### Systemic and organ-specific immune-related manifestations of COVID-19 [^86d38840]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Immune-related manifestations are increasingly recognized conditions in patients with COVID-19, with around 3,000 cases reported worldwide comprising more than 70 different systemic and organ-specific disorders. Although the inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is predominantly centred on the respiratory system, some patients can develop an abnormal inflammatory reaction involving extrapulmonary tissues. The signs and symptoms associated with this excessive immune response are very diverse and can resemble some autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, with the clinical phenotype that is seemingly influenced by epidemiological factors such as age, sex or ethnicity. The severity of the manifestations is also very varied, ranging from benign and self-limiting features to life-threatening systemic syndromes. Little is known about the pathogenesis of these manifestations, and some tend to emerge within the first 2 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas others tend to appear in a late post-infectious stage or even in asymptomatic patients. As the body of evidence comprises predominantly case series and uncontrolled studies, diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making is unsurprisingly often based on the scarcely reported experience and expert opinion. Additional studies are required to learn about the mechanisms involved in the development of these manifestations and apply that knowledge to achieve early diagnosis and the most suitable therapy.

### COVID-19: immunopathology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatment options [^80f56ae6]. The Journal of Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pathology

COVID‐19 is a disease in which multiple organ systems can be involved. The main pathological alterations detected in the most commonly affected organ systems are discussed in the following paragraphs, with particular emphasis on immunopathology.

Respiratory system

SARS‐CoV‐2 primarily affects the respiratory system, with viral entry into upper and lower respiratory epithelial cells, causing influenza‐like clinical manifestations, such as fever, cough, and dyspnoea. The ensuing immune response is suppressed in some individuals, leading to unrestrained viral replication that facilitates progression to a pulmonary phase with pneumonia. In late‐stage disease, hyperactivation of immune responses contributes to widespread hyperinflammation with the development of severe disease, including ARDS. Histological examinations showed various patterns of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with interstitial T‐cell infiltration (Figure 5). In some cases, an even more severe form of DAD could be observed, namely acute fibrinoid and organising pneumonia. Typical features of DAD, with hyaline membrane formation and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, were frequently encountered. Interestingly, abundant presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 has been demonstrated early in the disease course, whereas virus‐infected cells were only sporadically present at later stages of COVID‐19. The decrease in viral presence may be attributed to prompt immune activation, as demonstrated by extensive alveolar and interstitial inflammation (Figure 6). In line with this, a recent autopsy study discovered two distinct immunopathological reaction patterns in the lungs of deceased COVID‐19 patients: in the first subgroup, patients died early after hospitalisation with high viral load and relatively limited pulmonary pathology, implying extra‐pulmonary factors as contributors to lethal outcome, while patients in the second subgroup had a longer disease course and low viral load, yet prominent DAD, which was associated with marked immune cell infiltration and local complement activation. The disconnection between viral presence and pulmonary inflammation highlights the contribution of immunopathology in causing severe COVID‐19.

### Monocytes in coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis: where are we now? [^c65882ff]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite improvements in interventional and pharmacological therapy of atherosclerotic disease, it is still the leading cause of death in the developed world. Hence, there is a need for further development of effective therapeutic approaches. This requires better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathophysiology of the disease. Atherosclerosis has long been identified as having an inflammatory component contributing to its pathogenesis, whereas the available therapy primarily targets hyperlipidemia and prevention of thrombosis. Notwithstanding a pleotropic anti-inflammatory effect to some therapies, such as acetyl salicylic acid and the statins, none of the currently approved medicines for management of either stable or complicated atherosclerosis has inflammation as a primary target. Monocytes, as representatives of the innate immune system, play a major role in the initiation, propagation, and progression of atherosclerosis from a stable to an unstable state. Experimental data support a role of monocytes in acute coronary syndromes and in outcome post-infarction; however, limited research has been done in humans. Analysis of expression of various cell surface receptors allows characterization of the different monocyte subsets phenotypically, whereas downstream assessment of inflammatory pathways provides an insight into their activity. In this review we discuss the functional role of monocytes and their different subpopulations in atherosclerosis, acute coronary syndromes, cardiac healing, and recovery with an aim of critical evaluation of potential future therapeutic targets in atherosclerosis and its complications. We will also discuss technical difficulties of delineating different monocyte subpopulations, understanding their differentiation potential and function.

### Persistent inflammation subverts thrombospondin-1-induced regulation of retinal angiogenesis and is driven by CCR2 ligation [^5d1cb231]. The American Journal of Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Neovascular retinal disease is a leading cause of blindness orchestrated by inflammatory responses. Although noninfectious uveoretinitis is mediated by CD4(+) T cells, in the persistent phase of disease, angiogenic responses are observed, along with degeneration of the retina. Full clinical manifestation relies on myeloid-derived cells, which are phenotypically distinct from, but potentially sharing common effector responses to age-related macular degeneration. To interrogate inflammation-mediated angiogenesis, we investigated experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis, an animal model for human uveitis. After the initial acute phase of severe inflammation, the retina sustains a persistent low-grade inflammation with tissue-infiltrating leukocytes for over 4 months. During this persistent phase, angiogenesis is observed as retinal neovascular membranes that arise from inflamed venules and postcapillary venules, increase in size as the disease progresses, and are associated with infiltrating arginase-1(+) macrophages. In the absence of thrombospondin-1, retinal neovascular membranes are markedly increased and are associated with arginase-1(-) CD68(+) macrophages, whereas deletion of the chemokine receptor CCR2 resulted in reduced retinal neovascular membranes in association with a predominant neutrophil infiltrate. CCR2 is important for macrophage recruitment to the retina in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis and promotes chronicity in the form of a persistent angiogenesis response, which in turn is regulated by constitutive expression of angiogenic inhibitors like thrombospondin-1. This model offers a new platform to dissect the molecular and cellular pathology of inflammation-induced ocular angiogenesis.

### Dominant role of microglial and macrophage innate immune responses in human ischemic infarcts [^9899b6f9]. Brain Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Overall, our material contained 15 lesions in the acute stage, 17 in the resorption stage and 4 in the late scar stage. The majority of patients with acute ischemic infarct lesions had died within 1 and 8 days after clinical disease onset. In those patients, which had acute ischemic infarct lesions despite a longer intervall between clinical onset and autopsy, a mixture of lesions with different lesion stages were seen (Table 1), suggesting progressive accumulation of lesions at different time points between disease onset and death.

### Acute presentation of autoimmune hepatitis: a multicentre study with detailed histological evaluation in a large cohort of patients [^707442b2]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Although liver biopsy is crucial to diagnose and guide treatment decisions, a detailed histological analysis of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) with clinically acute presentations has not yet been performed. This study aimed to characterise the histological features and explore potential histological hallmarks to diagnose the acute presentation of AIH.

Methods

We systematically evaluated liver specimens of 87 adult patients with acute presentation of AIH retrospectively enrolled from Japanese multicentre facilities. Each histological feature was predefined by consensus based on the diagnostic criteria.

Results

Key findings were that acute presentation of AIH revealed histological features of both acute hepatitis and chronic hepatitis accompanying various degrees of fibrosis. The prominent features were lobular necrosis/inflammation (97.7%), plasma cell infiltration (96.4%), emperipolesis (89.3%), pigmented macrophages (84.5%), cobblestone appearance of hepatocytes (82.6%) and perivenular necroinflammatory activity, including centrilobular necrosis (81.4%).

Conclusions

The acute presentation of AIH represents the entire histological spectrum of acute hepatitis and chronic hepatitis with various activity grades and fibrosis stages that clinically correspond to acute-onset AIH and acute exacerbation of classic AIH, respectively. Although there are no pathognomonic features for the pathological diagnosis, the prominent presence of lobular and perivenular necroinflammatory activity, pigmented macrophages and cobblestone appearance of hepatocytes in addition to the classic AIH features, such as plasma cell infiltration and emperipolesis, are useful for the pathological diagnosis of the acute presentation of AIH.

### COVID-19-pathogenesis and immunological findings across the clinical manifestation spectrum [^66720a82]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The wide spectrum of COVID-19 clinical manifestations demonstrates the determinant role played by the individual immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the course of the disease. Thanks to the large number of published data, we are beginning to understand the logic of the human response to a virus adapted to bat immunity.

Recent Findings

Impairment of types I and III interferon responses may facilitate the occurrence of severe COVID-19 with reduced antiviral activity associated to potent inflammation. The human T and B-cell germline repertoire contain the specificities able to react against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Although inflammation disrupts the structure of germinal centers, memory T and B cells can be found in the blood of patients after mild and severe COVID 19.

Summary

Further studies are indispensable to better understand the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2. The diversity of the individual reaction may contribute to explain the clinical manifestation spectrum. Immunological memory can be demonstrated in patients, convalescent from mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19, but we do not know whether asymptomatic individuals have memory of the virus. Tailored vaccination protocols may be needed for individuals with previous SAS-CoV-2 infection.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: the clinical utility of bronchoalveolar lavage cellular analysis in interstitial lung disease [^5661b485]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society guideline — abnormal BAL differential cell patterns that suggest specific interstitial lung disease types — states: a lymphocyte differential count ≥ 25% suggests granulomatous disease (sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or chronic beryllium disease), cellular nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, drug reaction, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, or lymphoma; CD4+ / CD8+ > 3.5 is highly specific for sarcoidosis in the absence of an increased proportion of other inflammatory cell types; a lymphocyte differential count > 50% suggests hypersensitivity pneumonitis or cellular nonspecific interstitial pneumonia; a neutrophil differential count > 50% supports acute lung injury, aspiration pneumonia, or suppurative infection; an eosinophil differential count ≥ 25% is virtually diagnostic of acute or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia; and a cell differential count > 1% mast cells, > 50% lymphocytes, and > 3% neutrophils is suggestive of acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^3ed3b086]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

DILI ICIs, referred to clinically as immune‐related adverse events (irAEs), have been increasingly reported. The predominant histological pattern in ICI DILI is hepatocellular injury, with approximately 70% showing panlobular hepatitis and approximately 20% with centrilobular coagulative necrosis on liver biopsy.–Unlike AIH, plasma cell infiltration is not predominant, and the inflammatory infiltrate consists mostly of T lymphocytes, with CD8+ cells being greater in number than CD4+ cells. Sclerosing cholangitis is an uncommon manifestation of ICI DILI. Overall, jaundice and liver failure are rare in DILI because of ICI, and approximately a third of those with severe grades of DILI may even regress spontaneously.

Cholestatic DILI histology includes acute cholestasis, chronic cholestasis, and acute cholestatic hepatitis. In the acute cholestatic type, cholestasis without accompanying inflammation (so‐called bland cholestasis) may be the sole histological presentation and manifests as bile present in dilated canaliculi and within the hepatocyte cytoplasm. Acute cholestatic hepatitis is the presence of cholestasis accompanied by more prominent lobular inflammation. In chronic cholestasis, the cholestasis persists and may have severe bile duct injury or progress to bile duct loss. If bile duct loss exceeds 50%, the condition is then termed VBDS.

Less common histological manifestations of DILI include fatty liver disease, drug‐induced steatosis, and drug‐induced steatohepatitis. Steatosis may be purely microvesicular, which is primarily related to mitochondrial injury, mixed microvesicular and macrovesicular, or purely macrovesicular. Of note, microvesicular steatosis usually does not lead to increased echogenicity on ultrasound, nor does it manifest with hepatomegaly, and only liver biopsy can confirm its presence.

DILI resulting in vascular injury may lead to the development of nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH), obliterative portal venopathy (OPV), and SOS (formerly known as veno‐occlusive disease).NRH and OPV may clinically present insidiously, whereas SOS may manifest as either acute or chronic disease. Peliosis hepatis appears as blood‐filled lacunar spaces, and its development is associated with androgens and oral contraceptive agents.

### Cellular immune responses against hepatitis C virus [^f08b9b6a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Cellular immune responses are typically important in recovery from acute infections, and studies of acute hepatitis C confirm that broadly directed CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are associated with spontaneous clearance of infection. However, a major unanswered question is what role the cellular immune response plays in progression of liver disease during chronic infection. Classic models of hepatitis C suggest that cellular immune responses promote liver injury, either by causing direct cytolysis of infected cells or by promoting inflammation. However, clinical evidence suggests that persons with cellular immune dysfunction, such as that due to with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, have more-rapid disease progression. Recent data suggest that cellular immune responses do serve to limit the progression of liver disease, even if they are ineffective at clearance of virus. There is limited information on the effect of HIV coinfection on the cellular immune response to hepatitis C virus, but further study of this issue might shed light on the pathogenesis of liver disease in both immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised hosts.

### Underlying chronic inflammation alters the profile and mechanisms of acute neutrophil recruitment [^4d7e1a11]. The Journal of Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

We observed that, in chronically inflamed post‐ischaemic (PI) tissues, large populations of proangiogenic Gr1 low monocyte‐derived cells (MDCs) substantially elevate acute neutrophil recruitment through the generation of proinflammatory mediators in response to acute pharmacological or physiological stimulation. These findings demonstrate that, in chronically inflamed tissues, both the mechanisms and the magnitude of acute inflammatory responses are altered, potentially exacerbating and prolonging tissue inflammation and adversely affecting healing. These findings have important implications for the interpretation of data obtained in healthy tissue models and the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders.

### Pathophysiology of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection: a systematic literature review to inform EULAR points to consider [^6ac4d0c6]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to the scientific and global communities facing an unprecedented challenge. The rapid spread of the virus along with the lack of effective antiviral drugs to treat COVID-19 has so far resulted in more than 65 000 000 confirmed cases and 1 500 000 deaths (COVID-19.who.int/; 15 December 2020).SARS-CoV-2 infection encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes, from asymptomatic or mild diseases with little or no respiratory symptoms to severe COVID-19 with life-threatening manifestations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to multiorgan failure and death. Lung damage in severe COVID-19 is linked to inflammatory alveolar and interstitial immune cell infiltration and activation. The cellular and humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 appears to inadequately control viral spread or may be evident in tissue where there is no detectable virus with both scenarios being potentially deleterious consequent to severe inflammation. Excessive production and release of proinflammatory mediators, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and many other molecules, occurs in more patients with severe COVID-19. In severe cases, these features resemble other systemic severe inflammatory states such as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis.

A massive research effort to better understand the complex viral–host interactions has resulted in an extremely high volume of publications in a very short timeframe. The high heterogeneity and variety in the quality of the literature require a systematic appraisal; in order to propose a synthesis of existing evidence towards improved COVID-19 understanding and therapy. This systematic literature review (SLR) aimed to summarise the available information on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection from the rheumatological perspective, given that this specialty is intimately involved in investigation of aberrant and severe immunological reactions in many organ systems and in heterogeneous autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. An SLR addressing therapeutic aspects on the repurposing of rheumatic drugs as potential COVID-19 therapy is addressed elsewhere. This SLR informed the EULAR points to consider (PtC) on COVID-19 pathophysiology and immunomodulatory therapies.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), American Academy of Neurology (AAN), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR): 2020 guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease [^8f1e4d73]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Neurologic evaluation and Lyme disease — Screening neurologic patients with a low a priori likelihood of Lyme disease — that is, without a history of tick bite, erythema migrans, or other more typical manifestations, would result in far more false positive than true positive results. For suspected Lyme meningitis, likelihood increases with facial nerve palsy, symptoms of longer duration (> 7 days), and mononuclear cell predominant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis. Lyme disease can very rarely cause focal inflammation in the brain or spinal cord, and testing may be informative in this setting; however, MRI findings of nonspecific T2 white matter hyperintensities are not generally useful to diagnose Lyme neuroborreliosis, and misattribution of these to Lyme disease could lead to overuse of antibiotics with underemphasis on treatable vascular risk factors.

### Parasite-specific CD4 + IFN-γ + IL-10 + T cells distribute within both lymphoid and nonlymphoid compartments and are controlled systemically by interleukin-27 and ICOS during blood-stage malaria infection [^da4d40c3]. Infection and Immunity (2016). Low credibility.

Immune-mediated pathology typically manifests in nonlymphoid organs, such as the liver, lung, and brain, in IL-10-deficient mice during malaria infection. This suggests that IL-10 plays a key regulatory role within these tissue sites in regulating tissue-damaging inflammation during infection. However, to date, the cellular source of IL-10 during blood-stage malaria infection has been examined only in the spleen in mice and in the blood of humans. Consequently, the cellular source of IL-10 in the sensitive nonlymphoid organs is unknown. As such, we have a very limited comprehension of the overall systemic protective IL-10 response during blood-stage malaria infection. Notably, although CD4 + T cells appear to be the predominant source of IL-10 in the spleen in mice and blood in humans, during blood-stage malaria infection, IL-10 can be produced by virtually all leukocyte populations.

### Underlying chronic inflammation alters the profile and mechanisms of acute neutrophil recruitment [^98b9d0a8]. The Journal of Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The mechanisms governing leukocyte extravasation have been studied extensively. In the majority of in vivo models employed, acute inflammatory responses are induced in otherwise healthy tissues 14, 16, 17; however, in many clinical conditions, chronic inflammation and attendant tissue abnormalities are prominent features, and it is likely that the responses in these tissues will be mediated by very different mechanisms. Here, we have investigated the mechanisms governing acute leukocyte extravasation in chronically inflamed and angiogenic tissues as compared with physiologically normal conditions. Our findings describe a population of ischaemia‐associated and angiogenesis‐associated cells that are derived from circulating monocytes, and can amplify modest inflammatory insults through the generation of additional proinflammatory signals (Figure 6). This makes the tissues highly sensitive to acute inflammatory stimuli, and may affect disease progression and the resolution of chronic inflammation.

Figure 6
Schematic illustration of the interaction of acute and chronic inflammatory responses. (A) Induction of chronic partial ischaemia induces rapid recruitment of neutrophils and Gr1 high monocytes from the circulation. (B) Seven days after the induction of ischaemia, the neutrophilic inflammation has resolved, but an elevated population of Gr1 low MDCs persist in the tissue. (C) These Gr1 low MDCs are highly sensitive to a range of pharmacological or physiological stimuli (e.g. LPS or IR), and respond by generating a range of additional proinflammatory stimuli. (D) These secondary signals act on the endothelium to upregulate ICAM‐1 expression, which supports luminal neutrophil adhesion, and/or directly activate neutrophil chemotaxis. Naive tissues exposed to the same exogenous stimuli lack this additional source of secondary mediators, resulting in lower overall tissue activation.

### Lower respiratory tract myeloid cells harbor SARS-cov-2 and display an inflammatory phenotype [^6736cea7]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia may induce an aberrant immune response with brisk recruitment of myeloid cells into the airspaces. Although the clinical implications are unclear, others have suggested that infiltrating myeloid cells may contribute to morbidity and mortality rates during SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, few reports have characterized myeloid cells from the lower respiratory tract, which appears to be the primary site of viral-induced disease, during severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

### Imaging indications and findings in evaluation of lung transplant graft dysfunction and rejection [^ee3a2ea3]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Transbronchial biopsy findings in acute cellular rejection following lung transplantation. The vascular component of acute cellular rejection (a) is characterized by a lymphocyte-rich inflammatory infiltrate involving and surrounding small blood vessels within lung parenchyma. The Movat pentachrome stain (b) helps to highlight elastic layers in the blood vessel, demonstrating that inflammatory cells breach the elastic layers (black wavy lines) and involve the vascular intima (arrow). Airways involved by acute cellular rejection (c) show inflammation (long arrow). In more advanced examples, there is epithelial damage, manifested by sloughing of epithelial cells into the airway lumen (short arrow)

Chest radiography is often ordered as a baseline test. It may show non-specific findings such as perihilar opacities and/or pleural effusion. It has low sensitivity and specificity for acute rejection, and is usually performed to look for diseases other than rejection. Chest CT is typically obtained to evaluate the severity and distribution of the disease process. The CT findings of acute cellular rejection are non-specific. They include ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening with or without pleural effusions (Fig. 4). Significant clinical and radiographic improvement after early administration of high dose of corticosteroids provides additional supporting evidence for acute rejection. Given the non-specific nature of imaging findings in acute cellular rejection, the main role of CT is to exclude other etiologies and help identifying targets for bronchoscopic tissue sampling. Trans-bronchial biopsies are typically obtained from the lower lobes if the lungs are normal on imaging or if the disease process is diffuse. When disease is patchy on imaging, biopsies are usually taken from the radiologically abnormal areas.

### From sting to STING: role of inflammation in wasp sting induced AKI-a narrative review [^396c8d37]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple wasp stings are a serious problem in the remote mountains of East, South, and Southeast Asia, and pose a significant threat to human health. Wasp populations are rising due to global climate change, with reports of stings now emerging in America and Europe. The wasp venom contains a wide variety of biologically active constituents, including proteins (antigen 5), enzymes (hyaluronidase and phospholipase A), bioactive peptides (mastoparan and wasp kinin), and amines (histamine). As a highly vascularized and excretory organ, the kidney is susceptible to the detrimental effects of wasp venom and/or pathogenic factors secondary to the wasp sting. Mastoparan and phospholipase A in wasp venom not only directly act on renal tubule epithelial cell membranes and cause renal damage, but also contribute to the rhabdomyolysis by attacking the muscle cell membrane and disrupting its integrity. The roles of wasp venom in kidney injury have already been elaborated in our previous review and are not within the scope of this article. The earliest clinical study on wasp stings by Xie et al. demonstrated that acute kidney injury (AKI) was a prominent clinical manifestation of wasp stings. Subsequent studies reported that the incidence of AKI after wasp stings was 30–50%. Further studies have indicated that AKI is an independent risk factor for death in patients stung by wasps. A few clinical studies have indicated that acute tubular necrosis is a typical pathological manifestation in patients with wasp sting-induced AKI. A small number of patients have acute interstitial nephritis as pathological changes in kidney due to anaphylactic response. In recent years, more attention has been focused on AKI caused by wasp stings, and related studies are rapidly increasing, ranging from clinical retrospective studies and case reports on clinical manifestations to basic research (animal and cellular experiments) on pathogenesis. The pathogenesis of AKI induced by wasp stings is currently being explored further.

### Monocyte-driven atypical cytokine storm and aberrant neutrophil activation as key mediators of COVID-19 disease severity [^e85fb3b3]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Epidemiological and clinical reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 virulence hinges upon the triggering of an aberrant host immune response, more so than on direct virus-induced cellular damage. To elucidate the immunopathology underlying COVID-19 severity, we perform cytokine and multiplex immune profiling in COVID-19 patients. We show that hypercytokinemia in COVID-19 differs from the interferon-gamma-driven cytokine storm in macrophage activation syndrome, and is more pronounced in critical versus mild-moderate COVID-19. Systems modelling of cytokine levels paired with deep-immune profiling shows that classical monocytes drive this hyper-inflammatory phenotype and that a reduction in T-lymphocytes correlates with disease severity, with CD8+ cells being disproportionately affected. Antigen presenting machinery expression is also reduced in critical disease. Furthermore, we report that neutrophils contribute to disease severity and local tissue damage by amplification of hypercytokinemia and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Together our findings suggest a myeloid-driven immunopathology, in which hyperactivated neutrophils and an ineffective adaptive immune system act as mediators of COVID-19 disease severity.

### Acute pancreatitis [^6863b2ea]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute pancreatitis:

- **Definition**: Acute pancreatitis is a disease characterized by acute inflammation of the pancreas.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute pancreatitis is most frequently due to gallstones (40%) and alcohol (30%). Other minor causes include ERCP (5–10%), surgical complications (5–10%), drugs (< 5%), hypertriglyceridemia (2–5%), trauma (< 1%), infection (< 1%) and autoimmunity (< 1%).
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of acute pancreatitis ranges from 13 to 45 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: In patients with acute pancreatitis, localized tissue damage causes activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to a systemic inflammatory response that can progress to multiple organ failure and early mortality. The compensatory release of anti-inflammatory mediators plays a role in causing increased susceptibility to septic complications, such as infected pancreatic necrosis, and contributes to late mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Mortality associated with acute pancreatitis is approximately 1–5%, and the recurrence rate is approximately 20%.

### Diffuse smoking-related lung diseases: insights from a radiologic-pathologic correlation [^7d0da8b1]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute eosinophilic pneumonia

AEP is an uncommon condition that occurs most frequently in males between the second and forth decades of life. Approximately two-thirds of patients have smoking habits. Changes in smoking habits are known inducers of the development of AEP: initiation of smoking habit, resumption after interruption, and increased frequency of smoking. The clinical presentation is generally unspecific, letting the disease be frequently misdiagnosed as other most common entities such as community-acquired pneumonia. The clinical symptoms are acute, with duration of the respiratory illness of less than a month, and characterized by moderate fever, cough, dyspnea, pleuritic pain, malaise, myalgia, and night sweats. Acute respiratory failure is frequent and mechanical ventilation is often required. Therefore, the disease is severe, and most patients fulfill diagnostic criteria for acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The key to diagnosis is evidence of eosinophilia in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), with more than 25% of eosinophils on the cell count. Nevertheless, blood eosinophils are frequently at normal levels at the beginning of the clinical presentation and may rise after a few days. BAL is sterile with no bacterial growth during the disease course.

Lung biopsy is usually not needed to meet the diagnosis. It shows alveolar and interstitial eosinophilia and alveolar damage. Additional features include nonnecrotizing perivascular inflammation, eosinophilic abscesses, interstitial lymphocytes, organizing fibrinous exudate in the alveoli, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and also involvement of the airway.

Imaging findings are predominant in the lower lungs, showing diffuse consolidations, ground-glass opacities (GGO), ill-defined centrilobular nodules, smooth septal thickening, and unilateral or bilateral pleural effusion (Fig. 9). The radiologic differential includes infection, fluid overload, ALI/ARDS, hypersensitivity to drugs, and pulmonary hemorrhage.

Fig. 9
Radiologic-pathologic correlation of AEP. a Posteroanterior (PA) radiograph shows bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidation in the mid-left lung zone. A small left pleural effusion is present. b Axial CT shows peripheral lower lobe consolidations and ground-glass opacities, mainly on the left. c Transthoracic lung biopsy showing eosinophils (black arrow) infiltrating the interstitium and the alveolar spaces; edema (green arrow) and reactive pneumocytes are seen; no necrotizing vasculitis is observed (H&E, × 400)

Treatment with steroids achieves an excellent response, with resolution within days of the immunologic process.

### Neutrophil P2X7 receptors mediate NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent IL-1 β secretion in response to ATP [^8b2fd9e2]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The inflammatory process results in tissue damage that can impair organ function, which can result in clinical manifestations. Almost all mammalian cells including myeloid cells, platelets, leukocytes, epithelial and endothelial cells can release ATP, which can then lead to paracrine or autocrine activation of downstream purinergic signalling and exacerbation of the inflammatory response. ATP activates plasma membrane purinergic receptors of the P2X and P2Y families that are expressed on many cell types, including myeloid and lymphoid cells. Extracellular ATP has been implicated in multiple in vivo inflammatory responses, including lung inflammation and fibrosis, systemic inflammation and tissue damage during endotoxemia.

The ionotropic P2X 7 receptor (P2X 7 R) is expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells, which is activated by extracellular ATP to induce NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and caspase-1-dependent processing and release of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. In addition to macrophages and dendritic cells, expression of functional P2X 7 R has been described in other human and murine hematopoietic lineage cells, including mast cells, B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, microglial cells and osteoclasts; however, reports of P2X 7 R expression and its function on human and murine neutrophils are conflicting, and therefore the role of P2X 7 R in these cells remains uncertain.

P2X 7 R messenger RNA expression was reported in both human peripheral blood neutrophils and in the HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells that were differentiated into a granulocyte lineage. Another report showed the presence of P2X 7 R protein in the cytosol, but not on the cell surface of human neutrophils, whereas other investigators did not detect P2X 7 R messenger RNA or protein in human neutrophils. We are aware of only one report showing ATP-induced activation of inflammasome signalling in murine neutrophils, although those investigators did not identify the ATP receptor. Notably, no systemic studies on P2X 7 R RNA or protein expression in murine neutrophils have been performed. Given that neutrophils are the predominant cell type in multiple causes of acute infection and inflammation, and that ATP is released at sites of inflammation, we addressed these apparent contradictions in the literature by using multiple approaches to characterize P2X 7 R expression and function in human peripheral blood neutrophils and in murine bone marrow neutrophils.

### The role of dysregulated immune responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis [^8e772ae3]. Virus Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) which caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is a pandemic threat to global public health. It has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations from mild to critical illness, the most serious of which is the complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 infection appears mild in infants and children, however, in adults, it can lead to serious consequences. In this review, we highlighted the differences between the immune responses of the lung in children and adults, immune dysregulation and their possible role in clinical manifestations in COVID-19. There is a reduction in population of immunocompetent cells during aging and subsequently induced ineffective inflammation in the faces of some infections. Dysregulation in the immune system can lead to an unappropriated local and systemic immune responses and subsequently the rapid spread of the virus, leading to severe COVID-19 disease. Therefore, recognizing the differences in the immune responses of various hosts as well as to improve the immune system disorder should always be part of research and treatment protocols.

### Update on the features and measurements of experimental acute lung injury in animals: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^c63a1334]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2022). High credibility.

Experimental acute lung injury (ALI) — definitional features and reporting threshold are outlined as rapid onset (with a defined onset time, specific to the model utilized) plus domains that include histological evidence of tissue injury, alteration of the alveolar–capillary barrier, presence of an inflammatory response, and evidence of physiological dysfunction, and to state ALI has occurred, at least one accepted "relevant" measurement under at least three out of four domains should be reported.

### Cellular players and role of selectin ligands in leukocyte recruitment in a T-cell-initiated delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction [^6b2c2c9f]. The American Journal of Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions are characterized by a strong cellular infiltrate, including neutrophils, macrophages, and T lymphocytes. In all these cell types, both E- and P-selectin-dependent adhesion pathways play a significant role in recruitment into the inflamed skin. Accordingly, inhibition of selectin-mediated interactions (eg, by antibodies) results in impairment of acute DTH reactions. However, whether inhibition of a specific cell type is responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect or whether all leukocytes are affected remains unclear. To address this question, we used fucosyltransferase-VII knockout mice that lack functional selectin ligands as either donors or recipients in a DTH model elicited by Th1 cell and antigen transfer. We found that selectin-mediated adhesion is required by Th1 effector cells to enter the DTH reaction site and, additionally, to elicit the DTH reaction. On the other hand, elimination of selectin binding in the recipient's neutrophils and macrophages by use of fucosyltransferase-deficient mice receiving wild-type Th1 effector cells resulted in a strongly reduced infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages but unimpaired footpad swelling. These findings demonstrate a major role for both E- and P-selectin in the recruitment of different leukocyte cell types. However, only the presence of selectin ligands on T cells was critical for the inflammatory reaction. These findings reveal T cells as the predominant targets for selectin blockade that aim to suppress skin inflammation.

### Compartmental immunophenotyping in COVID-19 ARDS: a case series [^28789813]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe immunopathology may drive the deleterious manifestations that are observed in the advanced stages of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but are poorly understood.

Objective

Our aim was to phenotype leukocyte subpopulations and the cytokine milieu in the lungs and blood of critically ill patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Methods

We consecutively included patients less than 72 hours after intubation following informed consent from their next of kin. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was evaluated by microscopy; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood were assessed by 10-color flow cytometry and a multiplex cytokine panel.

Results

Four mechanically ventilated patients (aged 40–75 years) with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 ARDS were included. Immature neutrophils dominated in both blood and lungs, whereas CD4 and CD8 T-cell lymphopenia was observed in the 2 compartments. However, regulatory T cells and T H 17 cells were found in higher fractions in the lung. Lung CD4 and CD8 T cells and macrophages expressed an even higher upregulation of activation markers than in blood. A wide range of cytokines were expressed at high levels both in the blood and in the lungs, most notably, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, and monocyte chemoattactant protein-1, consistent with hyperinflammation.

Conclusion

COVID-19 ARDS exhibits a distinct immunologic profile in the lungs, with a depleted and exhausted CD4 and CD8 T-cell population that resides within a heavily hyperinflammatory milieu.

### Inflammatory endotypes in COPD [^7478510b]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major global health problem that is poorly treated by current therapies as it has proved difficult to treat the underlying inflammation, which is largely corticosteroid-resistant in most patients. Although rare genetic endotypes of COPD have been recognized, despite the clinical heterogeneity of COPD, it has proved difficult to identify distinct inflammatory endotypes. Most patients have increased neutrophils and macrophages in sputum, reflecting the increased secretion of neutrophil and monocyte chemotactic mediators in the lungs. However, some patients also have increased eosinophils in sputum and this may be reflected by increased blood eosinophils. Increased blood and sputum eosinophils are associated with more frequent exacerbations and predict a good response to corticosteroids in reducing and treating acute exacerbations. Eosinophilic COPD may represent an overlap with asthma but the mechanism of eosinophilia is uncertain as, although an increase in sputum IL-5 has been detected, anti-IL-5 therapies are not effective in preventing exacerbations. More research is needed to link inflammatory endotypes to clinical manifestations and outcomes in COPD and in particular to predict response to precision medicines.

### Postural hypotension as the initial presentation of fulminant right ventricular myocarditis [^4b036550]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Myocarditis can be totally asymptomatic or can manifest with chest pain syndromes, ranging from mild persistent chest pain of acute myopericarditis to severe symptoms that mimic acute myocardial infarction. About 60% of patients may have antecedent arthralgias, malaise, fevers, sweats, or chills consistent with viral infections 1 to 2 weeks before onset. Here, we report a postpartum young woman who developed postural hypotension as the first manifestation of fulminant myocarditis with initially acute "cold and dry" right-sided heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Common causes of postural hypotension include volume depletion, medications, diabetes, alcohol, infection, and varicose veins as well as dysautonomic syndromes. Fulminant myocarditis can cause cardiogenic shock. Myocardial inflammation more frequently affects localized areas of the left ventricle free wall, rarely right ventricle (RV). However, predominant RV involvement with acute right-sided heart failure and low cardiac output syndrome can be easily overlooked due to lack of typical heart failure signs. On reviewing medical literatures, we had found no report regarding the RV involvement with acute right-sided heart failure as the initial presentation of fulminant myocarditis.

### Longitudinal change of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy-associated interstitial lung disease on high-resolution computed tomography, a prospective cohort study [^6583bbf0]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Subtype-specific dynamic imaging evolution

Longitudinal imaging analysis revealed distinct progression patterns between ASS and MDA5 + DM. The ASS cohort exhibited a slow progressive period characterized by partial inflammatory resolution but persistent accumulation of consolidations, reflecting chronic inflammation-driven alveolar epithelial injury. It is also important to consider that persistent GGO may not only indicate active inflammation, but also could represent residual post-inflammatory damage, early fine fibrosis, or a mixed state of ongoing alveolar injury and attempted repair. MDA5 + DM cohort demonstrated sustained progression toward HC and reticular pattern-predominant fibrosis during the slow progressive period, suggesting anti-MDA5 antibody-mediated fibroblast transdifferentiation that perpetuates irreversible pulmonary remodeling. It should be noted, however, that this observed radiologic evolution toward a fibrotic-predominant pattern may not solely indicate actively progressive fibrosis, but could also represent a stabilized, post-inflammatory sequela following the acute alveolar injury, particularly in survivors of the initial RP-ILD phase. The inference of active fibrotic process in MDA5 + DM is based on cross-sectional imaging patterns and requires validation in future prospective studies incorporating longitudinal physiologic data and histopathological correlation to confirm the true activity and progression of fibrosis. Non-RP-ILD subgroup exhibited subclinical fibrotic progression despite inflammatory attenuation, implying persistent microenvironmental dysregulation. Consistent with prior evidence, ASS typically manifests radiologically as nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) or organizing pneumonia (OP) patterns, whereas MDA5 + DM frequently presents with rapidly progressive fibrotic phenotypes or acute lung injury patterns — notably diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). These dichotomous trajectories fundamentally reflect divergent pathomechanisms: ASS progression is driven by "sustained inflammasome activation" versus MDA5 + DM's "post-acute fibrotic reprogramming", necessitating subtype-specific therapeutic paradigms.

### Immunological and inflammatory profiles in mild and severe cases of COVID-19 [^bd2ec409]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

As of 26th June 2020, the unprecedented global epidemic outbreak of novel Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in 9,296,202 laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection reported from 210 countries to the WHO. Of these, there have been 479,133 deaths (5.1% mortality). Whilst the virological, epidemiological, clinical, routine laboratory, imaging, and management outcome features of COVID-19 patients have been rapidly defined –, the immune and inflammatory profiles are not well understood.

A wide spectrum of clinical manifestations occurs from mild to severe disease with extensive lung involvement leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death –. Severe lung disease with extensive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure leads to fatal outcomes –. Higher fatality rates occur in the elderly, and in individuals who have diabetes, co-morbidities and other causes of immunocompromise. We recently reported a case where significant interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates in the lung tissue, lymphopenia, and overactivation of T cells in peripheral blood. Inflammatory and immune responses are important for elimination of the infection, but may have a significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and may play a role in the expression of the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 disease.

In this study, we perform a cross-sectional observational study of immunological and inflammatory markers and cells in 41 COVID-19 patients (29 with mild disease and 12 with severe disease including 2 fatal cases). We find COVID-19 patients in severe group are characterized by profound lymphopenia, strong T-cell activation, and increased expression of T-cell inhibitory molecules compared to mild group of patients.

### Immune alterations in a patient with SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome [^0e0fadb7]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

First reported in December 2019 in China, SARS-CoV-2 (a beta coronavirus) can cause a respiratory syndrome that manifests a clinical pathology resembling mild upper respiratory-tract disease (common cold-like symptoms) and occasionally severe lower respiratory-tract illness and extra-pulmonary manifestations, leading to multiorgan failure and death. Such a severe clinical condition displayed by certain patients affected with COVID-19 pneumonia is strongly reminiscent of previous and recent epidemic cases of respiratory failure associated with related coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.

In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. Death results from hypoxemic respiratory failure in patients developing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is associated, in a substantial portion of patients, with an inflammatory syndrome and cytokine storm that may originate from immune cells. Severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia shares features with "cytokine storms," such as those seen in severe cytokine-release syndrome, which is characterized by fever, hypotension, and respiratory insufficiency associated with elevated serum cytokine levels, including those of IL-1 and IL-6, mostly produced by myeloid cells. Previous studies from SARS animal models and infected humans have suggested the occurrence of an aberrant host cytokine storm, resulting in an excessive clinical manifestation that plays a critical role in disease severity. However, a precise description of the immune mechanisms responsible for the pathophysiology and acute mortality in COVID-19-infected patients is still unavailable. Here, we provide a full description of a fatal case of COVID-19 in Europe, including a chronological immune profile of the patient, to aid the determination of the putative underlying mechanisms of this deadly case and the identification of potential therapeutic targets.

### Associations between macrophage colony-stimulating factor and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 in plasma and first-time coronary events: a nested case-control study [^a037b152]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils — myeloid effectors of innate immunity — play pivotal roles in atherosclerosis. Neutrophils have gained increasing interest in recent years, with the current consensus being that they have a proatherogenic role, especially in the initial stages of the disease. 1, 2 Human monocytes can be divided into the "classical" CD14 ++ CD16 − and "nonclassical" CD14 + CD16 + populations, which are considered to correspond to the "inflammatory" CCR2 + CX3CR1 − Ly‐6C hi and "steady state" CCR2 − CX3CR1 + Ly‐6C lo monocyte populations in mice. 3 Classical monocytes predominate in human circulation and are preferentially recruited into inflammatory sites and atherosclerotic plaques compared with their nonclassical counterparts. 3 We previously showed that blood counts of neutrophils and of the classical CD14 ++ CD16 − monocytes correlate with the incidence of acute cardiovascular events, 4, 5 suggesting that factors governing myeloid cell homeostasis might play important roles in human cardiovascular disease.

### Endogenous control of inflammation characterizes pregnant women with asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection [^bb9e6a5d]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Concerns are now arising with the second/third wave of the pandemic where more severe illness seems to characterize pregnant women with respect to the first wave, independently from COVID-19 strain. Even though COVID-19 manifestation seems to be less severe in pregnant women than in elderly patients, it could be not completely absent, or silent. Therefore, more investigational studies need to be done to assess the true impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy. A recent review of 63 observational studies on a total of 637 women with SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed that more than 3 out of 4 experienced mild disease.

In order to better understand the severity of the infection, clinical outcomes on pregnant women with COVID-19 were compared with those of SARS and MERS. Interestingly, case fatality was 0%, 18%, and 25%, respectively. In addition, clinical manifestations reported in pregnant women were mild and similar to those reported in nonpregnant women infected by SARS-CoV-2, with predominant features including fever, cough, dyspnea, and lymphopenia. Vertical transmission has been reported in SARS as ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in the placenta. Even if the structure of the receptor-binding domain of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 is similar, cases of vertical transmission of COVID-19 are possible, although reported in few cases –.

During pregnancy, the immune system undergoes relevant changes, and the immunological shifts that occur in pregnancy are partially related to changes in hormonal levels. The immune system of pregnant woman is characterized by an anti-inflammatory immunological tolerance, and for this reason, many autoimmune diseases go into remission, only to flare again in the early postpartum period. Clearly, this could leave the mother more susceptible to viral infections, as a Th1 response better helps to contrast viruses, even if little is known about the response to SARS-CoV-2.

The immune system of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection is now receiving more attention, and different questions are under deep investigation. Here we show that pregnant women with or without infection are characterized by different plasma levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, PBMC from all women have similar subset distributions and general functions of, and show normal parameters related to cell activation or exhaustion, except for higher amounts of circulating low-density neutrophils in infected pregnant women. A deep characterization of T- and B- lymphocyte subsets, along with monocytes, natural killer, and dendritic cells, shows a substantial lack of effect of the viral infection on such populations.

### Acute and chronic urticaria: evaluation and treatment [^4c937739]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute urticaria:

- **Definition**: Acute urticaria is a self-limited cutaneous condition characterized by transient, erythematous, and pruritic wheals or hives.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute urticaria is caused by mast cell and basophil activation, leading to the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators, which results in vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, leading to characteristic skin lesions. The activation of these cells can occur through multiple triggers, including IgE- and non-IgE-mediated mechanisms.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of acute urticaria in the United Kingdom is estimated at 355 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, acute urticaria presents as itchy, raised welts that can appear anywhere on the body. These hives are transient, often moving from one area of the body to another. In some cases, acute urticarial lesions may display central clearing with an ecchymotic or hemorrhagic hue.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of acute urticaria is generally good, as it is typically a self-limiting condition that resolves within 6 weeks.

### Clinical and laboratory evaluation… [^6c19c995]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical and Laboratory Evaluation Most human infections with Japanese encephalitis virus are asymptomatic; < 1% of people infected develop clinical disease. Acute encephalitis is the most commonly recognized clinical manifestation. Milder forms of disease, such as aseptic meningitis or undifferentiated febrile illness, can also occur. Illness usually begins with sudden onset of fever, headache, and vomiting. Mental status changes, focal neurologic deficits, generalized weakness, and movement disorders may develop over the next few days. The classical description of JE includes a Parkinsonian syndrome with masklike facies, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, and choreoathetoid movements. Acute flaccid paralysis, with clinical and pathological features similar to those of poliomyelitis, has also been associated with JE. Seizures are common, especially among children. The case-fatality ratio is approximately 20%–30%.

Among survivors, 30%–50% have significant neurologic, cognitive, or psychiatric sequelae. Clinical laboratory findings might include a moderate leukocytosis, mild anemia, and hyponatremia. Cerebrospinal fluid typically has a mild to moderate pleocytosis with a lymphocytic predominance, slightly elevated protein, and normal ratio of CSF to plasma glucose. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is better than computed tomography for detecting JE virus-associated abnormalities such as changes in the thalamus, basal ganglia, midbrain, pons, and medulla. Thalamic lesions are the most commonly described abnormality; although these can be highly specific for JE in the appropriate clinical context, they are not a very sensitive marker of JE. EEG abnormalities may include theta and delta coma, burst suppression, epileptiform activity, and occasionally alpha coma. JE virus infections are confirmed most frequently by detection of virus-specific antibody in CSF or serum.

Because humans have low or undetectable levels of viremia by the time distinctive clinical symptoms are recognized, virus isolation and nucleic acid amplification tests are insensitive and should not be used for ruling out a diagnosis of JE.

### Neutrophil recruitment and function in health and inflammation [^8caab9a0]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Neutrophils have traditionally been thought of as simple foot soldiers of the innate immune system with a restricted set of pro-inflammatory functions. More recently, it has become apparent that neutrophils are, in fact, complex cells capable of a vast array of specialized functions. Although neutrophils are undoubtedly major effectors of acute inflammation, several lines of evidence indicate that they also contribute to chronic inflammatory conditions and adaptive immune responses. Here, we discuss the key features of the life of a neutrophil, from its release from bone marrow to its death. We discuss the possible existence of different neutrophil subsets and their putative anti-inflammatory roles. We focus on how neutrophils are recruited to infected or injured tissues and describe differences in neutrophil recruitment between different tissues. Finally, we explain the mechanisms that are used by neutrophils to promote protective or pathological immune responses at different sites.

### Vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome-current perspectives [^de902218]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

VKHD is a multiphasic disease that classically has four clinical phases or stages with variable clinical features in different ethnic groups: 1) prodromal; 2) acute; 3) chronic convalescent; and 4) chronic recurrent stage.

The prodromal phase, which may mimic a viral infection, generally precedes the ocular inflammation by a few days and lasts for 1–2 weeks. Patients typically complain of CNS and auditory symptoms including headaches, neck stiffness, photophobia, fever, orbital pain, scalp or skin sensitivity, and focal neurological deficits such as cranial nerve palsies. They may also have hearing loss, particularly for higher frequencies, dysacousia, vertigo, and tinnitus, with less frequent auditory features observed in Hispanic patients.CSF samples from lumbar punctures show pleocytosis in > 80% of cases, and brain imaging studies can occasionally demonstrate focal parenchymal lesions.

In the eye, the acute phase of VKHD is characterized by a panuveitis or posterior uveitis with multifocal serous retinal detachments (SRDs). Vitreous inflammation is commonly noted with a low-grade non-granulomatous anterior uveitis seen in some patients. The diffuse choroidal thickening seen on OCT scans during the acute phase of VKHD correlates with diffuse mononuclear inflammatory cellular infiltration of the uvea with sparing of the choriocapillarisand the appearance of Dalen-Fuchs nodules on histopathological studies. The Dalen-Fuchs nodules are aggregates of lymphocytes and pigment-laden macrophages that appear mainly in the posterior pole between Bruch membrane and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The inflammation lasts several weeks, and early treatment may prevent the later development of the chronic phases of the disease in up to a third of cases. However, progression to the chronic convalescence phase occurs in 28%–62% of patients who present with acute VKHD, possibly due to more severe and rapid disease onset.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^b3347218]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Nonfibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) histopathology — features of a typical pattern include small airway-centered distribution involving bronchioles and/or alveolar ducts, uniform cellular interstitial inflammation of alveolar walls and bronchioles (which may include regions with a cellular NSIP pattern), inflammation consisting mostly of lymphocytes with relatively few plasma cells, and interstitial scattered poorly formed granulomas and/or multinucleated giant cells; lack of features suggesting an alternative diagnosis represents another requirement for the typical nonfibrotic HP pattern. Minor Features that are nonspecific and do not represent diagnostic criteria include small foci of organizing pneumonia, foamy macrophages, and cholesterol clefts. Biopsies can be classified as compatible with nonfibrotic HP pattern if the first three Major Features are identified but both granulomas and features of an alternative diagnosis are lacking.

### Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic interventions in acute kidney injury: a literature review [^24e56d37]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Immune cells-mediated damage

The renal interstitium houses the majority of the renal immune system, predominantly including dendritic cells, along with macrophages and fibroblasts. Dendritic cells collect and deliver antigens to initiate adaptive immune responses. Antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells and macrophages, convey antigens to naive T lymphocytes, triggering their activation and differentiation, CD4 + T helper cells are essential for coordinating immune responses by aiding B cells and activating cytotoxic CD8 + T cells, B lymphocytes mature into plasma cells, which generate antibodies that combat infections and facilitate their eradication. B lymphocytes also secrete chemokines C-C motif-ligand 7 (CCL7), which recruit neutrophils and monocytes to the kidney during AKI. Neutrophils contribute to inflammation by secreting cytokines, ROS, proteases, and other substances into renal tissue. Macrophages are classified into type 1 and type 2, with M1 macrophages generating pro-inflammatory cytokines to promote inflammation, and M2 macrophages exhibit anti-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic properties. Furthermore, interferon-γ, secreted by natural killer cells, activates M1 macrophages within renal tissue. Various inflammatory cells release several inflammatory factors, infiltrate the renal interstitium, and aggravate renal injury.

### Immunopathology of hyperinflammation in COVID-19 [^c7678bd6]. The American Journal of Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in an unprecedented public health crisis worldwide. Recent studies indicate that a hyperinflammatory syndrome induced by SARS-CoV-2 contributes to disease severity and mortality in COVID-19. In this review, an overview of the pathophysiology underlying the hyperinflammatory syndrome in severe COVID-19 is provided. The current evidence suggests that the hyperinflammatory syndrome results from a dysregulated host innate immune response. The gross and microscopic pathologic findings as well as the alterations in the cytokine milieu, macrophages/monocytes, natural killer cells, T cells, and neutrophils in severe COVID-19 are summarized. The data highlighted include the potential therapeutic approaches undergoing investigation to modulate the immune response and abrogate lung injury in severe COVID-19.

### Pathology and pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome [^2ec246eb]. The American Journal of Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious viral disease characterized by severe clinical manifestations of the lower respiratory tract. The pathogenesis of SARS is highly complex, with multiple factors leading to severe injury in the lungs and dissemination of the virus to several other organs. The SARS coronavirus targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. Several organs/cell types may be infected in the course of the illness, including mucosal cells of the intestines, tubular epithelial cells of the kidneys, neurons of the brain, and several types of immune cells, and certain organs may suffer from indirect injury. Extensive studies have provided a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. In this review we describe the most significant pathological features of SARS, explore the etiological factors causing these pathological changes, and discuss the major pathogenetic mechanisms. The latter include dysregulation of cytokines/chemokines, deficiencies in the innate immune response, direct infection of immune cells, direct viral cytopathic effects, down-regulation of lung protective angiotensin converting enzyme 2, autoimmunity, and genetic factors. It seems that both abnormal immune responses and injury to immune cells may be key factors in the pathogenesis of this new disease.

### Löfgren syndrome on 18F-FDG PET / CT: an acute manifestation of sarcoidosis [^4966381d]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A 58-year-old man presented with fever, erythema nodosum, and arthralgia of knee and ankle joints. Laboratory data showed signs of inflammation, and chest x-ray revealed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. 18F-FDG PET/CT was acquired to analyze the underlying causes and revealed FDG accumulation in thoracic lymphadenopathy and in subcutaneous lesions and periarticular uptake. This typical triad is known as Löfgren syndrome, an acute manifestation of sarcoidosis and which, as this case shows, can be visualized on 18F-FDG PET/CT. It is important to recognize this syndrome and to discriminate it from the classic presentation of sarcoidosis because of its different diagnostic and therapeutic consequences.

### Monocyte-driven atypical cytokine storm and aberrant neutrophil activation as key mediators of COVID-19 disease severity [^3b2564b7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Since the first reports of a novel coronavirus outbreak in Hubei, China at the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the globe, with more than 100 million people having been infected worldwide resulting in over 2 million fatal cases. A broad spectrum of disease symptom manifestations and varied severity has complicated patient care and put enormous pressure on healthcare systems worldwide –. Our current understanding of the pathophysiology underlying distinct COVID-19 clinical phenotypes shows a clear link between the host immune response and disease severity. Early reports of fever, increased acute phase reactants and coagulopathy in severe COVID-19 cases combined with hypercytokinemia have pointed towards a so-called cytokine storm reminiscent of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Importantly, this paradigm has formed the basis for many interventional trials. However, it remains unclear how the dysregulated cytokine release observed in COVID-19 compares to other known cytokine storm syndromes.

It has become increasingly clear that the host response to COVID-19 differs substantially from the antiviral response to other respiratory viruses including influenza. Decreased lymphocyte counts, reduced T-cell functionalities and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio are now well-established hallmarks of COVID-19 –. Despite a large-scale effort by the global research community over the past year, the exact mechanisms behind these innate and adaptive immune system alterations and their interplay remain to be fully elucidated. Based on results from plasma cytokine profiling, systems biology-driven predictive modelling and multiplexed immunophenotyping, here we show that (i) COVID-19 is characterized by an 'atypical' cytokine release with reduced type II interferon signalling, refuting the canonical cytokine storm paradigm, (ii) antigen presentation is impaired in critical disease and (iii) neutrophils are important effectors of the resulting damage both locally in the lung and systemically in circulation.

### Clinicopathology conference: 41-year-old woman with chronic relapsing meningitis [^18d510d0]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis Discussion

This is a 41‐year‐old woman with a 15‐year history of relapsing meningitis that progressed to chronic lumbar arachnoiditis, with several notable relapses following episodes of physical stress. Despite multiple investigations, no definitive etiology was identified, and the disease recurred despite multiple empirical treatment regimens for TB, herpesvirus infections, and inflammatory conditions. Several possible diagnoses should be considered at this stage. We focus our discussion around the findings of chronic arachnoiditis and granulomatous disease.

Infectious

The patient's initial presentation at age 26 years was of a subacute prodrome followed by acute meningism. An infectious cause was appropriately at the top of the differential. Given the subacute history and the monocyte‐predominant CSF with WBC < 100 cells/μl, bacterial meningitis secondary to typical pathogens, although possible, was less likely. 1, 2 Subacute causes of meningitis commonly occur in the setting of viral, parasitic, fungal, or atypical bacterial infections, such as TB. 2 Multiple investigations for these types of pathogens were negative, and there was no evidence of systemic infection by CT or FDG‐PET CT. However, TB PCR and culture are insensitive, and up to half of people with TBM have no evidence of systemic disease. 3, 4 Given her recent exposure to TB and subsequent PPD conversion, CSF pleocytosis, hypoglycorrhachia, and the poor sensitivity of diagnostic tests for TBM, empiric treatment was appropriate given the disease's high morbidity and mortality. 5, 6, 7 Her prolonged remission after empiric TB therapy was also reassuring.

### Sex-specific manifestations of Löfgren's syndrome [^106a65f6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Motivation

It has been debated whether patients need to have erythema nodosum to be classified as having Löfgren's syndrome. In this study, we have therefore in detail evaluated and compared a large number of patients with an acute onset of sarcoidosis and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL), with or without erythema nodosum (EN). This study is important because it may lead to a more accurate definition of Löfgren's syndrome, and an exact phenotype of patients is crucial in modern medical research.

Background

Löfgren's syndrome is commonly regarded as a distinct clinical entity.

Methods

We have in detail evaluated a large group of patients (n = 150) with an acute onset of sarcoidosis with BHL, in most cases with fever, EN, and/or bilateral ankle arthritis or periarticular inflammation. Within this group, 87 patients had EN (EN positive), whereas 63 were without EN (EN negative), though with distinct symmetric ankle inflammation.

Results

EN-positive and EN-negative patients were identical in every aspect except that there were significantly more women in the EN-positive group: 58 women (67%) in the EN-positive group compared with only 17 (27%) women in the EN-negative group (p < 0.0001). In all other aspects, such as age, smoking habits, seasonal clustering of disease onset, rate of positive biopsies, chest radiography, pulmonary function, bronchoalveolar lavage cell distributions including the typically increased CD4/CD8 ratio, and clinical development of the disease, the EN-positive and EN-negative groups were close to identical. The two groups were also identically strongly associated with HLA-DRB1*0301/DQB1*0201, with 60 (69.0%) and 44 (69.8%) patients having this particular HLA type in the EN-positive and EN-negative groups, respectively. Such patients recovered to the same degree-that is, at almost 100%.

Conclusions

We conclude that manifestations of Löfgren's syndrome differ between men and women, with EN found predominantly in women, whereas a marked periarticular inflammation of the ankles or ankle arthritis without EN is seen preferentially in men.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Postvaccination myocarditis — mechanisms and biopsy findings — has an uncertain mechanism, with hypotheses including molecular mimicry, autoantibody formation, immune dysregulation with natural killer cell activation, and a dysregulated cytokine and immune response to mRNA; male predominance may relate to sex hormone differences. Endomyocardial biopsy has been reported only in a small number of cases; in 2 cases infiltrates consisted largely of T cells and macrophages with eosinophils, B cells, and plasma cells, whereas in other cases biopsy failed to demonstrate myocardial infiltrates and evidence of myocarditis. Reported cases do not suggest a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, and no cases have had associated thrombotic events, thrombocytopenia, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.

### Could hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis be the core issue of severe COVID-19 cases? [^d63a2017]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19, a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), commonly presents as fever, cough, dyspnea, and myalgia or fatigue. Although the majority of patients with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, some are more prone to serious outcomes, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe, life-threatening inflammatory syndrome associated with intense cytokine release (also known as a "cytokine storm"). Similar to COVID-19, HLH is characterized by aggressive course leading to multi-organ failure.

Main Text

The purpose of this review article is to draw attention to the possibility of the complication of HLH in patients with the severe course of COVID-19. Indeed, some of the clinical characteristics observed in the more severe cases of COVID-19 are reminiscent of secondary HLH (which can be triggered by infections, malignancies, rheumatological diseases, or autoimmune/immunodeficiency conditions). The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection also suggests that HLH or a similar hyperinflammatory syndrome is the cause of the severe course of the infection.

Conclusion

The pathogenesis and clinical symptoms of severe COVID-19 indicate that an increased inflammatory response corresponding to HLH is occurring. Therefore, patients with severe COVID-19 should be screened for hyperinflammation using standard laboratory tests to identify those for whom immunosuppressive therapy may improve outcomes.

### Platelet-derived chemokines in inflammation and atherosclerosis [^97f7250f]. Cytokine (2019). Medium credibility.

Platelets are inflammatory anuclear cells with a well-established role in the development and manifestation of atherosclerosis. Activated platelets secrete a plethora of chemokines including CXCL4 or platelet factor 4 (PF4), CCL5, CXCL12 or stromal cell derived factor-1α (SDF-1α), CXCL16 and others, which initiate or promote local inflammatory processes at sites of vascular injury. These processes are mainly mediated by the recruitment of circulating haematopoietic stem cells, neutrophils, monocytes or lymphocytes on vascular wall. Under acute ischemic conditions platelet-derived chemokines may promote the mobilization of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells and their homing at lesion sites. This review focuses on the role of platelet-derived chemokines in inflammation and atherosclerosis. Further, we discuss the clinical value of plasma levels of chemokines in the prognosis of atherosclerotic heart disease.

### Characteristics of inflammatory factors and lymphocyte subsets in patients with severe COVID-19 [^4b6b28a3]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), which first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has rapidly spread all over the world. The World Health Organization characterized COVID‐19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. At the time of writing, patients with COVID‐19 had been identified in more than 200 countries worldwide. Up to 22 May 2020, the number of confirmed cases in China had reached 84 522, of which 4645 individuals had died and 79 738 had been cured. In addition to China, the number of confirmed cases in other countries had reached 5 146 723, with 330 959 individuals dying.

COVID‐19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), and is the third highly pathogenic coronavirus to arise, following the SARS‐CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome‐CoV. In general, COVID‐19 is an acute resolved disease but it can also be deadly, with a 2.3% case fatality rate. Currently, the pathogenesis of COVID‐19 is still poorly understood. Lung biopsy samples have shown evidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which greatly resembles that seen in patients with SARS and MERS. One of the main mechanisms for ARDS in SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV infection is the cytokine storm: a deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from the release of large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by immune effector cells., A cytokine storm triggers a violent attack by the immune system on the body, causing ARDS and multiple organ failure, and finally, leading to death. However, the main cytokines and chemokines involved in SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV infections differ. In COVID‐19, it has been reported that patients being treated on intensive care units (ICU's) have higher plasma levels of interleukin‐2 (IL‐2), IL‐7, IL‐10, granulocyte‐colony stimulating factor, interferon γ‐inducible protein‐10, monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1, macrophage inflammatory protein‐1A, and tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) compared to non‐ICU patients. Regarding other inflammatory factors, elevated IL‐6, serum ferritin, and C­‐reactive protein (CRP) have been most commonly reported in patients with COVID‐19.

Adequate samples were obtained from all five patients (Figure 1A–E), which demonstrated typical features of T cell–mediated ACR, including portal inflammation of predominantly mixed activated lymphocytes, portal vein (PV) phlebitis (Figure 1B–D, black arrows), and bile duct injuries (Figure 1D, E, red arrows). Complement component 4d (C4d) stain by immunohistochemistry was negative in all but one patient, who showed C4d in the PV, portal connective tissue, and small portal capillaries (Figure 1F). Three patients had rejection activity index (RAI) scores five of nine, whereas the other two had three of nine (Table 1).

### Granulomatous diseases: kids are not just little people [^26b3c710]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Granulomatous diseases represent a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by histiocytic inflammation that affect patients of any age. These diseases differ widely in their pathogenesis and include infectious and noninfectious conditions. This review focuses on noninfectious granulomatous conditions, with particular emphasis on age-related differences in the onset, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, prognosis, and age-specific management of specific granulomatous disorders. Knowledge of age-specific aspects of granulomatous conditions in adults and children improves both the extent of the diagnostic workup and the management of these patients.

### Pathology explains various mechanisms of auto-immune inflammatory peripheral neuropathies [^1cac67f4]. Brain Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

In AIDP, the primary site of immune attack (cellular and/or humoral) is the SC surface. There are a few endoneurial mononuclear cell infiltrates composed of macrophages and lymphocytes. Macrophages are usually more numerous, the prominence of lymphocytic infiltrates being low. When present, lymphocytes are perivascular or randomly distributed in epineurium or endoneurium. It has been suggested that T‐cells and antibodies might target a possible infectious agent ("molecular mimicry"), in the presence of the "major histocompatibility complex" (MHC) class II and co‐stimulatory molecules on the surface of an antigen‐presenting cell. Debris‐filled macrophages may be of perivascular or subperineurial distribution, or randomly dispersed throughout the nerve fascicle (in association with axon).

There is a prominent process of segmental demyelination and remyelination with a variety of aspects, from apparent normal myelin to completely demyelinated axons (depending of the duration and severity of the disease). Axons are usually spared, but, as described by Prineas, macrophages penetrate the basement membrane around nerve fibers and displace the adjacent SC, giving macrophage‐induced myelin disruption (by stripping myelin away from the body of SC). Vesicular destruction of myelin may sometimes precede macrophage invasion. These lesions are multifocal and predominate at the levels of nerve roots. They are supposed to be due to an immune response directed against a component of peripheral myelin which has not yet been identified.

4.2 The classical

The classical form of CIDP is defined as a chronic polyradiculoneuropathy (developing over at least 8 weeks) manifesting as progressive, stepwise, or recurrent symmetrical proximal and distal weakness and sensory impairment in all limbs. In 1975, Peter J. Dyck named it "chronic inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy" (CIP), before proposing the term "chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy" (CIDP), nowadays still used. CIDP mainly affect myelinated fibers and is characterized by segmental demyelination (corresponding to randomly distributed foci of acquired demyelination between two NoRs, along the internode). Despite primary demyelination, there is a secondary axonal loss (sometimes severe), as observed in about a quarter of the cases of Dyck et al. Inflammation is present in up to half of the cases. Most of the time, NB is not essential for the diagnosis of CIDP, because clinical and electrophysiological criteria are sufficient.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^58ccfb16]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Nonspecific tests of immunologic inflammation — routine laboratory tests such as complete blood cell count with differential, sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and other acute-phase reactants are useful in determining the inflammatory consequences of innate immunity, and functional assays of neutrophils and macrophages may be necessary to pinpoint inflammatory responses (B); functional assays of macrophages and neutrophils may indicate either impaired defense or uncontrolled inflammatory responses (ie, the macrophage activation syndrome), neutrophil and macrophage function tests may only be available in specialized medical centers, and high ferritin levels associated with the macrophage activation syndrome can be used to monitor treatment of this disorder.

### Guidance for assessment of the inflammation etiologic criterion for the GLIM diagnosis of malnutrition: a modified Delphi approach [^a01d4f75]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Comments and clarifications on statement 2 — clinical course, categorization, and actions: Mild infections and other self-limited or easily treated conditions often reflect mild inflammatory states and should receive appropriate medical treatment and be monitored; if they persist to become chronic or progress to moderate or severe inflammation, then further nutrition evaluation and intervention should be considered; a number of diseases or conditions can fit in either the acute or chronic and the mild, moderate, or severe inflammation categories depending on the duration and severity of inflammation that is manifest, with examples including pancreatitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); critically ill individuals with severe acute inflammatory conditions may not initially meet phenotypic GLIM criteria, and these patients should be assumed to be at an elevated risk of developing malnutrition and warrant early nutrition intervention and follow-up.

### Hemophagocytic macrophages in murine typhoid fever have an anti-inflammatory phenotype [^34c50567]. Infection and Immunity (2012). Low credibility.

Histiocytes are white blood cells of the monocytic lineage and include macrophages and dendritic cells. In patients with a variety of infectious and noninfectious inflammatory disorders, histiocytes can engulf nonapoptotic leukocytes and nonsenescent erythrocytes and thus become hemophagocytes. We report here the identification and characterization of splenic hemophagocytes in a natural model of murine typhoid fever. The development of a flow-cytometric method allowed us to identify hemophagocytes based on their greater than 6N (termed 6N+) DNA content. Characterization of the 6N+ population from infected mice showed that these cells consist primarily of macrophages rather than dendritic cells and contain T lymphocytes, consistent with hemophagocytosis. Most 6N+ macrophages from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium-infected mice contain intact DNA, consistent with hemophagocytosis. In contrast, most 6N+ macrophages from control mice or mice infected with a different bacterial pathogen, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, contain damaged DNA. Finally, 6N+ splenic macrophages from S. Typhimurium-infected mice express markers consistent with an anti-inflammatory M2 activation state rather than a classical M1 activation state. We conclude that macrophages are the predominant splenic hemophagocyte in this disease model but not in Y. pseudotuberculosis-infected mice. The anti-inflammatory phenotype of hemophagocytic macrophages suggests that these cells contribute to the shift from acute to chronic infection.

### Revision of the 1990 working formulation for the standardization of nomenclature in the diagnosis of heart rejection [^1ece0892]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2005). Medium credibility.

Peri-operative ischemic injury in heart transplant biopsies arises during the obligatory ischemic time that accompanies procurement and implantation of a donor heart and may be exacerbated by prolonged hypotension due to poor graft function, hemorrhage during the peri-operative period, and prolonged high-dose inotrope therapy. It is characterized initially by contraction band necrosis or coagulative myocyte necrosis, often with myocyte vacuolization and fat necrosis, and frequently extends to the endocardial surface. As healing ensues, biopsies may contain mixed inflammatory infiltrates including neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages and eosinophils, and at this point confusion with acute rejection may occur. Ischemic injury is a common biopsy finding in the early post-transplant period (up to 6 weeks) and must be differentiated from acute rejection; in acute rejection the inflammatory infiltrate frequently is proportionally greater than the degree of myocyte damage, whereas in ischemic foci it is usually the reverse, and peri-transplant injury with neutrophils may show overlapping features with antibody-mediated (humoral) rejection.

### Host response to infection: not all lymphopenia is created equal in SARS-CoV-2 [^14a23e33]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The last decade has demonstrated how outwardly similar patients may have substantial underlying biological heterogeneity, even in acute illness syndromes such as SARS-CoV-2. Identifying biological subphenotypes of acute illness and understanding how those differences may inform selection of different therapies are key precision medicine research priorities in critical care. Although Michels and colleagues raise more questions than answers, this excellent study demonstrates how a precision medicine framework integrating clinical observations, molecular assays, and advanced data analyses can bring new insights into the immunology of severe infection.

### Pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease [^3659c274]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Kawasaki disease (KD) most frequently affects infants and young children under 5 years of age. This disease is considered a kind of systemic vasculitis syndrome, and primarily invades the medium-sized muscular arteries, including coronary arteries. Diagnosis of KD is based on characteristic clinical signs and symptoms, which are classified as principal clinical findings and other clinical and laboratory findings. Even though the aetiology of KD is unknown, epidemiological data suggest that some kinds of infectious agents are involved in the onset of KD. In addition, the data indicate that host genetics underlie the disease's pathogenesis. Histologically, coronary arteritis begins 6–8 days after the onset of KD, and leads immediately to inflammation of all layers of the artery. The inflammation spreads completely around the artery; as a result, structural components of the artery undergo intense damage; the artery then begins to dilate. Inflammatory cell infiltration continues until about the 25th day of the disease, after which the inflammatory cells gradually decrease in number. KD arteritis is characterized by granulomatous inflammation that consists of severe accumulation of monocytes/macrophages. Aberrant activation of monocytes/macrophages is thought to be involved in the formation of vascular lesions. The lesions in all the arteries are relatively synchronous as they evolve from acute to chronic injury. There is no fibrinoid necrosis nor any mixture of acute inflammatory lesions and scarring lesions, which are characteristics in polyarteritis nodosa in KD.

### Autoinflammatory manifestations in adult patients [^4fa2deaf]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Autoinflammatory diseases represent a family of immune-mediated conditions characterized by the unchecked activation of innate immunity. These conditions share common clinical features such as recurrent fever, inflammatory arthritis, and elevation of acute phase reactants, in the absence of an identified infectious etiology, generally without detectable serum autoantibodies, with variable response to glucocorticoids and in some cases colchicine, which represented the mainstay of treatment until cytokine blockade therapies became available. The first autoinflammatory diseases to be described were monogenic disorders caused by missense mutations in inflammasome components and were recognized predominantly during childhood or early adulthood. However, the progress of genetic analyses and a more detailed immunological phenotyping capacity led to the discovery a wide spectrum of diseases, often becoming manifest or being diagnosed in the adult population. The beneficial role of targeting hyperinflammation via interleukin 1 in complex non-immune-mediated diseases is a field of growing clinical interest. We provide an overview of the autoinflammatory diseases of interest to physicians treating adult patients and to analyze the contribution of hyperinflammation in non-immune-mediated diseases; the result is intended to provide a roadmap to orient scientists and clinicians in this broad area.

### Immune alterations in a patient with SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome [^335ac6ca]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Along with these T cell populations, NK cells and monocyte/macrophages in the lung are at the first line of defense against pathogens. These cells produce a large array of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The high level of NK-cell proliferation and their disappearance from the blood suggest trafficking to the lung, which may contribute to lung-cell cytotoxicity. Three populations of monocytes, CD14 + CD16 −, CD14 + CD16 +, and CD14 − CD16 +, were at low or undetectable levels, also suggesting trafficking to the lung. CD14 + (CD16 + /CD16 −) cells have been shown to be capable of producing IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1 after activation, whereas CD14 dim CD16 + cells represent a monocyte subset that patrols blood vessels and selectively detects virally infected and damaged cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. Wei et al. recently reported the presence of inflammatory CD14 + CD16 + monocytes, suggesting an excessive activated immune response caused by pathogenic GM-CSF + Th1 cells, possibly linking them to the pulmonary immunopathology that leads to deleterious clinical manifestations after COVID-19 infections.

Although it may be speculative to draw conclusions from serum cytokine profiles to interpret the pathophysiological phenomena of the lung, the large number of factors analyzed and their changes throughout the illness may provide crucial information. First, we found elevated levels of certain biomarkers already described as prognostic markers of severe disease. For example, elevated levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP1-α, and TNF-α have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 patients in intensive care. Increased Th17, cytotoxic markers, IL-6, IP-10, MCP-3, and IL-1RA also appear to be associated with disease severity and fatal outcome in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Our data significantly extend these observations by the longitudinal survey of these changes. The various waves of markers suggest different stages, from a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm and Th1 and Th2 activation to T cell exhaustion, apoptosis, and cell cytotoxicity. It is difficult to correlate these features with clinical worsening from a single case, but a careful follow-up of these profiles in patients in ICUs may help to identify new prognostic markers or those of COVID-19 severity.

### Recommendations for the management of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in adults [^50ad5736]. Blood (2019). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, more specifically with respect to classification, HS 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that primary and secondary hemophagocytic syndromes, including macrophage activating syndrome, are hyperferritinemic, hyperinflammatory syndromes with a common terminal pathway but with different pathogenetic roots.
