## Question

A 76-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF 32%) presents for follow-up. She reports increasing fatigue and mild shortness of breath on exertion, but no chest pain or orthopnea. She has recently been hospitalized for heart failure decompensation. On examination, she appears frail, walks slowly, and requires assistance with some daily activities. Her medications are optimized, and her laboratory results are stable. The multidisciplinary heart failure team is discussing next steps to improve her functional status and quality of life.

According to current ESC guidelines, what non-pharmacological intervention should be considered for this patient, and why?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which non-pharmacological intervention should be considered for a 76-year-old woman with HFrEF, recent decompensation, and frailty to improve functional status and quality of life, and why this aligns with current ESC guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's phenotype and severity, including frailty and recent hospitalization. Then, I should verify which non-pharmacological options are guideline-endorsed and how they are graded. Next, I will weigh the evidence base for supervised exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, especially in older, frail patients. After that, I should consider alternative or adjunctive non-pharmacologic strategies and why they are less appropriate as the primary choice here. Finally, I will outline a practical, safety-conscious implementation plan and summarize the recommendation with supporting citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype and severity. This is chronic HFrEF with LVEF 32%, recent decompensation requiring hospitalization, and clinically evident frailty with reduced functional capacity, which places her in a high-risk, symptomatic category where guideline-directed non-pharmacologic therapies can meaningfully impact symptoms and outcomes if appropriately selected and supervised [^111Nnx1q] [^111KPWHL].

> I need to check which non-pharmacological interventions are explicitly recommended in current ESC guidance. The 2021 ESC guideline advises offering supervised, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to patients with more severe disease, frailty, or comorbidities, and broadly recommends advising exercise in all patients able to participate to improve exercise capacity, quality of life, and reduce HF hospitalization, which directly addresses this patient's goals and risk profile [^111Nnx1q] [^1133vK4i].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the strength of evidence and safety in frail, older adults. The HF-ACTION randomized trial demonstrated that structured aerobic exercise training is safe and, after adjustment for prognostic variables, associated with modest but significant reductions in all-cause mortality or hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality or HF hospitalization, with no excess adverse events, supporting feasibility even in patients with NYHA III symptoms and reduced EF, which is reassuring for frail older adults when appropriately risk-stratified and supervised [^114BYkJU]. Contemporary reviews and guideline summaries also emphasize that exercise-based rehabilitation is safe across HF phenotypes when standard precautions are followed, including in home-based settings, which is pertinent for older adults with limited mobility [^notfound].

> Let me consider alternatives and why they are not the primary choice here. Multidisciplinary HF management programs are strongly recommended to reduce hospitalization and mortality, but they are not exclusively non-pharmacologic and are already implied by the "optimized medications" and team-based care context; they do not, by themselves, deliver the structured exercise stimulus needed to improve frailty and functional capacity in this patient [^114nwX5j]. Self-management education is important, yet it lacks the proven benefits on exercise tolerance and frailty reversal that supervised rehabilitation provides in this setting [^117DgTkj]. Device therapies like CRT or ICD are not indicated solely for frailty or functional limitation without meeting specific electrocardiographic and remodeling criteria, and would not address the immediate goal of improving functional status and quality of life in this scenario [^112ahQer].

> Wait, let me verify the practical implementation details so I don't miss safety steps. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation should be initiated only after clinical stabilization, with preliminary risk stratification and individualized prescription; programs typically combine supervised sessions with home-based components, progress gradually, and incorporate education and self-care, which is especially important in older adults with frailty and comorbidities to avoid adverse events and maximize adherence [^117DgTkj]. I should confirm that the team coordinates referral, monitors symptoms, vitals, and functional metrics during titration, and adapts intensity to tolerance, aligning with ESC guidance to individualize rehabilitation in patients with frailty or comorbidities [^111Nnx1q].

> I should double-check that this aligns with broader consensus statements. The ACC/AHA/HFSA guideline similarly recommends exercise training to improve functional status, exercise performance, and health-related quality of life in patients with HF who are able to participate, reinforcing that supervised rehabilitation is an evidence-based, underutilized pillar of care that should be prioritized in symptomatic HFrEF, including older adults when safely implemented [^117GxGsT] [^116rCMFn].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate non-pharmacological intervention to prioritize for this 76-year-old frail woman with HFrEF and recent decompensation is supervised, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, because it is explicitly endorsed by the 2021 ESC guideline for patients with more severe disease or frailty, has supportive randomized evidence for improving functional outcomes and reducing HF hospitalizations, and directly targets her goals of improving fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and quality of life in a safe, structured manner when initiated after stabilization with appropriate risk stratification and monitoring [^111Nnx1q] [^1133vK4i] [^114BYkJU] [^117DgTkj].

---

The most appropriate non-pharmacological intervention for this 76-year-old woman with HFrEF, frailty, and recent hospitalization is **supervised cardiac rehabilitation** [^111Nnx1q] with individualized, progressive exercise training. ESC 2021 guidelines recommend supervised, exercise-based rehabilitation for patients with severe disease, frailty, or comorbidities because it improves functional capacity, quality of life, and reduces heart failure hospitalizations [^1133vK4i] [^114BYkJU]. Given her frailty and recent decompensation, a **multidisciplinary, home-based or hybrid program** with close monitoring is preferred to maximize safety and adherence [^114nwX5j] [^117DgTkj].

---

## Rationale for supervised cardiac rehabilitation

Supervised cardiac rehabilitation is a **structured, multidisciplinary program** that includes exercise training, education, and psychosocial support. It is tailored to patients' comorbidities, functional status, and preferences, making it particularly suitable for older adults with frailty and multiple comorbidities [^117DgTkj].

---

## Evidence supporting supervised cardiac rehabilitation

The ESC 2021 guidelines explicitly recommend supervised, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for patients with severe disease, frailty, or comorbidities, citing improvements in functional capacity, quality of life, and reductions in heart failure hospitalizations [^111Nnx1q] [^1133vK4i]. The HF-ACTION randomized controlled trial demonstrated that exercise training in patients with HFrEF significantly improved functional capacity and quality of life, with a trend toward reduced cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalizations [^114BYkJU]. Meta-analyses corroborate these benefits, showing consistent improvements in exercise capacity, quality of life, and reductions in heart failure hospitalizations across diverse patient populations, including older adults and those with comorbidities [^notfound].

---

## Benefits of supervised cardiac rehabilitation in elderly, frail patients

Elderly patients with heart failure and frailty face unique challenges, including reduced functional reserve, increased risk of falls, and difficulty adhering to exercise programs. Supervised cardiac rehabilitation addresses these challenges through:

- **Individualized assessment and risk stratification**: Ensuring patient safety by tailoring exercise intensity and modality to functional capacity and comorbidities [^117DgTkj].

- **Progressive, supervised exercise training**: Improving cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, balance, and coordination, thereby enhancing functional independence and quality of life [^117GxGsT].

- **Education and self-management support**: Empowering patients to manage symptoms, adhere to medications, and recognize early signs of decompensation, reducing hospital readmissions [^111KPWHL].

- **Psychosocial support**: Addressing depression, anxiety, and social isolation, which are common in elderly patients with chronic heart failure [^notfound].

---

## Practical considerations for implementation

Given the patient's frailty and recent hospitalization, a **home-based or hybrid supervised cardiac rehabilitation program** is recommended. Home-based programs offer flexibility, convenience, and safety, particularly for patients with limited mobility or transportation challenges. Hybrid models combine supervised sessions at a rehabilitation center with home-based exercises, ensuring adequate supervision while accommodating patient preferences and logistical constraints [^notfound].

---

## Safety considerations

Safety is paramount in elderly, frail patients. Supervised cardiac rehabilitation programs incorporate rigorous risk stratification, continuous monitoring, and gradual progression of exercise intensity. The risk of adverse events is low, and the benefits generally outweigh the risks when programs are appropriately supervised and individualized [^117DgTkj].

---

## Alternative non-pharmacological interventions

While supervised cardiac rehabilitation is the primary recommendation, other non-pharmacological interventions may be considered adjunctively:

- **Nutritional counseling**: Addressing malnutrition and sarcopenia, common in elderly patients with heart failure [^notfound].

- **Fall prevention strategies**: Including balance training, strength exercises, and home safety modifications [^notfound].

- **Psychosocial interventions**: Addressing depression, anxiety, and social isolation through counseling and support groups [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Supervised cardiac rehabilitation is the most appropriate non-pharmacological intervention for this 76-year-old woman with HFrEF, frailty, and recent hospitalization. It offers comprehensive, individualized care that addresses her functional limitations, comorbidities, and quality of life. A **home-based or hybrid program**, with close monitoring and multidisciplinary support, is recommended to maximize safety, adherence, and clinical outcomes [^111Nnx1q] [^1133vK4i].

The 2013 (with updates in 2016 and 2017) American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines provide practical evidence-based clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of both acute and chronic heart failure (HF). Both guidelines address noninvasive and invasive testing to establish the diagnosis of HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction. Extensive trial evidence supports the use of guideline-directed medical therapy and device-based therapies for the optimal management of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Specific recommendations are also provided for HF with preserved ejection fraction although the evidence is substantially weaker. Management of medical comorbidities is now addressed in both guidelines. Acute HF and end-stage disease requiring advanced therapies are also discussed. This review compares specific recommendations across the spectrum of HF phenotypes and disease severity, highlights areas where differences exist, and lists consequential studies published since the latest guidelines.

In this network meta-analysis, 19 randomized clinical trials enrolling 20 633 patients with HFpEF or HFmrEF were included. Compared with placebo, no included drug classes were associated with a reduced risk of death, but sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists were associated with a significant decrease in hospital admission for HF; SGLT2 inhibitors were the optimal drug class for decreasing the risk of admission for HF. Meaning The results of this study suggest that the incremental use of combinations of SGLT2 inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors–angiotensin receptor blockers, and β-blockers was associated with accumulative benefits in HF hospitalization rather than all-cause death among patients with HFpEF and HFmrEF.

Results In this analysis, 19 randomized clinical trials, including 20 633 patients with HF and an ejection fraction of 40% or more, without a remarkable risk of bias were included. Compared with placebo, no treatments were associated with a significant reduction in the risk of all-cause death or cardiovascular death. Approximately 64 million people worldwide have heart failure, with considerable related morbidity and mortality. 1, 2 Based on the left ventricular ejection fraction, recent guidelines classify HF into HF with reduced ejection fraction, HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction, and HF with preserved ejection fraction. 3, 4. This analysis included randomized clinical trials with follow-up of more than 3 months of adult patients with symptomatic HF and LVEF of 40% or more, assessing any of the following interventions: ARNIs, MRAs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, SGLT2 inhibitors, and β-blockers.

Outcomes estimated in this analysis included all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and first hospital admission for HF during the entire follow-up period. These outcomes were reported as efficacy or safety end points in the included studies. In this network analysis, 11 855 publications were identified, and 19 RCTs, including a total of 20 633 patients with HF and an ejection fraction of 40% or more, were included after screening; 19 trials reported all-cause death, 16 trials reported cardiovascular death, and 12 trials reported hospital admission for HF. Network diagrams of direct evidence based on RCTs are presented in Figure 1. Multiple direct connections among the intervention classes comprised 52 761 patient-years for death from any cause, 52 090 patient-years for death from cardiovascular causes, and 50 524 patient-years for HF hospitalization.

Figure 2 shows the population characteristics at baseline stratified by intervention classes, demonstrating the transitivity of our network meta-analysis. The age, sex, obesity degree, hemodynamics, and LVEF of the populations were deemed similar among the 7 different intervention classes. The cardiac function of the eligible population was primarily concentrated in New York Heart Association Class II and III. The 2021 European Society of Cardiology HF guidelines proposed the hypothesis that the lack of disease-modifying effects of drugs among patients with HFpEF was probably caused by the interference of concomitant drugs. 3 For practical reasons, a trial confirming this hypothesis was difficult to implement, but the results of the sensitivity analysis to some degree explain this hypothesis.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^117SCKvy]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

The care of patients with chronic heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction should be determined by the evidence from large‐scale randomized controlled trials that form the basis of accepted standards of practice. Numerous guideline documents have issued recommendations to clinicians. 1, 2 These describe the treatments that should be prescribed (class I); those that are appropriate but are not mandated (class II); and those that should not be used (class III). However, guidelines typically do not describe what constitutes an acceptable standard of care. As a result of this uncertainty, practitioners who adhere to only one or two recommendations could contend that they are treating patients with heart failure 'in accordance with the guidelines'.

How should we identify treatments that are essential in the management of chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction?

Guideline documents include hundreds of recommendations; however, the class I recommendations that are considered essential for most patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction are the treatments that prolong survival.

Prolongation of survival versus improvement in symptoms

Why do class I recommendations focus on interventions that reduce the risk of death? This emphasis does not imply that an improvement in symptoms and signs is unimportant. However, all clinical trials that form the basis of current recommendations focused on major outcomes, and thus, we have little data about the effect of treatments on quality of life. Furthermore, strategies that are directed primarily towards the relief of symptoms and signs must be tailored to the needs of individual patients and vary considerably among patients and over time in the same patients. 9 The doses of drugs that are needed to ameliorate symptoms are unpredictable, and it is nearly impossible to determine whether the degree of achieved symptom relief is appropriate or adequate on an individual basis. Importantly, efforts to treat symptoms are not exquisitely time‐sensitive, i.e. there is no ethical mandate to achieve a specific level of symptom improvement in a defined period of time.

The highly unpredictable and non‐standardized approach to achieving symptom relief contrasts markedly with the principles that govern the prescribing of drugs that prolong life. The efficacy of mortality‐reducing treatments has been established on a population basis in clinical trials where patients were treated using a standardized approach; thus, the strategies that prolong survival do not vary among patients or over time in the same patients. Furthermore, the use of drugs that reduce mortality cannot be ethically delayed; any meaningful delay means that deaths will occur that could have been prevented by early intervention. 10, 11 Because of this high level of standardization, it is much easier to ascertain whether patients are receiving appropriate treatment with life‐prolonging drugs than to determine if they are receiving adequate therapy for the relief of symptoms.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^117TPoVW]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Given the current state of affairs, most practitioners who claim that patients are receiving 'guideline‐directed medical therapy' are making a judgment that is not based on objective criteria. 8 No set of standards has been developed to define 'optimal medical therapy'. Anyone who asserts that their patients are being managed appropriately is providing a well‐intentioned (but personal) opinion, since no one has defined what combination of treatments should be considered 'optimal', 'acceptable', 'adequate', 'reasonable' or 'guideline‐directed'.

### Differences in presentation, diagnosis and management of heart failure in women. A scientific statement of the heart failure association of the ESC [^111kNqyB]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the progress in the care of individuals with heart failure (HF), important sex disparities in knowledge and management remain, covering all the aspects of the syndrome, from aetiology and pathophysiology to treatment. Important distinctions in phenotypic presentation are widely known, but the mechanisms behind these differences are only partially defined. The impact of sex-specific conditions in the predisposition to HF has gained progressive interest in the HF community. Under-recruitment of women in large randomized clinical trials has continued in the more recent studies despite epidemiological data no longer reporting any substantial difference in the lifetime risk and prognosis between sexes. Target dose of medications and criteria for device eligibility are derived from studies with a large predominance of men, whereas specific information in women is lacking. The present scientific statement encompasses the whole scenario of available evidence on sex-disparities in HF and aims to define the most challenging and urgent residual gaps in the evidence for the scientific and clinical HF communities.

### Rationale and design of the ESC heart failure III registry-implementation and discovery [^113okydQ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Heart failure outcomes remain poor despite advances in therapy. The European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure III Registry (ESC HF III Registry) aims to characterize HF clinical features and outcomes and to assess implementation of guideline-recommended therapy in Europe and other ESC affiliated countries.

Methods

Between 1 November 2018 and 31 December 2020, 10162 patients with chronic or acute/worsening HF with reduced, mildly reduced, or preserved ejection fraction were enrolled from 220 centres in 41 European or ESC affiliated countries. The ESC HF III Registry collected data on baseline characteristics (hospital or clinic presentation), hospital course, diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in hospital and at the clinic visit; and on outcomes at 12-month follow-up. These data include demographics, medical history, physical examination, biomarkers and imaging, quality of life, treatments, and interventions - including drug doses and reasons for non-use, and cause-specific outcomes.

Conclusion

The ESC HF III Registry will provide comprehensive and unique insight into contemporary HF characteristics, treatment implementation, and outcomes, and may impact implementation strategies, clinical discovery, trial design, and public policy.

### Adherence to guideline-directed medical treatments in heart failure. A scientific statement of the heart failure association (HFA) of the ESC and the ESC working group on cardiovascular pharmacotherapy [^112yLu5i]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) affects over 60 million individuals globally. Contemporary guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT) reduce cardiovascular mortality and HF hospitalizations. However, medication non-adherence represents a critical barrier limiting real-world efficacy of GDMT. This scientific statement aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding, measuring, and addressing medication non-adherence in HF management across diverse healthcare settings. Addressing medication non-adherence requires systematic, multifaceted approaches targeting individual patient barriers while implementing system-level interventions. Polypills, digital monitoring platforms, enhanced patient education and empowerment, and multidisciplinary care models represent promising strategies to optimize therapeutic adherence and improve clinical outcomes in HF management.

### Clinical management and therapeutic optimization of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and low blood pressure. A clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association (HFA) of the ESC [^116vQmA7]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite major advancements in heart failure (HF) management and guideline recommendations over the past two decades, real-world evidence highlights suboptimal implementation of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Low blood pressure (BP) is common in HFrEF patients and represents a major perceived barrier to implementing life-saving treatments in clinical practice, as physicians are often concerned about symptomatic hypotension and its consequences. Although low BP can be seen in those hospitalized with signs of shock, the most common scenario involves non-severe, asymptomatic hypotension in patients receiving foundational therapy for HFrEF, where premature down-titration or discontinuation of GDMT should be avoided. This clinical consensus statement provides a comprehensive overview of low BP in HFrEF, including its definition, risk factors, and effects of HF therapies on BP. We propose management pathways to optimize HFrEF treatment in the context of low BP, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes.

### Contemporary American and European Guidelines for heart failure management: JACC: heart Failure guideline comparison [^115ke5zp]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

This review serves to compare contemporary clinical practice recommendations for the management of heart failure (HF), as codified in the 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline, the 2022 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA)/Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) guideline, and the 2023 focused update of the 2021 ESC document. Overall, these guidelines aim to solidify significant advances throughout the HF continuum since the publication of previous full guideline iterations (2013 and 2016 for the ACC/AHA and ESC, respectively). All guidelines provide new recommendations for an increasingly complex landscape of HF care, with focus on primary HF prevention, HF stages, rapid initiation and optimization of evidence-based pharmacotherapies, overlapping cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities, device-based therapies, and management pathways for special groups of patients, including those with cardiac amyloidosis. Importantly, the ACC/AHA/HFSA document features special emphasis on HF risk prediction and screening, cost/value, social determinants of health, and health care disparities.

### Patterns of comorbidities differentially impact on in-hospital outcomes in heart failure patients [^117K4D5T]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The present study recalls attention to the role of non-cardiac comorbidities in predicting in-hospital outcome in HF patients admitted to an internal medicine unit – where HF is present in 11% of hospitalized patients.

Since the hospital admission of these very old HF patients with several non-cardiac comorbidities will continue to increase, it is imperative that we optimize the management of non-cardiovascular conditions to improve outcomes and reduce early in-hospital mortality – accomplishing the recommendation of ESC Guidelines "In addition to optimizing medical and device therapies for HF, attention should also be given to how HF care is delivered", i.e. implementing the models of care and disseminating a multidisciplinary management of older HF patients.

Improved management of HF patients in the pre-discharge and early post-discharge phase after hospitalization will be critical to reduce the burden of re-hospitalization and increase the time spent at home.

Future studies are encouraged to adopt a multidisciplinary approach to the growing older HF patients, which will simplify the identification of more risky phenotypes and the early identification of preventable factors precipitating hospitalization.

### Heart failure diagnosis in the general community-who, how and when? A clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^115t6bf6]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

A significant proportion of patients experience delays in the diagnosis of heart failure due to the non-specific signs and symptoms of the syndrome. Diagnostic tools such as measurement of natriuretic peptide concentrations are fundamentally important when screening for heart failure, yet are frequently under-utilized. This clinical consensus statement provides a diagnostic framework for general practitioners and non-cardiology community-based physicians to recognize, investigate and risk-stratify patients presenting in the community with possible heart failure.

### Advanced heart failure: a position statement of the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^111e3UuP]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

This article updates the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2007 classification of advanced heart failure and describes new diagnostic and treatment options for these patients. Recognizing the patient with advanced heart failure is critical to facilitate timely referral to advanced heart failure centres. Unplanned visits for heart failure decompensation, malignant arrhythmias, co-morbidities, and the 2016 ESC guidelines criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are included in this updated definition. Standard treatment is, by definition, insufficient in these patients. Inotropic therapy may be used as a bridge strategy, but it is only a palliative measure when used on its own, because of the lack of outcomes data. Major progress has occurred with short-term mechanical circulatory support devices for immediate management of cardiogenic shock and long-term mechanical circulatory support for either a bridge to transplantation or as destination therapy. Heart transplantation remains the treatment of choice for patients without contraindications. Some patients will not be candidates for advanced heart failure therapies. For these patients, who are often elderly with multiple co-morbidities, management of advanced heart failure to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life should be emphasized. Robust evidence from prospective studies is lacking for most therapies for advanced heart failure. There is an urgent need to develop evidence-based treatment algorithms to prolong life when possible and in accordance with patient preferences, increase life quality, and reduce the burden of hospitalization in this vulnerable patient population.

Updates to ESC guidelines

The opening session of European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2023 offered an introduction to the several updates to ESC guidelines premiering at the conference. These updates include recommendations (1) on the management of; (2) to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with; (3) on treatment of; and (4) on the treatment of — the first international guidelines on this topic.

Notable updates include a new diagnostic algorithm for endocarditis; the introduction of a new scoring system, SCORE2-Diabetes, to estimate the 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes; a new section on the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients with cancer and the combining of the 2017 and 2020 guidelines for patients with and without ST-segment elevation.

An — the focus of this year's congress — was also presented, reflecting the huge progress in this field since ESC's 2021 guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure. More than 10 randomised controlled trials have been released within this time. New recommendations are provided in three areas: chronic heart failure, acute heart failure, and comorbidities and prevention. Integral to ESC guidelines are theused to indicate whether a therapy is recommended or not (Class 1–3) and the level of confidence in the recommendations (level A–C), where Class 1A is the highest. This interim update only included results that would lead to new or changed Class 1 or 2A recommendations and at least 75% of taskforce members had to agree on inclusions. Notable updates include a historic Class 1A recommendation for use of a sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor in heart failure with preserved and mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFpEF and HPmrEF).

The inclusion of patient perspectives in these guideline updates is welcome; with the inclusion of new sections on patient-centred care stressing the importance of respecting individual preferences, explaining alternatives, and including patients in decision making as much as possible.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^111NNmY2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Numerous guideline documents have issued recommendations to clinicians concerning the treatment of chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. However, guidelines do not describe what constitutes an acceptable standard of care, and thus, practitioners who adhere to only a small fraction of the recommendations might claim that they are treating patients 'in accordance with the guidelines'. As a result, < 1% of patients with heart failure are receiving all life-prolonging treatments at trial-proven doses. A major impediment to the widespread adoption of trial-based treatments is a lack of any existing framework that would allow physicians to describe the adequacy of care. To address this deficiency, we propose a novel simple approach that would ask practitioners if a patient had been treated using the dosing algorithm that had been shown to be effective for each drug class. The proposed framework recognizes that all landmark survival trials in heart failure were 'strategy trials', i.e. the studies mandated a standardized forced-titration treatment plan that required timely uptitration to specified target dose unless patients experienced clinically meaningful, intolerable or serious adverse events, which persisted or recurred despite adjustment of other medications. Adherence to trial-proven regimens might be improved if physicians were asked to describe the degree to which a patient's treatment adhered to or deviated from the strategies that had been used to demonstrate the survival benefits of neurohormonal antagonists. The proposed framework should also promote practitioner self-awareness about the lack of evidence supporting the current widespread use of subtarget doses that are non-adherent with trial-proven forced-titration strategies.

Heart failure has become a worldwide epidemic of the 21st century with increasing impact on healthcare systems. The 2012 ESC and 2013 ACCF/AHA guidelines have set the stage for current therapy to reduce mortality and morbidity. There is a dawn of hope for therapy of acute and diastolic heart failure; it has become clearer that patients benefit from mitral reconstruction and which patients benefit from heart failure management programmes; genetics and proteomics advance in great strides; competing concepts of cell therapy seem to spiral, hopefully upwards; and we can further nurture our hope for evidence-based individualized diagnostic and therapy.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) clinical assessment — after guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is initiated and titrated, patients with chronic HFrEF should be evaluated regularly, with a reasonable interval every 3 to 6 months, though many may need more frequent follow-up to monitor stability and further titration. Cardiac rehabilitation is helpful but underused, and virtual care for outpatient GDMT titration has been useful and is expected to play an increasingly larger role, particularly for medication titration. High-risk features summarized by "I NEED HELP" should trigger consideration for referral for an advanced heart failure consultation.

### Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: a review… [^112ahQer]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Murphy SP, Ibrahim NE, Januzzi JL. Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction: A Review. JAMA. 2020; 324: 488–504. doi: 10.1001/jama.2020.10262 Importance Worldwide, the burden of heart failure has increased to an estimated 23 million people, and approximately 50% of cases are HF with reduced ejection fraction. Observations Heart failure is a clinical syndrome characterized by dyspnea or exertional limitation due to impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood or both. HFrEF occurs when the left ventricular ejection fraction is 40% or less and is accompanied by progressive left ventricular dilatation and adverse cardiac remodeling. Assessment for heart failure begins with obtaining a medical history and physical examination. Also central to diagnosis are elevated natriuretic peptides above age- and context-specific thresholds and identification of left ventricular systolic dysfunction with LVEF of 40% or less as measured by echocardiography.

Treatment strategies include the use of diuretics to relieve symptoms and application of an expanding armamentarium of disease-modifying drug and device therapies. Unless there are specific contraindications, patients with HFrEF should be treated with a β-blocker and one of an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker as foundational therapy, with addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in patients with persistent symptoms. Ivabradine and hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate also have a role in the care of certain patients with HFrEF. More recently, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors have further improved disease outcomes, significantly reducing cardiovascular and all-cause mortality irrespective of diabetes status, and vericiguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, reduces heart failure hospitalization in high-risk patients with HFrEF.

Device therapies may be beneficial in specific subpopulations, such as cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with interventricular dyssynchrony, transcatheter mitral valve repair in patients with severe secondary mitral regurgitation, and implantable cardiac defibrillators in patients with more severe left ventricular dysfunction particularly of ischemic etiology. Conclusions and Relevance HFrEF is a major public health concern with substantial morbidity and mortality. The management of HFrEF has seen significant scientific breakthrough in recent decades, and the ability to alter the natural history of the disease has never been better. Recent developments include SGLT2 inhibitors, vericiguat, and transcatheter mitral valve repair, all of which incrementally improve prognosis beyond foundational neurohormonal therapies. Disease morbidity and mortality remain high, with a 5-year survival rate of 25% after hospitalization for HFrEF.

### Patterns of comorbidities differentially impact on in-hospital outcomes in heart failure patients [^111o3K2P]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Characterizing co-morbidity with high prevalence in hospitalized HF patients and elucidating their selective impact on in-hospital outcome may improve risk stratification of HF patients, showing potential treatments and interventions and better understanding of underlying mechanisms. All together, these findings underline once more that about half of hospitalizations occur in patients with HF rather than because of HF, i.e. because of acute HF decompensation. Of note, at any level of comorbidity the length of stay was greater in HFs than in HFp patients. Factors underlying this observation have not been adequately characterized. It is likely that non-cardiac comorbidities impact on optimal innovative medication titration) and lead to a greater occurrence of side effects concerning the quality of life of older HF patients (particularly hypotension, and medication-medication or medication-disease interactions).

Novel risk stratification algorithms and multidisciplinary models of care will improve the management of older HF patients with cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidities.

The impact of comorbidities on HF patients is such that ESC 2021 Guidelines encompassed a large section on both cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidities, highlighting their prevalence and their impact on specific dilemmas in the treatment. Additionally, ESC Guidelines foster the assessment of frailty in patients with HF. Comprehensive multidimensional assessment exploring the four domains of clinical, psycho-cognitive, functional, and social is promoted to postpone functional decline and reduce hospitalization in older HF patients. A similar recommendation had also been proposed by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology.

ACC Expert Consensus — principles for optimizing care in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) state that transcatheter mitral valve repair may be considered in symptomatic patients with chronic, moderate-severe to severe MR despite optimal doses of all guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). Principle 9 directs to focus on the patient's symptoms, functional capacity, and cardiac function; maintain surveillance of the patient's health status using validated symptom questionnaires (eg, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire), and cardiac rehabilitation should be used to improve patient-reported outcomes, reduce hospitalizations, and improve aerobic fitness. Principle 10 emphasizes that the value of a therapy to a patient is the combination of benefits and burdens as they relate to that patient's values, goals, and preferences, and shared decision-making will help patients and the health care team reach the best treatment plan. Principle 11 highlights that team-based care is critical to optimizing GDMT and may include frequent follow-up visits, telehealth visits, and remote monitoring; use multidisciplinary teams to help titrate GDMT, and team management also facilitates serial assessments and longitudinal care, including management of comorbidities.

Cardiac rhythm management devices: cornerstones of comprehensive, patient‐centred management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

According to current estimates, there are 60 million individuals with heart failure (HF) worldwide, and approximately one in four persons will develop HF during their lifetime.HF is a leading cause of hospitalization and its mortality remains high, with a 1‐year risk of 15–30% post‐hospital discharge. Half of the patients diagnosed with HF die within 5 years of diagnosis. Across European Society of Cardiology (ESC) member countries, HF accounts for 5.8% of total deaths (14.6% of cardiovascular disease deaths) in females and for 4.4% of total deaths (12.5% of cardiovascular disease deaths) in males.HF can affect quality of life (QoL) and the ability to carry out activities of daily living, as well as mental health and psychosocial well‐being. A patient‐centred, multidisciplinary approach is needed to achieve timely, evidence‐based and comprehensive care, optimizing the use of all therapeutic options including medications, medical devices, surgery or other procedures, lifestyle modifications, and regular patient monitoring, while considering patients' clinical characteristics and preferences.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is characterized by a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%and affects 40% to 50% of patients with HF. Current HF guidelines make strong recommendations for quadruple drug therapy in HFrEF, namely (1) angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNi) (or angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEi]/angiotensin receptor blockers [ARB]), (2) beta‐blockers, (3) mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), and (4) sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Rapid initiation of foundational pharmacological therapy is recommended, and survival advantages support early initiation of comprehensive treatment over sequential initiation and titration to target doses. Practitioners are encouraged to personalize treatment based on patient characteristics and comorbidities. After initiation and optimization of quadruple therapy, additional drug therapies can be considered in selected patients.

### Predictors of death without prior appropriate therapy in ICD recipients: the comorbidities, frailty and functional status (COMFFORT study) [^1146Wdt3]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) have been shown to reduce death from ventricular arrhythmias in patients have either survived a cardiac arrest or in those at risk of future cardiac arrest. Careful selection of appropriate patients for ICD therapy is important. Randomised controlled trials have shown that ICDs reduce all-cause mortality when the proportion of deaths prevented from lethal ventricular arrhythmias is sufficiently high to outweigh the number of deaths from non-sudden cardiovascularor non-cardiovascularcauses.

In real-world clinical practice, the selection of patients for an ICD is challenging. For example, consider two scenarios: (a) a 76-year-old widower with a history of remote myocardial infarction, persistent left ventricular (LV) systolic impairment despite optimal medical therapy with the most recent left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) estimated at 28%, chronic kidney disease stage IIIb with proteinuria, diabetes with moderate glycaemic control, carcinoma of the prostate on hormonal therapy and previous stroke with mild residual unilateral weakness necessitating the useful of a walking stick for balance; (b) a 79-year-old married man with a remote history of myocardial infarction, persistent LV systolic impairment on optimal medical management with the most recent LVEF estimated at 28% with a history of well-controlled hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia but good functional status. Which of these two patients is most likely to derive mortality benefit from ICD implantation?

The European Society of Cardiology Guidelines recommend a patient-centred approach to communicating the risks and benefits of ICD therapy. Implantation of an ICD is only recommended in patients who have an expectation of good quality survival of over 1 year. However, the metrics that determine 'good quality survival' are obscure. Clinical risk scores can be employed to facilitate joint decision-making with patients but these tools should not be relied on to make decisions about ICD implantation.

As patients age and accumulate comorbidities, the risk of non-cardiac death from competitive causes increases. Such 'competing risks of death' reduce the potential benefit of ICD therapy on overall mortality. Patients dying from non-cardiac comorbidities, who have not received any appropriate ICD therapy, gain no benefit from ICD implantation, and this patient group is not well characterised.

This study evaluates real world ICD clinical practice, reporting the assessment of comorbidities, frailty and self-reported health status as competitors to sudden cardiac death (SCD) for mortality in ICD recipients who never receive appropriate ICD therapy.

### Efficacy and safety of exercise training in patients with chronic heart failure: HF-ACTION randomized controlled trial [^114BYkJU]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context

Guidelines recommend that exercise training be considered for medically stable outpatients with heart failure. Previous studies have not had adequate statistical power to measure the effects of exercise training on clinical outcomes.

Objective

To test the efficacy and safety of exercise training among patients with heart failure.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Multicenter, randomized controlled trial of 2331 medically stable outpatients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Participants in Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training (HF-ACTION) were randomized from April 2003 through February 2007 at 82 centers within the United States, Canada, and France; median follow-up was 30 months.

Interventions

Usual care plus aerobic exercise training, consisting of 36 supervised sessions followed by home-based training, or usual care alone.

Main Outcome Measures

Composite primary end point of all-cause mortality or hospitalization and prespecified secondary end points of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization, and cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization.

Results

The median age was 59 years, 28% were women, and 37% had New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms. Heart failure etiology was ischemic in 51%, and median left ventricular ejection fraction was 25%. Exercise adherence decreased from a median of 95 minutes per week during months 4 through 6 of follow-up to 74 minutes per week during months 10 through 12. A total of 759 patients (65%) in the exercise training group died or were hospitalized compared with 796 patients (68%) in the usual care group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.84–1.02]; P = 0.13). There were nonsignificant reductions in the exercise training group for mortality (189 patients [16%] in the exercise training group vs 198 patients [17%] in the usual care group; HR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.79–1.17]; P = 0.70), cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization (632 [55%] in the exercise training group vs 677 [58%] in the usual care group; HR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.83–1.03]; P = 0.14), and cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization (344 [30%] in the exercise training group vs 393 [34%] in the usual care group; HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.75–1.00]; P = 0.06). In prespecified supplementary analyses adjusting for highly prognostic baseline characteristics, the HRs were 0.89 (95% CI, 0.81–0.99; P = 0.03) for all-cause mortality or hospitalization, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.82–1.01; P = 0.09) for cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization, and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.74–0.99; P = 0.03) for cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization. Other adverse events were similar between the groups.

Conclusions

In the protocol-specified primary analysis, exercise training resulted in nonsignificant reductions in the primary end point of all-cause mortality or hospitalization and in key secondary clinical end points. After adjustment for highly prognostic predictors of the primary end point, exercise training was associated with modest significant reductions for both all-cause mortality or hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization.

### Heart failure improvement, remission, and recovery: a European journal of heart failure expert consensus document [^115WEhXr]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a heterogeneous and dynamic syndrome characterized by progressive pathophysiological alterations, variable clinical trajectories, and differential responses to therapeutic interventions. The concept of HF with improved ejection fraction (HFimpEF) underscores this complexity, identifying patients who exhibit an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) following time and/or pharmacological and device-based therapies. However, the distinction between improvement, remission, and recovery remains inconsistently defined and is primarily LVEF-centric, lacking comprehensive assessment of structural, functional, and symptomatic HF status. This expert consensus document delineates HF trajectories, examines factors reflecting HF improvement beyond recovery of LVEF, and explores the prognostic implications of these phenotypic transitions. Emphasis is placed on the necessity of continued guideline-directed medical and device therapy to minimize the risk of relapse. While a subset of patients attains sustained myocardial and clinical recovery, others remain susceptible to relapse, necessitating individualized monitoring and long-term management. Persistent knowledge gaps regarding the safety and feasibility of treatment de-escalation, the role of genetic predisposition, and optimal therapeutic strategies underscore the need for further research to refine risk stratification and evidence-based decision-making in HFimpEF.

### Clinical practice update on heart failure 2019: pharmacotherapy, procedures, devices and patient management. An expert consensus meeting report of the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^114ajh73]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has published a series of guidelines on heart failure (HF) over the last 25years, most recently in 2016. Given the amount of new information that has become available since then, the Heart Failure Association (HFA) of the ESC recognized the need to review and summarise recent developments in a consensus document. Here we report from the HFA workshop that was held in January 2019 in Frankfurt, Germany. This expert consensus report is neither a guideline update nor a position statement, but rather a summary and consensus view in the form of consensus recommendations. The report describes how these guidance statements are supported by evidence, it makes some practical comments, and it highlights new research areas and how progress might change the clinical management of HF. We have avoided re-interpretation of information already considered in the 2016 ESC/HFA guidelines. Specific new recommendations have been made based on the evidence from major trials published since 2016, including sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes mellitus, MitraClip for functional mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation ablation in HF, tafamidis in cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis, rivaroxaban in HF, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in non-ischaemic HF, and telemedicine for HF. In addition, new trial evidence from smaller trials and updated meta-analyses have given us the chance to provide refined recommendations in selected other areas. Further, new trial evidence is due in many of these areas and others over the next 2years, in time for the planned 2021 ESC guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure.

### Cardiac rehabilitation for heart failure:' cinderella' or evidence-based pillar of care? [^117DgTkj]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Are there any safety concerns?

Evidence regarding exercise-based rehabilitation in heart failure is derived from studies implementing exercise training programmes that are considered safe. No major adverse effects of exercise training were reported in the included studies of above systematic review/meta-analyses. There is a general agreement across guidelines, that exercise intervention should only be initiated in stable individuals after medical therapy has been initiated and the clinical status is stable. The 2020 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on sports cardiology and exercise in patients with cardiovascular diseases have pointed out key components of risk stratification and preliminary evaluation ahead of exercise initiation. When these recommendations are followed, the overall risk of exercise is considered low, even during higher-intensity exercises, in patients with more severe heart failure, and in home-based settings.

Clinical guidance/guidelines for cardiac rehabilitation for heart failure

International heart failure guidelines, recommend rehabilitation (including patient education, self-care, and exercise training as a Class IA recommendation) for patients with chronic heart failure regardless of left ventricular ejection fraction which may also include those with cardiac implantable electronic or ventricular assist devices. Detailed guidance on providing the core components of cardiac rehabilitation in chronic heart failure has been prepared by the European Association of Preventive Cardiology. A rehabilitation programme duration can run from 8- to 36-week duration for up to 7 days/week with an emphasis on supervised exercise training.

The wide overlap between the syndromes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chronic heart failure (HF) means that familiarity with the 2021 European Society of Cardiology guidelines is of importance to nephrologists. The common risk factors for the two syndromes together with the adverse cardiac structural remodelling associated with CKD means that many kidney disease patients experience breathlessness and fall within the HF phenotypes categorized in the guidelines. The management of HF is evolving rapidly leading to significant changes in the latest guideline iteration. The 2021 guidelines have changed from the 2016 version firstly by an increased focus on identifying the three phenotypes of HF to guide appropriate evidence-based management. Secondly, a new and simplified treatment algorithm for HF with reduced ejection fraction involving the rapid sequential initiation and up-titration of four 'pillars' of drug treatment-angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-neprilysin inhibitors, beta blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and now, thanks to convincing trial data, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors. Thirdly, guidelines for device therapy have been changed with down-graded advice on indications for primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy for patients with non-ischaemic HF and for cardiac resynchronization therapy with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and a QRS duration < 150 ms. There are updated treatment plans for HF associated with non-cardiovascular comorbidities including CKD.

Which strategies are effective for the use of life‐prolonging drugs in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction?

In the landmark trials with neurohormonal antagonists, investigators were required to follow a forced‐titration strategy to achieve and maintain treatment with specified target doses for long periods of time. Therapy was initiated at a low dose, and the doses were progressively increased in planned increments at specific time intervals, until the target dose was achieved or unless patients experienced clinically meaningful or serious adverse events, which persisted or recurred despite adjustment of other medications. In general, asymptomatic changes in vital signs and laboratory tests were not considered to represent events that would prevent uptitration to target doses. If the study medication was discontinued or the dose was decreased, these were considered to be temporary events, and investigators were strongly encouraged to reinstitute treatment and achieve target doses. Importantly, in most trials, the target dose was the same for every patient in the study, and a large majority achieved and were continued on target doses for the duration of the trial. Patients were maintained on subtarget doses only if the use of higher doses had been shown to threaten clinical stability. This 'forced‐titration' strategy ensured that few patients were maintained for long periods on the doses that had been used for initiation of treatment.

However, in clinical practice, these forced‐titration strategies are followed very infrequently. As a result, most patients are not receiving all mandated classes of drugs, and when treated, they commonly receive doses that were prescribed at the time of initiation of treatment. 3, 4, 5 Although these subtarget dosing regimens may have benefits, their ability to prolong life has not been established.

### Dapagliflozin for treatment of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction… [^116SwmYj]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Parameters were tested across 95% CIs where available or across a reasonable distribution otherwise.

A, Two-way sensitivity analysis of monthly probability of cardiovascular death and hazard ratio for CVD at different willingness-to-pay thresholds. The monthly probability of CVD and the HR for CVD with dapagliflozin treatment were simultaneously varied across their respective distributions.

Event Probabilities and Rate Ratios Before and After Calibration. Objective To estimate the cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin therapy among patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Design, Setting, and Participants. In that study, 8 4744 patients were randomized to dapagliflozin or placebo and were followed up for a median of 18. 2 months. Dapagliflozin significantly reduced the primary composite end point of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, or urgent visits for heart failure; reduced the secondary outcome of cardiovascular death; and improved patient-reported health status. Dapagliflozin had similar effectiveness for patients with and without diabetes. We performed 2 secondary subgroup analyses in which we separately evaluated groups with and without diabetes within each arm and 2 different levels of health status impairment due to heart failure within each arm.

Both diabetes and heart failure health status affect the baseline morbidity rates. 8, 10–13 Although relative treatment effects appeared similar across diabetes status, the DAPA-HF trial suggested possible effectiveness differences between patients with more and less severe heart failure. Effectiveness point estimates were nonsignificantly smaller for patients with higher left ventricular ejection fraction and those without past hospitalization for heart failure. We stratified patients into mild and moderate impairment of health status due to heart failure using the KCCQ-TSS. Transition probabilities were based on DAPA-HF trial outcomes and the natural history of HFrEF. 8 Patients had a monthly risk of hospitalization for heart failure, hospitalization for other causes, left ventricular assist device implantation, heart transplantation, cardiovascular or noncardiovascular death, and treatment intolerance.

The monthly risk of hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular mortality, and noncardiovascular mortality for SOC were estimated from the DAPA-HF control arm. 8 We assumed risk increased with age based on prior literature. 25–27 For patients treated with dapagliflozin, the probability of hospitalization for heart failure and cardiovascular mortality were calculated based on the SOC rates multiplied by the DAPA-HF HR. For subgroup analyses, we estimated subgroup-specific event rates using DAPA-HF data when available and otherwise from the literature. For the diabetes subgroup analysis, we assumed a similar dapagliflozin effect in both arms. 12 For the subgroups with health status impairment due to heart failure, we used different treatment effects based on baseline KCCQ-TSS.

### Heart failure in non-caucasians, women, and older adults: a white paper on special populations from the Heart Failure Society of America guideline committee [^116rVebB]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Low credibility.

The presentation, natural history, clinical outcomes, and response to therapy in patients with heart failure differ in some ways across populations. Women, older adults, and non-Caucasian racial or ethnic groups compose a substantial proportion of the overall heart failure population, but they have typically been underrepresented in clinical trials. As a result, uncertainty exists about the efficacy of some guideline-directed medical therapies and devices in specific populations, which may result in the under- or overtreatment of these patients. Even when guideline-based treatments are prescribed, socioeconomic, physical, or psychologic factors may affect non-Caucasian and older adult patient groups to a different extent and affect the application, effectiveness, and tolerability of these therapies. Individualized therapy based on tailored biology (genetics, proteomics, metabolomics), socioeconomic and cultural considerations, and individual goals and preferences may be the optimal approach for managing diverse patients. This comprehensive approach to personalized medicine is evolving, but in the interim, the scientific community should continue efforts focused on intensifying research in special populations, prescribing guideline-directed medical therapy unless contraindicated, and implementing evidence-based strategies including patient and family education and multidisciplinary team care in the management of patients.

Concluding remarks and future directions

Despite compelling evidence that several neurohormonal antagonists used in combination have a striking effect to prolong survival in patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, most eligible patients are not receiving all recommended classes of drugs, and treated patients are usually prescribed subtarget doses. Typically, patients are receiving doses that are used for initiation of treatment; these doses are maintained for long periods of time, and no or little attempt is made to achieve target doses or show that patients are intolerant of higher doses. As a result, the vast majority of patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction in clinical practice are receiving treatments that have been demonstrated to exert meaningful effect on the natural history of the disease.

The failure of physicians to treat patients with trial‐proven regimens has numerous complex causes. However, an important contributor to the current state of affairs is the fact that physicians can readily claim that the use of subtarget doses is fully compatible with recommendations of current guidelines. Practice guidelines do not describe what regimens are acceptable, adequate or reasonable; thus, most treatments can be labelled as consistent with 'guideline‐directed medical therapy'.

Perhaps, adherence to the trial‐proven regimens might be markedly improved if physicians were asked to document the degree to which a patient's treatment adheres to or deviates from the strategies that were used to demonstrate the benefits of the neurohormonal antagonists that have demonstrated survival benefits. All of the landmark trials were 'strategy trials', i.e. the studies mandated a standardized forced‐titration treatment plan to a target dose. Investigators were required to increase the dose at specified increments and intervals to achieve a target dose, even if the patient experienced asymptomatic but unwanted changes in vital signs or laboratory tests. Investigators were also required to make repeated efforts to achieve and maintain target doses, often adjusting concomitant medications to improve the likelihood of tolerance. 'Forced‐titration strategies' were an essential element of every trial that demonstrated a survival benefit.

### How to handle polypharmacy in heart failure. A clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association of the ESC [^114tzubM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

The multiplicity of coexisting comorbidities affecting patients with heart failure (HF), together with the availability of multiple treatments improving prognosis in HF with reduced ejection fraction, has led to an increase in the number of prescribed medications to each patient. Polypharmacy is defined as the regular use of multiple medications, and over the last years has become an emerging aspect of HF care, particularly in older and frailer patients who are more frequently on multiple treatments, and are therefore more likely exposed to tolerability issues, drug-drug interactions and practical difficulties in management. Polypharmacy negatively affects adherence to treatment, and is associated with a higher risk of adverse drug reactions, impaired quality of life, more hospitalizations and worse prognosis. It is important to adopt and implement strategies for the management of polypharmacy from other medical disciplines, including medication reconciliation, therapeutic revision and treatment prioritization. It is also essential to develop new HF-specific strategies, with the primary goal of avoiding the use of redundant treatments, minimizing adverse drug reactions and interactions, and finally improving adherence. This clinical consensus statement document from the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology proposes a rationale, pragmatic and multidisciplinary approach to drug prescription in the current era of multimorbidity and 'multi-medication' in HF.

European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) affects more than 64 million people worldwide and is increasing in prevalence, especially HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Mortality and risk of HF hospitalization remain high and quality of life and functional capacity are poor.

Since the first heart transplantation in 1967, there has been remarkable development of medical therapy beyond diuretics and digitalis. Current class I guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) in the form of the four foundational classes — angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNi), beta‐blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2/1 inhibitors (SGLT2/1i) — antagonizes or modulates neurohormonal activation and additionally has favourable effects on the heart, kidney, vasculature and on inflammation and metabolism. The clinical effects extend to important improvements in quality of life and reductions in the risk of hospitalization for HF, and cardiovascular (CV) or all‐cause mortality. While for many decades GDMT was available only for patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), SGLT2/1i are now recommended across the ejection fraction (EF) spectrum, and the remaining three foundational drug classes may also be considered in HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF).

Despite these advances, outcomes over time have been suggested both to be improving and to be worsening. The major reason is poor implementation of existing therapy. Implementation science analyses have described quality indicators and reasons for poor initiation, up‐titration, adherence, and persistence. However, there have been no comprehensive studies of therapeutic decision making (i.e. changes in medical therapy) according to acute and outpatient HF care, chronic and de novo HF, and across the different EF categories. The rationale and design of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) HF III Registry have been described. Here we present the first co‐primary analysis from the HF III Registry, providing a comprehensive analysis of contemporary HF characteristics and GDMT decisions.
