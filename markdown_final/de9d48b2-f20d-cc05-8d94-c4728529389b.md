## Question

what causes diuresis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes diuresis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining diuresis and its subtypes. Then, I should categorize the major mechanisms that increase urine output. Next, I will examine each mechanism with representative examples and pathophysiology. After that, I should integrate special contexts like heart failure, diabetes, and post-obstructive states. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically oriented answer and note key differentiators and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misclassify mechanisms. Diuresis simply means increased urine output, and clinically we distinguish water diuresis (electrolyte-free water excretion) from solute diuresis (increased urine flow driven by osmotically active solutes), with polyuria typically defined as more than about 3 liters per day in adults, which helps frame the differential and testing strategy [^01cb98f9] [^d288b2ed].

> I will now examine the major categories. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify that the canonical framework remains solute versus water diuresis, with additional contributors including mechanical/hemodynamic factors and pharmacologic agents, and that this aligns with contemporary reviews and guidelines on polyuria and fluid disorders [^d288b2ed] [^01cb98f9] [^6e9798b2].

> Next, I should review solute diuresis, starting with osmotic diuresis from non-reabsorbed solutes. Hyperglycemia drives glucosuria and osmotic diuresis, a classic mechanism in diabetes and hyperglycemic crises, and SGLT2 inhibitors intentionally create glucosuria with natriuresis and osmotic diuresis, with magnitude attenuated as eGFR declines, which I need to keep in mind when interpreting clinical effects [^c0c5cece] [^d1a60390] [^5225b635] [^580a33a6]. Urea diuresis occurs after relief of urinary obstruction or with high protein loads, and exogenous urea can be used therapeutically to increase free water clearance in SIADH, which I should remember as a treatment nuance rather than just a pathophysiologic cause [^6588ce8f] [^652213b8]. Mannitol is a prototypical osmotic diuretic used to increase urine flow while expanding plasma volume, and I should confirm that its sodium losses can be clinically relevant in some settings [^f7bdf19e].

> Wait, let me verify the water diuresis side. Central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus cause large volumes of dilute urine due to AVP deficiency or resistance, respectively, and primary polydipsia can mimic this by suppressing AVP; distinguishing these requires plasma/urine osmolality and, increasingly, copeptin testing rather than relying solely on water deprivation, which I should emphasize for diagnostic accuracy [^6d82e39b] [^0a725d52] [^d6c8e640]. I should also note that vasopressin V2 antagonists (aquaretics) produce a selective water diuresis without natriuresis, which is mechanistically distinct and clinically useful in euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia, though I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize to hypovolemic states [^80105b12] [^2ae6ef8f].

> I need to check pharmacologic diuresis next. Loop diuretics inhibit NKCC2 in the thick ascending limb, producing natriuresis and calciuresis with secondary water excretion, and their short duration of action contributes to rebound sodium retention between doses, which explains resistance phenomena and guides strategies like continuous infusion or sequential nephron blockade; thiazides act on NCC in the distal convoluted tubule and are often layered onto loops for synergy, though I should confirm the evidence base is stronger for chronic HF than acute settings [^b252c856] [^f6882e95] [^341a22a8]. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists add modest natriuresis and have important non-diuretic benefits in HFrEF, so I should not conflate their diuretic potency with their outcome benefits [^26d39415]. Acetazolamide causes bicarbonate diuresis and can assist in diuretic resistance or metabolic alkalosis, which is a practical adjunct to remember [^0dacd237].

> But wait, what if the diuresis is mechanical or post-obstructive rather than purely hormonal or osmotic. Relief of urinary obstruction triggers post-obstructive diuresis via medullary washout, impaired concentrating ability, and tubular dysfunction; I should double-check that management hinges on careful fluid and electrolyte replacement to avoid volume depletion while the kidney recovers, with urine sodium and specific gravity helping track recovery [^6588ce8f] [^dd99d240]. In heart failure, neurohormonal activation drives sodium and water retention; diuretics relieve congestion but can provoke renal dysfunction if overdone, so I need to balance decongestion against perfusion and consider sequential nephron blockade or vasodilators when resistance emerges [^b252c856] [^caa41541].

> Let me consider special contributors so I don't miss common clinical drivers. High solute intake from protein loads or parenteral nutrition can oblige higher urine flow, and dietary sodium excess can worsen diuretic resistance and perpetuate congestion, which is why sodium restriction is foundational in edema states; I should confirm that this applies across nephrotic syndrome and heart failure protocols [^bff27b3b] [^87f8efac] [^b4541870]. Caffeine has a modest, context-dependent diuretic effect that is blunted during exercise, so I shouldn't over-attribute polyuria to caffeine alone without corroborating factors [^6ca79846]. Finally, I should remember that overcorrection of hyponatremia can trigger a water diuresis, so monitoring urine output and electrolytes during therapy is essential to avoid rapid shifts [^8cb97981].

> Hold on, I should verify the key differentiators that guide testing and treatment. Urine osmolality separates hypotonic water diuresis from isotonic or hypertonic solute diuresis; in hypotonic polyuria, urine osmolality less than about 300 mOsm/kg supports AVP deficiency or resistance, whereas values above 800 mOsm/kg point to solute diuresis, and intermediate values require further evaluation; calculating total solute excretion and assessing for obvious solute sources refines the diagnosis and prevents misclassification [^01cb98f9] [^d288b2ed]. In heart failure, diuretic response should be integrated with congestion scores, renal function, and biomarkers, and diuretic resistance warrants escalation strategies rather than premature abandonment of decongestion goals [^b252c856] [^f38c27af].

> In summary, diuresis arises from four broad mechanisms: osmotic solute diuresis from non-reabsorbed solutes like glucose or urea, water diuresis from impaired AVP action or V2 antagonism, pharmacologic natriuresis from loop, thiazide, or MR antagonists, and mechanical or disease-specific states such as post-obstructive diuresis or heart failure–related neurohormonal congestion; recognizing the mechanism guides safe, effective therapy and helps avoid complications like electrolyte disturbances or renal injury [^d288b2ed] [^6d82e39b] [^b252c856] [^6588ce8f].

Diuresis is driven by **increased solute excretion** (osmotic diuresis) or **impaired water reabsorption** (water diuresis). Osmotic diuresis occurs when non-reabsorbed solutes such as glucose (hyperglycemia, SGLT2 inhibitors), urea (post-obstruction, high protein intake), or mannitol increase tubular osmotic load and oblige water excretion [^c0c5cece] [^d1a60390] [^652213b8] [^f7bdf19e]. Water diuresis results from impaired AVP action or signaling, as in diabetes insipidus (central or nephrogenic) [^6d82e39b] or with V2 antagonists, causing large volumes of dilute urine [^80105b12]. Pharmacologic diuresis from loop, thiazide, or MRAs increases natriuresis and water loss [^b252c856] [^f2d26f16] [^26d39415]. Management targets the cause: control glucose, stop osmotic agents, treat obstruction, or use desmopressin for DI; monitor for electrolyte and volume disturbances [^652213b8] [^6d82e39b] [^6588ce8f].

---

## Osmotic diuresis

Osmotic diuresis results from **non-reabsorbed solutes** in the proximal tubule that retain water and increase urine volume. Key causes include:

- **Hyperglycemia**: Glucose exceeds tubular reabsorption capacity, causing glucosuria and osmotic diuresis (e.g. diabetes mellitus, SGLT2 inhibitors) [^c0c5cece] [^d1a60390].

- **Urea**: High protein intake, catabolic states, or post-obstructive diuresis increase urea excretion and osmotic water loss [^652213b8] [^6588ce8f].

- **Mannitol**: Intentionally used to induce osmotic diuresis (e.g. cerebral edema, intraoperative renal protection) [^f7bdf19e].

---

## Water diuresis

Water diuresis arises from **impaired water reabsorption** in the collecting duct, producing large volumes of dilute urine. Causes include:

- **Diabetes insipidus**: Central (AVP deficiency) or nephrogenic (AVP resistance) forms cause large, dilute polyuria [^6d82e39b].

- **Primary polydipsia**: Excess water intake suppresses AVP and increases urine output [^6d82e39b].

- **V2 receptor antagonists**: Induce selective water diuresis (aquaresis) without natriuresis (e.g. tolvaptan, conivaptan) [^80105b12].

---

## Pharmacological diuresis

Pharmacologic agents increase urine output via **distinct nephron mechanisms**:

| **Diuretic class** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical use** |
|-|-|-|
| Loop diuretics | Inhibit NKCC2 in the thick ascending limb; cause natriuresis and calciuresis | - Heart failure <br/> - Edema <br/> - Hypertension [^b252c856] [^cb86ecc8] |
| Thiazides | Inhibit NCC in the distal convoluted tubule; cause natriuresis and kaliuresis | - Hypertension <br/> - Edema <br/> - Nephrogenic DI [^f2d26f16] [^d1ad9118] |
| MRAs (spironolactone, eplerenone) | Block aldosterone; cause natriuresis and potassium retention | - Heart failure <br/> - Resistant hypertension <br/> - Cirrhosis [^26d39415] [^b4541870] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Diuresis can cause **volume depletion, electrolyte disturbances, and renal dysfunction**. Management depends on the cause:

- **Osmotic diuresis**: Control hyperglycemia, stop osmotic agents, correct electrolytes [^c0c5cece].

- **Water diuresis**: Treat DI with desmopressin; manage primary polydipsia with fluid restriction [^6d82e39b].

- **Pharmacologic diuresis**: Adjust dosing, monitor electrolytes, and use combination therapy for diuretic resistance [^b252c856] [^caa41541].

---

Diuresis results from **increased solute excretion** or **impaired water reabsorption**, with causes including hyperglycemia, urea, mannitol, diabetes insipidus, and diuretics. Management targets the underlying mechanism while monitoring for complications.

### Evaluation of polyuria: the roles of solute loading and water diuresis [^d288b2ed]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Polyuria, defined as daily urine output in excess of 3.0 to 3.5L/d, can occur due to solute or water diuresis. Solute-induced polyuria can be seen in hospitalized patients after a high solute load from exogenous protein administration or following relief of urinary obstruction. Similar clinical scenarios are rarely encountered in the outpatient setting. We describe a case of polyuria due to high solute ingestion and excessive water intake leading to a mixed picture of solute and water diuresis. Restriction of the daily solute load and water intake resulted in complete resolution of polyuria. Determination of the daily excreted urinary osmoles may yield important clues to the cause of polyuria and should be included in the routine workup of polyuria.

Abnormalities of micturition occur in many different diseases, have a variety of causes and take several forms. This review will focus exclusively on those abnormalities in which antidiuretic therapy may be of benefit. These conditions are primarily characterized by an increase in the total amount of urine produced (polyuria) or a circadian shift in the control of urine production and/or voiding (nocturnal enuresis, nocturia).

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^223953c4]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), previously known as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, is a disorder of sodium and water balance characterized by “inappropriate” (ie, nonosmotic) retention of water. The first published cases of SIAD were 2 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma with hyponatremia, yet ongoing renal sodium loss, described by Schwartz et al in 1957. Through careful observation of sodium and water intake and urine output, they attributed this syndrome to sustained, inappropriate secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). The diagnostic criteria for SIAD later published by the same authors in 1967 have remained remarkably current (Table 1).

Table 1. 
Criteria for diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate diuresis

Over the decades since, understanding of the prevalence, pathophysiology, and complications of SIAD has progressed. Substantial advances have been made in understanding the principles of management of acute severe hyponatremia that have led to improvements in immediate mortality. A small but growing number of randomized trials have been conducted to inform management protocols. This review seeks to summarize the current understanding of SIAD, examine the evidence base informing current guidelines, and to appraise important studies conducted more recently. We aim to synthesize the literature to derive practical and clinically relevant management principles to aid the understanding of clinicians and researchers, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes.

While one of the key characteristics of SIAD is low serum osmolality, it is more precisely referred to as low effective osmolality or tonicity. “Effective” osmolytes (eg, sodium, glucose, potassium, organic osmolytes) do not cross the cell membrane freely, so they have the capacity to create osmotic forces to influence the movement of water across cell membranes. In contrast, “ineffective” osmolytes (eg, ethanol, urea) freely cross cell membranes and therefore do not cause water shifts.

In hypotonic hyponatremia the low serum sodium concentration is primarily due to a relative excess of circulating free water, with or without a sodium deficit. Nonhypotonic hyponatremia can either be measured due to a method-dependent laboratory artifact, in which case it is termed pseudohyponatremia, or can be caused by excess of an effective osmolyte in the circulation (eg, hyperglycemia), in which case it is termed translocational hyponatremia (Fig. 1).

### Use of a new diuretic agent (metolazone) in patients with edema and ascites (...) [^441c364e]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Metolazone, a new diuretic agent, was administered to patients with ascites and edema. After injection of a single dose, natriuresis, diuresis, and kaliuresis began promptly and persisted for two to three days. This uniquely prolonged duration of action is attributable to avid protein-binding and enterohepatic recycling of the drug, which result in slow disappearance from the body. In three of four responsive patients potassium excretions increased only slightly, despite moderately large increases in sodium excretion. Three other patients who were resistant to metolazone demonstrated kaliuresis even though the daily rate of sodium excretion increased by only a few milliequivalents. Metolazone appears to be a clinically useful diuretic agent which continues to act for an unusually long time after administration of a single dose. During metolazone therapy, natriuresis and kaliuresis may occur independently of each other. Lowenthal DT, Shear L.

### Furosemide [^201789d2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING

Furosemide is a potent diuretic which, if given in excessive amounts, can lead to a profound diuresis with water and electrolyte depletion. Therefore, careful medical supervision is required and dose and dose schedule must be adjusted to the individual patient's needs. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .)

### Proximal versus distal diuretics in congestive heart failure [^47c22be6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

Contemporary adjunct proximal and distal diuretics have been shown to elicit clear clinical benefit in the setting of acute and chronic HF. SGLT2 inhibitors and MR antagonists both cause short-term increases in natriuresis and diuresis; however, these mechanisms may not represent the primary actions responsible for long-term cardioprotection in chronic HF patients. Similarly, short-term treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors, CA inhibitors, and thiazide diuretics increase natriuresis in the acute HF setting, however, implications on long-term outcomes remain unclear and warrant further investigation to elucidate optimal treatment regimes. Last, a multi-nephron segment approach, using agents that act on distinct segments of the nephron, can further augment diuresis to alleviate signs and symptoms of volume overload in the acute setting. Future trials are required to determine efficacy of the multi-nephron segment approach whereby mechanisms of multiple therapies converge on similar nephron segments.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^3573ef13]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Postpituitary or hypothalamic surgery diuresis—diabetes insipidus (DI) risk and contributors: DI occurs commonly in the immediate period (days 1–2) after pituitary or hypothalamic surgery; other causes of postsurgical abundant diuresis include steroid-induced hyperglycemia, abundant intraoperative fluid administration, and an abrupt reduction of serum GH levels in acromegaly. High-dose perioperative GC increase the incidence of postoperative DI, possibly mediated by increased glomerular filtration rate, reduced ADH secretion, and reduced renal sensitivity to GC.

### Impact of solute intake on urine flow and water excretion [^bff27b3b]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

It is classically taught that when renal function is normal and the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (arginine vasopressin) is fully suppressed, the human kidney has the capacity to excrete large volumes of dilute urine, allowing for a broad range of water intake. This flexibility protects against the development of hyponatremia even in the face of water intake that can approach 20 L/d. What is not as widely recognized is the impact that alterations in solute intake, and therefore excretion, have on this process. As will be illustrated here, a decrement in solute intake markedly reduces the above-mentioned flexibility and puts the individual at risk for the unexpected development of hyponatremia. In contrast, an increment in solute intake can be used therapeutically to treat this electrolyte disorder and allow those prone to it to liberalize their water intake.

### As the river flows: a case report of post obstructive diuresis [^6588ce8f]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Post obstructive diuresis (PObD) is a medical complication that occurs after a period of urinary obstruction. It is defined as a prolonged production of urine of at least 200 cc/hour for two consecutive hours or over 3 L of urine production over a 24-hour period following relief of urinary retention or an obstructive uropathy. Normally once the initial cause of urinary retention is removed, a patient’s body naturally rids of solutes and excess fluids until a homeostatic response is met. This condition is known as physiological post obstructive diuresis and lasts for 24 h. In pathologic post obstructive diuresis, the body will continue to release electrolytes and fluids beyond what should be expected for more than 48-hours. This can lead to massive electrolyte deficiencies as well as the possibility of hypotension and shock.

Here we present a case of severe pathologic PObD that was uniquely resolved through interventions constructed based on our understanding of the physiologic causative factors contributing to PObD. We utilized the appropriate markers to track our efforts in treating our patient’s symptoms.

### Science and fiction in critical care: established concepts with or without evidence? [^23123f00]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Dogma #1: Give fluids, diuretics, and vasopressors if urinary output decreases

Most oliguric intensive care unit (ICU) patients receive fluids, diuretics, and/or vasopressors with the goal to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI). This treatment, however, is based on the belief that AKI in critically ill patients results from renal ischaemia. Whereas fluids and vasopressors are usually administered to increase renal blood flow and in proportion oxygen delivery, diuretics are given to reduce the osmolarity in the renal medulla. This is expected to increase glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and ultimately improve renal function.

Oliguria, however, is a clinical symptom rather than a disease. The underlying mechanisms include, but are not restricted to, hypovolaemia, physiologic stress response, tubular damage, post-renal obstruction or a combination of these factors. If hypovolaemia is not the cause of oliguria, it does not make sense to administer fluids for its treatment. Giving fluids to patients who are not hypovolaemic may in fact harm the kidneys by increasing intracapsular pressure, thereby further reducing urinary output. Hence, administering fluids to these patients may lead into a vicious cycle of infusing more and more fluids to treat oliguria, which is eventually a result of over-hydration. Furthermore, if functional renal damage is present, e.g. due to ischaemia or nephrotoxins, treating oliguria with fluids or diuretics is unlikely to improve renal function. In this context, it is also noteworthy that the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for AKI recommend neither fluid therapy beyond the correction of hypovolaemia nor diuretics for the treatment of AKI. This is supported by the fact that clinical evidence for a sustained increase in urine output or improvement in renal blood flow secondary to fluids and/or diuretics is lacking. Conversely, indiscriminately giving fluids to oliguric patients increases the risk of fluid overload with negative consequences on morbidity. Although fluid overload has been identified as independent risk factor for AKI in critically ill patients, “fill and spill” (“fill” the circulation and urine will “spill”) is still a dogma in many ICUs. Likewise, the concept of “squeeze and diurese” is commonly applied. It aims to increase mean arterial blood pressure with vasopressors (“squeeze”) and at the same time administer loop diuretics to paralyse the medulla and avoid ischaemia (“diurese”). Interestingly, no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) support the latter treatment strategies.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^b4541870]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure—diuretic therapy management and risks: Electrolyte imbalances should be treated aggressively and the diuresis continued, and if hypotension or azotemia occurs the physician may elect to slow the rapidity of diuresis, but diuresis should nevertheless be maintained until fluid retention is eliminated, even if this strategy results in mild or moderate decreases in blood pressure or renal function, as long as the patient remains asymptomatic. Once fluid retention has resolved, treatment with the diuretic should be maintained to prevent the recurrence of volume overload, with dose adjustment often accomplished by having patients record their weight each day and make changes in their diuretic dosage if the weight increases or decreases beyond a specified range. Patients may become unresponsive to high doses if they consume large amounts of dietary sodium, are taking agents that can block the effects of diuretics (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including cyclo- oxygenase-2 inhibitors), or have a significant impairment of renal function or perfusion, but diuretic resistance can generally be overcome by the intravenous administration of diuretics (including the use of continuous infusions), the use of 2 or more diuretics in combination (e.g., furosemide and metolazone), or the use of diuretics together with drugs that increase renal blood flow (e.g., positive inotropic agents). Diuretics can cause the depletion of potassium and magnesium and can predispose patients to serious cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in the presence of digitalis therapy, and the risk of electrolyte depletion is markedly enhanced when 2 diuretics are used in combination; concomitant administration of ACEIs alone or in combination with potassium-retaining agents (such as spironolactone) can prevent electrolyte depletion in most patients with HF who are taking a loop diuretic, and when these drugs are prescribed, long-term oral potassium supplementation is generally not needed and may be deleterious. Excessive use of diuretics can decrease blood pressure and impair renal function and exercise tolerance; if there are no signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia are likely to be related to volume depletion and may resolve after a reduction in diuretic dose, whereas the signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia, are likely to reflect worsening HF and a decline in effective peripheral perfusion, which is an ominous clinical scenario and necessitates considering the measures discussed under Stage D HF.

### Vasopressin regulation of renal sodium excretion [^608aaf07]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Vasopressin promotes renal water reabsorption decreasing excretion of free water to dilute plasma and lower serum osmolality. We have good understanding of the causes, mechanisms and consequences of this vasopressin-dependent renal water movement. In comparison, vasopressin actions on renal electrolytes including sodium excretion and its consequences have been less well understood. This is so for investigation and discussions of the renal actions of vasopressin are framed primarily around water metabolism rather than any direct effect on salt handling. The fact that water moves in biological systems, to include the mammalian kidney, only by osmosis passively down its concentration gradient is implicit in such discussion but often not overtly addressed. This can cause confusion. Moreover, although vasopressin action on renal sodium excretion via the V2 receptor is critical to water transport, it is masked easily being situational--for instance, dependent on hydration state. It is now clear that an increase in sodium reabsorption along the distal nephron (CNT + CD) mediated by activation of the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) by vasopressin makes an important contribution to maintenance of the axial corticomedullary osmotic gradient necessary for maximal water reabsorption. Thus, we need to modify slightly our understanding of vasopressin and its renal actions to include the idea that while vasopressin decreases free water excretion to dilute plasma, it does this, in part, by promoting sodium reabsorption and consequently decreasing sodium excretion via ENaC activated along the distal nephron.

### Proximal versus distal diuretics in congestive heart failure [^26d39415]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Natriuresis and diuresis in chronic HF

The use of spironolactone to elicit increases in natriuresis have been well-described. Short-term spironolactone treatment increased urinary sodium excretion, resulting in decreases in net sodium balance, body weight, and neurohormonal activation in HF patients abstaining from diuretic use. Furthermore, in severe HF patients with diuretic resistance, evident from persistent congestion despite maximal tolerable doses of loop diuretics and ACE inhibition, the addition of spironolactone further increased sodium excretion and decreased body weight, collectively supporting diuretic and natriuretic properties of spironolactone. MR antagonists also cause reductions in natriuretic hormones (Table 1). A secondary analysis of the RALES trial demonstrated that spironolactone decreased BNP following 3 months of treatment. Further, both eplerenone and finerenone elicited comparable reductions in NT-proBNP following 3 months in HFrEF patients, while spironolactone decreased NT-proBNP following 9 months in HFpEF patients.

Synonymous to SGLT2 inhibitors, the rapid time to statistical benefit (20 days) in the composite endpoints in HFrEF patients prescribed MR antagonists suggests that the mechanisms responsible for cardioprotection are promptly activated following treatment initiation. While the fast-acting diuretic effects may intuitively represent an important mediator, it is important to recognize that MR antagonists also possess anti-hypertrophic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects that largely mediate the cardiovascular benefits noted in clinical trials. Importantly, there is evidence to support that these mechanisms represent the primary actions responsible for long-term cardiovascular benefit of MR antagonists, as opposed to the natriuretic and diuretic properties. For example, in a secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial, patients treated with spironolactone required lower doses of furosemide and thiazide diuretics compared to placebo. However, reductions in HF hospitalization were not solely explained by indices of diuresis, suggesting that non-diuretic mechanisms were responsible for mediating the observed clinical benefit. Furthermore, spironolactone elicited improvements in mortality most clearly observed in patients with the lowest NT-proBNP. Therefore, steroidal MR antagonists may have natriuretic and diuretic effects but the contribution of these changes to the overall cardiovascular benefit noted in dedicated clinical trials is unclear.

### Night-time diuresis pattern in children with and without primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis [^69948ee8]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Night-time polyuria as the dominating pathophysiological mechanism for primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (PMNE) has been put in question with nocturnal detrusor overactivity and high arousal thresholds as alternatives. An earlier finding of night-time polyuria in 12% of healthy non-enuretic schoolchildren underscores that excessive night-time diuresis per se is unlikely the major cause of PMNE.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the night-time diuresis pattern in children with and without PMNE and to evaluate the role of night-time polyuria in provoking enuretic episodes in children with PMNE.

Study Design

Night-time diuresis pattern was recorded in 27 children with PMNE, aged 6-15 years, and 29 non-enuretic children, aged 6-13 years. Using a portable ultrasound recorder, the bladder volume was estimated at 15-min intervals for at least three nights with the child sleeping in its own bed at home. The volume of enuretic episodes was controlled using preweighed diapers. All voids were registered by time and volume. Diuresis during night time was estimated from the slope of regression lines fitted to ultrasound recording points. Mean night-time diuresis was calculated from total urine production during the night and time interval from the last void before bedtime to the first morning void.

Results

Night-time bladder filling pattern was recorded from 189 nights, giving 149 interpretable patterns for analysis (77 children with PMNE and 72 dry children). The night-time diuresis pattern was similar for children with or without PMNE, showing large variability between different nights of the same child. Most nights displayed a smooth bladder filling at constant low rate, whereas other nights showed an early phase with high diuresis followed by a longer period of low diuresis with no difference between the two groups.

Discussion

Night-time diuresis has been non-invasively monitored in children while asleep in their own beds at home. The pattern of night-time diuresis varies considerably between different nights of the same child, with no obvious differences in any diuresis parameters between children with or without PMNE.

Conclusion

Non-enuretic children have similar diuresis pattern and maximal night-time diuresis values as children with PMNE, making it unlikely that PMNE is caused by night-time polyuria per se (Summary figure). Delayed maturation of sleep mechanisms such as decreased arousability or sleep inhibition of the micturition reflex is more likely to be the main etiology for enuresis.

### Understanding hypernatremia [^919f58bb]. American Journal of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Understanding hypernatremia is at times difficult for many clinicians. However, hypernatremia can often be deciphered easily with some basic understanding of water and sodium balance. Here, the basic pathophysiological abnormalities underlying the development of sodium disorders are reviewed, and case examples are given. Hypernatremia often arises in the hospital, especially in the intensive care units due to the combination of (1) not being able to drink water; (2) inability to concentrate the urine (most often from having kidney failure); (3) osmotic diuresis from having high serum urea concentrations, and (4) large urine or stool outputs.

### Ecstasy-associated acute severe hyponatremia and cerebral edema: a role for osmotic diuresis? [^e422d9c7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Ecstasy, or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), is a drug of abuse with a wide range of toxicity affecting the brain, heart, and liver. Renal toxicity of MDMA is due either to acute kidney injury (e.g., non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis) or to water and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., hyponatremia). Although syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone has been recognized as a major mechanism for MDMA-associated hyponatremia, other factors (e.g., MDMA-induced polydipsia) have also been proposed.

Objectives

Hypertonic saline has been used by most authors to treat MDMA-associated acute symptomatic hyponatremia. Our case is the second published report in which mannitol was chosen for management of this pathologic phenomenon.

Case Report

We present a case of MDMA-associated acute severe hyponatremia and cerebral edema in a young female, and analyze the underlying pathophysiology, the therapeutic strategy, and the course of disease.

Conclusion

Based on this observation, coupled with the previous report and the complex pathophysiology of this phenomenon, we suggest that osmotic diuresis be considered a possible therapeutic option for MDMA-associated acute symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Nocturnal polyuria is related to 24-hour diuresis and osmotic excretion in an enuresis population referred to a tertiary center [^0fd7991b]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Primary nocturnal enuresis is a heterogeneous disorder, causing a mismatch between overnight diuresis volume and functional bladder capacity. Despite increasing insights in pathogenesis, lack of efficacy of the available treatments is a major problem. We evaluated characteristics of bladder volume and diuresis rate in patients with nocturnal enuresis referred to a tertiary enuresis center.

Materials and Methods

Noninvasive screening including maximal voided volume, 24-hour circadian rhythm of diuresis and osmotic excretion from 1,000 consecutive patients.

Results

Of the patients referred as having monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis 32% were subsequently classified as having nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis. Differences in bladder volume and nocturnal diuresis characteristics between the monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis groups were minimal.

Conclusions

The most common observation is a nocturnal diuresis volume greater than maximal voided volume, which in both groups can be caused by nocturnal polyuria or small bladder volume for patient age. The most striking observation is that the positive correlation between nocturnal diuresis volume rate and nocturnal osmotic excretion and 24-hour fluid intake is significantly higher than with the inversed urinary osmolality overnight, which is not only unexpected based on the theory of the primary suppression of vasopressin levels overnight, but also points to a more important role for nutritional and fluid intake than accepted, if not in the primary pathogenesis, then at least in therapy resistance.

### Diabetes insipidus in children [^59898e2d]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is one of the common disorders affecting sodium and water homeostasis, and results when ADH is either inadequately produced, or unable to negotiate its actions on the renal collecting tubules through aquaporins. The diagnostic algorithm starts with exclusion of other causes of polyuria and establishing low urine osmolality in the presence of high serum osmolality. In this paper, we have reviewed the diagnosis, etiology and management of DI in children, with special emphasis on recent advances in the field.

### Mild dehydration, vasopressin and the kidney: animal and human studies [^adcfa7e1]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Water balance depends essentially on fluid intake and urine excretion. Mild dehydration and the consequent hypertonicity of the extracellular fluid induce an increase in vasopressin secretion, thus stimulating urine concentrating processes and the feeling of thirst. The osmotic threshold for the release of vasopressin is lower than that for thirst and also shows appreciable individual variation. Sustained high levels of vasopressin and low hydration induce morphological and functional changes in the kidney. However, they could also be risk factors in several renal disorders, such as chronic renal failure, diabetic nephropathy and salt-sensitive hypertension.

### Approach to the patient with suspected hypotonic polyuria [^0a725d52]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Investigation and management of hypotonic polyuria is a common challenge in clinical endocrinology. The 3 main causes, recently renamed to arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D, formerly central diabetes insipidus), arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R, formerly nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), and primary polydipsia (PP) require accurate diagnosis, as management differs for each. This new nomenclature more accurately reflects pathophysiology and has now been adopted by the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED). Advances in diagnosis over the last few years have centered around the use of copeptin measurement. Here, we use 3 patient case histories to highlight the use of this approach, and to demonstrate how it can succeed where other approaches, such as the water deprivation test, sometimes fail. We discuss the overall approach to each type of patient and the strengths and limitations of diagnostic strategies, illustrating the use of the new nomenclature.

### Sodium and water disorders [^6e9798b2]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

The balancing of fluids and electrolytes is a core function of the kidneys. There are redundant mechanisms within the body to sense the adequacy of organ perfusion and the composition of body fluids aimed at maintaining hemodynamics and protecting an environment for optimal cellular function. Sodium and water are key components of extracellular fluid and are regulated in response to end-organ perfusion and serum tonicity. Baroreceptors activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, sympathetic nervous system, vasopressin, and atrial natriuretic peptide to adjust sodium handling to alter extracellular volume. Osmoreceptors affect anti-diuretic hormone release and aquaporin activity in the medullary collecting duct to modify the handling of water. Disordered handling of sodium and/or water may be adaptive or maladaptive, and understanding the stimuli and responses to clinical scenarios assists clinicians in developing appropriate treatment strategies.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^d1a60390]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors—mechanism of action and systemic effects—act by blocking the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal tubule, which is responsible for approximately 90% of urinary glucose reabsorption; inhibition lowers glucose via glucosuria that is more pronounced with hyperglycemia, diminishes as blood glucose normalizes, and is smaller as eGFR decreases. The risk of hypoglycemia is extremely low unless combined with insulin or insulin secretagogues, and beyond glycemia these agents cause diuretic and natriuretic effects, promote weight loss, and lower systolic blood pressure. Proposed contributors to cardiovascular and renal benefit include reductions in preload and afterload through diuresis, alterations in myocardial metabolism, and prevention of myocardial fibrosis.

### Diuretics: still the mainstay of treatment [^fe8123cc]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The mainstay of treatment of acute decompensated heart failure is diuretic therapy. While there are no data showing a morbidity or mortality benefit from the use of chronic diuretic therapy, diuretics rapidly improve symptoms associated with volume overload. Thus, despite concerns that some diuretics may cause harm by neurohormonal activation, these agents continue to be the first-line treatment for patients with heart failure. There is no conclusive evidence that one means of diuresis is better than another. When administration of moderate doses of loop diuretics is not sufficient, patients can be treated with higher doses, continuous infusions, or the addition of a thiazide diuretic or aldosterone antagonist. Diuretics improve symptoms but should be used in addition to other agents that improve the long-term outcome of patients with heart failure.

### Pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus [^5ba46e12]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2015). Medium credibility.

Healthy kidneys maintain fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis by adjusting urine volume and composition according to physiological needs. The final urine composition is determined in the last tubular segment: the collecting duct. Water permeability in the collecting duct is regulated by arginine vasopressin (AVP). Secretion of AVP from the neurohypophysis is regulated by a complex signalling network that involves osmosensors, barosensors and volume sensors. AVP facilitates aquaporin (AQP)-mediated water reabsorption via activation of the vasopressin V2 receptor (AVPR2) in the collecting duct, thus enabling concentration of urine. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), inability of the kidneys to respond to AVP results in functional AQP deficiency. Consequently, affected patients have constant diuresis, resulting in large volumes of dilute urine. Primary forms of NDI result from mutations in the genes that encode the key proteins AVPR2 and AQP2, whereas secondary forms are associated with biochemical abnormalities, obstructive uropathy or the use of certain medications, particularly lithium. Treatment of the disease is informed by identification of the underlying cause. Here we review the clinical aspects and diagnosis of NDI, the various aetiologies, current treatment options and potential future developments.

### The association of urine osmolality with decreased kidney function and / or albuminuria in the United States [^a1d159db]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Urine osmolality is dynamic as the body corrects temporary water imbalance and can help evaluate renal concentrating ability, and fluid balance between fluid intake and fluid loss. As a determination of the amount of osmotically active solutes in the urine, (a) any factors increasing urine output including increased fluid intake, water diuresis from diabetes insipidus, osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia, urea diuresis from improving AKI, and sodium diuresis from high salt intake, or (b) any factors decreasing urine output such as hypovolemia, decreased renal blood flow, and damage to renal tubular cells can impact urine osmolality. Moreover, calculating solute excretion is useful to determine the type of diuresis.

Our findings support the hypothesis that high urine osmolality is associated with decreased eGFR in our healthier sample with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 and it can be explained by (a) hypovolemia which refers to a reduction of effective circulating volume with salt and water loss via gastrointestinal system, diuretics, bleeding, or third space sequestration, or (b) dehydration which refers to a reduction of total body water with water loss (as with diabetes insipidus) or inadequate water intake, resulting in a rise in the plasma sodium, called hypernatremia. To support this hypothesis, urine output as well as urine sodium and creatinine would be required. If urine osmolality is high and urine output decreases, hypovolemia is likely. If urine osmolality is high but urine output increases, then it could be due to osmotic diuresis. However, these mechanisms are beyond the data available in our dataset.

### Conivaptan (vaprisol) for the treatment of hyponatremia-AAFP (...) [^80105b12]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Conivaptan is an antagonist of arginine vasopressin receptors V1A and V2 that produces a water diuresis, with electrolyte-sparing effects on the kidney. 1 It is labeled for the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients. 1, 2 Treatment may be required for rapid correction of sodium levels in symptomatic patients presenting with serum sodium levels less than 120 mEq per L.
3. SAFETY Conivaptan causes few serious problems when used in appropriate patients. It is contraindicated in patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia because it will cause an increase in free water excretion and may exacerbate the patient's existing hypovolemic condition. 1 In addition, the safety of conivaptan in patients with heart failure has not been established; it should not be used in patients with heart failure or other edematous conditions. 1, 3 Conivaptan is classified as U. S.

Food and Drug Administration pregnancy category C. TOLERABILITY Some of the most commonly reported adverse reactions are infusion related, including erythema, phlebitis, and pain at the site of injection; however, few patients will need to discontinue treatment because of these adverse effects. EFFECTIVENESS Low serum sodium levels may occur in conjunction with a reduction in total body water and a greater loss of total body sodium; increased total body water relative to an increase in total body sodium; and normal total body sodium, but increased total body water. Conivaptan has been compared with placebo in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Bottom Line In most cases, patients with hyponatremia can be adequately managed with fluid restriction alone. However, acutely symptomatic patients may require treatment, such as hypertonic saline.

In these situations, conivaptan is an expensive alternative. The safety and effectiveness of conivaptan has not been compared directly with hypertonic saline. It would be ideal to have comparative data before conivaptan is considered a standard treatment for hyponatremia.

### Diuretic treatment in heart failure [^b252c856]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diuretic treatment in heart failure: 
- Definition: Diuretic treatment in HF is used to promote renal sodium and water excretion, thereby reducing intravascular congestion, pulmonary edema, and elevated filling pressures. Loop diuretics such as furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide are the cornerstone of therapy, with thiazide or potassium-sparing diuretics added for additional effect when needed. The primary goal is to achieve rapid symptomatic relief and restoration of euvolemia while avoiding excessive volume loss, renal dysfunction, or electrolyte imbalance.
- Pathophysiology: In HF, neurohormonal activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems causes sodium and water retention, leading to increased venous pressures and pulmonary or systemic congestion. Diuretics counteract these effects by lowering preload and reducing ventricular filling pressures, which alleviates dyspnea and edema. However, excessive diuresis can decrease renal perfusion and stimulate further neurohormonal activation, diminishing long-term efficacy.
- Disease course: Diuretic therapy provides rapid improvement in symptoms, often within hours of initiation, particularly in acute decompensated HF. Treatment usually begins with intravenous loop diuretics, titrated according to urine output, weight reduction, and renal function. Thiazide-type diuretics may be combined with loop agents in cases of diuretic resistance. Once euvolemia is achieved, therapy is transitioned to the lowest effective oral dose while guideline-directed agents for HF are optimized.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Diuretic therapy is recommended in patients with HF and fluid retention to relieve congestion, improve symptoms, enhance exercise capacity, and reduce the risk of hospital readmission. In HFrEF, early and effective decongestion improves QoL and functional status, although diuretics do not confer a direct survival benefit. Prompt administration in acute HF may shorten hospitalization and lower in-hospital mortality, provided the diagnosis of volume overload is certain. Combination therapy with a thiazide such as metolazone is reserved for patients unresponsive to high-dose loop diuretics to minimize electrolyte disturbances and renal dysfunction.

### Streamlining diuresis: a quality improvement approach to implementing a sodium-based predictive diuresis protocol [^e63435ac]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Diuresis for hospitalized patients with acute decompensated heart failure is a routine clinical practice but one that remains reliant on error-prone and resource-intensive intake and output and weight measurements and is subject to wide provider variation. We sought to use quality improvement approaches to implement a data-driven predictive diuresis protocol based on natriuresis using the electronic health record to titrate dosing. Our initiative did not result in significant reductions in length of stay but did demonstrate a significant increase in the use of urine studies to guide diuresis and signals toward more aggressive diuretic dosing without an increase in adverse outcomes.

### Proximal versus distal diuretics in congestive heart failure [^341a22a8]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Distal tubular diuretics

The distal convoluted tubule accounts for <10% of sodium reabsorption through the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC) (Fig. 1) [1, 2]. However, distal sodium reabsorption can be altered by a variety of factors such as neurohormonal activation, tubular flow rate, aldosterone, and vasopressin, each of which can impact either the pathological development or therapeutic treatment of HF. Importantly, in the setting of chronic diuretic use or chronic HF, hypertrophy of the distal tubule increases distal tubular sodium reabsorption, contributing to sodium retention and is a major mechanism of diuretic resistance.

Thiazide diuretics

Thiazide diuretics have conventionally been considered a first line adjunct to augment diuresis, targeting the maladaptive distal tubular hypertrophy, by decreasing sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule through inhibition of the Na-Cl cotransporter (Fig. 1). Thiazide diuretics include metolazone, which has a long duration of action and is effective in those with advanced chronic kidney disease, hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide, and chlorthalidone. Both metolazone and hydrochlorothiazide cause similar acute changes in body weight, urine output, diuretic efficiency, and patient congestion scores, suggesting that neither have established superiority. However, in the acute HF setting, metolazone treatment was associated with increased mortality compared to high-dose loop diuretic treatment in propensity analyses, although this may be attributed to confounding by indication. Other thiazide diuretics, such as intravenous chlorothiazide and oral chlorthalidone, have also been used to promote diuresis to mitigate volume overload in acute HF; although the only available evidence supporting this practice is observational in nature, and randomized controlled trial data is lacking.

Natriuresis and diuresis in chronic HF

Thiazide diuretics are most frequently utilized concurrently to loop diuretics for treating chronic HF patients in clinical practice, particularly in the setting of loop diuretic resistance. Indeed, loop diuretics and thiazide diuretics can act synergistically to help achieve adequate diuresis. This synergistic response, mediated by distinct tubular mechanisms of action for sequential nephron blockade, forms the physiological rationale for combined loop and thiazide diuretics in consensus statements. While observational studies support the addition of thiazide diuretics, such as metolazone, to improve weight loss and decongestion in patients with chronic HF, there is a lack of randomized controlled trial evidence in this setting.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^696d22fe]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021—Diuretics and antihypertensive adverse effects in CKD—High BP due to fluid overload is common in CKD; therefore, diuretics are, in general, logical agents at appropriate dose to lower high BP, with or without the concomitant use of RASi. While thiazide diuretics decrease efficacy as GFR worsens, several, including chlorthalidone, metolazone, and indapamide appear to remain effective at GFRs <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and loop diuretics are often effective at lower GFRs (i.e., <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2). When combined with a loop diuretic, thiazides are particularly effective in inducing diuresis, but they often lead to hypokalemia and hyponatremia. The document notes common class adverse effects in CKD, including for both ACEi and ARBs, hyperkalemia as well as AKI, and for diuretics, hypokalemia, and states there are no data on clinical outcomes with loop diuretics in the treatment of high BP with or without CKD.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor therapy: mechanisms of action in heart failure [^5225b635]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Diuretic and antihypertensive effects

It has been suggested that SGLT2 inhibitors improve cardiovascular outcomes due to their diuretic and antihypertensive effects (figure 1). SGLT2 inhibitors cause osmotic diuresis due to glucosuria and natriuresis, although the degree of diuresis and its composition (ie, the amount of natriuresis compared with aquaresis) remains to be established.Indeed, in the context of co-administration of loop diuretic therapies, the contribution of osmotic diuresis towards improved heart failure outcomes remains unclear. Glycosuria in the context of SGLT2-inhibitor therapy administration occurs due to a twofold to threefold increase in the filtered and resorbed glucose in presence of hyperglycaemia. Therefore, glycosuria and osmotic diuresis associated with SGLT2 inhibition are dependent on blood glucose concentrations and hence this does not explain the similar benefits observed in normoglycaemic patients with heart failure in the absence of diabetes mellitus.Although SGLT2-inhibitor therapy is associated with natriuresis and reduction in plasma volume,it is unclear if these benefits are sustained as there were no differences seen in serum N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) concentrations in patients with chronic stable heart failure despite improvements in heart failure status.Moreover, there was no change in the diuretic dose among most participants during follow-up in the DAPA-HF trial, and the mean diuretic dose was similar between dapagliflozin and placebo groups.

Figure 1 
Schematic diagram showing conventional mechanisms of action of SGLT2 inhibitors. SGLT, sodium-glucose co-transporter.

Recent studies have highlighted important differences between the diuretic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors and loop diuretic therapies. Using mathematical modelling, a recent study showed that both dapagliflozin and bumetanide were associated with a reduction in sodium and interstitial fluid. However, dapagliflozin had little or no effect on plasma volume whereas bumetanide was associated with reductions in intravascular volume, which can pose challenges in the context of hypoperfusion.This predicted selectivity of SGLT2 inhibitors for interstitial fluid is supported by observations from ‘the renal and cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibition in combination with loop diuretics in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure’ (RECEDE-CHF) trial which showed an average increase in daily urine volume of 545 mL, 312 mL of which was electrolyte-free water clearance.This may suggest a synergistic effect of SGLT2-inhibitor therapy with background diuretic treatment in heart failure. This, however, requires further validation.

### Approach to the patient with suspected hypotonic polyuria [^01cb98f9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Suspicion

Patients who have symptoms of polyuria, nocturia, or polydipsia are candidates for further evaluation of a possible arginine vasopressin-related polyuria (AVP-D or AVP-R). However, before embarking on more complex pathways of investigation, it is important to exclude common causes of polyuria and polydipsia, including hypokalemia and hypercalcemia. Certain scenarios are suggestive of a solute diuresis, for example uncontrolled hyperglycemia, high protein intake from parenteral or enteral feeding, tissue catabolism from high-dose glucocorticoids, resolving kidney injury including relief of urinary obstruction, use of diuretics and SGLT-2 inhibitors, administration of mannitol or high volumes of isotonic NaCl. The presence of nocturia without daytime polyuria suggests nocturnal polyuria (production of 20%-33% of total urine volume during sleep). In the absence of such obvious causes of symptomatic polyuria, possible AVP-related disorders should be evaluated. The first step is measurement of plasma osmolality and/or serum sodium concentration. Although these are within normal ranges in most patients with polyuria due to the ability of thirst and renal water excretion to maintain osmotic homeostasis, hypernatremia strongly suggests AVP-D or AVP-R, and hyponatremia strongly suggests PP as the most likely causes of polyuria. If the plasma osmolality and serum sodium are normal, the next step is confirming the presence of hypotonic polyuria. Because patients’ estimations of both fluid intake and urine output are not always reliable, this should be assessed via measurement of a 24-hour urine. It is notable that there is no universally accepted definition of polyuria. Past studies have used an absolute urine volume (eg, ≥ 3 L/24 hours in adults and ≥ 2 L/m 2 /24 hours in children), and others have used a weight-based urine volume (eg, > 40 mL/kg/24 hours or > 50 mL/kg/24 hours). Consequently, clinical judgment and experience should be used to identify patients requiring further evaluation, but the least stringent criteria would be either a urine volume ≥ 3 L/24 hours in adults and ≥ 2 L/m 2 /24 hours in children, or > 40 mL/kg/24 hours. If these minimal criteria are not met, the patient should undergo urological evaluation for causes of increased urine frequency or nocturnal polyuria. Once polyuria is established, the second step is to confirm hypotonicity via measurement of osmolality in the 24 hours urine sample. A urine osmolality ≤ 300 mOsm/kg H 2 O confirms a hypotonic urine, and a urine osmolality ≥ 800 mOsm/kg H 2 O indicates a solute diuresis (due to glucose, sodium, urea, or administered diuretics such as mannitol). Urine osmolalities between 300 and 800 mOsm/kg H 2 O can be seen with partial AVP-D or AVP-R, so in such cases further evaluation is necessary. Once hypotonic polyuria is confirmed, additional testing is necessary to identify the cause (Table 1).

### The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^fc1c60b1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretions: 
- Definition: The SIADH is a disorder of impaired water excretion caused by persistent or uncontrolled release of ADH (arginine vasopressin) despite normal or low plasma osmolality. This leads to water retention, dilutional hyponatremia, and inappropriately concentrated urine. The condition is normovolemic and characterized by low serum sodium, low plasma osmolality, urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/kg, and urine sodium typically > 40 mEq/L in the absence of renal, adrenal, or thyroid disease.
- Pathophysiology: The syndrome arises when the normal osmotic suppression of ADH release fails. Persistent hormone activity increases water reabsorption in the renal collecting ducts, expanding total body water and diluting serum sodium. Secondary natriuresis restores extracellular volume but further lowers serum sodium. Multiple secretion patterns exist, including continuous inappropriate release, a "reset osmostat" with a lower osmotic threshold, and receptor-level activation independent of hormone concentration. Chronic stimulation also upregulates aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) water channels, maintaining water retention.
- Epidemiology: The SIADH is the most common cause of euvolemic hyponatremia. It occurs at any age but is particularly frequent in older adults and hospitalized patients. The prevalence among patients with significant hyponatremia varies widely, ranging from 30-50% in tertiary care settings. Inappropriate secretion of ADH is especially common in patients with pulmonary disease, intracranial pathology, or small cell carcinoma of the lung.
- Disease course: The onset may be acute or chronic depending on the rate of serum sodium decline. Neurologic symptoms such as headache, confusion, gait disturbance, seizures, and coma reflect cerebral edema caused by hypotonicity. Severe or rapid hyponatremia can be fatal, whereas chronic mild forms are often asymptomatic. Etiologic factors include CNS disorders, pulmonary infections, malignancies, medications such as carbamazepine, SSRIs, and cyclophosphamide, postoperative states, and endocrine deficiencies. Rarely, hereditary forms result from activating mutations in the vasopressin-2 receptor (V2R).
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Outcome depends on the underlying cause and the rapidity of sodium correction. When the precipitating factor is reversible, sodium levels normalize with treatment and recurrence is uncommon. Chronic or idiopathic cases may persist but can often be controlled with long-term fluid management. Mortality is primarily related to severe hyponatremia, rapid shifts in serum sodium, or the associated malignancy rather than the syndrome itself.

### Osmotic diuresis due to urea as the cause of hypernatraemia in critically ill patients [^4606a611]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypernatraemia is common in critically ill patients and has been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality. Osmotic urea diuresis can cause hypernatraemia due to significant water losses but is often not diagnosed. Free water clearance (FWC) and electrolyte free water clearance (EFWC) were proposed to quantify renal water handling. We aimed to (i) identify patients with hypernatraemia due to osmotic urea diuresis and (ii) investigate whether FWC and EFWC are helpful in identifying renal loss of free water.

Methods

In this retrospective study, we screened a registry for patients, who experienced intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired hypernatraemia. Among them, patients with hypernatraemia due to osmotic urea diuresis were detected by a case-by-case review. Total fluid and electrolyte balances together with FWC and EFWC were calculated for days of rising serum sodium and stable serum sodium.

Results

We identified seven patients (10% of patients with ICU-acquired hypernatraemia) with osmotic diuresis due to urea. All patients were intubated during development of hypernatraemia and received enteral nutrition. The median highest serum sodium level of 153 mmol (Q1: 151-Q3: 155 mmol/L) was reached after a 5-day period of rise in serum sodium. During this period, FWC was -904 mL/day (Q1: -1574-Q3: -572), indicating renal water retention, while EFWC was 1419 mL/day (Q1: 1052-Q3: 1923), showing renal water loss. While FWC did not differ between time of stable serum sodium and development of hypernatraemia, EFWC was significantly higher during rise in serum sodium.

Conclusion

Osmotic urea diuresis is a common cause of hypernatraemia in the ICU. EFWC was useful in the differential diagnosis of polyuria during rising serum sodium levels, while FWC was misleading.

### Effects of glucocorticoids in potentiating diuresis in heart failure patients with diuretic resistance [^00f134a3]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Diuretic resistance in heart failure is defined as a state in which diuretic response is diminished or lost before the therapeutic goal of relief from congestion has been reached. Diuretic resistance is very common and is associated with poor outcomes. Over the past decade, several new drugs and devices targeting decongestion and improvement in renal function in patients with heart failure have failed to show benefit in randomized clinical trials. Glucocorticoids had been used to manage diuretic resistance before the advent of loop diuretics. More recent evidence appears to confirm that glucocorticoids may also help to overcome resistance to loop diuretics. This review tries to summarize the available evidence and potential mechanisms related to glucocorticoid therapy in patients with heart failure and its effect on diuretic resistance.

### Diabetes insipidus [^6d82e39b]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder characterized by excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine. Central DI results from a deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, whereas nephrogenic DI results from resistance to AVP in the kidneys. Central and nephrogenic DI are usually acquired, but genetic causes must be evaluated, especially if symptoms occur in early childhood. Central or nephrogenic DI must be differentiated from primary polydipsia, which involves excessive intake of large amounts of water despite normal AVP secretion and action. Primary polydipsia is most common in psychiatric patients and health enthusiasts but the polydipsia in a small subgroup of patients seems to be due to an abnormally low thirst threshold, a condition termed dipsogenic DI. Distinguishing between the different types of DI can be challenging and is done either by a water deprivation test or by hypertonic saline stimulation together with copeptin (or AVP) measurement. Furthermore, a detailed medical history, physical examination and imaging studies are needed to ensure an accurate DI diagnosis. Treatment of DI or primary polydipsia depends on the underlying aetiology and differs in central DI, nephrogenic DI and primary polydipsia.

### How can inhibition of glucose and sodium transport in the early proximal tubule protect the cardiorenal system? [^32d1f6c6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

What mechanisms can link the inhibition of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in the early proximal tubule to kidney and heart protection in patients with and without type 2 diabetes? Due to physical and functional coupling of SGLT2 to other sodium and metabolite transporters in the early proximal tubule (including NHE3, URAT1), inhibitors of SGLT2 (SGLT2i) reduce reabsorption not only of glucose, inducing osmotic diuresis, but of other metabolites plus of a larger amount of sodium than expected based on SGLT2 inhibition alone, thereby reducing volume retention, hypertension and hyperuricemia. Metabolic adaptations to SGLT2i include a fasting-like response, with enhanced lipolysis and formation of ketone bodies that serve as additional fuel for kidneys and heart. Making use of the physiology of tubulo-glomerular communication, SGLT2i functionally lower glomerular capillary pressure and filtration rate, thereby reducing physical stress on the glomerular filtration barrier, tubular exposure to albumin and nephrotoxic compounds, and the oxygen demand for reabsorbing the filtered load. Together with reduced gluco-toxicity in the early proximal tubule and better distribution of transport work along the nephron, SGLT2i can preserve tubular integrity and transport function and, thereby, glomerular filtration rate in the long-term. By shifting transport downstream, SGLT2i may simulate systemic hypoxia at the oxygen sensors in the deep cortex/outer medulla, which stimulates erythropoiesis and, together with osmotic diuresis, enhances hematocrit and thereby improves oxygen delivery to all organs. The described SGLT2-dependent effects may be complemented by off-target effects of SGLT2i on the heart itself and on the microbiome formation of cardiovascular-effective uremic toxins.

### State-of-the-art-review: mechanisms of action of SGLT2 inhibitors and clinical implications [^540354c8]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Inhibitors of the Na+-coupled glucose transporter SGLT2 (SGLT2i) primarily shift the reabsorption of large amounts of glucose from the kidney's early proximal tubule to downstream tubular segments expressing SGLT1, and the non-reabsorbed glucose is spilled into the urine together with some osmotic diuresis. How can this protect the kidneys and heart from failing as observed in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes?

Goal

Mediation analyses identified clinical phenotypes of SGLT2i associated with improved kidney and heart outcome, including a reduction of plasma volume or increase in hematocrit, and lowering of serum urate levels and albuminuria. This review outlines how primary effects of SGLT2i on the early proximal tubule can explain these phenotypes.

Results

The physiology of tubule-glomerular communication provides the basis for acute lowering of GFR and glomerular capillary pressure, which contributes to lowering of albuminuria but also to long term preservation of GFR, at least in part by reducing kidney cortex oxygen demand. Functional co-regulation of SGLT2 with other sodium and metabolite transporters in the early proximal tubule explains why SGLT2i initially excrete more sodium than expected and are uricosuric, thereby reducing plasma volume and serum urate. Inhibition of SGLT2 reduces early proximal tubule gluco-toxicity and by shifting transport downstream may simulate "systemic hypoxia", and the resulting increase in erythropoiesis, together with the osmotic diuresis, enhances hematocrit and improves blood oxygen delivery. Cardio-renal protection by SGLT2i is also provided by a fasting-like and insulin-sparing metabolic phenotype and, potentially, by off-target effects on the heart and microbiotic formation of uremic toxins.

### Worsening renal function in acute heart failure in the context of diuretic response [^29d3ae86]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Worsening renal function (WRF), a term used to describe dynamic changes (decline) of renal function, occurs in 20% to 30% of patients with acute heart failure (AHF) and is associated with greater morbidity and mortality.Haemodynamic derangements in AHF often lead to reduced renal perfusion and increased central venous pressure, so patients with WRF might often have more severe heart failure. However, WRF may also be explained by other factors. For example, WRF can be caused by the initiation or up‐titration of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors, which is generally associated with improved clinical outcomes.,Also, WRF may reflect tubuloglomerular feedback due to greater diuresis and natriuresis, a physiological response to salt loss leading to renal afferent vasoconstriction, thereby reducing glomerular perfusion pressure and filtration. Such a physiological renal response to increased diuresis that is associated with WRF might not necessarily be related to worse clinical outcomes. In fact, several studies have shown that haemoconcentration, consistent with greater diuresis, was associated with better clinical outcomes despite being strongly associated with WRF.In addition, a recent study showed that several markers of decongestion modified the association between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline and adverse outcome.Finally, we and others have shown that a good diuretic response is associated with better clinical outcomes.,,,However, it is currently unclear if patients with a good diuretic response still have favourable outcomes if it is associated with WRF. Furthermore, it is unclear how to recognize when WRF is not associated with a poor prognosis. We investigated the hypothesis that the association between WRF and clinical outcomes depends on diuretic response in two large cohorts of patients with AHF.

### Chlorthalidone (Hemiclor) [^f2d26f16]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Chlorthalidone is a long-acting oral diuretic with antihypertensive activity. Chlorthalidone produces diuresis with increased excretion of sodium and chloride. The site of action appears to be the cortical diluting segment of the ascending limb of Henle’s loop of the nephron. The diuretic effects of chlorthalidone lead to decreased extracellular fluid volume, plasma volume, cardiac output, total exchangeable sodium, glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow. Although the mechanism of action of chlorthalidone and related drugs is not wholly clear, sodium and water depletion appear to provide a basis for its antihypertensive effect.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The diuretic action of chlorthalidone commences a mean of 2.6 hours after dosing and continues for up to 72 hours. Chlorthalidone produces dose-related reductions in serum potassium levels, elevations in serum uric acid and blood glucose, and it can lead to decreased sodium and chloride levels.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Distribution

Approximately 75 percent of the drug is bound to plasma proteins, 58 percent of the drug being bound to albumin. This is caused by an increased affinity of the drug to erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase. Data are not available regarding concentration of the drug in body fluids, degree of uptake by a particular organ or in the fetus, or passage across the blood-brain barrier.

Elimination

The mean plasma half-life of chlorthalidone is about 40 to 60 hours.

Metabolism

Data are not available regarding percentage of dose as unchanged drug and metabolites.

Excretion

Chlorthalidone is eliminated primarily as unchanged drug in the urine. Nonrenal routes of elimination have yet to be clarified.

### SGLT2 inhibition and kidney potassium homeostasis [^580a33a6]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The contribution of increased distal Na + delivery to augment electrogenic K + secretion is likely to be most pronounced soon after initiating the drug since the natriuretic effect of SGLT2is wanes over a variable time course ranging from days to weeks. Concomitant use of diuretics acting proximal to the collecting duct will prolong the kaliuretic effect by extending the duration of natriuresis. By contrast, the inhibitory effect on glucose absorption provides a more enduring effect to promote increased K + secretion. After SGLT2i, unreabsorbed glucose is delivered into the distal nephron. Reabsorption of water concentrates the glucose and raises tubular fluid osmolality. In the collecting duct, this effect will decrease the osmotic gradient between the tubular lumen and interstitium and reduce passive water reabsorption, resulting in an osmotic diuresis.Decreased water absorption will dilute luminal K + concentration, which along with increased flow will provide an ongoing stimulatory effect for K + secretion. The osmotic diuresis may also secondarily increase Na + excretion by solvent drag. The magnitude of osmotic diuresis is directly related to the plasma glucose concentration and persists even in the setting of normoglycemia because these drugs lower the tubular maximum for reabsorption below the normal fasting plasma glucose concentration in fasting healthy individuals.For any given plasma glucose concentration, a decrease in GFR will lower the filtered load of glucose and diminish the glycosuric effect of these drugs. This attenuation in glucose lowering is evident at a GFR of <60 ml/min and is nearly complete at a GFR <30 ml/min, suggesting the contribution of osmotic diuresis to increased K + secretion will likewise be reduced.

The administration of SGLT2is shift energy metabolism from glucose to fat oxidation, causing increased ketogenesis and increased endogenous glucose production. This shift is facilitated by increased glucagon levels accompanied by a reduction in insulin secretion in response to the forced excretion of glucose into the urine. Increased plasma glucagon may contribute to the kaliuretic effect of SGLT2i therapy. Receptors for glucagon are present in the thick ascending limb, distal convoluted tubule, and collecting duct.Infusion studies in rodents show a dose-dependent, rapid, and promptly reversible increase in K + excretion most likely because of a direct stimulatory effect of glucagon in the distal nephron. Because glucagon also stimulates hepatic ureagenesis (the end product of amino acid metabolism) and urinary excretion of urea, increased plasma glucagon after a protein meal may contribute to the excretion of the K + load contained in such diets in addition to disposing of the nitrogenous residues of dietary amino acids.

### The CANVAS program: implications of canagliflozin on reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^2d463785]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Osmotic diuresis and volume depletion

The hemodynamic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, including reduced blood pressure and extracellular volume, are generally favorable effects and may explain, in part, the observed reductions in HF-related events and mortality. However, osmotic diuresis can lead to dehydration and may not be tolerated in all patients. Similar to previous trials of canagliflozin, osmotic diuresis (34.5 vs 13.3 per 1000 patient-years; P < 0.001) and volume depletion (26.0 vs 18.5 per 1000 patient-years; P = 0.009) occurred more frequently with canagliflozin versus placebo in the CANVAS Program.

Risk of fracture

Low-trauma fracture (adjudicated by an endpoint adjudication committee) was the primary prespecified fracture outcome in the CANVAS Program, and significant heterogeneity was observed between the CANVAS study and CANVAS-R (P heterogeneity = 0.003); in the CANVAS study, an increased risk of low-trauma fracture was found to occur more frequently in those receiving canagliflozin compared to those receiving placebo (13.0 vs 8.3 per 1000 patient-years), but this was not observed in CANVAS-R (7.9 vs 10.3 per 1000 patient-years). Between-study heterogeneity was also observed in the secondary outcome of all fracture (adjudicated); patients in the CANVAS study had an increased risk of fracture with canagliflozin compared to placebo (16.9 vs 10.9 per 1000 patient-years), while no difference was observed in CANVAS-R (11.4 vs 13.2 per 1000 patient-years; P heterogeneity = 0.005). There is no clear explanation for the heterogeneity between the CANVAS study and CANVAS-R.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^e18e0f4a]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Medications

Medications are an important cause of hyponatremia to consider. Medications can cause SIAD through stimulating AVP release, potentiating its action, contributing to altered osmotic set point, or being a direct AVP analogue (Table 5). Medications with a natriuretic effect can mimic SIAD by causing hypovolemic hyponatremia with an increased UNa concentration. Thiazide diuretics are one of the most common causes of hyponatremia and are an important differential diagnosis for SIAD. Up to 13% of patients taking thiazides develop hyponatremia. Thiazide diuretics act at the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule to block sodium resorption, which impairs urinary dilution, resulting in free water retention and sodium excretion that can contribute to hyponatremia. A genetic susceptibility to thiazide-associated hyponatremia has been identified, with approximately 50% of those affected found to have a single-nucleotide variation in the SLCO2A1 gene encoding a prostaglandin transporter expressed in the renal collecting duct, a variant that activates water resorption in the collecting duct despite suppression of AVP. Thiazide-induced hyponatremia is likely to reoccur with repeat exposure, so should be recorded as an adverse reaction in the medical record. A rechallenge study in 11 patients with a history of previous thiazide-induced hyponatremia found that a single dose of hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg caused a fall in serum sodium (mean 5.5 mmol/L) in 6 hours, but minimal change in controls. Other medications that cause hyponatremia and resemble SIAD through salt-wasting diuresis include the antibiotic trimethoprim (and by extension, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), especially at higher doses. Of course, these common medications and underlying organic SIAD also frequently coexist, so the presence of potentially hyponatremia-causing medication does not rule out SIAD.

Stage 3: Presentation With Hyperglycemia After Development of Osmotic Diuresis

Osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia causes losses of body water, extracellular sodium and glucose, and intracellular potassium. Formulas (10), (13), (14), (15), (16), (17*), (18), (19) through (20) in Table 4 express volume and solute status in stage 3.

Tonicity values in Figure 6 were calculated using the maximal tonicity values achieved by [Glu] A of 112 mmol/L in Figure 5 and adding the rises in tonicity secondary to osmotic diuresis resulting in water loss from 0% to 25% of the baseline body water and urinary sodium plus urinary potassium concentration sums between 40 and 80 mmol/L.

### Why do SGLT2 inhibitors reduce heart failure hospitalization? A differential volume regulation hypothesis [^60cae6de]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The effect of a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) in reducing heart failure hospitalization in the EMPA-REG OUTCOMES trial has raised the possibility of using these agents to treat established heart failure. We hypothesize that osmotic diuresis induced by SGLT2 inhibition, a distinctly different diuretic mechanism than that of other diuretic classes, results in greater electrolyte-free water clearance and, ultimately, in greater fluid clearance from the interstitial fluid (IF) space than from the circulation, potentially resulting in congestion relief with minimal impact on blood volume, arterial filling and organ perfusion. We utilize a mathematical model to illustrate that electrolyte-free water clearance results in a greater reduction in IF volume compared to blood volume, and that this difference may be mediated by peripheral sequestration of osmotically inactive sodium. By coupling the model with data on plasma and urinary sodium and water in healthy subjects who received either the SGLT2i dapagliflozin or loop diuretic bumetanide, we predict that dapagliflozin produces a 2-fold greater reduction in IF volume compared to blood volume, while the reduction in IF volume with bumetanide is only 78% of the reduction in blood volume. Heart failure is characterized by excess fluid accumulation, in both the vascular compartment and interstitial space, yet many heart failure patients have arterial underfilling because of low cardiac output, which may be aggravated by conventional diuretic treatment. Thus, we hypothesize that, by reducing IF volume to a greater extent than blood volume, SGLT2 inhibitors might provide better control of congestion without reducing arterial filling and perfusion.

### Approach to the patient with suspected hypotonic polyuria [^bebc64b7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

It is common for endocrinologists to receive referred patients who have polyuria and polydipsia that need investigation. When initial investigations reveal the urine to be hypotonic, differentiating between the 3 main causes is essential, as the management differs for each. Over the past 2 years, due to concerns about patient safety and in response to patient feedback, the causes of hypotonic polyuria have been renamed as arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D, formerly central diabetes insipidus), arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R, formerly nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), while the name of the third cause is retained as primary polydipsia (PP), in which excess fluid intake suppresses AVP secretion. In a survey of more than one thousand patients with AVP-D, the large majority had experienced confusion of their condition by health care workers with diabetes mellitus, resulting in delays in availability of desmopressin and unnecessary capillary glucose monitoring when hospitalized, and 85% favored changing the name. The new nomenclature more accurately reflects pathophysiology and clearly identifies the patients’ condition as different from diabetes mellitus, and now has been adopted by the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) taxonomy hierarchy codes for electronic patient records. In parallel, the last several years have seen improvements in the diagnostic tools used for the investigation of hypotonic polyuria, with a particular emphasis on the use of measurement of plasma copeptin. This Approach to the Patient review presents the use of this copeptin-based approach in 3 specific cases, and places each in the context of the revised nomenclature. We then describe the overall approach to the patient presenting with hypotonic polyuria, itemize the causes, and discuss when and how testing should be performed (Fig. 1), highlighting specific areas that frequently cause diagnostic and management difficulties.

### Is it possible to improve elderly male bladder function by having them drink more water? A randomized trial of effects of increased fluid intake / urine output on male lower urinary tract function [^2238634e]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Several animal studies have shown that bladder performance improves as a result of diuresis. Whether increased urine output also has beneficial effects on elderly male bladder function and lower urinary tract symptoms is unknown.

Methods

We performed a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 141 men, 55 to 75 years of age, with moderate lower urinary tract symptoms. The experimental group drank 1.5 L of extra water daily. The control group consumed one tablespoon of placebo syrup daily. After 6 months, we evaluated bladder contractility, voided volumes, and the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms. The actual increase in water consumption was measured using the deuterium urine dilution method.

Results

Water consumption in the intervention group increased by 359 mL (95% confidence interval [CI] 171 to 548) per 24 hours compared with the control group. At 6 months, no statistically significant effect was found in the maximal flow rate (0.9 mL/s, 95% CI -0.4 to 2.2) compared with placebo. A statistically significant effect was found for bladder pressure (20 cm H2O, 95% CI 6 to 34) and bladder wall stress (1.9 N/cm2, 95% CI 0.3 to 3.5). In addition, it showed that the experimental group had greater maximal (44 mL, 95% CI -1 to 90) and average (26 mL, 95% CI 1 to 51) voided volumes per urination. The subjective effect parameters improved in both groups, but no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups.

Conclusions

It seems possible to improve some aspects of male bladder function by drinking more water. However, the effects are too small to be clinically relevant.

### Mannitol-induced diuresis (...) [^f7bdf19e]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Introduction In the past several years there has been renewed interest in the osmotic diuretic mannitol. In abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy mannitol has been widely used to maintain renal plasma flow and urinary output during cross-clamping of the abdominal aorta. 1 Increased urinary output during and after aortic surgery has been described in the literature2, 3 and confirmed by our own experience with the drug. Some discrepancies exist in published reports as to the amount of sodium lost in the urine during mannitol diuresis and the significance of this loss. In nonanesthetized, resting humans separate studies have shown that with mannitol diuresis there is increased sodium excretion with a significant decrease in serum sodium. 4, 5 Boba, Gainor, and Powers6 have shown that anesthetized traumatized dogs infused with 10% mannitol undergo considerable urine sodium loss with marked decreases in serum sodium. Whelan, 3 on the other hand, has reported that urine.

### Sodium chloride (nacellate solution 0.9%-100mL) [^dfbad24f]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP provides electrolytes and is a source of water for hydration. It is capable of inducing diuresis depending on the clinical condition of the patient.

Sodium, the major cation of the extracellular fluid, functions primarily in the control of water distribution, fluid balance, and osmotic pressure of body fluids. Sodium is also associated with chloride and bicarbonate in the regulation of the acid-base equilibrium of body fluid.

Chloride, the major extracellular anion, closely follows the metabolism of sodium, and changes in the acid-base balance of the body are reflected by changes in the chloride concentration.

### The biology of water homeostasis [^b7aad71f]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Disturbances in the physiological release or kidney response to AVP leads to water balance disorders, which are either classified as AVP deficiency/resistance (previously diabetes insipidus) or the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD; Fig. 2). Furthermore, lack of thirst (primary hypodipsia) or increased thirst sensation (primary polydipsia) also lead to water balance disorders. Depending on whether water balance disorders cause water loss or water retention, people will be prone to develop hypernatraemia or hyponatraemia. However, if thirst is intact and water intake is appropriately adjusted, people with water balance disorders remain normonatraemic. There is also a physiological mechanism to counteract the effects of AVP through the neurovasoactive peptide apelin. Apelin colocalizes with AVP in magnocellular vasopressinergic neurons, but has opposite effects and causes aquaresis instead of antidiuresis. The apelin receptor is expressed in the hypothalamus and collecting duct (CD) principal cells. Activation of the apelin receptor suppresses central AVP release but also counteracts the AVP stimulation of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) by inhibiting adenylate cyclase and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the kidney CD. A recent study demonstrated that an agonist of the apelin receptor can stimulate aquaresis and improve hyponatraemia in a rat model of AVP-induced water retention.

### Sodium and fluid excretion with torsemide in healthy subjects is limited by the short duration of diuretic action [^f6882e95]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The short duration of action of 2 to 4 hours of all loop diuretics after oral dosing is a class defect that can lead to 3 problems. First, the urinary concentration of the loop diuretic resides within the therapeutic range for only a short period. 10, 15 Second, the abrupt but short‐lived natriuresis leaves ≈20 hours for the kidney to regain the salt and water lost before the next daily dose. 8, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19 These attributes account for the failure of furosemide and bumetanide to cause net Na + loss over 1 to 3 days of once‐daily administration to normal subjects unless dietary salt is restricted to below 120 mmol·d −1. 8, 16, 18 Third, the torrential acute diuresis (“Niagara effect”) can cause incontinence in subjects with impaired bladder control. 20

We studied a novel extended‐release (ER) formulation of torsemide that delivers the drug into solution over 8 to 10 hours (Figure 1) to test the hypothesis that the inability of a single dose of a loop diuretic to deplete the body of salt and water during high salt intake is caused by a limited duration of action on the kidney. We compared the effects of 20 mg of oral torsemide as an immediate‐release (IR) or ER formulation given to 10 healthy volunteers consuming a fixed high‐salt diet containing 300 mmol Na + daily. We measured pharmacokinetics, creatinine clearance (C CR), and patterns of electrolyte and water excretion after drug administration to assess the mechanisms of any differences.

### Cardiovascular benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in diabetic and nondiabetic patients [^7c63463d]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Natriuresis, diuresis, and reduction in plasma volume

SGLT2i reduce the reabsorption of filtered glucose and sodium by blocking SGLT2, thus leading to natriuresis and osmotic diuresis. The natriuretic effect of SGLT2i may also be enhanced because of functional coordination with Na + /H + exchanger 3, which mediates a large fraction of sodium absorption in the proximal tubule. Skin sodium levels, which are closely associated with left ventricular mass, are increased in patients with T2DM and SGLT2 inhibition reduced skin sodium levels (without osmotic activity) in T2DM patients.

SGLT2i lead to a rapid increase in urine volume (approximately 110–470 ml/day), which settles at a new stable level over 12 weeks, with a persistent decline in plasma volume of about 7% by 12 weeks. The gradual attenuation of the diuretic effect is presumably regulated by compensatory mechanisms. A study in rats showed an increase in vasopressin-induced solute-free water reabsorption after administration of SGLT2i. SGLT2i increase the sodium concentration delivered to the macula densa and thus enhance renal tubuloglomerular feedback signals, resulting in a decrease in GFR and contraction of the renal afferent arterioles.

SGLT2i attenuate congestion, with little effect on arterial perfusion, in patients with HF. A mathematical model suggested that this is because the osmotic diuresis induced by SGLT2i leads to greater clearance of electrolyte-free water in the intercellular space than in the blood vessels, causing a greater reduction in intercellular fluid volume, relative to circulating volume. The improved quality of life in patients with HF during therapy with SGLT2i might be partly explained by this mechanism.

### Diuretic therapy for patients With Heart Failure: JACC state-of-the-art review [^12cee37a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Expansion of extracellular fluid volume is central to the pathophysiology of heart failure. Increased extracellular fluid leads to elevated intracardiac filling pressures, resulting in a constellation of signs and symptoms of heart failure referred to as congestion. Loop diuretics are one of the cornerstones of treatments for heart failure, but in contrast to other therapies, robust clinical trial evidence to guide the use of diuretics is sparse. A nuanced understanding of renal physiology and diuretic pharmacokinetics is essential for skillful use of diuretics in the management of heart failure in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Diuretic resistance, defined as an inadequate quantity of natriuresis despite an adequate diuretic regimen, is a major clinical challenge that generally portends a poor prognosis. In this review, the authors discuss the fundamental mechanisms and physiological principles that underlie the use of diuretic therapy and the available data on the optimal use of diuretics.

### New developments and concepts in the diagnosis and management of diabetes insipidus (AVP-deficiency and resistance) [^2c8a430c]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder characterised by the excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine, with a prevalence of 1 per 25,000 population. Central DI (CDI), better now referred to as arginine vasopressin (AVP)-deficiency, is the most common form of DI resulting from deficiency of the hormone AVP from the pituitary. The less common nephrogenic DI (NDI) or AVP-resistance develops secondary to AVP resistance in the kidneys. The majority of causes of DI are acquired, with CDI developing when more than 80% of AVP-secreting neurons are damaged. Inherited/familial CDI causes account for approximately 1% of cases. Although the pathogenesis of NDI is unclear, more than 280 disease-causing mutations affecting the AVP2 protein or AVP V2 receptor, as well as in aquaporin 2 (AQP2), have been described. Although the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway remains the major regulatory pathway of AVP/AQP2 action, in vitro data have also revealed additional cAMP independent pathways of NDI pathogenesis. Diagnosing partial forms of DI, and distinguishing them from primary polydipsia, can be challenging, previously necessitating the use of the water deprivation test. However, measurements of circulating copeptin levels, especially after stimulation, are increasingly replacing the classical tests in clinical practice because of their ease of use and high sensitivity and specificity. The treatment of CDI relies on desmopressin administration, whereas NDI requires the management of any underlying diseases, removal of offending drugs and, in some cases, administration of diuretics. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of DI has led to novel evolving therapeutic agents that are under clinical trial.

### The diuresis clinic: a new paradigm for the treatment of mild decompensated heart failure [^3c3ab548]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure results in approximately 1 million hospital admissions annually in the United States and is the leading cause of 30-day readmissions.

Methods

This study explores the impact of a diuresis clinic on heart failure outcomes and cost. Data were collected prospectively on all consecutive patients who received intravenous diuretics and multidisciplinary care in the clinic from its establishment from October 2011 to December 2012, as well as a comparison cohort of patients with heart failure who were admitted to the hospital for <48 hours. The percentage of hospitalized days was calculated for both cohorts 180 days before and 180 days after each patient's index visit.

Results

In the diuresis clinic group, 106 patients (mean age, 68.2 ± 13 years; 48% were women) were treated over 328 visits (1-22 visits per person), with a mean intravenous furosemide dose of 100 mg, average urine output of 1460 ± 730 mL, and weight loss of 2.3 ± 1.8 kg. Days hospitalized decreased from 38.3 to 31.2 per 1000 patient-days after the index diuresis clinic visit (P < .01). In the comparison group, 143 patients (mean age, 69 ± 16 years; 54% were women) were admitted for <48 hours. Days hospitalized increased from 14.4 to 21.0 per 1000 patient-days after index admission (P < .01). On multivariate analysis, the diuresis clinic was associated with 3 fewer days in the hospital per 180 days per patient, with an estimated annual savings of $12,113 per patient.

Conclusions

Compared with a brief hospital stay, treatment of mild decompensated heart failure in a diuresis clinic resulted in a substantial and cost-effective decline in the rate of subsequent hospitalization.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^f38c27af]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Diuretics in hospitalized heart failure: synopsis and supportive context. Intravenous loop diuretic therapy provides the most rapid and effective treatment for signs and symptoms of congestion leading to hospitalization for HF. Titration to achieve effective diuresis may require doubling of initial doses, adding a thiazide diuretic, or adding an MRA that has diuretic effects in addition to its cardiovascular benefits. A major goal of therapy is resolution of the signs and symptoms of congestion before discharge, as persistent congestion scored at discharge has been associated with higher rates of rehospitalizations and mortality. Most patients who have required intravenous diuretic therapy during hospitalization for HF will require prescription of loop diuretics at discharge to decrease recurrence of symptoms and hospitalization. As background, diuretic therapy with oral furosemide was the cornerstone of HF therapy for ≥20 years before construction of the modern bases of evidence for HF therapies.

### Phenotyping nocturnal polyuria: circadian and age-related variations in diuresis rate, free water clearance and sodium clearance [^85da91db]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

this study compares diuresis rate, sodium clearance and free water clearance (FWC) by age and time of day (nighttime vs. daytime) in subjects with and without nocturnal polyuria (NP) to determine whether these variables affect the phenotype of NP.

Methods

post hoc analysis of two prospective observational studies. Eight urine samples collected at 3-h intervals and a single blood sample were used to calculate daytime (10a/1p/4p/7p/10p) and nighttime (1a/4a/7a) diuresis rates, sodium clearance and FWC. Three mixed linear models were constructed for diuresis rate, sodium clearance and FWC using four predictor variables: NP status (present [nocturnal urine production >90 ml/h] vs. absent [≤90 ml/h]), time of day, age and study identification.

Results

subjects with NP experienced higher nighttime versus daytime diuresis rates, sodium clearance and FWC. Regardless of NP status, increased age was accompanied by an increase in the ratio of nighttime/daytime diuresis rate, nighttime sodium clearance and daytime sodium clearance. FWC showed a complex age effect, which was independent of time of day or NP status.

Conclusions

age-related increases in nighttime/daytime diuresis rate, 24-h sodium clearance and 24-h FWC are not specific to subjects with NP. The age-related surge in either nocturnal sodium clearance or nocturnal FWC may represent the relevant substrate for behavioural or pharmacologic interventions targeting sodium diuresis or free water diuresis, respectively. Increases in FWC in older age groups may reflect impaired circadian rhythmicity of endogenous AVP or changes in responsiveness of the aged nephron to water clearance.

### Nondiagnostic 99m Tc-MAG3 diuresis renography studies caused by propofol sedation: a case series [^952940b8]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

99m Tc-MAG3 diuresis renography is a noninvasive functional imaging technique used to assess clearance of radiotracer in a dilated urinary tract under high diuresis. It is commonly performed in patients to diagnose functionally significant urinary tract obstruction. In some pediatric patients, sedation is required to enable imaging. However, propofol, a commonly used IV sedative agent, is associated with altered renal hemodynamics. We report a case series of 3 pediatric patients at our institution who received propofol sedation to enable 99m Tc-MAG3 diuresis renography using a F+0 protocol, outlining that some "abnormal" studies were in fact assessed to be nondiagnostic.

### Proximal versus distal diuretics in congestive heart failure [^431d6364]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Volume overload represents a hallmark clinical feature linked to the development and progression of heart failure (HF). Alleviating signs and symptoms of volume overload represents a foundational HF treatment target that is achieved using loop diuretics in the acute and chronic setting. Recent work has provided evidence to support guideline-directed medical therapies, such as sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists, as important adjunct diuretics that may act synergistically when used with background loop diuretics in people with chronic HF. Furthermore, there is growing interest in understanding the role of SGLT2 inhibitors, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and MR antagonists in treating volume overload in patients hospitalized for acute HF, particularly in the setting of loop diuretic resistance. Thus, the current review demonstrates that: (i) SGLT2 inhibitors and MR antagonists confer long-term cardioprotection in chronic HF patients but it is unclear whether natriuresis or diuresis represents the primary mechanisms for this benefit, (ii) SGLT2 inhibitors, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and thiazide diuretics increase natriuresis in the acute HF setting, but implications on long-term outcomes remain unclear and warrants further investigation, and (iii) a multi-nephron segment approach, using agents that act on distinct segments of the nephron, potentiate diuresis to alleviate signs and symptoms of volume overload in acute HF.

Dietary water restriction counseling—Attempts at water restriction commonly are futile if sodium limitation is not observed simultaneously, and reducing a patient's water intake alone is not prudent most of the time because excessive sodium ingestion increases ECF osmolality and stimulates thirst; advising water limitation without curtailing sodium intake will cause suffering from unnecessary thirst.

### Critical analysis of the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal tubular sodium, water and chloride homeostasis and their role in influencing heart failure outcomes [^2ff71c43]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary and Conclusions

SGLT2 inhibitors block proximal tubular sodium and glucose reabsorption, but the nature and duration of any natriuretic or osmotic diuretic effect are the result of an interplay of the degree of SGLT2 and NHE3 upregulation, the extent to which downstream nephron mechanisms are activated in a compensatory manner, and the volume status and set point in individual patients. In euvolemic patients, counterregulatory sodium- and water-retaining downstream mechanisms are activated rapidly, thus truncating the duration of any observable diuresis. In fluid overloaded patients with acutely decompensated heart failure, the net early effect of SGLT2 inhibition is a water diuresis, but this aquaresis does not contribute to the early clinical improvement in these patients. The magnitude of any glycosuria-dependent effect is markedly attenuated in patients with a glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2,and yet these patients still show a robust reduction in the risk of heart failure hospitalizations with SGLT2 inhibitors. In patients with chronic heart failure, SGLT2 inhibitors may potentiate the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics, but in the short term, in patients with fluid retention, the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors to enhance the effect of loop diuretics appears to be smaller than with metolazone.There is little evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors alleviate edema or physical signs of congestion.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^e58d7d81]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

SELECTING THE RIGHT TERMINOLOGY: DIFFERENT MECHANISMS OF ACTION

Historically, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics were grouped together as they target the same segment of the distal convoluted tubule. It was thought that the targeting of the sodium-chloride transporter in this part of the kidney tubule mediated the decreases in blood pressure and cardiac output by causing volume loss. The mechanism of action for the blood pressure-lowering effect of diuretics is, in fact, more complex. Only the initial blood pressure reduction (1–2 weeks) is mediated by the kidney: the hypovolemia rapidly stimulates the activation of RAS, which stalls the decrease in blood pressure and results in volume and cardiac output returning almost to baseline. It is the second phase, during which the diuretic treatment targets peripheral vascular resistance and vasodilation that mediates the bulk of the ongoing (4–8 weeks) and long-term blood pressure reduction.

### Osmotic homeostasis [^c10b008b]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Alterations in water homeostasis can disturb cell size and function. Although most cells can internally regulate cell volume in response to osmolar stress, neurons are particularly at risk given a combination of complex cell function and space restriction within the calvarium. Thus, regulating water balance is fundamental to survival. Through specialized neuronal "osmoreceptors" that sense changes in plasma osmolality, vasopressin release and thirst are titrated in order to achieve water balance. Fine-tuning of water absorption occurs along the collecting duct, and depends on unique structural modifications of renal tubular epithelium that confer a wide range of water permeability. In this article, we review the mechanisms that ensure water homeostasis as well as the fundamentals of disorders of water balance.

### Copeptin and its role in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^d6c8e640]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is the main regulating hormone of body fluid homeostasis. It is secreted from the posterior pituitary upon osmotic or nonosmotic stimuli, with the main osmotic stimulus being increased plasma osmolality and the main nonosmotic stimulus being hypovolaemia and promotes water reabsorption via V2 receptors in the kidney, thereby normalizing hypertonicity and vasomotor tone.

Disorders of body fluid homeostasis are common and can be divided into hyper‐ and hypoosmolar circumstances: the classical hyperosmolar disorder (deficiency of body fluid relative to body solute 1) is diabetes insipidus, while the most common hypoosmolar disorder (excess of body fluid relative to body solute) is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD).

Diabetes insipidus belongs to the polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome and is characterized by a high urinary output of more than 50 ml per kg body weight per 24 hours, accompanied by polydipsia of more than 3 L a day. 2 After exclusion of osmotic diuresis (such as hyperglycaemia), the differential diagnosis of polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome includes impaired AVP synthesis (central diabetes insipidus) or action (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) as well as primary polydipsia.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis is the predominant cause of hyponatraemia 3, 4 and is characterized by reduced free water excretion and secondary natriuresis, 5 mostly due to an imbalanced secretion of the antidiuretic hormone AVP. 6, 7

Arginine vasopressin measurement could theoretically help in the guidance of diagnosis and treatment of body fluid disorders. However, AVP is difficult to measure and unreliable, mainly due to complex pre‐analytical requirements. 8 Copeptin is the C‐terminal segment of the AVP precursor peptide and mirrors AVP concentrations. 9 It can easily be measured providing a reliable surrogate marker for AVP.

This review focuses on copeptin and its role in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and SIAD.

### Water prescription in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a pilot study [^3b94d145]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

In animal models of polycystic kidney disease, the ingestion of large amounts of water promotes diuresis by suppressing plasma levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and renal levels of cAMP, slowing cyst progression. Whether simple water ingestion is a potential therapeutic strategy for individuals with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is unknown. In this study, a simple method to quantify the amount of water to achieve a specific mean urine osmolality target in patients with ADPKD was developed and tested.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

In eight ADPKD patients eating typical diets, osmolality and volume were measured in 24-hour urine collections. The amount of additional ingested water required daily to achieve a mean urine osmolality of 285 ± 45 mosm/kg was determined. Participants were instructed to distribute the prescribed water over waking hours for each of 5 days. Blood chemistries, 24-hour urine collections, BP, and weight were measured before and after the period of supplemental water intake.

Results

Five patients achieved the 285 mosm/kg urine target without difficulty. Mean urine osmolality decreased and mean urine volume increased; serum sodium, weight, and BP were unchanged. Daily osmolar excretion remained constant, indicating a stable ad lib dietary intake of solutes and protein over the 2-week study period.

Conclusions

The amount of additional water needed to achieve a urine osmolality target can be approximated from the urine osmolar excretion in ADPKD patients eating typical diets, providing a quantitative method to prescribe supplemental water for such individuals.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^7b14a709]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypernatremia

Hypernatremia is characterized by a plasma sodium concentration greater than 145 mmol/L. Hypernatremia is a less common SEA and generally affects children less than 4 years old. This condition typically arises from decreased free water intake or increased loss of solute-free water and viral gastroenteritis is the leading cause. Additionally, a less common cause is salt poisoning. Importantly, hypernatremic dehydration can result from excessive water loss due to conditions including osmotic diuresis or urinary concentration defects. Determining the cause of the hypernatremic state is crucial for effective management and is depicted in Fig. 3. When the FENa is less than 1% and the patient demonstrates weight loss, this can be either attributed to free water loss or insufficient water intake. Free water loss in a hypernatremic state is attributed to extrarenal causes such as vomiting and diarrhea or renal losses such as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) resistance or osmotic diuresis. Furthermore, if a patient demonstrates a FENa of greater than 2% with weight gain, this is typically attributed to salt excess. Additionally, Table 2 demonstrates the various causes of hypernatremia in children.

### Pathophysiology of diuretic resistance and its implications for the management of chronic heart failure [^caa41541]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Diuretic resistance implies a failure to increase fluid and sodium (Na + ) output sufficiently to relieve volume overload, edema, or congestion, despite escalating doses of a loop diuretic to a ceiling level (80 mg of furosemide once or twice daily or greater in those with reduced glomerular filtration rate or heart failure). It is a major cause of recurrent hospitalizations in patients with chronic heart failure and predicts death but is difficult to diagnose unequivocally. Pharmacokinetic mechanisms include the low and variable bioavailability of furosemide and the short duration of all loop diuretics that provides time for the kidneys to restore diuretic-induced Na + losses between doses. Pathophysiological mechanisms of diuretic resistance include an inappropriately high daily salt intake that exceeds the acute diuretic-induced salt loss, hyponatremia or hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, and reflex activation of the renal nerves. Nephron mechanisms include tubular tolerance that can develop even during the time that the renal tubules are exposed to a single dose of diuretic, or enhanced reabsorption in the proximal tubule that limits delivery to the loop, or an adaptive increase in reabsorption in the downstream distal tubule and collecting ducts that offsets ongoing blockade of Na + reabsorption in the loop of Henle. These provide rationales for novel strategies including the concurrent use of diuretics that block these nephron segments and even sequential nephron blockade with multiple diuretics and aquaretics combined in severely diuretic-resistant patients with heart failure.

### Whole-body volume regulation and escape from antidiuresis [^f6bbbb0b]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Both individual cells and organs regulate their volume in response to sustained hypo-osmolality via solute and water losses. Similar processes occur in the whole body to regulate the volumes of extracellular fluid (ECF) and intravascular spaces toward normal levels. Body water losses occur via the phenomena "escape from antidiuresis"; solute losses occur through the secondary natriuresis induced by water retention. As a result of resistance to arginine vasopressin (AVP) signaling, escape from antidiuresis is caused by downregulation of kidney aquaporin-2 expression despite high AVP plasma levels. Recent data have implicated downregulation of vasopressin V2R as a potential mechanism of resistance, and suggest that this may be a result of decreased intrarenal angiotensin II signaling in combination with increased intrarenal nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 signaling. The natriuresis that results in volume regulation of the ECF and vascular spaces is the result of intrarenal hemodynamic changes produced by volume expansion, but the degree to which these effects are modulated by aldosterone secretion and the activity of distal sodium cotransporters and channels remains to be elucidated. The clinical implication of these volume-regulatory processes is that the chronic hyponatremic state is one of water retention and solute losses from intracellular fluid and ECF compartments. The degree to which solute losses versus water retention contribute to hyponatremia will vary in association with many factors, including the etiology of the hyponatremia, the rapidity of development of the hyponatremia, the chronicity of the hyponatremia, the volume of daily water loading, and individual variability. Understanding these volume-regulatory processes allows a better understanding of many aspects of the conundrum of patients with "clinical euvolemia" and dilutional hyponatremia from AVP-induced water retention.

### Relationship between the first undisturbed sleep period and diuretic and urine storage States of the first void after sleep [^b50d6198]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

The FUSP substantially impacts sleep quality, particularly within the first 3 h after sleep (i.e. the first two sleep cycles). Waking during this period reduces slow‐wave sleep duration, leading to daytime fatigue, decreased quality of life, impaired glucose tolerance, and even dementia. Various factors can cause nighttime awakenings in older adults, but nocturia is the most common. Weiss et al. reported that nocturnal polyuria accompanies most cases of frequent nocturia. Because urine volume is the sum of water diuresis and osmotic diuresis, the presence of nocturnal polyuria indicates an increase in one or both of these processes. FWC reflects water diuresis, and increased SC is thought to drive osmotic diuresis. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the diuretic state using FWC and SC. We found that water diuresis was elevated in the first urine after sleep compared with the first urine upon waking in both the FUSP < 3 h and FUSP ≥ 3 h groups. Goessart et al. also reported increased water diuresis early in sleep, with a decreased diuresis rate upon waking. Their results were similar to ours, despite differences in nocturnal polyuria status, sex, and age among the included patients. The cause of this increased water diuresis early in sleep remains unclear. However, water redistribution due to altered body position occurs within 30–40 min, potentially contributing to increased water diuresis early in sleep. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between 24‐h water intake and water diuresis during the first urination after falling asleep, suggesting that increased circulating plasma volume from water intake contributes to water diuresis.

In both the FUSP < 3 h and FUSP ≥ 3 h groups, sodium diuresis was increased in the first urine after falling asleep and the first urine upon waking; the diuretic state did not differ between these voids. Goessart et al. also reported no significant change in sodium diuresis during sleep. However, other studies have shown that excessive salt intake and hypertension can enhance sodium diuresis during sleep. Although we found no clear difference in 24‐h salt intake between the FUSP < 3 h and FUSP ≥ 3 h groups, 24‐h salt intake and BNP level were positively correlated with sodium diuresis (r = 0.253, p = 0.019 and r = 0.268, p = 0.012, respectively). This suggests that excessive salt intake can lead to increased circulating plasma volume and enhanced sodium diuresis.

### Cosmic kidney disease: an integrated pan-omic, physiological and morphological study into spaceflight-induced renal dysfunction [^ef81409a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Abnormal water homeostasis has been noted in astronauts since the early days of spaceflight, with a marked reduction in both diuresis and natriuresis with vasopressin dysregulation via unknown mechanisms –. In fact, the reduced NKCC2 activity would conversely be anticipated to enhance diuresis, much like a loop diuretic. In this context, downregulation of prostaglandin transporters (PGT; encoded by SLCO2A1), a result seen in multiple of our proteomic and transcriptomic datasets (Fig. 5), is intriguing and may offer a way to reconcile this paradox. As carriers of a gain-of-function mutation of SLCO2A1, see a reduction in PGT activity in the proximal straight tubule and the cortical collecting duct which colocalises with Aquaporin-2 (AQP2). Loss of PGT-mediated reabsorption by collecting duct principal cells, causes a subsequent build-up in the luminal concentration of the prostaglandin PGE 2, which stimulates apical prostaglandin E 2 receptor 4 (EP 4) receptors to activate Aquaporin-2 and inappropriate water reabsorption. In our study the loss of NKCC2 activity through dephosphorylation and reduction of PGT abundance can offset each other.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^f2571f79]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Loop Diuretics

Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, increase urinary salt and water excretion via inhibition of the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter in the Henle loop to reduce reabsorption of these solutes. They are listed in the European guidelines as a second-line therapy for SIAD in combination with salt tablets (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), but are not endorsed in the international expert panel recommendations. The guideline recommendation was made on the strength of several case series, though only 1 of these included patients with SIAD rather than patients with heart failure and cirrhosis, and that report from 1973 included only 5 patients.

Loop diuretics are useful in the treatment of hypervolemia; however, in the absence of volume excess, natriuresis may cause volume depletion, which stimulates AVP release, thereby worsening hyponatremia. The randomized trial discussed earlier that evaluated FR with and without furosemide and salt tablets to prevent hypovolemia in SIAD found no significant benefit to the addition of frusemide 20 to 40 mg daily compared with FR alone, but in fact observed increased rates of acute kidney injury and hypokalemia. Furosemide increases urinary potassium excretion, which can be potentiated by increased sodium in the distal nephron. Because of this recent evidence, we do not recommend loop diuretics for euvolemic hyponatremia.

### Evaluation and management of hypo-osmolality in hospitalized patients [^2ae6ef8f]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting. Abnormalities of the mechanisms that maintain normal water and sodium metabolism are often present in hospitalized patients, including defects in renal water excretion. All of the current therapeutic approaches in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and other forms of vasopressin-induced hyponatremia have significant limitations. Studies in animal models and humans have demonstrated that antagonists of the AVP V2 receptor in the kidney are effective in correcting hyponatremia. These new agents have been termed "aquaretics" because of their ability to induce a free water diuresis without the natriuresis or kaliuresis characteristic of diuretic drugs. When approved for clinical use, selective V2, and possibly also combined V1 + V2 receptor antagonists will be helpful in therapy.

Diuretic therapy (Figure 6)—in hospitalized heart failure, initiate IV loop diuretics early (ED or immediately after admission) with an initial dose usually 1-2.5 times total daily oral loop diuretic agent in furosemide equivalents, and prescribe IV diuretics every 8-12 hrs or continuous while measuring daily weights and urine output and monitoring vital signs and congestion; consider addition of SGLT inhibitors for chronic therapy and consider adjunct diuretic agent such as acetazolamide. For Adequate diuresis, continue diuretics with target relief of congestion and plan for transition to oral therapy. For Inadequate diuresis, usually increase loop diuretic agent dose by 50%-100% and consider other thiazides or additional diuretic agents. For Refractory to diuretics, change course by escalating diuretics, considering additional diuretic agents or other decongestion strategies, and consider hemodynamic monitoring to guide therapy.

### In-vivo administration of CLC-K kidney chloride channels inhibitors increases water diuresis in rats: a new drug target for hypertension? [^66e12a97]. Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The human kidney-specific chloride channels ClC-Ka (rodent ClC-K1) and ClC-Kb (rodent ClC-K2) are important determinants of renal function, participating to urine concentration and blood pressure regulation mechanisms. Here we tested the hypothesis that these chloride channels could represent new drug targets for inducing diuretic and antihypertensive effects.

Methods

To this purpose, the CLC-K blockers benzofuran derivatives MT-189 and RT-93 (10, 50, 100mg/kg), were acutely administered by gavage in Wistar rats, and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters determined by functional, bioanalytical, biochemical and molecular biology assays.

Results

Plasma concentration values for MT-189 and RT-93 were indicative of good bioavailability. Both MT-189 and RT-93 dose-dependently increased urine volume without affecting electrolyte balance. A comparable reduction of SBP was observed in rats after MT-189, RT-93 or furosemide administration. Benzofuran derivatives treatment did not affect kidney CLC-K mRNA level or inner medulla osmolality, whereas a significant vasopressin-independent down-regulation of aquaporin water channel type 2 was observed at protein and transcriptional levels. In rats treated with benzofuran derivatives, the observed polyuria was mainly water diuresis; this finding indirectly supports a cross-talk between chloride and water transport in nephron. Moreover, preliminary in-vitro evaluation of the drugs capability to cross the blood-inner ear barrier suggests that these compounds have a limited ability to induce potential auditory side effects.

Conclusion

CLC-K blockers may represent a new class of drugs for the treatment of conditions associated with expanded extracellular volume, with a hopeful high therapeutic potential for hypertensive patients carrying ClC-K gain-of-function polymorphisms.

### As the river flows: a case report of post obstructive diuresis [^dd99d240]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The typical pathophysiology of PObD involves multiple mechanisms. These include a progressive reduction in medullary concentration due to washout from urinary retention and tubular injury, downregulation of sodium transport receptors in the thick ascending loop of henle, a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) because of excess urinary retention leading to ischemic effects and damage to nephrons, and a poor response to anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) comparable to that of Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (DI) [,,–]. Multiple conditions can lead to outlet obstruction of the urinary tract and induce PObD such as urinary stones, benign prostatic hyperplasia, fecal impaction, diabetes and neurogenic disorders, and/or bladder or prostate cancer as in our patient.

Although there are no concrete treatment plans for patients with PObD, there is acknowledged importance in ensuring documentation of hourly urine output and serum electrolytes every 12 h. The expectation is to replace half to two thirds of the hourly urine output to avoid increased diuresis while also ensuring adequate fluid resuscitation combined with appropriate electrolyte repletion [–,]. A urine sodium greater than 40 and a specific gravity less than 1.010 or a urine osmolality less than 450 can indicate concurrent tubular dysfunction and can also be tracked to indicate improvement in a patient’s condition [–,,].

ADPKD—thiazide diuretics or metformin to mitigate tolvaptan-induced aquaresis: short-term signals exist, but use is not advised. Tolvaptan “causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, resulting in substantial polyuria,” and hydrochlorothiazide “is an established therapy for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, as it is able to decrease urine output by around 30%”; metformin “has been shown to decrease urine output by almost 50% in tolvaptan-treated rats.” In two small crossover trials, short-term regimens “reduced urine volume, as measured in a 24-hour time, by 21%–25%, and improved QoL,” but “the long-term effect of these interventions… is not known,” and “A planned trial will evaluate this question (NCT05373264, comprising 300 participants).” Accordingly, “we advise against using a thiazide diuretic or other concomitant medication to mitigate aquaresis.”

### Seasonal variation of vasopressin and its relevance for the winter peak of cardiometabolic disease: a pooled analysis of five cohorts [^7e5eff7f]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Low water intake is the key determinant of high plasma VP and copeptin during normal conditions. Consequently, the easiest way to lower VP and copeptin concentration in plasma is to drink water. Previous epidemiological studies have found increased water intake during the warm season. Another study found serum osmolality among elderly to be higher during the spring, and urine to be more concentrated during the winter and the spring, than during the summer and autumn, further pointing at a less hydrated state, and thus elevated VP concentration, during the cold season.

Thirst, hydration status, and drinking behavior are complex entities and decreased thirst, as well as increased diuresis, during the cold season may be linked to other environmental stimuli, such as daylight or temperature. Experiments in rats suggest that cold‐induced diuresis might be caused by downregulation of V2R in the kidney, which in turn results in increased urine output. These results suggest that cold‐induced diuresis is due to suppression of renal V2R rather than inhibition of VP secretion. Experimental evidence suggests that low outdoor temperature decreases thirst. The underlying mechanism may be an effect of vasoconstriction in peripheral tissues, resulting in increased volume in internal vascular beds mimicking volume expansion, which in turn affects VP secretion and thirst but may also be linked to the fact that cold water is a better thirst quencher than room‐temperature water. A link between water intake, VP, and circadian rhythmicity has been established in rodents in a study showing anticipatory thirst before sleep independent of current serum osmolality. The increased water intake is shown to be a consequence of increased VP signaling (as a neurotransmitter) in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus. Our results, showing a peak in copeptin concentration during the cold season, may thus be a consequence of decreased water intake, which in turn may be a result of environmental stimuli such as low outdoor temperature, as discussed above, or decreased amount of daylight.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^8cb97981]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Problems caused by assuming a closed system

Formulas 2 to 7 do not account for changes in body sodium, potassium, or water other than saline infusion. Under experimental conditions mimicking closed systems, formulas similar to formula 7 predicted accurately the changes in [Na] after the induction of hypernatremia, or hyponatremia. However, patients with dysnatremia do not represent closed systems. They exhibit external losses of solute and water during treatment. The magnitude of these losses, which are usually hypotonic, varies depending on the pathogenetic mechanisms of the dysnatremia, the effects of treatment on these mechanisms, and other conditions present.

Losses occur through the respiratory system, the skin, the gastrointestinal track and the kidneys. Normally, average loss of water though the first 3 routes is ≈1100 mL (≈400 mL through the lungs, ≈500 mL through the skin, and ≈200 mL through the gastrointestinal system), whereas water generation from oxidation amounts to 350 mL per 24 hours. Net water loss amounts to 750 mL per 24 hours or 188 mL per 6 hours.Loss of solute through the 3 routes is proportionally lower than water loss. Sodium concentration in sweat is 30 to 65 mEq/L.In the stool, average sodium concentration is 40 mEq/L, and potassium, 90 mEq/L.Water and solute losses increase in sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea and hyperpnea. Urinary losses vary during treatment of hyponatremia. After correction of uncomplicated hypovolemia, urine flow increases as the volume stimulus for vasopressin secretion disappears and water diuresis ensues. Overcorrection of hyponatremia may follow. –

### Effects of diuretics on urate and calcium excretion (...) [^1ca3c064]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

• Forty-nine patients with gout, many with hypertension and/ or renal calculi, were given hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, or ticrynafen. Diuresis and increased clearances of sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium occurred after a single dose of hydrochlorothiazide, 100 mg, or furosemide, 40 mg, orally. There was very slight change in urate and phosphorus clearances. With prolonged use of hydrochloride or furosemide, diuresis and increased electrolyte excretion disappeared. Urate and Ca excretion fell with hydrochlorothiazide. With long-term use of furosemide, urate excretion was suppressed, but Ca excretion was sustained. Ticrynafen produced diuresis and increased clearances of Na, K, and Cl. Calcium excretion was increased after a single dose and minimally decreased after long-term use. Most striking was the severe and rather sustained uricosuria.

Though ticrynafen is an effective uricosuric, natriuretic, and antihypertensive agent, its hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity mitigate against its clinical use. Yü T, Berger L, Sarkozi L, Kaung C. Effects of Diuretics on Urate and Calcium Excretion. Arch Intern Med. 1981; 141: 915–919. doi:

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^652213b8]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Urea

Urea is recommended as a second-line treatment after FR both in the European hyponatremia guidelines and the US expert panel recommendations, despite an absence of randomized trials. Urea is a product of hepatic nitrogen metabolism that is renally excreted and exerts an osmotic effect to promote free water excretion. In SIAD, in which urine osmolality remains inappropriately high due to persistent AVP action, osmotic intake becomes an important determinant of urine volume. In addition to the main antidiuretic action of AVP (via vasopressin V2 receptors, to increase aquaporin insertion in the renal collecting duct), AVP also promotes water retention by upregulating expression of UT-A1s to increase reabsorption of urea, augmenting medullary interstitial osmolality and therefore urinary concentrating ability. In hyponatremic patients, treatment with exogenous urea overwhelms this mechanism by achieving a high concentration of urea in the glomerular filtrate, which induces an osmotic diuresis and reduces natriuresis, resulting in increased electrolyte-free water clearance (see Fig. 11). Urea administration is a much more efficient means of solute supplementation than oral sodium chloride administration. For example, a 15-g sachet of urea provides a renal solute load of 250 mOsm, whereas a single 600-mg sodium chloride tablet provides a renal solute load of 20.6 mOsm, and a 1000-mg NaCl tablet provides 34 mOsm. In other words, a 30-g dose of urea provides the same solute load as 14 to 25 salt tablets, depending on their strength (see Table 9).

Regarding inpatient care for heart failure, more specifically with respect to intravenous diuretics, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to consider intensifying the diuretic regimen with higher doses of IV loop diuretics or adding a second diuretic in patients hospitalized with HF, if diuresis is inadequate to relieve symptoms and signs of congestion.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^44e98daa]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) water intake and diet—people with ADPKD should be advised to maintain optimal hydration; plain drinking water, mainly obtained from tap water, is the preferred fluid for drinking in people with ADPKD, and the consumption of drinks with added sugar and/or salt or alcohol should be minimized. A high dietary solute load requires a higher fluid intake to maintain dilute urine, and people with ADPKD should be educated about the importance of dietary solute intake in determining obligatory urine volume; as outlined in Chapter 7, people with ADPKD should be advised to achieve and maintain a moderate protein intake (0.8–1.0 g/kg/d, per WHO recommendations) and limit sodium (Na) intake (Na <2 g/d [<90 mmol/d] or <5 g salt/d). No evidence indicates that the source or type of water (tap, bottled, filtered) is important to the progression of kidney cyst growth; prior self-reported estimates suggest most people (61%) with ADPKD probably have a high habitual intake of fluid (≥ 2 L/d). For implementation context, the increase in urine volume in 3 RCTs was ~0.8 L/d. Safety considerations include that water intake that vastly exceeds population-based recommendations can lead to life-threatening hyponatremia, and in a systematic review of 590 people without ADPKD with life-threatening hyponatremia, psychogenic polydipsia and iatrogenic advice were identified as underlying factors in 68% of cases. The overall grade of certainty of evidence is very low.

### Accidental ketosis-induced polyuria in a toddler: a case report [^09b28e4a]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Polyuria refers to the excessive production of urine, generally defined as > 2000 mL/m 2 /24h in the pediatric population. Polyuria is differentiated from urinary frequency, which is the increased need to urinate without excessive urine volume production. While urinary frequency is a relatively common phenomenon in children, often occurring in the setting of lower genito-urinary tract infections, the causes of polyuria in pediatric patients are less common and require prompt recognition and diagnosis. Polyuria frequently presents in the setting of underlying conditions that result in either a water diuresis or solute diuresis. The differential diagnosis for new-onset polyuria in the pediatric population includes diabetes mellitus, central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, in addition to other less common metabolic, endocrine, renal, and psychological causes (Table 1).

KDIGO 2022—Edema management in nephrotic syndrome (Practice Points 1.4.1–1.4.3) states “Use loop diuretics as first-line therapy for treatment of edema in the nephrotic syndrome,” advising “Twice daily dosing preferred over once daily dosing; daily dosing may be acceptable for reduced GFR,” to “Increase dose of loop diuretic to cause clinically significant diuresis or until maximally effective dose has been reached,” and to “Switch to longer acting loop diuretic such as bumetanide or torsemide/torasemide if concerned about treatment failure with furosemide, or if concerned about oral drug bioavailability”; it adds “Restrict dietary sodium to <2.0 g/d (<90 mmol/d),” recommends for resistant edema to “Use loop diuretics with other mechanistically different diuretics as synergistic treatment of resistant edema in the nephrotic syndrome” where “All thiazide-like diuretics in high doses are equally effective. None is preferred,” and notes “Thiazide diuretics, administered with an oral or i.v. loop diuretic, will impair distal sodium reabsorption and improve diuresis,” with adjunct options “Amiloride may provide improvement in edema/hypertension, and counter hypokalemia from loop or thiazide diuretics,” “Acetazolamide may be helpful for the metabolic alkalosis of diuresis,” and “Spironolactone may provide improvement in edema/hypertension, and counter hypokalemia from loop or thiazide diuretics.”

### Osmotic pressure in clinical medicine with an emphasis on dialysis [^5ea75881]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

Since the beginning of life of the first multicellular organisms, the preservation of a physiologic milieu for every cell in the organism has been a critical requirement. A particular range of osmolality of the body fluids is essential for the maintenance of cell volume. In humans the stability of electrolyte concentrations and their resulting osmolality in the body fluids is the consequence of complex interactions between cell membrane functions, hormonal control, thirst, and controlled kidney excretion of fluid and solutes. Knowledge of these mechanisms, of the biochemical principles of osmolality, and of the relevant situations occurring in disease is of importance to every physician. This comprehensive review summarizes the major facts on osmolality, its relation to electrolytes and other solutes, and its relevance in physiology and in disease states with a focus on dialysis-related considerations.
