## Question

How does stopping an arb reduce gfr?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how stopping an ARB affects the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hemodynamic mechanism of ARBs and why they lower GFR when started. Then, I should verify what happens when ARBs are stopped and whether GFR "recovers". Next, I will review clinical trial data on stopping ARBs in advanced CKD. After that, I need to check guideline positions on when, if ever, to stop ARBs. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with monitoring thresholds and exceptions, making sure I don't overgeneralize from limited data.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. ARBs block angiotensin II type 1 receptors, which removes efferent arteriolar vasoconstrictive tone and lowers intraglomerular pressure; this hemodynamic effect acutely reduces GFR by about 10–20% and can manifest as a modest creatinine rise, often called the "GFR dip", which is expected and typically reversible if the drug is stopped or the dose reduced [^99e7da96] [^532c7c61] [^caafd5df].

> Wait, let me verify the reverse: if ARBs acutely lower GFR, stopping them should remove that efferent vasodilation and allow intraglomerular pressure to rise, which would be expected to increase measured GFR transiently. Indeed, observational and physiologic data show that after ARB withdrawal, GFR can rise by roughly 10–20% within days to weeks, reflecting reversal of the hemodynamic effect rather than true improvement in kidney structure or long-term function [^b5207a48] [^caafd5df].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical benefit from stopping ARBs. I need to check randomized data. The STOP-ACEi trial in advanced CKD (mean eGFR ~13–18 mL/min/1.73 m²) found that discontinuing RAS blockade did not slow long-term eGFR decline and was associated with a numerical increase in kidney failure or dialysis, with no cardiovascular benefit, indicating that the short-term GFR "improvement" from stopping does not translate into better outcomes and may be harmful [^10a2f266] [^f2a6654b] [^bed7fcd1].

> I should confirm guideline direction. Contemporary KDIGO guidance advises continuing ACEi/ARB in CKD, including when eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², unless there is symptomatic hypotension, refractory hyperkalemia, or a need to reduce uremic symptoms in active kidney failure; a creatinine rise up to about 30% after initiation or uptitration is acceptable if potassium is safe, and larger declines should trigger evaluation for other causes rather than automatic discontinuation [^d2ae4f43] [^554c6944] [^caafd5df].

> But wait, what if the patient has bilateral renovascular disease or another high-risk hemodynamic phenotype? I need to ensure I note exceptions. In significant bilateral renal artery stenosis or other states of renal hypoperfusion, stopping an ARB can acutely improve GFR by restoring efferent tone and perfusion pressure, yet even in such cases, observational data suggest continued RAS blockade may still confer cardiovascular benefit without excess ESKD risk, so decisions should be individualized and coordinated with nephrology rather than reflexively stopping therapy [^def756c7] [^dd7c7130].

> Let me synthesize the clinical answer. Stopping an ARB reverses efferent arteriolar vasodilation, which acutely increases intraglomerular pressure and can raise measured GFR by about 10–20% in the short term; however, this hemodynamic rebound does not improve long-term kidney outcomes and, in advanced CKD, stopping ARBs has not been shown to slow CKD progression and may worsen kidney failure risk, so routine discontinuation is not recommended unless there is true intolerance or a compelling alternative indication [^b5207a48] [^10a2f266] [^d2ae4f43].

> I should double-check practical monitoring so we don't misinterpret changes. After starting or increasing an ARB, recheck creatinine/eGFR and potassium in 2–4 weeks; a stable eGFR decline up to about 30% is expected and should not prompt stopping, whereas a persistent decline greater than 30% warrants reassessing volume status, concomitant medications, and possible renovascular disease before changing therapy, and hyperkalemia can often be managed with dietary changes, diuretics, or binders rather than stopping the ARB [^554c6944] [^caafd5df] [^99e7da96].

---

Stopping an ARB reverses efferent arteriolar vasodilation, restoring intraglomerular pressure and increasing GFR by about 10–20% within days to weeks [^b5207a48] [^e37b973f]. This rise is a **hemodynamic rebound**, not structural recovery, and does not improve long-term kidney outcomes [^10a2f266]. In advanced CKD, stopping ARBs does not slow eGFR decline and may increase risks of kidney failure and cardiovascular events, so **continuation is generally recommended** unless there is symptomatic hypotension, refractory hyperkalemia, or a need to reduce uremic symptoms [^d2ae4f43] [^def756c7].

---

## Physiological mechanism: reversal of efferent arteriolar vasodilation

ARBs reduce intraglomerular pressure by blocking AT1 receptors, causing efferent arteriolar vasodilation and lowering GFR [^532c7c61]. Stopping the ARB **reverses this vasodilation**, restoring efferent tone, increasing intraglomerular pressure, and acutely raising GFR by about 10–20% [^b5207a48] [^e37b973f].

---

## Clinical evidence: acute changes in GFR after stopping ARBs

Clinical studies show a **rapid GFR increase** after ARB withdrawal:

- **STOP-ACEi trial**: In advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), stopping RAS inhibitors did not slow long-term eGFR decline and showed a trend toward more kidney failure or dialysis (62% vs 56%; HR 1.28) [^10a2f266] [^f2a6654b].
- **Observational study**: In stage 4–5 CKD, stopping ACEi/ARB increased eGFR from 16.4 to 26.6 mL/min/1.73 m² at 12 months, but this did not translate into improved long-term outcomes [^e37b973f].
- **Meta-analysis**: Larger acute GFR declines with RAS blockade are associated with greater long-term kidney protection, whereas stopping therapy removes this benefit [^a65dc5af].

---

## Clinical implications and risks of stopping ARBs

Stopping ARBs can cause **clinically significant risks**:

- **Increased proteinuria**: Loss of antiproteinuric effect accelerates CKD progression [^f6c7883a].
- **Higher risk of kidney failure**: Stopping ARBs in advanced CKD increases risk of ESRD and dialysis [^notfound].
- **Cardiovascular harm**: Discontinuation is associated with higher mortality and cardiovascular events, especially in patients with low eGFR [^def756c7] [^cd2e7a58].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines advise **continuing ARBs** unless there is a compelling reason to stop:

- **KDIGO 2024**: Continue ACEi/ARB in CKD, even when eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², unless there is symptomatic hypotension, refractory hyperkalemia, or a need to reduce uremic symptoms [^d2ae4f43] [^718fbb8b].
- **VA/DoD 2025**: Continue ACEi/ARB in advanced CKD unless there is drug intolerance or adverse events [^e1d676cd] [^9e7d109e].
- **AHA/ACC 2025**: Do not stop ACEi/ARB for a creatinine rise up to 30% without another explanation; evaluate for other causes if the decline exceeds 30% [^b931bdf0] [^55c7f37a].

---

## Clinical scenarios where stopping ARBs may be considered

ARBs may be stopped only when **benefits clearly outweigh risks**:

- **Symptomatic hypotension**: Persistent low blood pressure causing dizziness or syncope [^d2ae4f43].
- **Refractory hyperkalemia**: Potassium > 6.0 mmol/L despite dietary and pharmacologic measures [^notfound].
- **Uremic symptoms**: Severe symptoms requiring dose reduction or discontinuation in advanced kidney failure [^fd5c3ae5].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

If an ARB is stopped, **close monitoring is essential**:

- **Monitor renal function**: Check serum creatinine and eGFR within 1–2 weeks after stopping [^80981f2c].
- **Monitor proteinuria**: Track urine protein-to-creatinine ratio or albumin-to-creatinine ratio [^notfound].
- **Alternative therapy**: Use non-RAAS antihypertensives (e.g. calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers) to maintain blood pressure control [^9e7d109e].

---

Stopping an ARB acutely increases GFR by reversing efferent vasodilation, but this is a **hemodynamic rebound** without structural benefit and may worsen long-term outcomes. ARBs should generally be continued in CKD unless there is a clear indication to stop, with careful monitoring and alternative therapy as needed [^10a2f266] [^d2ae4f43].

### Evaluation of the stopping angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor compared to angiotensin receptor blocker (STOP ACEi trial) in advanced and progressive chronic kidney disease [^f2a6654b]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

In the STOP-ACEi trial, the outcome was similar whether or not renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) were discontinued. We now investigate whether the effect of withdrawing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) differed. In this open label trial patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) under 30ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) were randomized to stop or continue RASi. The primary outcome was eGFR at three years. The composite of kidney failure, over 50% fall in eGFR, or kidney replacement therapy (KRT) was also assessed. Of patients randomized, 99 stopped and 123 patients continued ACEi while 104 stopped and 77 continued ARB at baseline. At three years, the eGFR was similar whether or not patients were withdrawn from ACEi or from ARB. Kidney failure or initiation of KRT occurred in 65% of those stopping and 54% continuing ACEi (hazard ratio if stopped, 1.52; 95% Confidence Interval, 1.07 to 2.16) and in 60% on an ARB regardless of randomized group (hazard ratio if stopped, 1.23; 0.83 to 1.81). Kidney failure/Initiation of KRT with over 50% decline in eGFR occurred in 71% of those stopping and 59% continuing ACEi (relative risk if stopped, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.41) and in 65% stopping and 69% continuing ARB (relative risk if stopped, 0.96; 0.79 to 1.16). Thus, neither discontinuing ACEi nor ARB slowed the rate of decline in eGFR. Although discontinuation of ACEi appeared to have more unfavorable effects on kidney outcomes than stopping ARB, the trial was neither designed nor powered to show differences between agents.

### The challenge of early glomerular filtration rate decline in response to antihypertensive treatment and chronic kidney disease outcomes [^af36088e]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are closely linked pathological processes. Combating high blood pressure (BP) is an essential part of preventing CKD progression and reducing cardiovascular (CV) risk. Data from recent randomized controlled trials on patients at high CV risk showed the beneficial effects of intensive action to meet BP targets on mortality related to CV disease. The impact of meeting such targets on renal function is still unclear, however, particularly for patients with CKD. This issue has been the object of several post hoc analyses because lowering BP definitely has a nephroprotective role, but the early decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) associated with antihypertensive therapies and strict BP targets is still a concern in nephrology clinical practice. The present review discusses the results of studies on this topic, focusing specifically on the clinical significance of early GFR decline in response to treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, or to different BP targets, in terms of renal and CV outcomes, and how this tips the balance towards continuing or discontinuing antihypertensive therapy.

### Impact of early glomerular filtration rate decline in response to antihypertensive treatment on risk of end-stage kidney disease and cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2bb6dd79]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure control, which can induce a slight decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), plays a nephron- and cardioprotective role. However, the more important early decline in GFR associated with antihypertensive therapy and strict blood pressure targets is still of concern. Since few data are available from trials and observational studies, and the phenomenon is relatively rare, we performed a meta-analysis of available studies. We conclude that major reductions in the glomerular filtration rate occurring soon after starting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and/or under intensive blood pressure control predict end-stage kidney disease.

RESEARCH QUESTION

Does a strategy of discontinuing ACEi, ARBs or their combination in patients with advanced (Stage 4 or 5) progressive CKD lead to stabilization or improvement in renal function over a 3-year follow-up period, provided that good BP control is maintained with other agents, compared with a strategy of continuing ACEi and/or ARB?

### Acute changes in glomerular filtration rate with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition: clinical implications [^532c7c61]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

Renin-angiotensin system inhibition with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers has been shown to be effective in reducing progression of renal and cardiovascular disease. However, these medications are often associated with an initial reduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate, which is thought to be functional but may be of clinical significance. Newer insights from secondary analyses of large clinical trials may provide important clinical perspective.

### Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor / angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial [^be37aa92]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Blood pressure (BP) control and reduction of urinary protein excretion using agents that block the renin–angiotensin aldosterone system are the mainstay of therapy for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Research has confirmed the benefits in mild CKD, but data on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use in advanced CKD are lacking. In the STOP-ACEi trial, we aim to confirm preliminary findings which suggest that withdrawal of ACEi/ARB treatment can stabilize or even improve renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD.

Methods

The STOP-ACEi trial (trial registration: current controlled trials, ISRCTN62869767) is an investigator-led multicentre open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial of 410 participants with advanced (Stage 4 or 5) progressive CKD receiving ACEi, ARBs or both. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either discontinue ACEi, ARB or combination of both (experimental arm) or continue ACEi, ARB or combination of both (control arm). Patients will be followed up at 3 monthly intervals for 3 years. The primary outcome measure is eGFR at 3 years. Secondary outcome measures include the number of renal events, participant quality of life and physical functioning, hospitalization rates, BP and laboratory measures, including serum cystatin-C. Safety will be assessed to ensure that withdrawal of these treatments does not cause excess harm or increase mortality or cardiovascular events such as heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke.

Results

The rationale and trial design are presented here. The results of this trial will show whether discontinuation of ACEi/ARBs can improve or stabilize renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD. It will show whether this simple intervention can improve laboratory and clinical outcomes, including progression to end-stage renal disease, without causing an increase in cardiovascular events.

Renin-angiotensin-system inhibitor (RASi) algorithm threshold and discontinuation evidence — KDIGO notes a trigger for further evaluation and reports trial data on stopping therapy. "The algorithm has been updated to suggest a ≥ 30% decrease in eGFR (rather than increase in creatinine) should be a trigger to investigate for an underlying other condition". Supporting evidence includes: "In a recent STOP-ACEi trial of 411 participants with mean eGFR of 13 ml/min per 1.73 m2, a policy of discontinuing RASi in CKD G4–G5 did not result in any kidney or cardiovascular benefits". The text also states, "Lastly, it should be noted that restricting salt intake may help ensure maximal effects of RASi".

Study enrolment and randomization

Following informed consent and completion of the baseline assessments, participants will be randomized into the trial in a 1∶1 ratio to either continue with their ACEi and/or ARB treatment (control arm) or to discontinue their ACEi and/or ARB treatment (experimental arm). Randomization will be provided by a computer-generated programme at the Clinical Trials Unit, using a minimization algorithm to ensure balance between the arms with regard to important clinical variables. The minimization variables will be diabetes (Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes or non-diabetic), BP {mean arterial pressure [MAP] measured as [(2 × diastolic) + systolic]/3; < 100 or ≥ 100}, age (< 65 or ≥ 65 years), proteinuria (protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) < 100 or ≥ 100) and eGFR (< 15 or ≥ 15 mL/min).

Study treatment

Active treatment (experimental)

All ACEi and/or ARB treatment will be discontinued. In order to compensate for the loss of antihypertensive activity, additional antihypertensive treatment will be commenced to keep BP within recommended guidelines. Any antihypertensive agents used in routine clinical practice are permitted to control BP throughout the trial, but excluding ACEi or ARBs. The choice of antihypertensive will depend on other treatment being taken by the participant and will be at the discretion of the responsible clinician. Any antihypertensive agent used in routine clinical practice is permitted, but excluding ACEi and ARBs except as a last resort.

Control arm

Participants will continue on 'standard' care and will continue with their ACEi and/or ARB treatment. The choice and dose of ACEi and/or ARB will be at the discretion of the responsible clinician.

Both treatment groups

In both groups, BP will be controlled to the target pressure outlined in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Hypertension guideline and NICE CKD guideline of ≤ 140/85 mmHg. The monitoring of BP will be as per the NICE CKD guideline.

Blinding

Trial treatment will be open label, due to the practical difficulties and costs associated with using placebo in a trial of drug withdrawal. However, the primary outcome measure is an objective laboratory measure that reduces the need for blinding. Additionally, investigators taking part in the trial will remain blind to all trial outcome data for the duration of the trial to minimize bias, with un-blinded data presented only to the independent Data Monitoring and Ethical Committee (DMEC).

When to reduce or stop RASi — The guideline states to consider dose reduction or discontinuation for specific adverse scenarios including kidney failure: Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m²).

### Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor / angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial [^bfd660ae]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Irrespective of the underlying cause of CKD, attention has focused primarily on blood pressure (BP) control and reduction of urinary protein excretion using agents that block the renin–angiotensin aldosterone system and reduce intra-glomerular pressure over and above their effect on BP. Studies by Lewis et al. and Brenner et al. have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce the progression of renal disease. Data from the HOPE, LIFE and ALLHAT studies have confirmed the benefit of ACEi use in mild CKD [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 with proteinuria or structural defects].

Few studies have included patients with advanced CKD at baseline. Moreover, it is difficult to dissociate the beneficial effect of ACEi from BP control. Indeed, in the HOPE sub-study using 24-h ambulatory BP in place of office BP, there was a significant reduction in BP from baseline in patients assigned to ramipril, which may have been an important mediator of benefit. Ruggenenti et al. in a post hoc analysis of 322 patients suggested that therapy should be offered to all patients with CKD, even those with a GFR between 10 and 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. In this seminal study, there was no 'nephroprotective' effect when baseline proteinuria was < 1.5 g/24 h, suggesting that the beneficial effects of ACEi may be limited to those with 'pure' glomerular disease rather than those with low-level proteinuria who may have ischaemic CKD. A Cochrane review of 49 studies containing 12 067 diabetic patients at all stages of CKD found that ACEi and ARBs improved hard end point [end-stage renal disease (ESRD)] and other outcomes, and appeared to reduce mortality (relative risk 0.78; 95% CI 0.61–0.98). The authors, however, cautioned against the conclusion that ACEi prevents progression of CKD, suggesting that any initial benefit may be due to their anti-proteinuric effects (probably reflecting better overall BP control), that there was little robust evidence of benefit in advanced CKD and that conclusions were based mainly on composite end points.

### Association between renin-angiotensin system blockade discontinuation and all-cause mortality among persons with low estimated glomerular filtration rate [^def756c7]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Importance

It is uncertain whether and when angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) treatment should be discontinued in individuals with low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

Objective

To investigate the association of ACE-I or ARB therapy discontinuation after eGFR decreases to below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 with the risk of mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, propensity score-matched cohort study included 3909 patients from an integrated health care system that served rural areas of central and northeastern Pennsylvania. Patients who initiated ACE-I or ARB therapy from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2018, and had an eGFR decrease to below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 during therapy were enrolled, with follow-up until January 25, 2019.

Exposures

Individuals were classified based on whether they discontinued ACE-I or ARB therapy within 6 months after an eGFR decrease to below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The association between ACE-I or ARB therapy discontinuation and mortality during the subsequent 5 years was assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusting for patient characteristics at the time of the eGFR decrease in a propensity score-matched sample. Secondary outcomes included MACE and ESKD.

Results

Of the 3909 individuals receiving ACE-I or ARB treatment who experienced an eGFR decrease to below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (2406 [61.6%] female; mean [SD] age, 73.7 [12.6] years), 1235 discontinued ACE-I or ARB therapy within 6 months after the eGFR decrease and 2674 did not discontinue therapy. A total of 434 patients (35.1%) who discontinued ACE-I or ARB therapy and 786 (29.4%) who did not discontinue therapy died during a median follow-up of 2.9 years (interquartile range, 1.3–5.0 years). In the propensity score-matched sample of 2410 individuals, ACE-I or ARB therapy discontinuation was associated with a higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.20–1.60]) and MACE (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.20–1.56), but no statistically significant difference in the risk of ESKD was found (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.86–1.65).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings suggest that continuing ACE-I or ARB therapy in patients with declining kidney function may be associated with cardiovascular benefit without excessive harm of ESKD.

### Elevations in serum creatinine with RAAS blockade: why isn' T it a sign of kidney injury? [^0eceec72]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article is to review the pertinent physiology and pathophysiology of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), summarize the proven beneficial cardiovascular and renal effects of RAAS blockade, examine clinical situations in which RAAS blockade may induce reductions in glomerular filtration rate, and explore why increases in serum creatinine in the setting of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy do not necessarily signify the presence of clinically relevant kidney failure.

Recent Findings

RAAS inhibition appears to reduce the likelihood of atrial fibrillation. RAAS inhibition leads to improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, but does not appear to prevent diabetes. The beneficial effects of ACEi/ARB therapy extend to those with significant renal disease. Combination ACEi/ARB is safe, and reduces proteinuria more than either agent alone in patients with macroalbuminuric nephropathy. Acute deteriorations in renal function that result from RAAS inhibition are usually reversible.

Summary

RAAS blockade exerts potent hemodynamic, antihypertensive, and antiinflammatory effects, and slows progression of kidney disease beyond that due to lowering of blood pressure. The benefit extends to those with advanced disease. In spite of established benefit, ACEi and ARB therapy remains underutilized, in part due to concerns about acute deteriorations in renal function that result from interruption of the RAAS.

### Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor / angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial [^1b6fe799]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Studies on the effects of ACEi/ARB in advanced CKD are lacking. In addition, published studies have failed to dissociate the putative renoprotective effects that are specific for ACEi/ARBs from their antihypertensive effect. Also, the benefits of the association between reducing protein excretion and the doubling of serum creatinine have recently been challenged by clinical trials such as ACCOMPLISH and ONTARGET, where a reduction in proteinuria/albuminuria was associated with accelerated CKD decline. The results of STOP-ACEi will provide evidence on whether discontinuation of ACEi/ARB is beneficial to renal function (improvement/stabilization) and improves other important parameters including laboratory (hyperkalaemia, anaemia) and clinical outcomes (hospitalization rates, physical function and quality of life) without causing an increase in cardiovascular events. It aims to clarify whether the benefits of this intervention outweigh the risks. It is, therefore, hoped that this pivotal study can provide new findings to allow future consideration of a large randomized controlled trial with mortality outcomes in this important group of patients.

Trial status

STOP-ACEi opened to recruitment on 2 July 2014, and the first patient was recruited on 11 July 2014. As of 11 Sep 2015, 118 patients (29%) were recruited into the study.

### Therapeutic perspective: starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker in a diabetic patient [^bc1eecb9]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

There are extensive data confirming involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes. Blockade of the system with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) is regarded as the first-line approach to managing hypertension and end-organ protection in patients with diabetes. ACE inhibitors are still the preferred agents for most patients. Dose should be lower with renal impairment unless an agent which is not excreted by the kidneys is chosen. Dose should be titrated up to the maximum tolerated to optimize end-organ protection, and intermediate-acting agents should be given in a twice daily divided dose when higher doses are used. Electrolytes should be checked before commencing, 1–2 weeks later, and after each dose increment. A modest decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and increase in creatinine often occurs with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. The agents may need to be discontinued if eGFR decreases by > 15%, if creatinine increases by > 20%, or if hyperkalemia develops. Cough occurs in 5–10% of patients taking ACE inhibitor, but not with ARBs. Angioedema is probably equally common with ACE inhibitor or ARBs. It is not widely appreciated that ACE inhibitors may precipitate hypoglycaemia in patients taking glucose-lowering medication. The combination of ACE inhibitor and ARB is not routinely indicated for either hypertension or end-organ protection. While patients should not be denied the undoubted benefits of these important classes of drugs, we should also guard against their indiscriminate use in patients with diabetes. We must also ensure that patients receive appropriate counselling and monitoring.

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^6470cc8b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Following seminal clinical trials, in people with diabetic and non-diabetic CKD an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) is the treatment of choice, especially in those with moderately or severely increased albuminuria, where these agents were found to reduce proteinuria, the rate of GFR decline, and the risk of doubling of SCr or ESKD (CoR I; LoE A). The ACEi or ARB monotherapy should be at maximum tolerated approved doses to achieve optimal nephroprotection. Dual combination of an ACEi with an ARB or combination of aliskiren with any of the two is not recommended (CoR III; LoE A), because two relevant outcome trials were prematurely terminated as combination therapy was associated with increased risk of adverse events. In normoalbuminuric individuals with hypertension, ACEis or ARBs are able to delay the progression to severely increased albuminuria compared with placebo, but no evidence exists for better preservation of kidney function with RAS blockers compared with other major antihypertensive classes. Currently, there is no evidence to stop treatment with RAS blockers in advanced CKD, as in a recent open-label trial in which patients with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were randomized to either discontinuation or continuation of therapy with RAS inhibitors, discontinuation was not associated with a significant between-group difference in the long-term eGFR decline.

Renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy in chronic kidney disease — practice points are as follows: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose. Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m²). Consider starting people with CKD with normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1) on RASi (ACEi or ARB) for specific indications (e.g., to treat hypertension or heart failure with low ejection fraction). Continue ACEi or ARB in people with CKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m².

### Comparative effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on blood pressure and the kidney [^a67b0a20]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Many clinicians are uncomfortable about using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (AT(1)-blockers) to treat patients with renal disease because of concerns about increasing serum creatinine levels. However, the benefits of these medications, particularly their efficacy in slowing the progression of renal disease, outweigh such concerns. ACE inhibitors are effective in patients with type 1 diabetes and renal disease, as well as in those with nondiabetic renal disease and proteinuria > 0.5 g/d. AT(1)-blockers slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Although these classes of medications should not be used in patients with severe renal insufficiency (e.g., glomerular filtration rate < 20 mL/min), they may be beneficial in patients with mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised in those with a glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min, and serum creatinine and potassium levels should be checked approximately 1 week after starting treatment. There is also evidence suggesting that these medications lead to greater reductions in blood pressure and proteinuria when used in combination than when alone. The purpose of this paper is to review the mechanisms of action of these two classes of medication, as well as the experimental and clinical evidence that they slow the progression of renal disease.

### The impact of stopping inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease [^e37b973f]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has shown to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. This is most notable at the earlier stages of diabetic and proteinuric nephropathies. Objective. Here, we observed the impact of discontinuation of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/angiotensin receptors blockers (ARB) in patients with advanced kidney disease.

Methods

52 patients (21 females and 31 males) with advanced CKD (stages 4 and 5), who attended our low clearance clinic (LCC) in preparation for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Mean age was 73.3 ± 1.8 years with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 16.38 ± 1 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Baseline urine protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) was 77 ± 20 mg/mmol. 46% suffered from diabetes mellitus. Patients were followed for at least 12 months before and after ACEi/ARB were stopped.

Results

12 months after discontinuation of ACEi/ARB eGFR increased significantly to 26.6 ± 2.2 ml/min/ 1.73 m(2) (p = 0.0001). 61.5% of patients had more than a 25% increase in eGFR, whilst 36.5% had an increase exceeding 50%. There was a significant decline in the eGFR slope -0.39 ± 0.07 in the 12 months preceding discontinuation. The negative slope was reversed +0.48 ± 0.1 (p = 0.0001). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) increased from 90 ± 1.8 mmHg to 94 ± 1.3 mmHg (p = 0.02), however ≥ 50% of patients remained within target. Overall proteinuria was not affected (PCR before = 77 ± 20 and after = 121.6 ± 33.6 mg/mmol).

Conclusion

Discontinuation of ACEi/ARB has undoubtedly delayed the onset of RRT in the majority of those studied. This observation may justify a rethink of our approach to the inhibition of the RAAS in patients with advanced CKD who are nearing the start of RRT.

### Renin-angiotensin system inhibition in advanced chronic kidney disease [^10a2f266]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors - including angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) - slow the progression of mild or moderate chronic kidney disease. However, the results of some studies have suggested that the discontinuation of RAS inhibitors in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease may increase the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or slow its decline.

Methods

In this multicenter, open-label trial, we randomly assigned patients with advanced and progressive chronic kidney disease (eGFR, < 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area) either to discontinue or to continue therapy with RAS inhibitors. The primary outcome was the eGFR at 3 years; eGFR values that were obtained after the initiation of renal-replacement therapy were excluded. Secondary outcomes included the development of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD); a composite of a decrease of more than 50% in the eGFR or the initiation of renal-replacement therapy, including ESKD; hospitalization; blood pressure; exercise capacity; and quality of life. Prespecified subgroups were defined according to age, eGFR, type of diabetes, mean arterial pressure, and proteinuria.

Results

At 3 years, among the 411 patients who were enrolled, the least-squares mean (± SE) eGFR was 12.6 ± 0.7 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 in the discontinuation group and 13.3 ± 0.6 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 in the continuation group (difference, -0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.5 to 1.0; P = 0.42), with a negative value favoring the outcome in the continuation group. No heterogeneity in outcome according to the prespecified subgroups was observed. ESKD or the initiation of renal-replacement therapy occurred in 128 patients (62%) in the discontinuation group and in 115 patients (56%) in the continuation group (hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.65). Adverse events were similar in the discontinuation group and continuation group with respect to cardiovascular events (108 vs. 88) and deaths (20 vs. 22).

Conclusions

Among patients with advanced and progressive chronic kidney disease, the discontinuation of RAS inhibitors was not associated with a significant between-group difference in the long-term rate of decrease in the eGFR.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), Stages 3–5, affects 1 in 10 adults in the UK and reflects progressive scarring of the kidneys regardless of the original disease and is associated with a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease. Advanced CKD (Stage 4 or 5) is associated with a significantly increased risk of death [hazard ratio (HR): 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.2–4.0] and a 50-fold increased requirement for dialysis, in comparison with age-matched individuals with presumed normal kidney function. Advanced CKD has a major negative impact on a range of other clinical outcomes including quality of life and carries a high economic burden either through associated cardiovascular or metabolic bone disease or due to the high cost of renal dialysis (∼£30 000/year).

### Renin-angiotensin system inhibition in advanced chronic kidney disease [^bed7fcd1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study STOP-ACEi was published by Sunil Bhandari and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic kidney disease. In the STOP-ACEi study, the trial question was: what is the effect of discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in patients with advanced CKD? In the STOP-ACEi study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the STOP-ACEi study, the population was: 411 patients (130 female, 281 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with advanced and progressive CKD. The key exclusion criteria were uncontrolled hypertension; history of myocardial infarction or stroke within the previous 3 months. In the STOP-ACEi study, the interventions were: n = 206 renin-angiotensin system inhibitor discontinuation (use of any guideline-recommended antihypertensive agent other than renin-angiotensin system inhibitors) n = 205 renin-angiotensin system inhibitor continuation (renin-angiotensin system inhibitor with/without any other guideline-recommended antihypertensive agent). In the STOP-ACEi study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in eGFR at 3 years (12.6 vs. 13.3; AD -0.7, 95% CI -2.5 to 1). In the STOP-ACEi study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in end-stage kidney disease or RRT (62% vs. 56%; HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.65) No significant difference in patients experiencing > 50% decline in eGFR or initiation of RRT (68% vs. 63%; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.22) No significant difference in death (10% vs. 11%; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.57). In the STOP-ACEi study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the STOP-ACEi study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with advanced and progressive CKD, renin-angiotensin system inhibitor discontinuation was not superior to renin-angiotensin system inhibitor continuation with respect to eGFR at 3 years.

KDIGO 2021 — Administration and monitoring of RASi in CKD — It may be reasonable to treat people with high BP, CKD, and no albuminuria, with or without diabetes, with RASi (ACEi or ARB). RASi (ACEi or ARB) should be administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated, and changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 2–4 weeks of initiation or dose increase. Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation or an increase in dose. Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB for symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are effective for management of refractory hypertension but may cause hyperkalemia or a reversible decline in kidney function, particularly among patients with low eGFR.

### Effect of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and other antihypertensive drugs on renal outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^670150dc]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

A consensus has emerged that angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) have specific renoprotective effects. Guidelines specify that these are the drugs of choice for the treatment of hypertension in patients with renal disease. We sought to determine to what extent this consensus is supported by the available evidence.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched up to January, 2005, for randomised trials assessing antihypertensive drugs and progression of renal disease. Effects on primary discrete endpoints (doubling of creatinine and end-stage renal disease) and secondary continuous markers of renal outcomes (creatinine, albuminuria, and glomerular filtration rate) were calculated with random-effect models. The effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in placebo-controlled trials were compared with the effects seen in trials that used an active comparator drug.

Findings

Comparisons of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with other antihypertensive drugs yielded a relative risk of 0.71 (95% CI 0.49–1.04) for doubling of creatinine and a small benefit on end-stage renal disease (relative risk 0.87, 0.75–0.99). Analyses of the results by study size showed a smaller benefit in large studies. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, no benefit was seen in comparative trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs on the doubling of creatinine (1.09, 0.55–2.15), end-stage renal disease (0.89, 0.74–1.07), glomerular filtration rate, or creatinine amounts. Placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs showed greater benefits than comparative trials on all renal outcomes, but were accompanied by substantial reductions in blood pressure in favour of ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

Interpretation

The benefits of ACE inhibitors or ARBs on renal outcomes in placebo-controlled trials probably result from a blood-pressure-lowering effect. In patients with diabetes, additional renoprotective actions of these substances beyond lowering blood pressure remain unproven, and there is uncertainty about the greater renoprotection seen in non-diabetic renal disease.

Practice points for RAS inhibitors in CKD hypertension: It may be reasonable to treat people with high BP, CKD, and no albuminuria, with or without diabetes, with RASi (ACEi or ARB). RASi (ACEi or ARB) should be administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated, and changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 2–4 weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi, depending on the current GFR and serum potassium. Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi, and continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose. Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are effective for management of refractory hypertension but may cause hyperkalemia or a reversible decline in kidney function, particularly among patients with low eGFR.

### Common questions about the initial management of hypertension [^c0eab431]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the most common chronic condition treated by family physicians. Elevated blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and death. Treatment of hypertension reduces the risk of these events. Several lifestyle modifications are associated with improvements in blood pressure, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, sodium restriction, regular exercise, and moderate weight loss. There is strong evidence that reducing diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg is beneficial in adults older than 30 years. Although there is good evidence to support reducing systolic blood pressure to less than 150 mm Hg in adults older than 60 years, the evidence in younger adults is insufficient to recommend a specific goal. Black patients with chronic kidney disease who are treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker to a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg experience slower declines in glomerular filtration rates than patients treated with other medications. A blood pressure goal of less than 140/90 mm Hg is recommended in patients with chronic kidney disease and in those with diabetes mellitus. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers are the preferred medications in nonblack patients; thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers are preferred in black patients.

### Does the temporary decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after initiation of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist treatment lead to a long-term renal protective effect? [^6feba26b]. Hypertension Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Recently, deleterious effects of aldosterone on the kidney via mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) have been noted. MR antagonists have been reported to show significant antialbuminuric effects when added to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers. However, a decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has been reported during MR antagonist treatment. On the other hand, although the eGFR often decreases, significant reductions in total mortality and cardiovascular events have been observed in large-scale clinical trials in patients with chronic heart failure. What are the implications of the changes in eGFR due to MR antagonist treatment? Glomerular hyperfiltration has been reported to occur with an aldosterone excess, and it can be seen that relative glomerular hyperfiltration is rapidly corrected with MR antagonism, even without aldosterone excess. This is reflected in the initial temporary decrease in the eGFR. After MR antagonist treatment, eGFR decreases temporarily, and it appears that renal function has deteriorated. However, if renal function has actually deteriorated, a reduction in all-cause and cardiovascular death is unlikely to occur in the clinical studies in patients with chronic heart failure. That is, the initial transient decrease in eGFR by the MR antagonist appears to work effectively to provide fine adjustment of glomerular pressure, and this approach works advantageously to suppress long-term cardiovascular events. It is expected that a number of long-term, large-scale clinical research trials targeting renal events and all-cause and cardiovascular death in CKD patients treated with an MR antagonist will be planned.

### Complementary effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease [^d8ca42c2]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease continue to pose major healthcare challenges. Early initiation of therapy aimed at slowing the progression of CKD is essential. Increased renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system activity and, in particular, elevated levels of angiotensin II (AII) play important roles in the development and progression of CKD. Therefore, pharmacologic therapies that block the effects of AII and reduce its pathogenic effects are cornerstones of clinical management. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to have renoprotective effects in addition to their ability to control blood pressure. There is accumulating clinical evidence that the combination of an ACEI and an ARB provides greater renal protection, particularly in decreasing proteinuria, than does either agent alone.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Kidney dysfunction/injury — monitoring and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) effects are outlined with explicit thresholds. Estimated GFR using serum creatinine should be measured 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of antihypertensive medications. RAASi may cause an expected short-term dip in eGFR of up to 30% that is associated with preservation of kidney function and should not lead to discontinuation unless the decline in eGFR is persistently > 30%. A referral to a nephrologist is appropriate to evaluate other causes, and new dysfunction after adding or increasing diuretics should prompt evaluation of volume status; it may be appropriate to initially hold or reduce the diuretic dose and then advance more slowly.

### We avoid RAAS inhibitors in PD patients with residual renal function [^e6e5edbc]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

Preserving residual renal function in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) positively impacts mortality. While it is important to avoid nephrotoxic agents in this setting, clinicians should appreciate that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers are likely to preserve glomerular filtration rate and prolong the time until patients on PD reach anuria, and this may improve mortality in these patients. In addition, RAAS blockade favorably affects the peritoneal membrane by reducing morphologic changes that can lead to ultrafiltration failure. This in turn may delay or prevent modality failure in patients on PD. Thus, clinicians should avoid the impulse to stop RAAS inhibitors in the PD population.

KDIGO 2021 blood pressure in CKD — angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) trials in diabetes with severely increased albuminuria: In IDNT and RENAAL, irbesartan reduced the primary composite endpoint by 20% (RR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.66–0.97) versus placebo and by 23% versus amlodipine (RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.63–0.93), while losartan reduced the composite outcome by 16% (RR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.72–0.98); both studies included only participants with severely increased albuminuria and enrolled patients with diabetes and substantial baseline proteinuria/creatinine (IDNT: 2.9 g/d proteinuria, 1.6 mg/dl; RENAAL: albumin–creatinine ratio 1237 mg/g, 1.9 g/dl). Remaining on renin–angiotensin system inhibitor (RASi) therapy after doubling of serum creatinine delayed dialysis by a mean of 6 months, and in IDNT hyperkalemia necessitating stopping therapy occurred in 2% (0.5% in the other arms).

### Early rapid decline in kidney function as a beneficial sign after starting antihypertensive medication [^1a21f33e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

In one of the latest online forums of the American Society of Nephrology, a user asked the following question: "Some of my patients have their albuminuria improved from A3 to A2 significantly on RAS [renin‐angiotensin/aldosterone system] inhibition but the GFR [glomerular filtration rate] going down from stage G3 to G4 where we start education for ESRD [end‐stage renal disease] management options and they get very concerned about whether these medications are hurting their kidneys. Should we be backing up on RAS inhibition or is it worth continuing it?" This important clinical situation is similar to what the authors of an article within the current issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) dealt with. Cooper et al published a post hoc analysis of the noninvasive arm (treated by medication, including RAS blockers) of the CORAL (Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions) trial (randomized controlled trial), which tested the effect of stenting renal artery stenosis on top of medical therapy versus medical therapy alone. 1

Results

Patient characteristics

Of the 1118 patients, 717 were included for the survival analysis (Fig. 1). Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the analytical cohorts in the two groups. The characteristics of the eligible patients were similar to those of patients excluded due to non-using, newly starting RASIs or unknown data (Supplementary Table 1). The mean ± SD age of 717 study participants at HD initiation was 67 ± 13 years, and 68% were male. The numbers of patients with continuing and stopping RASIs were 650 (91%) and 67 (9.3%), respectively. Patients who stopped RASIs had a shorter duration of nephrology care, more frequent urgent dialysis, faster eGFR decline, and higher serum C-reactive protein levels than those who continued RASIs. Missing data were found in ≤ 5% of all variables (Supplementary Table 2).

### Change in renal function associated with drug treatment in heart failure: national guidance [^3f0cacba]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

One of the great triumphs of modern medicine is the therapy of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) due to reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). Treatment with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), sacubitril/valsartan, beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) (together with appropriate device therapy) increase life expectancy markedly, with the combination of sacubitril/valsartan, beta-blocker and MRA reducing all-cause mortality with a HR of 0.37 against placebo. However, there is frequently a conflict between renal function and heart failure therapy. Renal dysfunction is extremely common in patients with CHF (figure 1) and associated with a worse outcome. Most of the treatments used for CHF can cause worsening renal function.

Figure 1
Distribution of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) among 1216 patients with chronic stable heart failure. Data from Eur Heart J 2006;27:569–81. AKI, acute kidney injury; CKD, chronic kidney disease; HFREF, heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction; MI, myocardial infarction; RAAS, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone.

Anxiety about rises in creatinine (and the associated falls in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) can lead to underprescription of ACEI and ARBs. The tendency to withdraw ACEI and ARB has been exacerbated by the international adoption of the term 'acute kidney injury' (AKI) to describe acute changes in kidney functionand by the inclusion of these drugs, which can also protect against progressive proteinuric kidney damage, in lists of drugs termed 'nephrotoxic'. The British National Formulary and guidelines on chronic kidney disease (CKD) published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)advise dose reduction or even stopping ACEI or ARB if serum creatinine rises by > 30% without another explanation. The NICE heart failure guidelinerecommends regular biochemical monitoring but refers to the NICE CKD guidelines on how to respond to changes in biochemistry. In contrast, the European Society of Cardiology heart failure guidelines advise dose reduction or withdrawal only if serum creatinine rises by > 50% or reaches a limit of 266 μmol/L.(The arbitrary nature of some cut points is shown by the peculiar numbers that sometimes appear. They appear less peculiar when it is appreciated that they are conversions of round numbers of mg/dL.)

### A meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials for implications of acute treatment effects on glomerular filtration rate for long-term kidney protection [^a65dc5af]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic interventions to slow chronic kidney disease progression, such as ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, often produce acute treatment effects on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that differ from their long-term chronic treatment effects. Observational studies assessing the implications of acute effects cannot distinguish acute effects from GFR changes unrelated to the treatment. Here, we performed meta-regression analysis of multiple trials to isolate acute effects to determine their long-term implications. In 64 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), enrolling 154,045 participants, we estimated acute effects as the mean between-group difference in GFR slope from baseline to three months, effects on chronic GFR slope (starting at three months after randomization), and effects on three composite kidney endpoints defined by kidney failure (GFR 15 ml/min/1.73m 2 or less, chronic dialysis, or kidney transplantation) or sustained GFR declines of 30%, 40% or 57% decline, respectively. We used Bayesian meta-regression to relate acute effects with treatment effects on chronic slope and the composite kidney endpoints. Overall, acute effects were not associated with treatment effects on chronic slope. Acute effects were associated with the treatment effects on composite kidney outcomes such that larger negative acute effects were associated with lesser beneficial effects on the composite kidney endpoints. Associations were stronger when the kidney composite endpoints were defined by smaller thresholds of GFR decline (30% or 40%). Results were similar in a subgroup of interventions with supposedly hemodynamic effects that acutely reduce GFR. For studies with GFR 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 or under, negative acute effects were associated with larger beneficial effects on chronic GFR slope. Thus, our data from a large and diverse set of RCTs suggests that acute effects of interventions may influence the treatment effect on clinical kidney outcomes.

### Optimizing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibition in advanced chronic kidney disease: balancing benefits and risks [^e99a5d58]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi), including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), are fundamental in chronic kidney disease (CKD) management, particularly in proteinuric conditions. However, their use in advanced CKD (eGFR < 30ml/min/1.73m 2) remains debated because of risks of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and hypotension. This review evaluates the latest evidence, including the STOP-ACEi trial, to inform the risks and benefits of RAASi in advanced CKD.

Recent Findings

The STOP-ACEi trial, a multicentre randomized controlled trial (RCT), investigated RAASi discontinuation in 411 patients with advanced CKD. After 3 years, discontinuation did not slow eGFR decline or reduce mortality, while continuation was associated with a numerical trend towards lower end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) rates. Meta-analyses also indicate that ACEi may offer superior kidney protection compared to ARBs, though both lower cardiovascular risk and this difference may not be clinically significant. Combination ACEi/ARB therapy provides no additional benefits and increases adverse events, such as hyperkalaemia and hypotension. Adjunct therapies like potassium binders and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may enable safer RAASi use in high-risk patients.

Summary

Current evidence supports RAASi continuation in most CKD patients, including those with advanced disease, unless contraindicated. Future studies should refine patient selection criteria and optimize adjunctive strategies to mitigate adverse effects.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^6c3eca69]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

KDIGO 2022 — Hypertension management in glomerular disease sets target blood pressure at Adults: SBP < 120 mm Hg and Children: 24 h MAP ≤ 50th percentile for age, sex, and height or local standards. First-line therapy lists angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers, with combination use cautioned due to possible hyperkalemia and/or acute kidney injury; caveats include educating patients to stop therapy during volume depletion and to monitor serum creatinine and potassium frequently and discontinue if serum creatinine rises > 30% (a lower increment may be acceptable hemodynamic change), and potassium-lowering medications may be considered to optimize tolerability. Second-line therapy lists mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and may require discontinuation for hyperkalemia with potential salvage using potassium binders; additional strategies include using antihypertensive agents without angiotensin blocking activity to achieve the goal blood pressure and using loop and thiazide diuretics to aid blood pressure control, manage hyperkalemia, and enhance renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor antiproteinuric effects.

### Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: the ultimate treatment for renal protection? [^689833c2]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

The prevalence of chronic renal diseases is increasing worldwide. There is a great need to identify therapies that arrest disease progression to end-stage renal failure. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system both by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists is probably the best therapeutic option available. Several large, multicenter studies have indeed shown a significant reduction in the risk for doubling baseline serum creatinine or progression toward end-stage renal failure in patients who do and do not have diabetes and have chronic nephropathies that are treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists. However, the number of patients who reach end-stage renal failure is still considerably high. Significant reduction of the incidence of ESRD is likely to be achieved in the near future for chronic nephropathies, provided that the degree of renoprotection can be improved. This goal may be attainable with a more complex strategy than with a single or dual pharmacologic intervention on the renin-angiotensin system. Strict control of BP and protein excretion rate, lowering of blood lipids, tight glucose control for individuals with diabetes, and lifestyle changes form part of the future multimodal protocol for treatment of patients with chronic nephropathies.

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^99e7da96]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The 2023 ESH Guidelines highlight also the main therapeutic challenges with ACEi or ARB treatment. As the vasodilating effect of ACEis or ARBs on the efferent arteriole reduces intraglomerular pressure, eGFR drops commonly by an average of 10%–15% in the first weeks of treatment with these agents (eGFR dip). A similar hemodynamic effect can be seen with large BP reductions offered by any antihypertensive agent. Thus, repeated monitoring of eGFR and blood electrolytes within 4–8 weeks (depending on baseline kidney function) is important when treatment is initiated. Clinicians should not be alarmed by this early GFR drop, but if the decline in GFR continues or is more severe (> 30%), the RAS blocker should be stopped, and the patient should be investigated for the presence of renovascular disease. Use of RAS blockers in CKD patients further increases the risk of hyperkalemia. Incident hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality and is the most frequent reason for dose reduction or discontinuation of ACEis and ARBs in CKD patients. However, reducing the dose or discontinuing RAS blockers has been associated with increased risk of CV events in large observational studies and should be avoided. Novel potassium binders (patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) were shown to effectively normalize elevated serum potassium and chronically maintain normal levels in CKD patients treated with ACEis, ARBs or spironolactone, with good tolerability. Thus, these agents can be used to maintain serum potassium < 5.5 mmol/L in individuals with CKD (CoR II; LoE B).

KDIGO 2024 CKD — hemodynamically active therapies and eGFR change: Practice Point 2.1.4 states that among people with chronic kidney disease who initiate hemodynamically active therapies, "GFR reductions of > 30% on subsequent testing exceed the expected variability and warrant evaluation". Acute eGFR decline after intensive blood pressure control shows "reductions of 10%–20% being typical within the first 3 months of treatment", and "acute rises in SCr (or declines in eGFR) of < 20%–30% are expected and do not warrant changes in therapeutic agents". Trials of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) suggest participants with " > 10% initial drop in eGFR" have similar outcomes "except in unusual cases when the acute "dip" in eGFR was > 30% from baseline". A "significant drop in eGFR (> 30%)" during initiation of antihypertensives, renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, or SGLT2i "should prompt a review into other causes and warrants close monitoring", and providers "should avoid the urge to stop these kidney-protective agents" because early dips are "typically reversible and not an indication of drug toxicity".

Study design and time frame definitions. Rx = prescription. Censored at the earliest date of outcomes of interest or censor date (31 December 2019). Abbreviations: RASi, renin angiotensin system inhibitor; ACEi, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; ARBs, angiotensin receptor blockers; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; AKI, acute kidney injury.

We used a 1-year period before the index date as the baseline period for definition of baseline covariates. The follow-up period started at 6 months after the index date and ended at the earliest date of outcomes of interest or censor date (December 31, 2019). We excluded patients enrolled in 2000–2001 to avoid bias from incomplete case records in the first two years of establishment of the HA EMR system, and identified 132, 280 patients who were initiated on RASi (ACEi/ARBs) in the RAMP-DM module in 2002–2019. We excluded patients with eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (n = 116,099) throughout the observation period and those who had already stopped RASi prior to reaching eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (n = 6396). We also excluded those who were initiated on RASi in 2019, with RASi exposure < 90 days during the observation period and follow-up < 6 months. This yielded 10,400 patients with T2D in the main analysis (Fig. 2). In further subgroups analyses, we compared the effects of those who subsequently re-initiated RASi after initial discontinuation in the first 6 months of the index date (stop-restart RASi) and those who permanently discontinued-RASi (stopping within 6 months and never re-initiate).

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Renin–angiotensin system inhibitor use in CKD — monitoring and continuation criteria: ACEi or ARB reduce intraglomerular pressure, which may cause a transient decrease, or dip, in eGFR up to 30%, but this short-term decline in eGFR is not associated with decreased long-term outcomes and should not prompt discontinuation of the ACEi or ARB. Electrolytes should be rechecked 2 to 4 weeks after initiating or intensifying ACEi or ARB dosage, monitoring for hyperkalemia or a decline in eGFR of > 30%, which may require reducing or holding the agent temporarily or additional evaluation. ACEi or ARB can be continued in people with eGFR < 30 mL/ min/1.73 m2 as an RCT found that discontinuation was not associated with a significant difference in long-term decrease in eGFR, and the combined use of an ACEi and an ARB should be avoided because of increased harm.

Management of hypertension and proteinuria in glomerular disease — angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) use and titration are described as follows: Use an ACEi or ARB to maximally tolerated or allowed doses as first-line therapy in treating patients with both hypertension and proteinuria; do not stop ACEi or ARB with modest and stable increase in serum creatinine (up to 30%), but stop ACEi or ARB if kidney function continues to worsen, and/or refractory hyperkalemia; combinations of ACEi and ARB may be used in young adults without diabetes or cardiovascular disease, but benefits and safety are uncertain; caveat: do not start ACEi/ARB in patients who present with abrupt onset of NS, because these drugs can cause AKI especially in patients with MCD; and up titrate an ACEi or ARB to maximally tolerated or allowed daily dose as first-line therapy in treating patients with GN and proteinuria alone, indicated for persistent proteinuria despite treatment of primary GN with immunosuppression (where indicated), while avoiding use of an ACEi or ARB if kidney function is rapidly changing.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for adults with early (stage 1 to 3) non-diabetic chronic kidney disease [^42d9e4ed]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long term condition that occurs as a result of damage to the kidneys. Early recognition of CKD is becoming increasingly common due to widespread laboratory estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting, raised clinical awareness, and international adoption of Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) classification. Early recognition and management of CKD affords the opportunity not only to prepare for progressive kidney impairment and impending renal replacement therapy, but also for intervening to reduce the risk of progression and cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are two classes of antihypertensive drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Beneficial effects of ACEi and ARB on renal outcomes and survival in people with a wide range of severity of renal impairment have been reported; however, their effectiveness in the subgroup of people with early CKD (stage 1 to 3) is less certain.

Objectives

This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of ACEi and ARB or both in the management of people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who do not have diabetes mellitus.

Search Strategy

In March 2010 we searched The Cochrane Library, including The Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Reference lists of review articles and relevant studies were also checked. The search was conducted using the optimally sensitive strategy developed by the Cochrane Collaboration for the identification of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with input from an expert in trial search strategy.

Selection Criteria

All RCTs reporting the effect of ACEi or ARB in people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who did not have diabetes mellitus were selected for inclusion. Only studies of at least four weeks duration were selected. Authors, working in teams of two, independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts, and whenever necessary the full text of these studies were screened to determine which studies satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was carried out by two authors, independently, using a standard data extraction form and cross checked by two other authors. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data entry was carried out by one author and cross checked by another author. When more than one study reported similar outcomes, data were pooled using the random-effects model, but a fixed-effect model was also analysed to ensure the robustness of the model chosen and to check susceptibility to outliers. Heterogeneity was analysed using a Chi² test on N-1 degrees of freedom, with an alpha of 0.05 used for statistical significance and with the I² test. Where data permitted, subgroup analysis was used to explore possible sources of heterogeneity. The quality of the evidence was analysed.

Main Results

Four RCTs enrolling 2177 participants met our inclusion criteria. Of these, three compared ACEi with placebo and one compared ACEi with ARB. Two studies had an overall low risk of bias, and the other two were considered to be at moderate to high risk of bias. Low to moderate quality of evidence (from two studies representing 1906 patients) suggested that ACEi had no impact on all-cause mortality (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.17 to 19.27, P = 0.63) or cardiovascular events (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.14, P = 0.31) in people with stage 3 CKD. For all-cause mortality, there was substantial heterogeneity in the results. One study (quality assessment: low risk of bias) reported no difference in the risk of end-stage kidney disease in those with an eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.74 m² treated with ACEi versus placebo (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.11, P = 0.99). The (high risk of bias) study that compared ACEi with ARB reported little difference in effect between the treatments when urinary protein, blood pressure or creatinine clearance were compared. No published studies comparing ARB with placebo or ACEi and ARB with placebo were identified.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review demonstrated that there is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of ACEi or ARB in patients with stage 1 to 3 CKD who do not have diabetes mellitus. We have identified an area of significant uncertainty for a group of patients who account for most of those labelled as having CKD.

### An acute fall in estimated glomerular filtration rate during treatment with losartan predicts a slower decrease in long-term renal function [^6a7297bd]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Intervention in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) is associated with slowing the progressive loss of renal function. During initiation of therapy, however, there may be an acute fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We tested whether this initial fall in GFR reflects a renal hemodynamic effect and whether this might result in a slower decline in long-term renal function. We performed a post hoc analysis of the Reduction of Endpoints in Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) trial. Patients assigned to losartan had a significantly greater acute fall in estimated (eGFR) during the first 3 months compared to patients assigned to placebo, but a significantly slower long-term mean decline of eGFR thereafter. A large interindividual difference, however, was noticed in the acute eGFR change. When patients were divided into tertiles of initial fall in eGFR, the long-term eGFR slope calculated from baseline was significantly higher in patients with an initial fall compared to those with an initial rise. When eGFR decline was calculated from 3 months to the final visit, excluding the initial effect, patients with a large initial fall in eGFR had a significant lower long-term eGFR slope compared to those with a moderate fall or rise. This relationship was independent of other risk markers or change in risk markers for progression of renal disease such as blood pressure and albuminuria. Thus, the greater the acute fall in eGFR, during losartan treatment, the slower the rate of long-term eGFR decline. Hence, interpretation of trial results relying on slope-based GFR outcomes should separate the initial drug-induced GFR change from the subsequent long-term effect on GFR.

### Slowing nephropathy progression: focus on proteinuria reduction [^f6c7883a]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Blood pressure control reduces decline of kidney function. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers offer renoprotection to a small extent beyond that attributable to blood pressure lowering. These agents also reduce proteinuria, a risk marker for renal disease progression. Accumulating evidence indicates that their antiproteinuric effect correlates with their additional renal benefits.

### Effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on cardiovascular events and residual renal function in dialysis patients: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^5c289375]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular events (CVEs) are the leading causes of death among dialysis patients, with mortality rates 7 to 30 times higher than in the general population. Observational studies to date in dialysis patients have reported an association between progressive loss of residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and increased mortality; Causality has not been established with dialysis patient survival and residual renal function (RRF). Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has provided significant cardiovascular protection and preserved RRF for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Unfortunately, most trials excluded patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving maintenance dialysis, the beneficial effects of ACEI/ARBs on CVEs and RRF in dialysis patients remain uncertain. Some large-scale trials tested the effects of ACEIs/ARBs therapy in dialysis patients provided inconsistent results, and much uncertainty persists regarding the protective effects of this agent.

We therefore undertook a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of ACEIs and ARBs on cardiovascular events and residual renal function decline in patients receiving dialysis.

### Is there added value to adding ARB to ACE inhibitors in the management of CKD? [^7c256799]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Antagonism of the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) decreases BP and reduces proteinuria in chronic kidney disease. BP is decreased approximately 5 mmHg when angiotensin II blockers are added to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and is less than typically seen when other agents are added to existing ACE inhibitor regimens. Dual RAAS blockade results in additional reduction in proteinuria. Clinically insignificant increases in hyperkalemia and modest decreases in GFR occur. Data regarding long-term preservation of renal function are lacking. We suggest dual RAAS blockade be used in patients with chronic kidney disease with residual proteinuria on maximal ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II blocker therapy, anticipating additional data with ongoing trials.

### Actual impact of angiotensin II receptor blocker or calcium channel blocker monotherapy on renal function in real-world patients [^4c66b3b5]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This observational retrospective cohort study investigates the effect of antihypertensive therapy with angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (dCCBs) monotherapy on renal function using longitudinal real-world health data of a drug-naive, hypertensive population without kidney disease.

Methods

Using propensity score matching, we selected untreated hypertensive participants (n = 10151) and dCCB (n = 5078) or ARB (n = 5073) new-users based on annual health check-ups and claims between 2008 and 2020. Participants were divided by the first prescribed drug.

Results

The mean age was 51years, 79% were men and the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 78ml/min per 1.73m 2. Blood pressure rapidly decreased by approximately 10% in both treatment groups. At the 1-year visit, eGFR levels decreased in the ARB group by nearly 2% but increased in the dCCB group by less than 1%. However, no significant difference was apparent in the annual eGFR change after the 1-year visit. The risk for composite kidney outcome (new-onset proteinuria or eGFR decline ≥ 30%) was lowest in the ARB group owing to their robust effect on preventing proteinuria: hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for proteinuria was 0.91 (0.78–1.05) for the dCCB group and 0.54 (0.44–0.65) for the ARB group, compared with that for the untreated group after ending follow-up at the last visit before changing antihypertensive treatment.

Conclusion

From the present findings based on the real-world data, ARBs can be recommended for kidney protection even in a primary care setting. Meanwhile, dCCB treatment initially increases eGFR with no adverse effects on proteinuria.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated elevations in serum creatinine… [^b5207a48]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Inhibition of the RAS blunts the maximal capacitance of organs such as the heart and kidney to respond to increased metabolic and physical demands. Clinical trial data support the observation that a small reduction in GFR or rise in serum creatinine level markedly slows renal disease progression. An analogous example in the cardiovascular system is the relationship between heart rate and cardiovascular events. Data support the concept that a reduction in heart rate, by β-blockers, reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events. Thus, we argue that an initial, limited, rise in serum creatinine level is beneficial within the context of preserving renal function. Two representative, long-term studies in patients with diabetic nephropathy illustrate that the initial reduction in GFR, following initiation of ACE inhibition, reverted to rates not significantly different from baseline 1 month after ACE inhibition was withdrawn.

26, 30 In a follow-up study by Hansen et al, 26 42 hypertensive diabetic subjects received ACEIs for an average period of 6 years. In the ACEI group there was a clear initial reduction in GFR by 3% to 9% below baseline at this time. Overall, mean arterial pressure ranged from 105 to 109 mm Hg. However, at the end of 6 years when therapy with ACEIs was stopped, GFR increased by an average of 6. 1% over a period of 1 month. This supports the concept that initial or persistent GFR declines are reversible despite prolonged ACEI use. We also noted that patients with diabetic nephropathy given the ACEI lisinopril had from a 1% to 9% fall in GFR at 1 month following treatment initiation. 30 The range of mean arterial pressure achieved in this study was 99 to 105 mm Hg. After an average of 5 years of ACEI therapy, patients were withdrawn from the ACEI treatment and clonidine was substituted to maintain blood pressure control.

The GFR returned to levels not different from baseline within 1 month of ACEI termination, despite similar blood pressure control. This study further supports the concept that while GFR may be reduced acutely, one can markedly blunt the rate of progression of renal disease with ACEIs. Moreover, these initial ACEI-associated declines in GFR are reversible and partially independent of systemic arterial pressure. In this trial, ACEI or placebo were added to a standard antihypertensive regimen to lower blood pressure to less than 140/90 mm Hg.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for adults with early (stage 1 to 3) non-diabetic chronic kidney disease [^e6d2b1e4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition that occurs as a result of damage to the kidneys. Early recognition of CKD is becoming increasingly common due to widespread laboratory estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting, raised clinical awareness, and international adoption of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classifications. Early recognition and management of CKD affords the opportunity to prepare for progressive kidney impairment and impending kidney replacement therapy and for intervention to reduce the risk of progression and cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are two classes of antihypertensive drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Beneficial effects of ACEi and ARB on kidney outcomes and survival in people with a wide range of severity of kidney impairment have been reported; however, their effectiveness in the subgroup of people with early CKD (stage 1 to 3) is less certain. This is an update of a review that was last published in 2011.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of ACEi and ARB or both in the management of people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who do not have diabetes mellitus (DM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 6 July 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the effect of ACEi or ARB in people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who did not have DM were selected for inclusion. Only studies of at least four weeks duration were selected. Authors independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts and, where necessary, the full text to determine which satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was carried out by two authors independently, using a standard data extraction form. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data entry was carried out by one author and cross-checked by another. When more than one study reported similar outcomes, data were pooled using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity was analysed using a Chi² test and the I² test. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach MAIN RESULTS: Six studies randomising 9379 participants with CKD stages 1 to 3 (without DM) met our inclusion criteria. Participants were adults with hypertension; 79% were male from China, Europe, Japan, and the USA. Treatment periods ranged from 12 weeks to three years. Overall, studies were judged to be at unclear or high risk of bias across all domains, and the quality of the evidence was poor, with GRADE rated as low or very low certainty. In low certainty evidence, ACEi (benazepril 10 mg or trandolapril 2 mg) compared to placebo may make little or no difference to death (any cause) (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.26 to 15.37; I² = 76%), total cardiovascular events (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05; I² = 0%), cardiovascular-related death (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.26 to 11.66; I² = 54%), stroke (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.03; I² = 0%), myocardial infarction (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.20; I² = 0%), and adverse events (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.41; I² = 0%). It is uncertain whether ACEi (benazepril 10 mg or trandolapril 2 mg) compared to placebo reduces congestive heart failure (1 study, 8290 participants): RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.95) or transient ischaemic attack (1 study, 583 participants): RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.01; I² = 0%) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. It is uncertain whether ARB (losartan 50 mg) compared to placebo (1 study, 226 participants) reduces: death (any-cause) (no events), adverse events (RR 19.34, 95% CI 1.14 to 328.30), eGFR rate of decline (MD 5.00 mL/min/1.73 m 2, 95% CI 3.03 to 6.97), presence of proteinuria (MD -0.65 g/24 hours, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.52), systolic blood pressure (MD -0.80 mm Hg, 95% CI -3.89 to 2.29), or diastolic blood pressure (MD -1.10 mm Hg, 95% CI -3.29 to 1.09) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. It is uncertain whether ACEi (enalapril 20 mg, perindopril 2 mg or trandolapril 1 mg) compared to ARB (olmesartan 20 mg, losartan 25 mg or candesartan 4 mg) (1 study, 26 participants) reduces: proteinuria (MD -0.40, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.20), systolic blood pressure (MD -3.00 mm Hg, 95% CI -6.08 to 0.08) or diastolic blood pressure (MD -1.00 mm Hg, 95% CI -3.31 to 1.31) because the certainty of the evidence is very low.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of ACEi or ARB in patients with stage 1 to 3 CKD who do not have DM. The available evidence is overall of very low certainty and high risk of bias. We have identified an area of large uncertainty for a group of patients who account for most of those diagnosed as having CKD.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^caafd5df]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Practice Point 2.1.4 — hemodynamically active therapies and estimated GFR (eGFR) changes in CKD — states that GFR reductions of > 30% on subsequent testing exceed expected variability and warrant evaluation; early after intensive blood pressure (BP) control, reductions of 10%–20% within the first 3 months are typical, and acute rises in serum creatinine (SCr) or declines in eGFR of < 20%–30% are expected and do not warrant changes; post hoc SGLT2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) analyses found similar trajectories with > 10% initial drops except when the acute "dip" was > 30% from baseline; during initiation of anti-hypertensive agents, renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), or SGLT2i, a significant drop in eGFR (> 30%) should prompt a review into other causes and warrants close monitoring, and healthcare providers should avoid the urge to stop these kidney-protective agents as earlier "dips" are typically reversible and not an indication of drug toxicity.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for diabetes and CKD: 2012 update [^1c3292a0]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

KDOQI Diabetes Guideline: 2012 Update — research priorities in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) state that, given the limitations of albuminuria as an outcome measure, studies are needed to evaluate durability of effects on urinary albumin excretion, and the categorization of albuminuria outcomes should be based on a minimum of two of three consecutive urine samples being in the same category. Consider an indication for regulatory approval based on demonstration of a lasting reduction in urinary albumin excretion, but conditional upon firm commitment to continue long-term studies to determine effects on GFR (glomerular filtration rate) loss and clinically relevant outcomes. Evaluate the relative roles of ACE-Is (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers), renin blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers on progression of DKD in patients with albuminuria. Kidney biopsy outcomes based on carefully measured structural variables that correlate strongly with GFR loss may reduce the duration of primary prevention or early intervention DKD clinical trials, and enzyme replacement for Fabry's Disease is given as an example. Clinical trials represent important opportunities to advance knowledge beyond addressing the primary hypotheses themselves, and protocols should include plans for acquiring and banking blood, urine, DNA, and other samples for eventual biomarker discovery and validation, with the DCCT cited as an example.

### ACE inhibitors to prevent end-stage renal disease: when to start and why possibly never to stop: a post hoc analysis of the REIN trial results. ramipril efficacy in nephropathy [^da6559bb]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

In this post hoc, secondary analysis of the Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) trial, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition risk/benefit profile was assessed in 322 patients with nondiabetic, proteinuric chronic nephropathies and different degrees of renal insufficiency. The rate of GFR decline (Delta GFR) and the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during ramipril or non-ACE inhibitor treatment were compared within three tertiles of basal GFR. Delta GFR was comparable in the three tertiles, whereas the incidence of ESRD was higher in the lowest tertile than in the middle and highest tertiles. Ramipril decreased Delta GFR by 22%, 22%, and 35% and the incidence of ESRD by 33% (P < 0.05), 37%, and 100% (P < 0.01) in the lowest, middle, and highest tertiles, respectively. Delta GFR reduction was predicted by basal systolic (P < 0.0001), diastolic (P = 0.02), and mean (P < 0.001) BP and proteinuria (P < 0.0001) but not by basal GFR (P = 0.12). ESRD risk reduction was predicted by basal proteinuria (P < 0.01) and GFR (P < 0.0001) and was strongly dependent on treatment duration (P < 0.0001). Adverse events were comparable among the three tertiles and within each tertile in the two treatment groups. Thus, disease progression and response to ACE inhibition do not depend on severity of renal insufficiency. The risk of ESRD and the absolute number of events saved by ACE inhibition is highest in patients with the lowest GFR. However, renoprotection is maximized when ACE inhibition is started earlier and when long-lasting treatment may result in GFR stabilization and definitive prevention of ESRD.

### Rationale for combination angiotensin receptor blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment and end-organ protection in patients with chronic kidney disease [^669e602f]. American Journal of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem that has received increasing attention because of the high rate of associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Mounting evidence indicates that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) safely slow down progression of CKD. There is also growing evidence supporting combination treatment of nephropathies with an ACE inhibitor plus an ARB to more completely block the RAAS and provide greater renoprotection than either an ACE inhibitor-based or ARB-based regimen. The National Kidney Foundation suggests that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may be used in combination to reduce proteinuria in patients with kidney disease; however, larger outcomes trials are needed.

When should RAAS blockade be stopped?

The use of RAAS-blocking drugs in early pregnancy has been associated with harm to the fetus, including cardiovascular, neurological and renal malformations, although more recent surveys do not suggest that there is a high risk of these problems occurring. Pregnancy is associated with a high risk of progression of diabetic nephropathy in people with type 1 diabetes, and the benefits of RAAS blockade in such individuals may outweigh the risks, but current advice is that RAAS-blocking drugs should be stopped when pregnancy is confirmed, and indeed when pregnancy is planned.

Drugs that block the RAAS reduce intraglomerular pressure and may lead to a rise in serum creatinine of up to 30%, which should then stabilise. Some studies suggest that clinically significant renal artery stenosis may be quite common among people with diabetes, especially those with type 2 diabetes. While the use of drugs that modulate the RAAS may increase the risk of deterioration in renal function in people with renovascular disease, in practice such deterioration is rare.

RAAS blockade can lead to hyperkalaemia, which may be managed by dietary methods, diuretics or use of sodium bicarbonate. However, if the hyperkalaemia is severe and refractory to these measures, RAAS blockade may need to be stopped or reduced but this needs balanced with the loss of the benefits of proteinuria reduction and retardation of GFR declin e. A further possible clinical scenario is someone with type 1 diabetes having deteriorating renal function despite having well-controlled blood pressure on ACEI drugs. Once renal dysfunction continues to escape, despite optimal therapy, a decision may need to be made about cessation of ACEI therapy, especially if there may be a degree of ischaemic nephropathy, renovascular disease or postural hypotension. RAAS blockade may also increase the risk of AKI in people with diabetes, and advice to stop these drugs during periods of acute illness should be considered.

### Using ACE inhibitors and ARBs in advanced chronic… [^fe93c28e]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question In patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, does the continued use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors have a worsening effect on renal function. Bottom Line Although some experts have recommended the discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in patients with advanced CKD, the study supports their continuation with no evidence of harm and a possible reduction in the need for renal replacement therapy. Synopsis Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors include angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Although their use in mild to moderate CKD slows progression of the disease, their use in patients with advanced CKD is not known. The U. K. investigators identified adults with stage IV or V CKD and a decrease in GFR of 2 mL per minute per 1.

73 m. 2 per year over the past two years who were not on dialysis and used an ACE inhibitor or ARB for at least six months before enrollment. At baseline, the 411 patients had a median serum creatinine level of 3. 4 mg per dL, a median estimated GFR of 18 mL per minute per

1. 73 m 2, 45% were 65 years or older, and 36% had type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patients were randomized to continue or discontinue their ACE inhibitor or ARB. In both groups, other classes of antihypertensives could be used to control blood pressure at the discretion of the treating physician. Analysis was by intention to treat, and the groups were balanced at baseline. After a median follow-up of three years, the estimated GFR was higher in the group that continued to use renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, but this difference was not statistically significant.

Patients in the continuation group had a strong trend toward a lower rate of requiring renal replacement therapy.

### Comprehensive suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in chronic kidney disease: covering all of the bases [^3229e899]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Reducing proteinuria and blood pressure in chronic kidney disease (CKD) decreases rate of progression. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers is beneficial in reducing proteinuria but incomplete in suppressing aldosterone production and its renal effects. Adding aldosterone receptor blockers to these other agents may further halt the progression of CKD.

### Initiating renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in chronic kidney disease [^c1369a8e]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by abnormalities in kidney structure or function, present for at least 3 months. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are established treatments in the management of CKD, reducing the risk of adverse kidney and cardiovascular events. Despite an extensive evidence base and decades of clinical experience, they remain underused, underdosed and frequently discontinued due to concerns about changes in kidney function and hyperkalaemia. In this article, we provide an overview of initiating RAS inhibitors in adults with CKD, highlight current guideline recommendations and offer a practical approach to dealing with the challenges associated with their use.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^33d4853d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — supportive evidence and ACEi/ARB monitoring: SPRINT data demonstrated adults with CKD and hypertension can be effectively and safely treated to SBP < 130 mm Hg, and meta-analyses have shown benefit of treating SBP < 130 mm Hg versus higher SBP targets. An analysis of CKD patients from 4 trials found that an SBP target of < 130 mm Hg (versus < 140 mm Hg) decreased all-cause mortality; a meta-analysis of the CKD subsets from 18 trials reported that more-intensive SBP (mean SBP 132 mm Hg) versus less-intensive SBP (mean SBP 140 mm Hg) control resulted in 14% reduction in all-cause mortality. While < 120 mm Hg is more effective at preventing CVD events, meta-analyses of trial data support an SBP < 130 mm Hg to balance the benefits of intensive BP-lowering with the risks of adverse events. ACEi or ARB reduce intraglomerular pressure, which may cause a transient decrease, or dip, in eGFR up to 30%, and this short-term decline in eGFR is not associated with decreased long-term outcomes and should not prompt discontinuation of the ACEi or ARB. Electrolytes should be rechecked 2 to 4 weeks after initiating or intensifying ACEi or ARB dosage, monitoring for hyperkalemia or a decline in eGFR of > 30%, which may require reducing or holding the agent temporarily or additional evaluation. ACEi or ARB can be continued in people with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 as an RCT found that discontinuation was not associated with a significant difference in long-term decrease in eGFR, and the combined use of an ACEi and an ARB should be avoided because of increased harm.

### Clinical implications of estimated glomerular filtration rate dip following sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor initiation on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes [^20d8c1cb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Our analyses of factors associated with eGFR discontinuation suggest that the occurrence of adverse events, hospitalization, or increase in HbA1c (a marker of worsening glycemic control) was associated with discontinuation of SGLT2i. Furthermore, eGFR dip > 30% was also associated with increased risk of discontinuation. These results may be useful in guiding efforts to examine whether some of these patient groups may benefit from resumption of treatment with SGLT2i.

The mechanism underpinning the eGFR dip in SGLT2i is not entirely clear. It has been suggested that this initial dip is reminiscent of the mild decline in eGFR observed in some patients following initiation of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, which is generally attributed to postglomerular (efferent) vasodilatation and reduced hyperfiltration. Several other hypotheses are being tested, including potential contribution of enhanced proximal tubular natriuresis leading to activation of tubuloglomerular feedback and resultant preglomerular (afferent) vasoconstriction. The constellation of evidence from randomized controlled trials and real‐world studies suggests that the initial eGFR dip is likely a functional (and reversible) dip that does not reflect kidney injury and is then followed by eGFR stabilization, and ultimately reduced risk of adverse cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. The results of our analyses are congruent with this understanding and support the assessment that eGFR dip does not substantially erode the effectiveness of SGLT2i on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, and that even in those with eGFR dip > 30%, continued therapy with SGLT2i was more beneficial for longer‐term cardiovascular and kidney outcomes than discontinued therapy.

### Renin-angiotensin system inhibition in advanced chronic kidney disease: how low can the kidney function go? [^4a0fd3f4]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To present the available data on the risks and benefits for ACEi/ARB usage in patients with advanced CKD.

Recent Findings

It has been well established that ACEi/ARB use is beneficial in patients with mild-to-moderate CKD, especially in patients with proteinuria. The majority of available data includes patients with diabetes mellitus. However, data in individuals with advanced CKD are limited. Additionally, data available for this subset of patients is conflicting and the definition of advanced CKD varies across clinical trials.

Summary

On the basis of our literature review, evidence suggests continuing ACEi/ARB therapy in patients with advanced CKD (eGFR less than 15ml/min/1.73m) unless hyperkalemia ensues unresponsive to therapy, hypotension develops or have unusually rapid worsening of eGFR (not usual progressive decline). These patients should be monitored closely. There is not enough data to support starting ACEi/ARBs de novo in patients with advanced CKD (eGFR less than 15ml/min/1.73m). If RAS blockade is started de novo in this subgroup, we recommend close monitoring.

### Blood pressure management… [^409cc07a]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

- Treating type 2 diabetes with metformin in CKD reduces mortality and can be continued until eGFR drops to 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m
2. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists also improve outcomes in CKD. From the AFP Editors. Dietary Recommendations Dietary sodium restriction to reduce proteinuria and to improve blood pressure control should be considered. Studies have evaluated various thresholds, but limiting intake to about 2, 000 mg per day is generally accepted. Limiting dietary protein intake to 0. 6 to
0. 8 g per kg per day to decrease CKD progression when the eGFR is below 60 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 increases malnutrition risk, which requires close monitoring. Blood Pressure Management One meta-analysis suggests reduced mortality in CKD when systolic blood pressure is maintained below 140 mm Hg.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers should be used to treat patients who have CKD with albuminuria and diabetes mellitus. For CKD with albuminuria but no diabetes, an ACE inhibitor is preferred because of a 31% reduction in end-stage renal disease. Treatment of Diabetes with CKD Metformin is considered first-line therapy to decrease mortality in type 2 diabetes with CKD. Metformin can be started above an eGFR of 45 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 and safely continued until eGFR drops to 30 mL per minute per

1. 73 m 2. Consider additional treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists to reduce CKD progression. SGLT-2 inhibitors slow CKD progression and reduce hospitalization for heart failure, with uncertain effect on mortality.

Based on a post-hoc trial analysis, GLP-1 receptor agonists appear to reduce major cardiovascular events and mortality in CKD and may slightly reduce CKD progression. Conversely, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors do not improve outcomes in CKD.

### Reduction of proteinuria with angiotensin receptor blockers [^a8e1ad3b]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Renal pathophysiology is elicited by activation of angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptors at all stages of renovascular disease. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) that specifically block the AT(1) receptor offer the potential to prevent or delay progression to end-stage renal disease independently of reductions in blood pressure. Proteinuria — an early and sensitive marker for progressive renal dysfunction — is reduced by ARB use in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy and microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria. Retrospective analysis of data available from early trials has confirmed this finding and has shown that albuminuria reduction is associated with lessening of cardiovascular risk. The ARB telmisartan is equivalent to enalapril in preventing glomerular filtration rate decline, and equivalent to valsartan in reducing proteinuria. Telmisartan is more effective than conventional therapy in lowering the risk of transition to overt nephropathy in hypertensive and normotensive patients. An additive effect has been seen in smaller studies when telmisartan has been added to lisinopril therapy, and high-dose telmisartan reduces albuminuria better than low-dose telmisartan. Similar data were obtained with other ARBs such as candesartan, losartan, valsartan, or irbesartan. These data support the proposition that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system beyond that required for maximum blood pressure reduction provides optimum renal protection.

### Change in renal function associated with drug treatment in heart failure: national guidance [^dd7c7130]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Changes in kidney function after initiation of drug treatment

A decline in renal function is commonly seen in patients when they start an ACEI, ARB or sacubitril/valsartan and is usually modest. The decline is attributable to loss of renal efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and an acute decrease in intraglomerular pressure, with subsequent fall in GFR. Renal function may actually improve: in Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS), although the average increase in creatinine was 44 µmol/L at 2 weeks, in nearly a quarter of patients creatinine declined.RAAS inhibitors can decrease the rate at which renal function subsequently declines, despite an apparent initial worsening.

The deterioration in renal function may also indicate haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis or intrarenal vascular disease. For a small proportion of patients, particularly those with bilateral renovascular disease, initiation of ACEI/ARB can result in substantial and irreversible declines in renal function or life-threatening hyperkalaemia. In those rare cases with profound decline in GFR post-RAAS inhibitor, renal artery stenosis should be actively sought with decision on revascularisation made on an individual patient basis.

Important questions are: (1) whether there is a level of decline in renal function related to ACEI/ARB initiation beyond which the risk of continuing treatment outweighs the benefits; and (2) whether the risk:benefit balance depends on the indication for treatment.

One of the pitfalls in caring for patients with heart failure is premature discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors when renal function declines during initiation or uptitration of the drugs. Worsening renal function is more common in patients treated with ACEI and ARB. Among patients with HFrEF, those with worse renal function at baseline, and those who have a greater decline in renal function during initiation of RAAS inhibitors, have a worse prognosis than those who do not; however, they gain a greater relative benefit from RAAS inhibitors. In patients with HFpEF, worse renal function is again associated with higher mortality, but in contrast to patients with HFrEF, worsening renal function on RAAS inhibitors is associated with increased mortality.

### Aldosterone antagonists in addition to renin angiotensin system antagonists for preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease [^d4cb6cd4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is used to reduce proteinuria and retard the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, resolution of proteinuria may be incomplete with these therapies and the addition of an aldosterone antagonist may be added to further prevent progression of CKD. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009 and updated in 2014.

To evaluate the effects of aldosterone antagonists (selective (eplerenone), non-selective (spironolactone or canrenone), or non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists (finerenone)) in adults who have CKD with proteinuria (nephrotic and non-nephrotic range) on: patient-centred endpoints including kidney failure (previously know as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)), major cardiovascular events, and death (any cause); kidney function (proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and doubling of serum creatinine); blood pressure; and adverse events (including hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury, and gynaecomastia).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 January 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared aldosterone antagonists in combination with ACEi or ARB (or both) to other anti-hypertensive strategies or placebo in participants with proteinuric CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Data were summarised using random effects meta-analysis. We expressed summary treatment estimates as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, or standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were used together with their 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk of bias were assessed using the Cochrane tool. Evidence certainty was evaluated using GRADE.

Main Results

Forty-four studies (5745 participants) were included. Risk of bias in the evaluated methodological domains were unclear or high risk in most studies. Adequate random sequence generation was present in 12 studies, allocation concealment in five studies, blinding of participant and investigators in 18 studies, blinding of outcome assessment in 15 studies, and complete outcome reporting in 24 studies. All studies comparing aldosterone antagonists to placebo or standard care were used in addition to an ACEi or ARB (or both). None of the studies were powered to detect differences in patient-level outcomes including kidney failure, major cardiovascular events or death. Aldosterone antagonists had uncertain effects on kidney failure (2 studies, 84 participants: RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.65, I² = 0%; very low certainty evidence), death (3 studies, 421 participants: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.50, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence), and cardiovascular events (3 studies, 1067 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.56; I² = 42%; low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce protein excretion (14 studies, 1193 participants: SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.20, I² = 82%; very low certainty evidence), eGFR (13 studies, 1165 participants, MD -3.00 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -5.51 to -0.49, I² = 0%, low certainty evidence) and systolic blood pressure (14 studies, 911 participants: MD -4.98 mmHg, 95% CI -8.22 to -1.75, I² = 87%; very low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists probably increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (17 studies, 3001 participants: RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.22, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), acute kidney injury (5 studies, 1446 participants: RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.97, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), and gynaecomastia (4 studies, 281 participants: RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.14 to 23.23, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Non-selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB had uncertain effects on protein excretion (2 studies, 139 participants: SMD -1.59, 95% CI -3.80 to 0.62, I² = 93%; very low certainty evidence) but may increase serum potassium (2 studies, 121 participants: MD 0.31 mEq/L, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.45, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared to diuretics plus ACEi or ARB. Selective aldosterone antagonists may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (2 studies, 500 participants: RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.95, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared ACEi or ARB (or both). There were insufficient studies to perform meta-analyses for the comparison between non-selective aldosterone antagonists and calcium channel blockers, selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB (or both) and nitrate plus ACEi or ARB (or both), and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists and selective aldosterone antagonists.

Authors' Conclusions

The effects of aldosterone antagonists when added to ACEi or ARB (or both) on the risks of death, major cardiovascular events, and kidney failure in people with proteinuric CKD are uncertain. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce proteinuria, eGFR, and systolic blood pressure in adults who have mild to moderate CKD but may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and gynaecomastia when added to ACEi and/or ARB.

### Renin-angiotensin system blockade discontinuation and mortality in persons with low estimated glomerular filtration rate… [^cd2e7a58]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

These findings suggest that continued angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker use is associated with cardiovascular health benefits in individuals with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1. 73 m2, without increased risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease. Importance It is uncertain whether and when angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker treatment should be discontinued in individuals with low estimated glomerular filtration rate. We compared individuals who stopped ACE-I or ARB therapy within 6 months after a decrease in eGFR to below 30 mL/min/1. 73 m2 with those who did not discontinue therapy. We defined discontinuation as a gap in therapy longer than 60 days that occurred before T0. We allowed for switching between ACE-I and ARB or to different medications within each class given evidence suggesting that ACE-Is and ARBs share similar mechanisms, benefits, and risks. 4, 5, 11.

Compared with their counterparts, individuals who discontinued ACE-I or ARB therapy were more often male, had lower eGFR, had higher serum potassium levels, had a higher prevalence of congestive heart failure, and were more likely to be receiving antiplatelet agents at the time of the eGFR decrease. 14, 15 However, an observational study of 52 individuals with stage G4 or G5 CKD reported an eGFR increase after ACE-I or ARB treatment discontinuation, and the authors concluded that "discontinuation of ACEi/ARB has undoubtedly delayed the onset of RRT in the majority of those studied. "12 An ongoing clinical trial16 aims to detect the difference in 3-year eGFR among individuals with stages G4 to G5 CKD. We found a higher risk of mortality and MACE associated with ACE-I or ARB therapy discontinuation after an eGFR decrease to below 30 mL/min/1. 73 m2 but no significant difference in the risk of ESKD.

Similar patterns held for individuals with a 40% or greater decrease in eGFR. Our findings suggest that continuing ACE-I or ARB therapy in patients with declining kidney function may provide cardiovascular and survival benefits without excess risks of ESKD.

### Initial decline (dip) in estimated glomerular filtration rate after initiation of dapagliflozin in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: insights from DAPA-HF [^3e59abdd]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Editorial, see p

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of worsening heart failure (HF) and death attributable to cardiovascular causes in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). These agents also reduce the long-term rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and development of end-stage kidney disease in patients with HFrEF and patients with chronic kidney disease, with or without type 2 diabetes. However, SGLT2 inhibitors cause an initial decline (dip) in eGFR, which has caused some clinical concern, particularly in patients with a reduced baseline eGFR. One concern is that the initial decline, if substantial, might lead to discontinuation of existing evidence-based and lifesaving treatments such as renin-angiotensin system blockers or a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist or even to consideration of renal replacement therapy. Physicians may also associate an acute decline in eGFR with a risk of progressive, chronic worsening of kidney function and poor outcomes, and concern about reducing eGFR may lead to underuse of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HFrEF. Although there have been several analyses of the early decline in eGFR with SGLT2 inhibitors, these have all been in patients with type 2 diabetes, in whom the renal pathophysiology may be different from that of individuals with HFrEF. – Moreover, patients with HFrEF are universally treated with diuretics, renin-angiotensin system blockers, and often mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, all of which also affect eGFR. In contrast to the participants in the other trials, generally with normal or elevated blood pressure, patients with HFrEF often have low blood pressure and fluctuations in plasma volume that may reduce glomerular filtration, especially in the setting of renin-angiotensin system blockade causing efferent arteriolar dilatation.

It is therefore important to understand the frequency and extent of an early decline in eGFR after initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor, its predictors, and its association with subsequent clinical outcomes in patients with HFrEF, including those without type 2 diabetes and low eGFR at baseline. We have explored these questions in the DAPA-HF trial (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse-Outcomes in Heart Failure).

### Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for preventing the progression of diabetic kidney disease [^71a6da10]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines suggest that adults with diabetes and kidney disease receive treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2006.

Objectives

We compared the efficacy and safety of ACEi and ARB therapy (either as monotherapy or in combination) on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in adults with diabetes and kidney disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplants Register of Studies to 17 March 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included studies evaluating ACEi or ARB alone or in combination, compared to each other, placebo or no treatment in people with diabetes and kidney disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

One hundred and nine studies (28,341 randomised participants) were eligible for inclusion. Overall, the risk of bias was high. Compared to placebo or no treatment, ACEi may make little or no difference to all-cause death (24 studies, 7413 participants: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.15; I² = 23%; low certainty) and with similar withdrawals from treatment (7 studies, 5306 participants: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.19; I² = 0%; low certainty). ACEi may prevent kidney failure (8 studies, 6643 participants: RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.94; I² = 0%; low certainty). Compared to placebo or no treatment, ARB may make little or no difference to all-cause death (11 studies, 4260 participants: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; I² = 0%; low certainty). ARB have uncertain effects on withdrawal from treatment (3 studies, 721 participants: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.26; I² = 2%; low certainty) and cardiovascular death (6 studies, 878 participants: RR 3.36, 95% CI 0.93 to 12.07; low certainty). ARB may prevent kidney failure (3 studies, 3227 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94; I² = 0%; low certainty), doubling of serum creatinine (SCr) (4 studies, 3280 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97; I² = 32%; low certainty), and the progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria (5 studies, 815 participants: RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.85; I² = 74%; low certainty). Compared to ACEi, ARB had uncertain effects on all-cause death (15 studies, 1739 participants: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.88; I² = 0%; low certainty), withdrawal from treatment (6 studies, 612 participants: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.28; I² = 0%; low certainty), cardiovascular death (13 studies, 1606 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.98; I² = 0%; low certainty), kidney failure (3 studies, 837 participants: RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07; I² = 0%; low certainty), and doubling of SCr (2 studies, 767 participants: RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.48; I² = 0%; low certainty). Compared to ACEi plus ARB, ACEi alone has uncertain effects on all-cause death (6 studies, 1166 participants: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.40; I² = 20%; low certainty), withdrawal from treatment (2 studies, 172 participants: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.86; I² = 0%; low certainty), cardiovascular death (4 studies, 994 participants: RR 3.02, 95% CI 0.61 to 14.85; low certainty), kidney failure (3 studies, 880 participants: RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.32; I² = 0%; low certainty), and doubling of SCr (2 studies, 813 participants: RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.85; I² = 0%; low certainty). Compared to ACEi plus ARB, ARB alone has uncertain effects on all-cause death (7 studies, 2607 participants: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.37; I² = 0%; low certainty), withdrawn from treatment (3 studies, 1615 participants: RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.24; I² = 0%; low certainty), cardiovascular death (4 studies, 992 participants: RR 3.03, 95% CI 0.62 to 14.93; low certainty), kidney failure (4 studies, 2321 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.95; I² = 29%; low certainty), and doubling of SCr (3 studies, 2252 participants: RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.64; I² = 0%; low certainty). Comparative effects of different ACEi or ARB and low-dose versus high-dose ARB were rarely evaluated. No study compared different doses of ACEi. Adverse events of ACEi and ARB were rarely reported.

Authors' Conclusions

ACEi or ARB may make little or no difference to all-cause and cardiovascular death compared to placebo or no treatment in people with diabetes and kidney disease but may prevent kidney failure. ARB may prevent the doubling of SCr and the progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria compared with a placebo or no treatment. Despite the international guidelines suggesting not combining ACEi and ARB treatment, the effects of ACEi or ARB monotherapy compared to dual therapy have not been adequately assessed. The limited data availability and the low quality of the included studies prevented the assessment of the benefits and harms of ACEi or ARB in people with diabetes and kidney disease. Low and very low certainty evidence indicates that it is possible that further studies might provide different results.

### The role of calcium antagonists in chronic kidney disease [^91792277]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review goals of antihypertensive treatment in chronic kidney disease in the context of what role calcium antagonists play toward reducing progression of kidney disease.

Recent Findings

All recently published guidelines recommend a blood pressure goal of less than 130/80 mmHg in patients with chronic kidney disease. Use of calcium antagonists is not recommended as part of the initial armamentarium. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, when used in concert with diuretics reduce blood pressure as well as both proteinuria and the rate of decline in the glomerular filtration rate. The evidence for calcium antagonists in this regard is more divergent. Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, e.g. amlodipine, felodipine, help achieve blood pressure goals and reduce stroke risk. When used with a renin-angiotensin system blocker they do not detract from the benefits of this blockade on slowing progression of kidney disease. Non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, e.g. verpamil or diltiazem, decrease proteinuria and in studies with 5 to 6 years follow-up preserve kidney function similarly to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The reason for this outcome difference between calcium antagonists is partial preservation of renal autoregulation compared to its obliteration by the dihydropyridine subclass.

Summary

Use of calcium antagonists is safe and necessary to achieve blood pressure goals in people with chronic kidney disease. While both subclasses are safe and necessary to achieve blood pressure goals, dihydropyridine calcium antagonists fail to significantly slow the progression of kidney disease among patients with established nephropathy and macroalbuminuria when compared to agents that block the renin-angiotensin system.

### Management of low blood pressure in ambulatory heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients [^bf928487]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Step II: Identify hypotensive factors unrelated to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and stop/reduce non‐heart failure with reduced ejection fraction blood pressure‐lowering therapies

Non‐drug related causes of hypotensive episodes should be investigated, such as diarrhoea, fever, dehydration, etc. In such cases, the cause of hypotension should be corrected, and chronic HF treatment should not be changed over the long term. However, transient discontinuation of HF therapies may be considered (especially for diuretics when dehydration is observed) until resolution of the acute event. Early re‐introduction should be attempted whenever possible.

In the absence of the aforementioned causes of hypotension, BP‐lowering treatments without evidence of morbidity‐mortality reduction in HFrEF patients should be decreased or stopped. Cardiovascular treatments not indicated in HFrEF, such as calcium channel blockers, centrally‐acting antihypertensive drugs or alpha‐blockers, should be reduced or discontinued, regardless of the form of administration. It is also critical to identify 'hidden' hypotensive drugs (such as alpha‐blockers in the context of prostate disease or intraocular beta‐blockers in case of glaucoma) and replace the latter with another drug class (Figure 2).

KDOQI diabetes and CKD — type 2 diabetes with macroalbuminuria: Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are stated to be "more effective than other antihypertensive classes in slowing progression of kidney disease characterized by macroalbuminuria in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes", and this is supported by "high-quality randomized controlled trials" demonstrating ARBs slow "the decline in GFR and onset of kidney failure" in this population.

### Effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system blockade: a joint analysis of the CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD trials [^911550ff]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Significance Statement

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are foundational therapy for CKD but are underused, in part because they are frequently withheld and not restarted due to hyperkalemia, AKI, or hospitalization. Consequently, ensuring persistent use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in CKD has long been a major clinical priority. In this joint analysis of the CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD trials, the relative risk of discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was reduced by 15% in patients randomized to sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. This effect was more pronounced in patients with urine albumin:creatinine ratio ≥ 1000 mg/g, for whom the absolute benefits of these medications are the greatest. These findings indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors may enable better use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with CKD.

Background

Strategies to enable persistent use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade to improve outcomes in CKD have long been sought. The effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on discontinuation of RAS blockade has yet to be evaluated.

Methods

We conducted a joint analysis of canagliflozin and renal events in diabetes with established nephropathy clinical evaluation (CREDENCE) and dapagliflozin and prevention of adverse outcomes in CKD (DAPA-CKD), two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with albuminuric CKD. The main outcome was time to incident temporary or permanent discontinuation of RAS blockade, defined as interruption of an ACE inhibitor or ARB for at least 4 weeks or complete cessation during the double-blind on-treatment period. Cox regression analyses were used to estimate the treatment effects from each trial. Hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled with fixed effects meta-analysis to obtain summary treatment effects, overall and across key subgroups.

Results

During median follow-up of 2.2 years across both trials, 740 of 8483 (8.7%) patients discontinued RAS blockade. The relative risk for discontinuation of RAS blockade was 15% lower in patients randomized to receiving SGLT2 inhibitors (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.99), with consistent effects across trials (P -heterogeneity = 0.92). The relative effect on RAS blockade discontinuation was more pronounced among patients with baseline urinary albumin:creatinine ratio ≥ 1000 mg/g (pooled HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.94; P -heterogeneity = 0.009).

Conclusions

In patients with albuminuric CKD with and without type 2 diabetes, SGLT2 inhibitors facilitate the use of RAS blockade.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^9a32eac3]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker use in CKD — benefits, risks, and recommendation strength are summarized as follows: The benefits of using either an ACEI or ARB to slow the progression of CKD outweighed the potential harm of cough, angioedema, or hyperkalemia. ACEI and ARB should not be combined due to an increased risk of AKI and hyperkalemia, and clinicians should counsel patients about the possible teratogenic effects of ACEI and ARB. Therefore, it is categorized as Reviewed, Amended, the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was High, and thus the Work Group decided upon a Strong for recommendation.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^fd97b52e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Renin–angiotensin system blockade in diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) — given the proven cardiovascular benefits and shared properties of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in inhibiting the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), either type of agent should be strongly considered for people with diabetes and CKD because they reduce the risk of both cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and progression of kidney disease.

### Long-term effects of addition of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist to angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with diabetic nephropathy: a randomized clinical trial [^a9e02e46]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Addition of spironolactone (SPR) to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) might provide antiproteinuric effects beyond what is gained by either medication alone. This study was designed to assess the long-term efficacy of SPR/ARB combination in comparison with the standard ACE/ARB regimen in diabetic nephropathy.

Methods

In an open-label, parallel-group, single-center, randomized clinical trial (NCT01667614), 136 patients with diabetes and proteinuria, already treated with enalapril and losartan, were included. In 74 patients, ACE inhibitors were discontinued. After a wash-out period of 2 weeks, 25 mg SPR daily was initiated. The remainder of the patients (n = 62) received ACE inhibitors and ARBs as before. Patients were followed every 3 months for 18 months. During each visit, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), urinary albumin excretion (UAE), serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and serum potassium concentrations were determined.

Results

After 18 months, three patients in the SPR/ARB group developed asymptomatic hyperkalemia. SPR/ARB significantly reduced both systolic and diastolic BP (P < 0.001 and 0.001, respectively). SPR/ARB decreased UAE by 46, 72 and 59% after 3, 12 and 18 months, respectively. Compared with the continuation regimen, SPR/ARB was superior in UAE reduction (P = 0.017 after 18 months), independent of BP change. In both groups, eGFR declined significantly over the trial course and the decline rate did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusions

Addition of SPR to ARB provides added benefits with respect to BP control and proteinuria diminution. These antiproteinuric effects are not accompanied by prevention of eGFR loss compared with conventional therapy with ACE/ARB.

### Current management of chronic kidney disease in type-2 diabetes – A tiered approach: an overview of the joint association of British clinical diabetologists and UK kidney association (ABCD-UKKA) guidelines [^80981f2c]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2.1 Use of renin‐angiotensin blocking agents

Over and above the BP lowering effect, RASi, ACE inhibitor or ARBs further reduce the risk of progression of CKD. In the landmark RENAAL and IDNT trials, there was 16%–20% reduction in the risk of kidney disease progression, but a significant number of people studied had residual risk despite RASi. Furthermore, no significant reduction in CVD events was demonstrated in these trials. For maximum kidney protection, the dose of ACE inhibitor or ARB should be titrated up to the maximum tolerated, keeping an eye on serum potassium and creatinine.

Serum electrolytes and creatinine (eGFR) should be measured before starting and 1–2 week after starting or increasing the dose of RASi. A reduction in eGFR is anticipated after starting or increasing the dose of RASi. If the eGFR falls > 25%, stop the drug, repeat the test, and consider other causes, for example, volume depletion, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory use. If the reduction in eGFR is < 25%, we suggest continuing the drug and repeating the test in further 1–2 weeks. Similarly, a rise in serum potassium is expected with starting and increasing the dose of RASi. We suggest continuing the drug if the serum potassium is < 6.0 mmol/L, with dietary advice for lowering potassium containing food, and repeat the test in 1–2 week.

Dual RAS inhibition has not been shown to provide additional benefit and in fact may be detrimental in terms of risk of hyperkalaemia and deterioration in kidney function. As such, combining ACE inhibitor and ARB is discouraged. It is recommended that RAS blocking agents are temporarily stopped during periods of acute illness to prevent acute kidney injury. The STOP ACE trial has demonstrated that stopping RAS blocking agents in progressive CKD does not improve kidney outcomes and hence this class of agent should be continued in people with more advanced progressive CKD (eGFR, < 30 mL per min per 1.73 m 2.).

KDIGO 2021 blood pressure in chronic kidney disease — Practice Point 3.2.1 states that it may be reasonable to treat people with high BP, CKD, and no albuminuria, with or without diabetes, with RASi (ACEi or ARB); this rationale notes that patients with CKD, high BP, and no albuminuria are at lower risk of CKD progression, existing evidence does not demonstrate clear clinical benefits of RASi for CKD progression and other antihypertensive agents are as appropriate for BP management, though some patients may value CV protection and accept potential harms, particularly those with higher GFR and a relatively low risk of harm.

ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in diabetes with CKD — preferred indications and dosing emphasize albuminuria thresholds and use of maximum tolerated doses: ACE inhibitors or ARBs are the preferred first-line agents for blood pressure treatment among people with diabetes, hypertension, eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and UACR ≥ 300 mg/g [creatinine], and in the setting of lower levels of albuminuria (30–299 mg/g [creatinine]) therapy at maximum tolerated doses reduced progression to more advanced albuminuria (≥ 300 mg/g creatinine), slowed CKD progression, and reduced cardiovascular events but has not reduced progression to ESKD; while ACE inhibitors or ARBs are often prescribed for moderately increased albuminuria (30–299 mg/g [creatinine]) without hypertension, outcome trials have not been performed, and two long-term, double-blind studies demonstrated no renoprotective effect when initiated in people with normal albuminuria or hypertension alone without albuminuria; it is also noted that not maximizing these therapies due to creatinine rise concerns would not be considered optimal care and that trials used maximum tolerated doses, there are no studies demonstrating outcome benefits on both mortality and slowed CKD progression in people with diabetes who have an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, and when increases in serum creatinine reach 30% without associated hyperkalemia, RAS blockade should be continued.

### Early rapid decline in kidney function as a beneficial sign after starting antihypertensive medication [^6a023252]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Such effects have been shown in the trials of gliflozins to treat diabetes mellitus and reduce cardiovascular end points as well. 14, 15, 16 These inhibitors of the sodium‐dependent tubular glucose‐(re)transporter reduce osmotic pressure against the glomerular basement membrane by abandoning glucose reabsorption. Typically, patients receiving this new class of drugs experience modest early GFR decline, but a favorable renal outcome thereafter. Using gliflozins, the early GFR decrease is nowadays discussed as an advantageous sign of nephroprotection. 17 Following this reasoning, a growing clinical community might agree that there is no need to skip RAS blocker, antihypertensives, or gliflozins in all patients experiencing initial therapy‐induced GFR decrease. Instead, the key to find the appropriate treatment algorithm is to consider the particular clinical and pathophysiological situation. Only when GFR decrease is accompanied by significant and sustained systolic blood pressure decrease to < 110 mm Hg (eg, caused by hypovolemia with acute kidney failure), we recommend discontinuation of this medication until blood pressure has normalized. On the other hand, conditions associated with activated RAS (diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and nephrotic syndrome) do compose additional arguments to sustain RAS blockade. In any case, after getting through critical phases, to maintain or reconstitute such medication should be a prioritized goal. To answer the colleague′s opening web forum question: When a GFR decrease is certifiable, physicians should carefully monitor GFR and albuminuria (at least 3 months, following the presented study of Cooper et al 1). If albuminuria decreases, systemic blood pressure is not critically reduced, and no additional hypovolemia is present, most patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease are likely to restore their baseline function and to benefit from this mechanism of expedient reduced intraglomerular pressure in the long‐term.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^b4d0c25b]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 — CKD without diabetes and severely increased albuminuria (A3) — We recommend starting renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (RASi) (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] or angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB]) for people with high BP, CKD, and severely increased albuminuria (G1–G4, A3) without diabetes. (1B). Supporting evidence includes the Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) program: in REIN Stratum-2, a study of 166 patients with proteinuria ≥ 3 g per 24 hours, the monthly decline in GFR was significantly lower in the ramipril group (0.53 ml/min) than the placebo group (0.88 ml/min), and the composite of doubling of serum creatinine or ESKD occurred in 18 versus 40 participants (ramipril vs placebo, P = 0.02); in REIN Stratum-1 of 186 patients with proteinuria of > 1 to < 3 g/d, the decline in GFR was not different, but ESKD events were less with ramipril.

### Early rapid decline in kidney function as a beneficial sign after starting antihypertensive medication [^a8c9f9cb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

However, if initial worsening of kidney function after medication initiation is long‐term beneficial (and not only hazard free) has not been proved definitely in all RAS trials yet. This question looks like the key idea of the current post hoc CORAL trial analysis. Authors analyzed 359 patients from the medical therapy group for occurrence of rapid decline of renal function (at 3 and 6 months or at both time points) and what happened in 66 of these 359 patients (18%). They analyzed baseline parameters and further course of renal function (up to 5 years) for examination of risk factors associated with rapid decline. Baseline renal function, age, and logarithmic urine albumin/creatinine ratio discriminated between patients experiencing rapid decline at 3 or 6 months or not, and decline "was associated with an improvement in eGFR [estimated GFR] at 1‐year (6.9%, P = 0.04), as was baseline logarithmic urine albumine/creatinine ratio (−1.8%, P = 0.007), and baseline cystatin C (14.2%, P < 0.001)". 1 This is an intriguing effect, but does not answer the extended question, if GFR decline is advantageous compared with having no decline because patients in whom GFR declined were compared with their own baseline and not with the group in whom GFR did not decline. Moreover, nephroprotection exerted by reduced transmembrane glomerular pressure, as it is supposed in these patients, should be accompanied by reduced proteinuria, an issue that was not investigated in the study but is well known in clinical practice. Anyhow, the rapid declining group reconstituted their baseline function after a period of 6 to 12 months and up to a time period of 5 years in some patients. A complex, but important, figure providing GFR course in every single patient shows virtually no patient experiencing exaggerated GFR loss during follow‐up, despite declining from baseline to 3 or 6 months. Interestingly, few patients restored their baseline GFR as late as 2 years after decline. Other long‐term clinical outcomes (cardiovascular and renal death and cardiovascular events) were similar between GFR‐declining and nondeclining patients as well. The authors conclude "that patients continuing medical treatment after declining kidney function often experience a [later] improvement in kidney function" and take such proof to advise that an "early rapid GFR decline in renal function with medical treatment may not be an indication for stenting". Although this statement can be agreed on, a further issue of clinical relevance apart from the stenting question could be added: Without regard to endovascular therapy and although having a renal artery stenosis, decline of (excretory) renal function after initiation of medications affecting glomerular perfusion is not unfavorable per se. Physicians should consider that diminishing intraglomerular perfusion pressure (by RAS blockers or simply blood pressure reduction) might result in decreased GFR but at the same time may convey nephroprotective effects in the long run by reducing transmembrane glomerular injury.
