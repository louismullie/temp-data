## Question

Does having taller family members effect how tall your kids are even if you are ahort

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether having taller family members affects how tall your kids are, even if you are short. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the genetic architecture of height and how heritability shapes offspring stature. Then, I should verify how mid-parental height and family height distributions influence a child's expected height range. Next, I will examine whether a single short parent's child can still be tall due to other relatives' genes. After that, I should review exceptions and modifiers, including monogenic disorders and environmental effects. Finally, I will synthesize a probabilistic answer and note practical implications for counseling and evaluation [^113rHjN2].

> Let me first confirm the genetic foundation. Height is a classic polygenic trait with high heritability, meaning that much of the variation in adult stature is explained by the cumulative effect of many genetic variants across the genome, with modern estimates placing heritability roughly in the 0.7–0.8 range, and contemporary work continues to refine the architecture and direct genetic effects within families [^114Sptep] [^114Uztrg] [^112WRwGm].

> Wait, let me verify the practical clinical correlate of that heritability. The mid-parental height (MPH) calculation remains the most informative single predictor of a child's genetic height potential, explaining a substantial proportion of variance in adult height and outperforming early polygenic scores in many settings; the standard formulas are (mother's height + father's height + 5 inches)/2 for boys and (father's height + mother's height − 5 inches)/2 for girls, with a typical target range of MPH ± about 2 SD (roughly ± 10 cm), which clinicians use to contextualize a child's growth trajectory [^1117KriD] [^113rHjN2] [^115DqqKT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single short parent dictating the child's height. Because each parent transmits a random sample of their genome, a short parent may carry many height-promoting alleles that are not expressed in their own stature but can be passed on; thus, even when one parent is short, the child may inherit a taller genetic profile if the other parent or the broader family includes taller individuals, shifting the child's expected height upward within or even above the calculated target range [^112WRwGm] [^117A29rd].

> I should double-check the nuance about "family height" versus "parental height" only. Familial tallness and familial shortness are well-recognized entities in pediatrics; children can be tall because multiple relatives (grandparents, uncles/aunts, siblings) contribute height-promoting variants even when one parent is short, and conversely, children can be short when both parents and the extended family are short, which is why clinicians assess the family pattern rather than a single parent's stature in isolation [^113rHjN2] [^115sBm2U].

> But wait, what if the apparent "short parent" reflects a pathological cause rather than normal familial variation. I need to ensure we consider monogenic and syndromic causes of short stature (for example, SHOX haploinsufficiency, NPR2 variants, Turner syndrome) and overgrowth syndromes that can masquerade as familial tallness; these conditions can alter the expected transmission patterns and may warrant targeted genetic evaluation when the growth pattern or body proportions are atypical or when the child's height deviates markedly from the familial target range [^112PjcP3] [^112imWxn] [^111f1YDk] [^113rHjN2].

> Next, I should review environmental and developmental modifiers that can shift outcomes within genetic potential. Nutrition, chronic disease, and endocrine disorders can suppress growth, while obesity and early puberty can accelerate early growth and increase near-term stature; importantly, parental heights should be measured rather than reported when possible because misreporting can distort MPH and misclassify a child's genetic potential, and bone age assessment helps distinguish constitutional delay from pathological short stature when growth velocity is slow [^113rHjN2] [^11263sZ9] [^111z9NH2].

> Let me synthesize the answer carefully. Yes, having taller family members can meaningfully increase the likelihood that your children will be taller, even if you are short, because height is polygenic and mid-parental height reflects the broader familial genetic background; a child's expected height is a probabilistic range around MPH, and with taller relatives contributing alleles, the child may fall at or above the upper end of that range, though outcomes remain variable due to the random assortment of parental genomes and environmental influences [^114Sptep] [^1117KriD] [^113rHjN2].

> I should confirm the clinical implications. In practice, we counsel families using MPH and the family pattern, monitor growth velocity on standardized charts, and consider further evaluation if the child's height or growth pattern deviates beyond about 2 SD from the familial target or if there are red flags such as disproportion, dysmorphic features, or abnormal velocity; when assessing a child's growth, we also remember that stated parental heights are often inaccurate, so we prefer measured heights to avoid misclassification of genetic potential [^113rHjN2] [^116mnYGF] [^11263sZ9].

---

Yes, having taller family members can increase a child's height potential even if the parents are short, because **height is polygenic** [^114Sptep] and shaped by many relatives' genes, not just the parents' [^111DUkuU]. A child's expected height is best estimated by the **mid-parental height** [^1117KriD] plus the family pattern, so if grandparents, aunts/uncles, or cousins are tall, the child may inherit those taller alleles and grow taller than the parents. Environmental factors (nutrition, health, and hormones) also matter, but **genetics from the broader family can shift a child's height upward** even when the parents are short.

---

## Genetic inheritance of height

- **Polygenic trait**: Height is controlled by many genes, each with small effects, creating a wide range of possible heights [^114Sptep].

- **Mid-parental height**: A child's expected height is often close to the average of the parents' heights, but this is an estimate, not a strict rule [^1117KriD].

- **Broader family influence**: Genes from grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins can contribute to a child's height, even if the parents are short [^notfound].

---

## Influence of taller family members

- **Genetic variation**: Taller relatives may carry alleles that increase height, which can be passed to children even if the parents are shorter [^notfound].

- **Recessive genes**: Some height-increasing alleles may be recessive and not expressed in parents but can appear in children [^116r6rBR].

- **Polygenic inheritance**: The combined effect of many height-increasing alleles from relatives can significantly raise a child's height potential [^111QqBSu].

---

## Environmental factors

Environmental factors also shape height: **nutrition** — especially early childhood intake of protein, vitamins, and minerals — supports optimal growth, while **overall health**, including chronic illness or hormonal disorders, can limit it. Socioeconomic status influences access to nutrition and healthcare, thereby affecting growth outcomes [^1179YMwo].

---

## Statistical evidence

Studies show that **family height strongly predicts child height**, with correlations around 0.6–0.8. Children with taller grandparents or other relatives are more likely to be taller than their parents, reflecting the influence of the broader family genome [^1117KriD].

---

## Clinical implications

Clinicians use **mid-parental height** and family height patterns to estimate a child's growth potential. If a child is significantly shorter than expected for the family, further evaluation may be warranted [^116mnYGF].

---

## Conclusion

Even if parents are short, having taller relatives can increase a child's height potential through **polygenic inheritance** and environmental factors. Height is a complex trait; **genetics from the broader family can shift a child's height upward** even when the parents are short.

### Investigation and management of tall stature [^115sBm2U]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Referral for an assessment of tall stature is much less common than for short stature. Although the commonest cause is an underlying familial tendency to tallness, there are important disorders that should be considered at the initial assessment. Distinguishing these conditions from normal variations of growth is the key objective when managing the child and family. In some children, further targeted investigations will be needed and in rare instances intervention to limit final height may be appropriate. This article discusses a structured approach to the assessment and management of a child with tall stature.

### How short is too short according to parents of primary care patients [^115VjY2E]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Height is a physical trait on a continuum. The threshold between normal and abnormal is arbitrarily set but can potentially influence medical decision-making. We sought to examine parents' perceptions of adult heights and associated demographic factors.

Methods

Parents of pediatric primary care patients of various heights completed a one-time survey. Parents answered the question "How short is too short?" for adult males and females. The results were summarized as median [interquartile range]. Factors significantly associated with height threshold by simple linear regression were included in a multivariable mixed effects analysis of covariance model.

Results

A total of 1,820 surveys were completed (83% response rate; 1,587 females, 231 males). The median threshold height deemed too short for adult females was 56 inches [48, 59] among male respondents and 57 inches [50, 60] among females (P < .05). The median threshold height for adult males was 61 inches among males [60, 64] and females [59, 66] (P < .05). The median of male minus female heights per respondent (delta heights) was 5 [2, 7] inches. Factors found to be significant main effects in a parsimonious model were sex of the adult considered, height of respondent, sex of respondent, respondent race, primary care practice, income, and having concerns about their child's height.

Conclusion

Taller acceptable height thresholds were perceived by respondents who were taller, wealthier, white, female, from nonurban practices, or who had a personal concern about their child's height. Male heights were expected to be taller than female heights. Such traits may influence who is concerned and more likely to seek medical treatment for their children.

### Within-sibship genome-wide association analyses decrease bias in estimates of direct genetic effects [^111DUkuU]. Nature Genetics (2022). High credibility.

Estimates from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of unrelated individuals capture effects of inherited variation (direct effects), demography (population stratification, assortative mating) and relatives (indirect genetic effects). Family-based GWAS designs can control for demographic and indirect genetic effects, but large-scale family datasets have been lacking. We combined data from 178,086 siblings from 19 cohorts to generate population (between-family) and within-sibship (within-family) GWAS estimates for 25 phenotypes. Within-sibship GWAS estimates were smaller than population estimates for height, educational attainment, age at first birth, number of children, cognitive ability, depressive symptoms and smoking. Some differences were observed in downstream SNP heritability, genetic correlations and Mendelian randomization analyses. For example, the within-sibship genetic correlation between educational attainment and body mass index attenuated towards zero. In contrast, analyses of most molecular phenotypes (for example, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) were generally consistent. We also found within-sibship evidence of polygenic adaptation on taller height. Here, we illustrate the importance of family-based GWAS data for phenotypes influenced by demographic and indirect genetic effects.

### Final height prediction in constitutional growth delay [^111egFPU]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Methods to predict the final stature of children are commonly used in pediatric endocrinology since one of the questions that parents have about their short children is how tall he or she will be as an adult. There is a disparity between what the family wants and what the physician expects from a height prediction, and what is available. The family wants an accurate prediction of final height for their child. What the physician expects is a well-validated and accurate technique applicable to individual children and that can be trusted for use, not just with normally growing children, but also with children exhibiting abnormal growth. Unfortunately, what is available from the generally used height prediction methods are estimates, with fairly broad error limits, based on groups of normal children followed to adult height. The underlying problem in predicting final height is that there is considerable individual variation in the timing and tempo of puberty and the pubertal growth spurt in individual children which significantly impacts the validity of the techniques when applied to individual children. This article reviews the methods of height prediction that are available, and their limitations.

### The treatment of parental height as a biological factor in studies of birth weight and childhood growth [^1154pC2X]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Parental height is frequently treated as a biological variable in studies of birth weight and childhood growth. Elimination of social variables from multivariate models including parental height as a biological variable leads researchers to conclude that social factors have no independent effect on the outcome. This paper challenges the treatment of parental height as a biological variable, drawing on extensive evidence for the determination of adult height through a complex interaction of genetic and social factors. The paper firstly seeks to establish the importance of social factors in the determination of height. The methodological problems associated with treatment of parental height as a purely biological variable are then discussed, illustrated by data from published studies and by analysis of data from the 1958 National Childhood Development Study (NCDS). The paper concludes that a framework for studying pathways to pregnancy and childhood outcomes needs to take account of the complexity of the relation between genetic and social factors and be able to account for the effects of multiple risk factors acting cumulatively across time and across generations. Illustrations of these approaches are given using NCDS data.

### Genetic testing of children with familial tall stature: is it worth doing? [^111f1YDk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Familial tall stature (FTS) is considered to be a benign variant of growth with a presumed polygenic etiology. However, monogenic disorders with possible associated pathological features could also be hidden under the FTS phenotype.

Objective

To elucidate the genetic etiology in families with FTS and to describe their phenotype in detail.

Methods

Children with FTS (the life-maximum height in both the child and his/her taller parent > 2 SD for age and sex) referred to the Endocrinology center of Motol University Hospital were enrolled into the study. Their DNA was examined cytogenetically and via a next-generation sequencing panel of 786 genes associated with growth. The genetic results were evaluated by the American College of Molecular Genetics and Genomics guidelines. All of the participants underwent standard endocrinological examination followed by specialized anthropometric evaluation.

Results

In total, 34 children (19 girls) with FTS were enrolled in the study. Their median height and their taller parent's height were 3.1 SD and 2.5 SD, respectively. The genetic cause of FTS was elucidated in 11/34 (32.4%) children (47, XXX and 47, XYY karyotypes, SHOX duplication, and causative variants in NSD1 [in 2], SUZ12 [in 2], FGFR3, CHD8, GPC3, and PPP2R5D genes). Ten children had absent syndromic signs and 24 had dysmorphic features.

Conclusion

Monogenic (and cytogenetic) etiology of FTS can be found among children with FTS. Genetic examination should be considered in all children with FTS regardless of the presence of dysmorphic features.

### Investigation and management of short stature [^11495FEC]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Paediatricians need to develop a strategy for assessing and managing the short child because it is a common reason for referral to paediatric services. Understanding what is normal is a key prerequisite to the appropriate assessment of the short child. Most pathological causes of short stature will be associated with clues in the history or on examination. Factors that should trigger a more detailed assessment of the short child include malaise, dysmorphic features, slow growth and small size with a normal weight centile. Establishing that the healthy short child is growing appropriately for their family size can be reassuring for the family and clinician and will facilitate discharge.

### A genetic approach to evaluation of short stature of undetermined cause [^112PjcP3]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Short stature is a common presentation to paediatric endocrinologists. After exclusion of major endocrine or systemic disease, most children with short stature are diagnosed based on a description of their growth pattern and the height of their parents (eg, familial short stature). Height is a polygenic trait and genome-wide association studies have identified many of the associated genetic loci. Here we review the application of genetic studies, including copy number variant analysis, targeted gene panels, and whole-exome sequencing in children with idiopathic short stature. We estimate 25–40% of children diagnosed with idiopathic short stature could receive a molecular diagnosis using these technologies. A molecular diagnosis for short stature is important for affected individuals and their families and might inform treatment decisions surrounding use of growth hormone or insulin-like growth factor 1 therapy.

### Maternal height and child growth patterns [^1156cMWF]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine associations between maternal height and child growth during 4 developmental periods: intrauterine, birth to age 2 years, age 2 years to mid-childhood (MC), and MC to adulthood.

Study Design

Pooled analysis of maternal height and offspring growth using 7630 mother-child pairs from 5 birth cohorts (Brazil, Guatemala, India, the Philippines, and South Africa). We used conditional height measures that control for collinearity in height across periods. We estimated associations between maternal height and offspring growth using multivariate regression models adjusted for household income, child sex, birth order, and study site.

Results

Maternal height was associated with birth weight and with both height and conditional height at each age examined. The strongest associations with conditional heights were for adulthood and 2 years of age. A 1-cm increase in maternal height predicted a 0.024 (95% CI: 0.021–0.028) SD increase in offspring birth weight, a 0.037 (95% CI: 0.033–0.040) SD increase in conditional height at 2 years, a 0.025 (95% CI: 0.021–0.029 SD increase in conditional height in MC, and a 0.044 (95% CI: 0.040–0.048) SD increase in conditional height in adulthood. Short mothers (< 150.1 cm) were more likely to have a child who was stunted at 2 years (prevalence ratio = 3.20 (95% CI: 2.80–3.60) and as an adult (prevalence ratio = 4.74, (95% CI: 4.13–5.44). There was no evidence of heterogeneity by site or sex.

Conclusion

Maternal height influences offspring linear growth over the growing period. These influences likely include genetic and non-genetic factors, including nutrition-related intergenerational influences on growth that prevent the attainment of genetic height potential in low- and middle-income countries.

### Growing up with idiopathic short stature: psychosocial development and hormone treatment; a critical review [^116yGUuZ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2006). Low credibility.

To facilitate decisions on interventions in medically referred children with idiopathic short stature, the research on psychosocial functioning of these children, possible risk and protective factors influencing adaptation, and effects of hormone treatment were reviewed. Parents ranked the behaviour of their children on average between normal and below normal. The magnitude of these deviations varied from small to large. Little is known about the children's self-perceived psychosocial functioning. Some risk factors were found: being teased, being juvenilised, being a boy, having a younger but taller sibling, low intelligence, and low socioeconomic status. There have been few studies on the impact of protective factors including temperament, coping strategies, and social support. On average, hormone treatment did not improve psychosocial functioning. The research shows the advantages and disadvantages of hormone treatment that must be considered when choosing a suitable intervention. It is suggested that psychosocial adjustment can be improved by focusing on factors other than height alone.

### Parental concerns on short stature: a 15-year follow-up [^114bCcLd]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare parental attitudes about short stature over time and determine possible factors that predict changes in attitudes.

Study Design

At baseline (1993–1994), we surveyed parents about their attitudes regarding their children's height. We compared parents of children (aged 4–15 years) referred to endocrinologists (referred, 154) with those of children with heights < 10th percentile seen by pediatricians during regular visits (control, 240). At follow-up (2008–2009), 103 control and 98 referred parents completed a similar survey. We then made a logistic regression analysis to observe changes in perception. Primary variables included self-esteem, treatment by peers, and ability to cope with current height.

Results

At baseline, referred parents perceived a worse impact of short stature on their children than did controls. At follow-up, instead, referred parents were 3.8 times more likely to report improvement in self-esteem, 2.4 times more likely to report improved treatment from peers, and 5.7 times more likely to report overall ability to cope with height than were unreferred parents. Perception of psychosocial improvement was greater in the referred than the control group. Referral was a stronger predictor of an improved follow-up response than patients' current height or change in height.

Conclusions

While incorporating parental attitudes into management decisions, clinicians should be aware that parental perceptions may change over time and that referral itself may lead parents to perceive psychosocial improvements over time.

### Predicting human height by victorian and genomic methods [^1117KriD]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

In the Victorian era, Sir Francis Galton showed that 'when dealing with the transmission of stature from parents to children, the average height of the two parents,… is all we need care to know about them' (1886). One hundred and twenty-two years after Galton's work was published, 54 loci showing strong statistical evidence for association to human height were described, providing us with potential genomic means of human height prediction. In a population-based study of 5748 people, we find that a 54-loci genomic profile explained 4–6% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and had limited ability to discriminate tall/short people, as characterized by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). In a family-based study of 550 people, with both parents having height measurements, we find that the Galtonian mid-parental prediction method explained 40% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and showed high discriminative accuracy. We have also explored how much variance a genomic profile should explain to reach certain AUC values. For highly heritable traits such as height, we conclude that in applications in which parental phenotypic information is available (eg, medicine), the Victorian Galton's method will long stay unsurpassed, in terms of both discriminative accuracy and costs. For less heritable traits, and in situations in which parental information is not available (eg, forensics), genomic methods may provide an alternative, given that the variants determining an essential proportion of the trait's variation can be identified.

### Final height in patients with constitutional delay of growth and development from tall statured families [^117A29rd]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Constitutional delay of growth and development occurs not only in children of short statured families but also in children of tall statured families. We represent the final height from 12 boys and 21 girls cared for CDGD. The mean target height for boys was 186.6 cm and for girls 173.6 cm and final heights were 191.2 and 176.9 cm, respectively. The final height of 14 patients exceeded the mean target height by more than 4 cm, nine patients exceeded the familial target height range. Only one boy did not reach the familial target height range. We conclude that CDGD occurs in equal quantities in boys and in girls irrespective of the familial height score and will lead to normal final heights within the familial target height range. In general, no therapy is necessary to alter the progression of CDGD.

### Height assessments in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^114LrrQF]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Previous studies have suggested that children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are shorter than their unaffected counterparts. Unfortunately, these reports did not consider other contributing factors that might also influence short stature. The purpose of the current study was to characterize the genetic influence of NF1 on the growth of children. Height data were measured and recorded for 170 patients, whereas parental measurements were obtained for 61 patients to calculate sex-corrected mid-parental target heights. Children with NF1 had population mean height and mid-parental height z scores statistically different from the general population. Importantly, these differences were pronounced when neither parent had NF1 but were not significant when one of the parents had NF1. Moreover, height z scores for children with NF1 were also statistically different than their unaffected siblings. Collectively, these data establish a clear effect of a germline NF1 gene mutation on stature in children with NF1.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^111Lmwj2]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Children at increased risk for overweight and obesity — evidence overview: Certain populations of children who are of normal weight are at risk for developing overweight and obesity as they grow older, and epidemiologic associations suggest that primary care providers should be alert to increasing BMI trends and excessive weight gain beyond what is anticipated for height increase or pubertal change and should consider intervention before the child becomes overweight. From observational studies summarized for these Guidelines, sample populations at special risk include children with BMI between the 85th and 95th percentiles and children in whom there is a positive family history of obesity in one or both parents.

### A polygenic risk score to predict future adult short stature among children [^114LhHg9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Adult height is highly heritable, yet no genetic predictor has demonstrated clinical utility compared to mid-parental height.

Objective

To develop a polygenic risk score for adult height and evaluate its clinical utility.

Design

A polygenic risk score was constructed based on meta-analysis of genomewide association studies and evaluated on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort.

Subjects

Participants included 442 599 genotyped White British individuals in the UK Biobank and 941 genotyped child-parent trios of European ancestry in the ALSPAC cohort.

Interventions

None.

Main Outcome Measures

Standing height was measured using stadiometer; Standing height 2 SDs below the sex-specific population average was considered as short stature.

Results

Combined with sex, a polygenic risk score captured 71.1% of the total variance in adult height in the UK Biobank. In the ALSPAC cohort, the polygenic risk score was able to identify children who developed adulthood short stature with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.84, which is close to that of mid-parental height. Combining this polygenic risk score with mid-parental height or only one of the child's parent's height could improve the AUROC to at most 0.90. The polygenic risk score could also substitute mid-parental height in age-specific Khamis-Roche height predictors and achieve an equally strong discriminative power in identifying children with a short stature in adulthood.

Conclusions

A polygenic risk score could be considered as an alternative or adjunct to mid-parental height to improve screening for children at risk of developing short stature in adulthood in European ancestry populations.

### Height matters-from monogenic disorders to normal variation [^115bBcQF]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Height is a classic polygenic quantitative trait with a high level of heritability. As it is a simple and stable parameter to measure, height is a model for both common, complex disorders and monogenic, Mendelian disease. In this Review, we examine height from the perspective of monogenic and complex genetics and discuss the lessons learned so far. We explore several examples of rare sequence variants with large effects on height and compare these variants to the common variants identified in genome-wide association studies that have small effects on height. We discuss how copy number changes or genetic interactions might contribute to the unidentified aspects of the heritability of height. We also ask whether information derived from genome-wide association studies on specific loci in the vicinity of genes can be used for further research in clinical paediatric endocrinology. Furthermore, we address key challenges that remain for gene discovery and for the transition of moving from genomic localization to mechanistic insights, with an emphasis on using next-generation sequencing to identify causative variants of people at the extremes of height distribution.

### Evaluation of short and tall stature in children [^113rHjN2]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Short stature is defined as height that is more than 2 standard deviations below the mean height for age; tall stature is defined as height that is more than 2 standard deviations above the mean height for age. The initial evaluation of short and tall stature should include obtaining a comprehensive history, performing a physical examination, plotting serial height measurements on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or World Health Organization growth charts, calculating estimated adult height and comparing it with midparental height, determining bone age, and laboratory testing in select patients. The most common causes of short stature are constitutional delay of growth and puberty, familial short stature, and idiopathic short stature. Pathologic etiologies are less common and include nutritional deficiencies, systemic disease, growth hormone deficiencies, and genetic abnormalities. Common causes of tall stature include constitutional advancement of growth, familial tall stature, and obesity. Uncommon etiologies of tall stature include precocious puberty, Marfan syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome. Referral to pediatric endocrinology is indicated in patients with idiopathic short stature for management of select genetic and metabolic conditions and for interventions to correct growth.

### Children's psychosocial functioning and parents' quality of life in paediatric short stature: the mediating role of caregiving stress [^113YqtbQ]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

On the basis of the multidimensional model of the caregiving process, this study aimed (a) to compare the levels of quality of life (QoL) and psychological problems of children with short stature and the levels of caregiving stress and QoL of their parents, between diagnostic, treatment, and current height deviation groups, and (b) to examine the direct and indirect links, via caregiving stress, between children's psychosocial functioning and their parents' QoL.

Method

The sample was collected in 5 European countries and comprised 238 dyads of 8- to 18-year-old children and adolescents with a clinical diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency or idiopathic short stature and one of their parents. The children completed self-report measures of height-related QoL (Quality of Life in Short Stature Youth Core Module) and psychological problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire); the parents reported on their own QoL (EUROHIS-QOL-8 Index) and caregiving stress (Quality of Life in Short Stature Youth Effects on Parents subscale).

Results

Children who were treated and who achieved normal height reported better QoL compared to those untreated and with current short stature. Parents of children with idiopathic short stature and current short stature presented greater caregiving stress than parents of children with growth hormone deficiency and achieved normal height. Children's better psychosocial functioning was indirectly associated with parents' better QoL, via less caregiving stress, and these links were invariant across diagnoses, treatment status, and current height deviation.

Conclusions

These results suggest that, along with growth hormone treatments, multidisciplinary interventions in paediatric endocrinology should be family-centred, by targeting both the children's psychosocial functioning and the parents' stress, in order to improve individual and family adaptation.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^112TNLDX]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Children at increased risk for overweight and obesity — observational studies identify certain normal-weight children who are at risk as they grow older, and epidemiologic associations suggest that primary care providers should be alert to increasing body mass index (BMI) trends and excessive weight gain beyond what is anticipated for height increase or pubertal change and should consider intervention before the child becomes overweight. Populations at special risk include children with BMI between the 85th and 95th percentiles and children with a positive family history of obesity in one or both parents.

### Recent progress in the study of the genetics of height [^116RREX2]. Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Adult height is a classic polygenic trait of high narrow-sense heritability (h² = 0.8). In the late nineteenth to early twentieth century, variation in adult height was used as a model to set the foundation of the fields of statistics and quantitative genetics. More recently, with our increasing knowledge concerning the extent of genetic variation in the human genome, human geneticists have used genome-wide association studies to identify hundreds of loci robustly associated with adult height, providing new insights into human growth and development, and into the architecture of complex human traits. In this review, I highlight the progress made in the last 2 years in understanding how genetic variation controls height variation in humans, including non-Caucasian populations and children.

### Short stature for the general pediatrician [^114wkExu]. Pediatrics in Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Short stature (SS) is among the most common reasons for referral to a pediatric endocrinology clinic, particularly in urban areas. An appropriate medical history, including family history with measurement of the parents, an evaluation of the growth chart, an appropriate review of systems and physical exam, and determining the bone age, will allow the clinician to have a clear understanding of the reason(s) why the child is short. Familial SS and constitutional delay of growth are the most common causes of short stature. Children who are small for gestational age, whose height are not normal by age 2 years, and have dysmorphic features or abnormal body proportions should have an evaluation for genetic causes of SS. Children with abnormal growth velocity should be evaluated for endocrinopathies, inflammatory conditions, intestinal malabsorption, environmental factors, and/or chromosome mosaicism. Treatment of the identified cause should restore normal growth. Growth hormone treatment is only required by a minority of patients with SS.

### Validation of the Greek version of the quality of life in short stature youth (QoLISSY) questionnaire [^117CHAMC]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Background The Quality of Life in Short Stature Youth (QoLISSY) questionnaire is a condition-specific instrument for measuring the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in short statured children/adolescents from patients' and parents' perspectives. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the Greek version of the QoLISSY questionnaire. Methods The original European QoLISSY scales were translated into Greek following the guidelines for linguistic validation and applied to 184 dyads of children 8–18 years old and their parents, as well as to 14 parents of children 4–7 years old in Greece. The field testing responses to the Greek version of QoLISSY were analyzed. Results The qualitative analysis of the Greek data provided results consistent with the European sample. The subsequent field test showed acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach α between 0.67–0.93) and high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients [ICC] ≥ 0.70). Correlations with the generic KIDSCREEN questionnaire indicated good convergent validity. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) also yielded acceptable results. Higher HRQoL for taller children suggests that QoLISSY was able to detect significant height-related differences. Conclusions The Greek version of the QoLISSY questionnaire is psychometrically sound and its use is recommended in further clinical research to ascertain the impact of short stature (SS) and treatments in Greek children/adolescents and families.

### Evaluation of short and tall stature in children [^11288WWv]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Short stature is defined as a height more than two standard deviations below the mean for age (less than the 3rd percentile). Tall stature is defined as a height more than two standard deviations above the mean for age (greater than the 97th percentile). The initial evaluation of short and tall stature should include a history and physical examination, accurate serial measurements, and determination of growth velocity, midparental height, and bone age. Common normal variants of short stature are familial short stature, constitutional delay of growth and puberty, and idiopathic short stature. Pathologic causes of short stature include chronic diseases; growth hormone deficiency; and genetic disorders, such as Turner syndrome. Tall stature has the same prevalence as short stature, but it is a much less common reason for referral to subspecialty care. Common causes of tall stature include familial tall stature, obesity, Klinefelter syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and precocious puberty. Although most children with short or tall stature have variants of normal growth, children who are more than three standard deviations from the mean for age are more likely to have underlying pathology. Evaluation for pathologic etiologies is guided by history and physical examination findings.

### Inaccuracy of stated versus measured parental heights [^11263sZ9]. Clinical Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Routine measurement of children's height is essential in monitoring for deviations in normal growth velocity. Target adult height of children is estimated by determining an adjusted midparental height. Such determinations are dependent on the accurate acquisition of parental height. Incorrect assessment of parental height will result in inaccurate expectations for the child's height. To observe the difference between stated and measured parental heights within a United States subspecialty setting, prospective acquisition of parental stated and measured heights during the summer months of 2000 and 2001 was examined. Two hundred and thirty-eight parents, 185 mothers and 53 fathers, were measured. The mean values of the stated heights for mothers and fathers were 163.7 cm ± 6.3 cm and 177.1 cm ± 8.6 cm, respectively. The corresponding measured heights were 163.0 cm ± 5.9 cm and 175.2 cm ± 6.6 cm, respectively. The mean height difference for mothers was 0.69 cm (p < 0.001) while the mean height difference for fathers was 1.90 cm (p < 0.001). Parents significantly overestimate their height in a clinical setting. Fathers overestimate to a greater degree than mothers. These findings emphasize the need to obtain height measurement of parents along with that of their children in assessing for linear growth delay.

### Evaluation of short and tall stature in children [^11724f2b]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Children and adolescents whose heights and growth velocities deviate from the normal percentiles on standard growth charts present a special challenge to physicians. Height that is less than the 3rd percentile or greater than the 97th percentile is deemed short or tall stature, respectively. A growth velocity outside the 25th to 75th percentile range may be considered abnormal. Serial height measurements over time documented on a growth chart are key in identifying abnormal growth. Short or tall stature is usually caused by variants of a normal growth pattern, although some patients may have serious underlying pathologies. A comprehensive history and physical examination can help differentiate abnormal growth patterns from normal variants and identify specific dysmorphic features of genetic syndromes. History and physical examination findings should guide laboratory testing.

### Family pediatrics: report of the task force on the family [^114AkkS7]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

WHY A TASK FORCE ON THE FAMILY? The practice of pediatrics is unique among medical specialties in many ways, among which is the nearly certain presence of a parent when health care services are provided for the patient. Regardless of whether parents or other family members are physically present, their influence is pervasive. Families are the most central and enduring influence in children's lives. Parents are also central in pediatric care. The health and well-being of children are inextricably linked to their parents' physical, emotional and social health, social circumstances, and child-rearing practices. The rising incidence of behavior problems among children attests to some families' inability to cope with the increasing stresses they are experiencing and their need for assistance. When a family's distress finds its voice in a child's symptoms, pediatricians are often parents' first source for help. There is enormous diversity among families-diversity in the composition of families, in their ethnic and racial heritage, in their religious and spiritual orientation, in how they communicate, in the time they spend together, in their commitment to individual family members, in their connections to their community, in their experiences, and in their ability to adapt to stress. Within families, individuals are different from one another as well. Pediatricians are especially sensitive to differences among children-in their temperaments and personalities, in their innate and learned abilities, and in how they view themselves and respond to the world around them. It is remarkable and a testament to the effort of parents and to the resilience of children that most families function well and most children succeed in life. Family life in the United States has been subjected to extensive scrutiny and frequent commentary, yet even when those activities have been informed by research, they tend to be influenced by personal experience within families and by individual and cultural beliefs about how society and family life ought to be. The process of formulating recommendations for pediatric practice, public policy, professional education, and research requires reaching consensus on some core values and principles about family life and family functioning as they affect children, knowing that some philosophic disagreements will remain unresolved. The growing multicultural character of the country will likely heighten awareness of our diversity. Many characteristics of families have changed during the past 3 to 5 decades. Families without children younger than 18 years have increased substantially, and they are now the majority. The average age at marriage has increased, and a greater proportion of births is occurring to women older than 30 years. Between 1970 and 2000, the proportion of children in 2-parent families decreased from 85% to 69%, and more than one quarter (26%) of all children live with a single parent, usually their mother. Most of this change reflects a dramatic increase in the rate of births to unmarried women that went from 5.3% in 1960 to 33.2% in 2000. Another factor in this change is a slowly decreasing but still high divorce rate that is roughly double what it was in the mid-1950s. Family income is strongly related to children's health, and the financial resources that families have available are closely tied to changes in family structure. Family income in real dollars has trended up for many decades, but the benefits have not been shared equally. For example, the median income of families with married parents has increased by 146% since 1970, but female-headed households have experienced a growth of 131%. More striking is that in 2000, the median income of female-headed households was only 47% of that of married-couple families and only 65% of that of families with 2 married parents in which the wife was not employed. Not surprising, the proportion of children who live in poverty is approximately 5 times greater for female-headed families than for married-couple families. The comped families than for married-couple families. The composition of children's families and the time parents have for their children affect child rearing. Consequent to the increase in female-headed households, rising economic and personal need, and increased opportunities for women, the proportion of mothers who are in the workforce has climbed steadily over the past several decades. Currently, approximately two thirds of all mothers with children younger than 18 years are employed. Most families with young children depend on child care, and most child care is not of good quality. Reliance on child care involves longer days for children and families, the stress imposed by schedules and created by transitions, exposure to infections, and considerable cost. An increasing number and proportion of parents are also devoting time previously available to their children to the care of their own parents. The so-called "sandwich generation" of parents is being pulled in multiple directions. The amount and use of family time also has changed with a lengthening workday, including the amount of commuting time necessary to travel between work and home, and with the intrusion of television and computers into family life. In public opinion polls, most parents report that they believe it is more difficult to be a parent now than it used to be; people seem to feel more isolated, social and media pressures on and enticements of their children seem greater, and the world seems to be a more dangerous place. Social and public policy has not kept up with these changes, leaving families stretched for time and stressed to cope and meet their responsibilities. What can and what should pediatrics do to help families raise healthy and well-adjusted children? How can individual pediatricians better support families? FAMILY PEDIATRICS: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Board of Directors appointed the Task Force on the Family to help guide the development of public policy and recommend how to assist pediatricians to promote well-functioning families (see Appendix). The magnitude of the assigned work required task force members to learn a great deal from research and researchers in the fields of social and behavioral sciences. A review of some critical literature was completed by a consultant to the task force and accompanies this report. That review identified a convergence of pediatrics and research on families by other disciplines. The task force found that a great deal is known about family functioning and family circumstances that affect children. With this knowledge, it is possible to provide pediatric care in a way that promotes successful families and good outcomes for children. The task force refers to that type of care as "family-oriented care" or "family pediatrics" and strongly endorses policies and practices that promote the adoption of this 2-generational approach as a hallmark of pediatrics. During the past decade, family advocates have successfully promoted family-centered care, "the philosophies, principles and practices that put the family at the heart or center of services; the family as the driving force". Most pediatricians report that they involve families in the decision making regarding the health care of their child and make an effort to understand the needs of the family as well as the child. Family pediatrics, like family-centered care, requires an active, productive partnership between the pediatrician and the family. But family pediatrics extends the responsibilities of the pediatrician to include screening, assessment, and referral of parents for physical, emotional, or social problems or health risk behaviors that can adversely affect the health and emotional or social well-being of their child. FAMILY CONTEXT OF CHILD HEALTH: The power and importance of families to children arises out of the extended duration for which children are dependent on adults to meet their basic needs. Children's needs for which only a family can provide include social support, socialization, and coping and life skills. Their self-esteem grows from being cared for, loved, and valued and feeling that they are part of a social unit that shares values, communicates openly, and provides companionship. Families transmit and interpret values to their children and often serve as children's connection to the larger world, especially during the early years of life. Although schools provide formal education, families teach children how to get along in the world. Often, efforts to discuss families and make recommendations regarding practice or policy stumble over disagreements about the definition of a family. The task force recognized the diversity of families and chose not to operate from the position of a fixed definition. Rather, the task force, which was to address pediatrics, decided to frame its deliberations and recommendations around the functions of families and how various aspects of the family context influence child rearing and child health. One model of family functioning that implicitly guided the task force is the family stress model (Fig 1). Stress of various sorts (eg, financial or health problems, lack of social support, unhappiness at work, unfortunate life events) can cause parents emotional distress and cause couples conflict and difficulty with their relationship. These responses to stress then disrupt parenting and the interactions between parent and child and can lead to short-term or lasting poor outcomes. The earlier these events transpire and the longer that the disruption lasts, the worse the outcomes for children. The task force favors efforts to encourage and support marriage yet recognizes that every family constellation can produce good outcomes for children and that none is certain to yield bad ones.

### A major gene model of adult height is suggested in Chinese [^116r6rBR]. Journal of Human Genetics (2004). Low credibility.

Adult height (stature), as a complex quantitative trait, has been studied in different populations. However, few genetic studies on height were performed on the Chinese, the largest population in the world. In this study, familial correlation and segregation analyses were carried out for adult height in a Chinese sample composed of 385 nuclear families with a total of 1,169 informative individuals. The results suggest that a major gene with a recessive effect accounts for about 17.2% of the total adult height variation in the Chinese. Significant familial residual effects are found. The heritability (± SE) of height is estimated to be 0.647 (± 0.122). This study, for the first time, provides evidence for the high degree of genetic determination of adult height in the Chinese population and furnishes a valuable reference for further mapping and identification of adult height genes in the Chinese.

### Accuracy of self-reported height measurements in parents and its effect on mid-parental target height calculation [^111z9NH2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical determination of mid-parental height is an important part of the assessment of a child's growth, however our clinical impression has been that parents cannot be relied upon to accurately report their own heights. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the accuracy of parental height self-reporting and its effect on calculated mid-parental target height for children presenting to a pediatric endocrinology office.

Methods

All parents bringing their children for an initial evaluation to a pediatric endocrinology clinic over a period of nine months were questioned and then measured by a pediatric endocrinologist. Parents were blinded to the study. Mid-parental target heights, based on reported and actual height were compared.

Results

There were 241 families: 98 fathers and 217 mothers in our study. Mean measured paternal height was 173.2 cm, self reported 174.9 cm (p < 0.0001), partner reported 177 cm (p = 0.0004). Only 50% of fathers and 58% of mothers reported their height within ± 2 cm of their measured height, while 15% of fathers and 12% of mothers were inaccurate by more than 4 cm. Mean measured maternal height was 160.6 cm, self-reported 161.1 cm (NS), partner reported 161.7 cm (NS). Inaccuracy of height self-report had a small but significant effect on the mean MPTH (0.4 cm, p = 0.045). Analysis showed that only 70% of MPTH calculated by reported heights fell within ± 2 cm of MPTH calculated using measured heights, 24% being in ± 2–4 cm range, and 6% were inaccurate by more than 4 cm.

Conclusion

There is a significant difference in paternal measured versus reported heights with an overall trend for fathers to overestimate their own height. A large subset of parents makes a substantial error in their height self-report, which leads to erroneous MPTH. Inaccuracy is even greater when one parent reports the other parent's height. When a child's growth is in question, measured rather than reported parental heights should be obtained.

### Incorporating genetic potential when evaluating stature in children with cystic fibrosis [^115t4JsT]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The 2002 Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) practice guidelines recommend adjusting for genetic potential when evaluating height status in children with CF. However, there is paucity of data to support this recommendation. We compared three methods of classifying short stature: unadjusted height percentile < 10th, Himes adjusted height percentile < 10th, and unadjusted height below the CFF target height lower bound.

Patients and Methods

Data from 3306 children with parental heights documented in the 1986–2005 CFF Patient Registry were analyzed.

Results

Mean height percentile of CF children (33rd) was lower than their parents' (mothers' 53rd, fathers' 57th), and 80% of CF children were below the average of their parental height percentiles. In children with short parents, Himes adjusted height percentile was significantly higher than unadjusted height percentile (27th vs. 8th), whereas the opposite was found in children with tall parents (Himes adjusted at 18th vs. unadjusted at 49th). Consequently, the prevalence of short stature decreased from 52% to 22% in children with short parents and increased from 8% to 34% in children with tall parents after Himes adjustment. In children with discrepant classification on short stature before and after Himes adjustment, percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second was negatively associated with unadjusted height percentile but positively associated with Himes adjusted height percentile. In children with short parents, the CFF method underestimated the prevalence of short stature (9%) compared to the Himes method (22%).

Conclusion

Without adjustment of genetic potential, the prevalence of short stature is underestimated and the association between height and lung function is biased.

### Current concepts in tall stature and overgrowth syndromes [^1114bavj]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

In this overview an update is given on the pathogenesis, classification and differential diagnosis of overgrowth syndromes. In addition, height prognosis and therapeutic modalities available for managing mainly constitutional tall stature are discussed. Constitutional tall stature comprises normal variants in which one or both parents are tall. Primary disorders may have a prenatal onset and may be of chromosomal or genetic origin. Secondary overgrowth syndromes are most often the result of hormonal disturbances. Height prediction plays a key role in the management of tall children. Prediction equation models have been developed based on the growth data of healthy tall children. There is general agreement that a favourable effect on reducing ultimate height is obtained using high doses of sex steroids (girls 100–300 microg ethinyloestradiol; boys testosterone (T) ester depot preparations 250–1000 mg/month), the height reduction being greater when the treatment is started at a lower chronological and/or bone age. An alternative is the induction of puberty with low doses of sex steroids (girls 5–50 microg ethinyloestradiol; boys T esters 25–50 mg/m²/3 wk). In addition orthopaedic procedures have been suggested, but there is limited experience. Although psychosocial factors constitute the main reason for treating tall stature, extensive psychological investigations before or during height limiting therapy are lacking. Moreover, there are no objective data indicating lifelong psychosocial damage resulting from being tall.

### Child with suspected short stature [^116mnYGF]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected short stature — clinical features and referral triggers are listed as follows: suggestive history and physical findings include "Child well below 3rd percentile for height", "Child with decreasing growth velocity – crossing percentiles down after the age of 3 years", "Child with a history of IUGR without catch-up growth by age 2", and "Syndromic appearance, abnormal body proportions". When to refer is stratified as Urgent and Routine; urgent indications are "If child is growing poorly and is having headaches or vision changes" or "If you suspect a child may have multiple hormone deficiencies", and routine indications are "Height below 3rd percentile", "Abnormal growth velocity in a child older than 3 years", and "Height potential is different than expected for the family".

### Parental heights and maternal education as predictors of length / height of children at birth, age 3 and 19 years, independently on diet: the ELSPAC study [^1179YMwo]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Little is currently known about the relationship between the parental diet during pregnancy and the growth of the child from early childhood until early adulthood. This study was designed to examine whether the dietary patterns of the parents during a pregnancy and of the respective child at 3 years are associated with the length/height-for-age z-score of child at birth, 3 years of age and at 19 years of age.

Subjects/Methods

Dietary patterns of pregnant women and their partners, and offspring at 3 years that were enroled in the 1990–1991 period in the Czech part of the European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood. Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the relationship between the dietary patterns of parents (835 child-mother-father trios) during pregnancy and the length/height-for-age z-score of their offspring at birth, 3 years and 19 years.

Results

The maternal health-conscious food pattern was found to predict lower child height at 3 years, but not at birth nor at 19 years of age. An increase in the health-conscious pattern score of the maternal diet was associated with significantly lower height-for-age z-score at 3 years; however, the observed effect lost its significance after the adjustment for diet of the child at 3 years.

Conclusions

After full adjustment, the only significant predictors of the height-for-age z-score of the child at 3 years were the heights of both parents and maternal education. More research into the association of maternal diet in pregnancy and height of child is necessary.

### The interaction of childhood height and childhood BMI in the prediction of young adult BMI [^115rjeLy]. Obesity (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine the interaction of childhood height and childhood BMI in the prediction of young adult BMI. The 2,802 subjects in this study were from the Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH). The subjects' heights and weights were measured in 3rd grade (mean age 8.7 years) and again in 12th grade (mean age 18.3 years). The associations and interactions between height (cm) and BMI (kg/m²) were assessed using mixed linear regression models with adult BMI as the dependent variable. We found a significant interaction between childhood height and childhood BMI in the prediction of adult BMI (P < 0.0001). Stratification by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reference quintiles revealed that a positive association between childhood height and adult BMI existed only for those subjects in the top quintile of childhood BMI, within whom predicted adult BMI ranged from 27.5 (95% confidence interval = 26.4–28.6) for those in the shortest height quintile to 30.2 (95% confidence interval = 29.7–30.6) for those in the highest height quintile. Among children with high BMI levels, those who were taller, as compared to those who were shorter, had significantly higher young adult BMI levels. This pattern seems primarily due to the positive association of childhood height and childhood BMI. Clinicians should recognize the risk of excess body weight in young adulthood for all children who have a high BMI, and pay special attention to those who are tall, because their childhood height will not protect them from subsequent weight gain and elevated BMI.

### Genetic evaluation of short stature [^111AUmFc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Genetics plays a major role in determining an individual's height. Although there are many monogenic disorders that lead to perturbations in growth and result in short stature, there is still no consensus as to the role that genetic diagnostics should play in the evaluation of a child with short stature.

Evidence Acquisition

A search of PubMed was performed, focusing on the genetic diagnosis of short stature as well as on specific diagnostic subgroups included in this article. Consensus guidelines were reviewed.

Evidence Synthesis

There are a multitude of rare genetic causes of severe short stature. There is no high-quality evidence to define the optimal approach to the genetic evaluation of short stature. We review genetic etiologies of a number of diagnostic subgroups and propose an algorithm for genetic testing based on these subgroups.

Conclusion

Advances in genomic technologies are revolutionizing the diagnostic approach to short stature. Endocrinologists must become facile with the use of genetic testing in order to identify the various monogenic disorders that present with short stature.

### Etiologies and early diagnosis of short stature and growth failure in children and adolescents [^113Q6wpS]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Accurate measurement of height and weight using standardized techniques is a fundamental component of pediatric medical visits. Calculation of height velocity over time enables comparison with standardized growth charts to identify potential deviations from normal. Growth deviations may be expressed as SD from the normal population mean for children of comparable age and sex; children with heights > 2 SD below the mean are generally classified as short stature. In a child with suspected impaired growth, a detailed evaluation should be conducted to identify the cause. Such an evaluation may include a combination of personal, family, and social history; physical examination; general and perhaps specialized laboratory evaluations; radiologic examinations; genetic testing; and consultation with a pediatric subspecialist, such as a pediatric endocrinologist. Variants of normal growth include familial short stature, constitutional delay of growth and puberty, and small for gestational age with catch-up growth. Pathological causes of abnormal growth include many systemic diseases and their treatments, growth hormone deficiency, and a series of genetic syndromes, including Noonan syndrome and Turner syndrome. Children with short stature in whom no specific cause is identified may be diagnosed with idiopathic short stature. Early identification of abnormal growth patterns and prompt referral to specialist care offer children with growth failure and/or short stature the greatest chance for appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and improved clinical outcomes.

### The genetic basis of human height [^114Sptep]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2025). High credibility.

Human height is a model polygenic trait - additive effects of many individual variants create continuous, genetically determined variation in this phenotype. Height can also be severely affected by single-gene variants in monogenic disorders, often causing severe alterations in stature relative to population averages. Deciphering the genetic basis of height provides understanding into the biology of growth and is also of relevance to disease, as increased or decreased height relative to population averages has been epidemiologically and genetically associated with an altered risk of cancer or cardiometabolic diseases. With recent large-scale genome-wide association studies of human height reaching saturation, its genetic architecture has become clearer. Genes implicated by both monogenic and polygenic studies converge on common developmental or cellular pathways that affect stature, including at the growth plate, a key site of skeletal growth. In this Review, we summarize the genetic contributors to height, from ultra-rare monogenic disorders that severely affect growth to common alleles that act across multiple pathways.

### Child with suspected short stature [^1164WAx6]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis of short stature — common causes and idiopathic short stature criteria are specified as follows: Common causes include familial or intrinsic short stature, constitutional delay of growth and puberty, idiopathic short stature, and small for gestational age without catch up growth by 2 years. In constitutional delay, children typically cross percentiles downwards in the first 3 years and then grow at a normal growth velocity on the lower percentiles or just below the 3rd percentile, and bone age is delayed. Idiopathic short stature is defined as height < 2.25 SD below the mean for age and sex (shortest 1.2% of children) – FDA definition, with notes that patients are unlikely to attain adult height in the normal range (less than 63 inches for boys and 59 inches for girls) and that diagnostic evaluation excludes other causes of short stature.

### Child with suspected short stature [^115DqqKT]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected short stature — differential considerations include DiGeorge Syndrome; chronic illness such as gastrointestinal diseases (Celiac disease, Inflammatory bowel disease), pulmonary diseases (Asthma, Cystic fibrosis), cardiac disease, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, and glucocorticoid treatment; musculoskeletal issues including Skeletal dysplasia and Spinal disorders; and psychosocial issues including Psychosocial dwarfism and Fetal alcohol syndrome. Mid-parental target height calculation is provided: for boys, "Mother's height + 5 inches averaged with father's height"; for girls, "Father's height – 5 inches averaged with mother's height".

### Short and tall stature: a new paradigm emerges [^116xgwzW]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

In the past, the growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) axis was often considered to be the main system that regulated childhood growth and, therefore, determined short stature and tall stature. However, findings have now revealed that the GH-IGF-1 axis is just one of many regulatory systems that control chondrogenesis in the growth plate, which is the biological process that drives height gain. Consequently, normal growth in children depends not only on GH and IGF-1 but also on multiple hormones, paracrine factors, extracellular matrix molecules and intracellular proteins that regulate the activity of growth plate chondrocytes. Mutations in the genes that encode many of these local proteins cause short stature or tall stature. Similarly, genome-wide association studies have revealed that the normal variation in height seems to be largely due to genes outside the GH-IGF-1 axis that affect growth at the growth plate through a wide variety of mechanisms. These findings point to a new conceptual framework for understanding short and tall stature that is centred not on two particular hormones but rather on the growth plate, which is the structure responsible for height gain.

### Inference of the genetic architecture underlying BMI and height with the use of 20, 240 sibling pairs [^112WRwGm]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Evidence that complex traits are highly polygenic has been presented by population-based genome-wide association studies (GWASs) through the identification of many significant variants, as well as by family-based de novo sequencing studies indicating that several traits have a large mutational target size. Here, using a third study design, we show results consistent with extreme polygenicity for body mass index (BMI) and height. On a sample of 20,240 siblings (from 9,570 nuclear families), we used a within-family method to obtain narrow-sense heritability estimates of 0.42 (SE = 0.17, p = 0.01) and 0.69 (SE = 0.14, p = 6 × 10⁻⁷) for BMI and height, respectively, after adjusting for covariates. The genomic inflation factors from locus-specific linkage analysis were 1.69 (SE = 0.21, p = 0.04) for BMI and 2.18 (SE = 0.21, p = 2 × 10⁻¹⁰) for height. This inflation is free of confounding and congruent with polygenicity, consistent with observations of ever-increasing genomic-inflation factors from GWASs with large sample sizes, implying that those signals are due to true genetic signals across the genome rather than population stratification. We also demonstrate that the distribution of the observed test statistics is consistent with both rare and common variants underlying a polygenic architecture and that previous reports of linkage signals in complex traits are probably a consequence of polygenic architecture rather than the segregation of variants with large effects. The convergent empirical evidence from GWASs, de novo studies, and within-family segregation implies that family-based sequencing studies for complex traits require very large sample sizes because the effects of causal variants are small on average.

### Overgrowth [^115bNPMZ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2010). Low credibility.

Overgrowth presenting at birth requires blood glucose monitoring while a cause is sought. Among older children presenting with tall stature, common causes such as familial tall stature and simple obesity must be distinguished from rarer endocrine and genetic causes. Several genetic overgrowth syndromes carry increased risk of malignancy and regular screening is recommended. The use of high-dose oestrogen or testosterone in an attempt to limit final stature has limited efficacy and carries a significant risk of side effects.

### Views on short stature of female vs male endocrine pediatric patients undergoing provocative growth hormone testing and their parents [^111yJXnu]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Boys outnumber girls in short stature evaluations and growth hormone treatment despite absence of gender differences in short stature prevalence. Family views on short stature influence medical management, but gender-based analysis of these views is lacking. This study explored endocrine patients' and their parents' perceptions of short stature and its impact on quality of life by patient gender.

Methods

Patients aged 8 to 14 years undergoing provocative growth hormone testing and 1 parent each completed semistructured interviews. Clinical data were extracted by chart review.

Results

Twenty-four patient-parent dyads (6 female patients, 22 mothers; predominantly non-Hispanic White) participated. Six major themes emerged: (1) patients' perceptions of their short stature were similar by gender, (2) physical experiences of short stature were similar by gender, (3) social experiences of short stature were both similar and different by gender, (4) parental perceptions of short stature as a factor limiting their child's functionality were similar by gender, (5) concern about societal stigma related to short stature arose for both genders, and (6) patients' perceptions of parental messaging about the import of their short stature were similar by gender.

Conclusion

Our data reveal more similarities than differences between genders in patient perceptions and patient and parent-reported experiences of short stature. Worry about stature-related stigma was noted for patients of both genders. Parental messaging about short stature emerged as an important area to explore further by patient gender. Our findings suggest that clinicians should be wary of making gender or stigma-based assumptions when evaluating children with short stature.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^111NQTBH]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Family-based involvement and outcomes — In all effective studies, the parent or family unit was included, prior evidence associates parent involvement with early success and indicates family-based interventions are more effective for achieving and sustaining child body mass index (BMI) reduction than child-only approaches, but for adolescents the evidence on including parents is less clear; moreover, although studies often measure parental BMI, none in the technical report demonstrated significant reduction, and while family-based treatment has potential to improve the health and weight of other household members including siblings, no data are available to support this outcome.

### Copy number variants in patients with short stature [^112oEqpx]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Height is a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed that at least 180 genetic variants influence adult height. However, these variants explain only about 10% of the phenotypic variation in height. Genetic analysis of short individuals can lead to the discovery of novel rare gene defects with a large effect on growth. In an effort to identify novel genes associated with short stature, genome-wide analysis for copy number variants (CNVs), using single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, in 162 patients (149 families) with short stature was performed. Segregation analysis was performed if possible, and genes in CNVs were compared with information from GWAS, gene expression in rodents' growth plates and published information. CNVs were detected in 40 families. In six families, a known cause of short stature was found (SHOX deletion or duplication, IGF1R deletion), in two combined with a de novo potentially pathogenic CNV. Thirty-three families had one or more potentially pathogenic CNVs (n = 40). In 24 of these families, segregation analysis could be performed, identifying three de novo CNVs and nine CNVs segregating with short stature. Four were located near loci associated with height in GWAS (ADAMTS17, TULP4, PRKG2/BMP3 and PAPPA). Besides six CNVs known to be causative for short stature, 40 CNVs with possible pathogenicity were identified. Segregation studies and bioinformatics analysis suggested various potential candidate genes.

### Genome partitioning of genetic variation for height from 11, 214 sibling pairs [^113w9vLB]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2007). Low credibility.

Height has been used for more than a century as a model by which to understand quantitative genetic variation in humans. We report that the entire genome appears to contribute to its additive genetic variance. We used genotypes and phenotypes of 11,214 sibling pairs from three countries to partition additive genetic variance across the genome. Using genome scans to estimate the proportion of the genomes of each chromosome from siblings that were identical by descent, we estimated the heritability of height contributed by each of the 22 autosomes and the X chromosome. We show that additive genetic variance is spread across multiple chromosomes and that at least six chromosomes (i.e., 3, 4, 8, 15, 17, and 18) are responsible for the observed variation. Indeed, the data are not inconsistent with a uniform spread of trait loci throughout the genome. Our estimate of the variance explained by a chromosome is correlated with the number of times suggestive or significant linkage with height has been reported for that chromosome. Variance due to dominance was not significant but was difficult to assess because of the high sampling correlation between additive and dominance components. Results were consistent with the absence of any large between-chromosome epistatic effects. Notwithstanding the proposed architecture of complex traits that involves widespread gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, our results suggest that variation in height in humans can be explained by many loci distributed over all autosomes, with an additive mode of gene action.

### Accuracy of height and weight data from child health records [^11166sKp]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

Background

There is limited knowledge of the accuracy of height and weight measurements from child health records, despite widespread use for research and clinical care. We assess the accuracy of such measurements, using research measurements as the gold standard.

Methods

We compare height/length and weight measurements from clinics of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children with routinely collected child health records within 2 months of the clinic date at age 4 (n = 345), 8 (n = 1051), 12 (n = 139), 18 (n = 649), 25 (n = 183), and 43 months (n = 123). To adjust for age differences at measurement, growth data were converted into standard deviation scores using the UK 1990 growth reference.

Results

Mean weight standard deviation score (SDS) differences were ≤ 0.08, with mean predicted differences ≤ 0.1 kg (eg, mean predicted difference at 8 months -0.011 kg, 95% level of agreement -0.64 to 0.62 kg). Mean height SDS differences were ≤ 0.45, with mean predicted differences ≤ 0.9 cm (eg, mean predicted difference at 8 months -0.59 cm, 95% level of agreement -3.84 to 2.66 cm). There was indication of lower accuracy at 4 months old (mean predicted height difference at 4 months -0.91 cm, 95% level of agreement -4.61 to 2.79 cm), but this decreased when the age difference between measurements was reduced. Routine measurements slightly overestimated heights of tall children and underestimated those of short children, but otherwise differences were not associated with sex, social class, birth weight, birth length, or maternal anthropometry.

Conclusion

Routinely collected child health record height/length and weight data are compatible with no systematic bias, at least in children over 8 months old, supporting their use in clinical practice and research.

### Child with suspected obesity and metabolic syndrome [^1166BUxR]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected obesity — additional history and associated problems include abnormal weight gain along with normal height gain (tall stature or taller than expected stature for family), irregular dietary habits such as skipping major meals, snacking, binge eating, stress eating, eating out, consumption of sugar sweetened beverages, decreased physical activity/ increased screen time, and associated problems of joint pain; shortness of breath, snoring at night; daytime sleepiness, headache; vision changes; acanthosis; menstrual irregularity; and poor self-esteem, depression, history of bullying.

### Nutrition support for neurologically impaired children: a clinical report of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^112ZXU5p]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Medium credibility.

Growth history — baseline and parental context: Historical measurements guide interpretation, as "Birth weight and length, as well as previous weight, length, and head circumference measurements, when recorded on NCHS growth charts, may be compared with the reference population to determine if growth faltering or abnormal weight gain or loss has occurred". Risk stratification is flagged because "Low birth weight may indicate a greater risk of undernutrition", and caution is advised since "The interpretation of historical data may be flawed because accurate growth measurements, particularly standing heights, may be difficult to obtain in children with neurological impairment". Family context can help, as "The height of the biological parents may be useful to estimate the child's genetic potential for linear growth".

### Genetic architecture associated with familial short stature [^115azsp5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Human height is an inheritable, polygenic trait under complex and multilocus genetic regulation. Familial short stature (FSS; also called genetic short stature) is the most common type of short stature and is insufficiently known.

Objective

To investigate the FSS genetic profile and develop a polygenic risk predisposition score for FSS risk prediction.

Design and Setting

The FSS participant group of Han Chinese ancestry was diagnosed by pediatric endocrinologists in Taiwan.

Patients and Interventions

The genetic profiles of 1163 participants with FSS were identified by using a bootstrapping subsampling and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) method.

Main Outcome Measures

Genetic profile, polygenic risk predisposition score for risk prediction.

Results

Ten novel genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 9 reported GWAS human height-related SNPs were identified for FSS risk. These 10 novel SNPs served as a polygenic risk predisposition score for FSS risk prediction (area under the curve: 0.940 in the testing group). This FSS polygenic risk predisposition score was also associated with the height reduction regression tendency in the general population.

Conclusion

A polygenic risk predisposition score composed of 10 genetic SNPs is useful for FSS risk prediction and the height reduction tendency. Thus, it might contribute to FSS risk in the Han Chinese population from Taiwan.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^114BJWnZ]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Family-based pediatric obesity interventions and post–weight loss maintenance — long-term outcomes showed that "Ten-year follow-up of obese children (ages 6–12 years at enrollment) documented sustained improvement in weight-for-height measures of family-based interventions based on training children and parents in optimal food choices in a research setting". "This is the first evidence that weight regulation in children can be achieved and maintained over extended periods from childhood through adolescence". "Change in physical activity in addition to dietary change was significantly associated with reduced obesity in this report". Moreover, "the importance of a treatment focus on parents in children this age" was highlighted. For maintenance after weight loss, "Another RCT tested an intervention designed for weight maintenance after an active weight loss treatment program in 204 healthy children ages 7–12 years with elevated BMI; the trial found that maintenance-targeted treatment improved weight loss short term compared with no maintenance treatment, but effects were not significant at 2 years".

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^112GWGLN]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children — guiding principles and evidence grading — The taskforce retrieved ~15,000 citations with approximately 6,300 specific to GHD or PIGFD, used a two-stage review with primary and secondary reviewers, and included all RCTs, with nonrandomized studies when they addressed the safety data. Evidence quality was judged as very low (●○○○), low (●●○○), moderate (●●●○), or high (●●●●), and recommendations were assessed as strong (denoted by "We recommend") or conditional (denoted by "We suggest"); consensus was defined as at least 6 of the 8 members agreeing on the recommendation as strong or weak. AH was selected as the primary outcome; in the absence of AH data, surrogate short-term outcomes such as growth velocity, change in height z-score, or change in predicted height were considered, but did not form the basis of a recommendation. For comparing AH across studies, GHD analyses used (AH SDS – midparental height [MPH] SDS) and, because MPH SDS formulas varied, the MPH SDS reported for each study was used; ISS analyses used (AH SDS minus baseline HtSDS), and (AH SDS – MPH SDS) was not used for ISS because MPH may not reflect genetic potential if one or both parents has an undiagnosed condition. Studies utilizing predicted AH were excluded. The taskforce emphasized harm prevention and described a conservative approach, recommending only practices with supporting evidence of sufficient quality that minimize potential risks to patients.

### Genetics of short stature [^116RAd3y]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Short stature is a common and heterogeneous condition that is often genetic in etiology. For most children with genetic short stature, the specific molecular causes remain unknown; but with advances in exome/genome sequencing and bioinformatics approaches, new genetic causes of growth disorders have been identified, contributing to the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of longitudinal bone growth and growth failure. Identifying new genetic causes of growth disorders has the potential to improve diagnosis, prognostic accuracy, and individualized management, and help avoid unnecessary testing for endocrine and other disorders.

### Genome-wide linkage screen for stature and body mass index in 3.032 families: evidence for sex-and population-specific genetic effects [^111SHLxk]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Stature (adult body height) and body mass index (BMI) have a strong genetic component explaining observed variation in human populations; however, identifying those genetic components has been extremely challenging. It seems obvious that sample size is a critical determinant for successful identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) that underlie the genetic architecture of these polygenic traits. The inherent shared environment and known genetic relationships in family studies provide clear advantages for gene mapping over studies utilizing unrelated individuals. To these ends, we combined the genotype and phenotype data from four previously performed family-based genome-wide screens resulting in a sample of 9.371 individuals from 3.032 African-American and European-American families and performed variance-components linkage analyses for stature and BMI. To our knowledge, this study represents the single largest family-based genome-wide linkage scan published for stature and BMI to date. This large study sample allowed us to pursue population- and sex-specific analyses as well. For stature, we found evidence for linkage in previously reported loci on 11q23, 12q12, 15q25 and 18q23, as well as 15q26 and 19q13, which have not been linked to stature previously. For BMI, we found evidence for two loci: one on 7q35 and another on 11q22, both of which have been previously linked to BMI in multiple populations. Our results show both the benefit of (1) combining data to maximize the sample size and (2) minimizing heterogeneity by analyzing subgroups where within-group variation can be reduced and suggest that the latter may be a more successful approach in genetic mapping.

### Children with idiopathic short stature: an expanding role for genetic investigation in their medical evaluation [^112Z37Qv]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Short stature in children is a common reason for referral to a pediatric endocrinologist. Many genetic, nutritional, psychological, illness-related, and hormonal causes must be excluded before labeling as idiopathic. Idiopathic short stature is not a diagnosis, but rather describes a large, heterogeneous group of children, who are short and often slowly growing. As new testing paradigms become available, the pool of patients labeled as idiopathic will shrink, although most will have a polygenic cause. Given that many of the new diagnoses are involved in growth plate biology, physical examination should assess for subtle dysmorphology or disproportion of the skeleton that may indicate a heterozygous mutation that in its homozygous state would be apparent. When laboratory evaluations are negative, one may consider genetic testing, such as targeted gene or gene panel, comparative genomic hybridization, or whole exome or whole genome sequencing (respectively). With a known genetic diagnosis, targeted therapy may be possible rather than recombinant human growth hormone, where response is generally poorer than that for children with growth hormone deficiency, because the variety of diagnoses may have varying growth hormone sensitivity. A firm diagnosis has heuristic value: to truncate further diagnostic evaluation, alert the clinician to other possible comorbidities, inform the family for genetic counseling, and direct appropriate targeted therapy, if available.

### Association analyses of CYP19 gene polymorphisms with height variation in a large sample of caucasian nuclear families [^1159EUjB]. Human Genetics (2006). Low credibility.

Human height is a complex trait regulated by multiple genetic and environmental factors. CYP19 (cytochrome P450 19) encodes aromatase, which catalyses the rate-limiting step in the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Deleterious mutations in CYP19 can result in estrogen deficiency that will influence adult height to certain extent. In the present study, we aimed to test the associations between the CYP19 gene polymorphisms with adult height variation, using family-based association methods, such as QTDT (quantitative transmission disequilibrium test) and FBAT (family-based association test) in 1,873 subjects from 405 Caucasian nuclear families. We found one SNP (rs730154) significantly associated with height by both QTDT (P = 0.0030) and FBAT (P = 0.0016) analyses. Haplotype analyses corroborated our single-marker results by showing that the haplotypes in block 4 containing rs730154 were significantly associated with height variation. We thus concluded that CYP19 could be one of the genetic factors influencing adult height in Caucasians. Further studies are required to identify the causal functional variants responsible for Caucasian height within the CYP19 gene.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^115yg66N]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Endocrine evaluation in obese children and adolescents — We recommend against a routine laboratory evaluation for endocrine causes of obesity in obese children or early to midpubertal obese adolescents unless the child's height velocity, as assessed in relation to stage of puberty and family background, is attenuated (1QQQQ). GH deficiency, hypothyroidism, Cushing disease or syndrome, and related disorders are associated with increased BMI but decreased stature and height velocity, whereas stature and height velocity are usually increased with exogenous obesity; testing for endocrine disorders is unlikely to be useful unless the patient is short for family background or is showing a deceleration in height velocity, and an adrenal tumor with concomitant hypersecretion of androgens and cortisol may present, but signs of virilization should be evident on careful physical examination.

### Genomewide linkage analysis of stature in multiple populations reveals several regions with evidence of linkage to adult height [^1116UZjL]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2001). Low credibility.

Genomewide linkage analysis has been extremely successful at identification of the genetic variation underlying single-gene disorders. However, linkage analysis has been less successful for common human diseases and other complex traits in which multiple genetic and environmental factors interact to influence disease risk. We hypothesized that a highly heritable complex trait, in which the contribution of environmental factors was relatively limited, might be more amenable to linkage analysis. We therefore chose to study stature (adult height), for which heritability is approximately 75%-90% (Phillips and Matheny 1990; Carmichael and McGue 1995; Preece 1996; Silventoinen et al. 2000). We reanalyzed genomewide scans from four populations for which genotype and height data were available, using a variance-components method implemented in GENEHUNTER 2.0 (Pratt et al. 2000). The populations consisted of 408 individuals in 58 families from the Botnia region of Finland, 753 individuals in 183 families from other parts of Finland, 746 individuals in 179 families from Southern Sweden, and 420 individuals in 63 families from the Saguenay-Lac-St.-Jean region of Quebec. Four regions showed evidence of linkage to stature: 6q24–25, multipoint LOD score 3.85 at marker D6S1007 in Botnia (genomewide P < .06), 7q31.3–36 (LOD 3.40 at marker D7S2195 in Sweden, P < .02), 12p11.2-q14 (LOD 3.35 at markers D12S10990-D12S398 in Finland, P < .05) and 13q32–33 (LOD 3.56 at markers D13S779-D13S797 in Finland, P < .05). In a companion article (Perola et al. 2001 [in this issue]), strong supporting evidence is obtained for linkage to the region on chromosome 7. These studies suggest that highly heritable complex traits such as stature may be genetically tractable and provide insight into the genetic architecture of complex traits.

### Approach to the patient with short stature: genetic testing [^114tmUrg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The first step in the evaluation of the short child is to decide whether growth parameters in the context of the history are abnormal or a variant of normal. If growth is considered abnormal, system and hormonal tests are likely to be required, followed by more directed testing, such as skeletal survey and/or genetic screening with karyotype or microarray. In a small percentage of short children in whom a diagnosis has not been reached, this will need to be followed by detailed genetic analysis; currently, exome sequencing using targeted panels relevant to the phenotype is the commonly used test. Clinical scenarios are presented that illustrate how such genetic testing can be used to establish a molecular diagnosis, and how that diagnosis contributes to the management of the short child. New genetic causes for short stature are being recognized on a frequent basis, while the clinical spectrum for known genes is being extended. We recommend that an international repository for short stature conditions is established for new findings to aid dissemination of knowledge, but also to help in the definition of the clinical spectrum both for new and established conditions.

### International small for gestational age advisory board consensus development conference statement: management of short children born small for gestational age, April 24-October 1, 2001 [^115w9zPf]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide pediatric endocrinologists, general pediatricians, neonatologists, and primary care physicians with recommendations for the management of short children born small for gestational age (SGA).

Methods

A 13-member independent panel of pediatric endocrinologists was convened to discuss relevant issues with respect to definition, diagnosis, and clinical management of short children born SGA. Panel members convened over a series of 3 meetings to thoroughly review, discuss, and come to consensus on the identification and treatment of short children who are born SGA.

Conclusions

SGA is defined as birth weight and/or length at least 2 standard deviations (SDs) below the mean for gestational age (≤ -2 SD). Accurate gestational dating and measurement of birth weight and length are crucial for identifying children who are born SGA. Comprehensive pregnancy, perinatal, and immediate postnatal data may help to confirm the diagnosis. Maternal, placental, and fetal causes of SGA should be sought, although the cause is often not clear. Most children who are SGA experience catch-up growth and achieve a height > 2 SD below the mean; this catch-up process is usually completed by the time they are 2 years of age. A child who is SGA and older than 3 years and has persistent short stature (ie, remaining at least 2 SD below the mean for chronologic age) is not likely to catch up and should be referred to a pediatrician who has expertise in endocrinology. Bone age is not a reliable predictor of height potential in children who are SGA. Nevertheless, a standard evaluation for short stature should be performed. A diagnosis of SGA does not exclude growth hormone (GH) deficiency, and GH assessment should be performed if there is clinical suspicion or biochemical evidence of GH deficiency. At baseline, insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, fasting insulin, glucose, and lipid levels as well as blood pressure should be measured, and all aspects of SGA-not just stature-should be addressed with parents. The objectives of GH therapy in short children who are SGA are catch-up growth in early childhood, maintenance of normal growth in childhood, and achievement of normal adult height. GH therapy is effective and safe in short children who are born SGA and should be considered in those older than 2 to 3 years. There is long-term experience of improved growth using a dosage range from 0.24 to 0.48 mg/kg/wk. Higher GH doses (0.48 mg/kg/wk [0.2 IU/kg/d]) are more effective for the short term. Whether the higher GH dose is more efficacious than the lower dose in terms of adult height results is not yet known. Only adult height results of randomized dose-response studies will give a definite answer. Monitoring is necessary to ensure safety of medication. Children should be monitored for changes in glucose homeostasis, lipids, and blood pressure during therapy. The frequency and intensity of monitoring will vary depending on risk factors such as family history, obesity, and puberty.

### Examining the interdependence of parent-child dyads: effects on weight loss and maintenance [^116FErfe]. Pediatric Obesity (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aimed to further elucidate correlated weight changes in parent-child dyads enrolled in family-based treatment (FBT) by modeling the interdependence of weight changes during treatment.

Methods

Parent-child dyads (n = 172) with overweight/obesity (child mean zBMI = 2.16 ± 0.39; parent mean BMI = 37.9 ± 9.4 kg/m²) completed 4months of FBT and were randomized to one of three 8-month maintenance interventions (Social Facilitation Maintenance [SFM]-high dose, SFM-low dose or control). Weight/height was measured at 0, 4 and 12months. Structural equation models simultaneously estimated the effect that an individual had on their own (actor effect) and on one another's (partner effect) weight-status across time using the actor-partner interdependence model.

Results

Actor paths were significant over time for parent and child. Partner paths were significant for child zBMI predicting parent BMI at 4 and 12months. Maintenance condition moderated actor/partner paths in the model.

Conclusions

Child weight change may motivate parents to make environmental and behavioural changes that impact their own weight.

### Population genetic differentiation of height and body mass index across Europe [^113LNUYp]. Nature Genetics (2015). Medium credibility.

Across-nation differences in the mean values for complex traits are common, but the reasons for these differences are unknown. Here we find that many independent loci contribute to population genetic differences in height and body mass index (BMI) in 9,416 individuals across 14 European countries. Using discovery data on over 250,000 individuals and unbiased effect size estimates from 17,500 sibling pairs, we estimate that 24% (95% credible interval (CI) = 9%, 41%) and 8% (95% CI = 4%, 16%) of the captured additive genetic variance for height and BMI, respectively, reflect population genetic differences. Population genetic divergence differed significantly from that in a null model (height, P < 3.94 × 10⁻⁸; BMI, P < 5.95 × 10⁻⁴), and we find an among-population genetic correlation for tall and slender individuals (r = -0.80, 95% CI = -0.95, -0.60), consistent with correlated selection for both phenotypes. Observed differences in height among populations reflected the predicted genetic means (r = 0.51; P < 0.001), but environmental differences across Europe masked genetic differentiation for BMI (P < 0.58).

### Genetic approaches to stature, pubertal timing, and other complex traits [^113BRQNm]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

The factors that regulate the timing of puberty remain largely elusive, as do the factors that modulate childhood growth and adult height. However, it is clear that these developmental processes are highly heritable — much of the natural variation in growth and timing of puberty is due to genetic variation within the population. In this review, we discuss how recent genetic and genomic advances can be exploited to help understand the genetic regulation of these processes. In particular, we describe how genome-wide linkage scans and association studies, in conjunction with haplotype-based approaches, are potentially useful tools to increase our understanding of these two complex traits. Discovery of the genetic variants that regulate these two traits would expand our understanding of human neuroendocrinology, postnatal development, and the general architecture of complex genetic traits.

### Early determinants of overweight at 4.5 years in a population-based longitudinal study [^115yJJeB]. International Journal of Obesity (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

The roots of the obesity epidemic need to be traced back as early in life as possible in order to develop effective means for preventing obesity and its health consequences in the future. The aim of this paper is to examine a broad range of factors that may simultaneously contribute to childhood overweight in a population-based cohort of children followed from birth to 4.5 years, to determine which factors exert the most influence in early life.

Design

The analyses were performed using data from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development 1998–2002 (QLSCD).

Subjects

The study follows a representative sample (n = 2103) of children born in 1998 in the Canadian province of Quebec.

Measure

Measured height and weight were available for 1550 children aged 4.5 years. At 4.5 years, BMI was analyzed using the US CDC sex- and age-specific growth charts. In order to study children at their highest weights at various ages, odds ratios were presented for high birth weight, weight-for-stature at or above the 95th percentile at 5 months, and BMI at or above the 95th percentile at 4.5 years. Monthly weight gain between birth and five months has been analyzed. Children were also evaluated by the Z-score obtained from the standardized weight divided by height. Factors potentially related to children's weight include sex, gestational age and birth rank, breastfeeding, mothers' smoking status during pregnancy, family type at child's birth, and family income before pregnancy and when the children were 5 months and 4.5 years old. Other parental factors such as height and overweight/obesity (based on BMI) and other maternal factors (age, education, immigrant status) were also part of the analysis.

Results

Being in the highest quintiles of weight gain between birth and 5 months, as well as maternal smoking during pregnancy, almost double the odds of being overweight at 4.5 years. Parental overweight or obesity also increased the odds of being overweight at this age, as well as being raised in middle-income or in poor families. A greater proportion of children born to nonsmoking mothers with higher weights (more than 4000 g) were overweight at 4.5 years, the percentage being greatest for those in the highest weight-gain categories from birth to 5 months. The pattern was different for children born to smoking mothers. The greatest proportion of 4.5-year-old overweight children was seen for children born in the normal weight-range category (3000–4000 g) who were in the highest quintiles of weight gain from birth to 5 months, and for children with high birth weights (more than 4000 g) who were in the lowest quintiles of birth-to-5-months weight gain. Children who were overweight at 4.5 years and who had been born to smoking mothers started life with a birth weight around that for the population means, but they gained more weight in the first 5 months of life than did the children of nonsmoking mothers.

Conclusion

This study indicates that behavioral and social factors exert critical influences on the onset of childhood overweight in preschool years. From a population-health perspective, interventions aimed at preventing childhood obesity would do well to target smoking pregnant women, as well as nonsmoking pregnant women at risk for giving birth to high-birth-weight children, paying particular attention to rapid weight gain in the first months of life.

### International consensus statement on the diagnosis, multidisciplinary management and lifelong care of individuals with achondroplasia [^114FkNg5]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Achondroplasia — psychosocial issues, family perspectives and support — more than 80% of individuals born with achondroplasia are part of average height families, and meetings with other families and support and advocacy groups can provide additional support. The diagnosis of achondroplasia is associated with varying degrees of psychosocial impact on the individual, the parents and the whole family, and cultural diversity and family dynamics should be taken into consideration to tailor appropriate support for those affected directly or indirectly by achondroplasia. Individuals with achondroplasia can face physical and emotional hurdles across their lifespan and so should be offered or signposted to psychosocial support when needed, which can help to develop coping strategies and improve quality of life. Facing social stigmatization can have a negative emotional impact on the lives of individuals with achondroplasia and on their families, and they all should be offered psychosocial support with open and effective communication. Young individuals with achondroplasia should be offered specific follow-up appointments at the time of transition from paediatric to adult health care to facilitate this change and discuss long-term health-care management. Practical, psychosocial and personal needs should be considered and assessed before any changing situation in the educational and professional life of an individual with achondroplasia. Siblings of a child with achondroplasia should be offered informative, psychological and emotional support, and starting from diagnosis health-care professionals should provide the family with prompt communication, comprehensive guidance and support throughout life. Understanding the needs and assessing the quality of life of individuals with achondroplasia should be key actions of health-care professionals, and the medical care of children and adults with achondroplasia should be multidisciplinary, with social and psychological support offered to families.

### Determinants of body mass index in Greek children and adolescents [^115s93ac]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the determinants of body mass index (BMI) among Greek children and adolescents, such as parental age and BMI, number of family members in the household, parents' educational status and occupation, physical activity and hours of television viewing and playing computer games by children per day. This cross-sectional study included 2,495 children aged 6–17 years from primary and high schools of Thessaloniki, capital of Northern Greece. Data were collected by questionnaires concerning age, height and weight of the parents, number of family members, and socioeconomic status as determined by occupation and educational status of the parents. Our results revealed that overweight in Greek children and adolescents is influenced positively by several determinant factors, such as parental age and obesity, hours of television viewing, and negatively by a high parental educational level. No significant association was found between children's BMI and physical activity. Intervention and prevention measures should be targeted at the reduction of sedentary activities, especially television viewing, and promotion of physical activity. These measures should be directed at families that are affected and/or concerned with obesity.

### Identification of ten loci associated with height highlights new biological pathways in human growth [^111QqBSu]. Nature Genetics (2008). Medium credibility.

Height is a classic polygenic trait, reflecting the combined influence of multiple as-yet-undiscovered genetic factors. We carried out a meta-analysis of genome-wide association study data of height from 15,821 individuals at 2.2 million SNPs, and followed up the strongest findings in > 10,000 subjects. Ten newly identified and two previously reported loci were strongly associated with variation in height (P values from 4 x 10(-7) to 8 x 10(-22)). Together, these 12 loci account for approximately 2% of the population variation in height. Individuals with ≤ 8 height-increasing alleles and ≥ 16 height-increasing alleles differ in height by approximately 3.5 cm. The newly identified loci, along with several additional loci with strongly suggestive associations, encompass both strong biological candidates and unexpected genes, and highlight several pathways (let-7 targets, chromatin remodeling proteins and Hedgehog signaling) as important regulators of human stature. These results expand the picture of the biological regulation of human height and of the genetic architecture of this classical complex trait.

### Electronic health record mid-parental height auto-calculator for growth assessment in primary care [^114ZYBCv]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Primary care providers are charged with distinguishing children with an underlying growth problem from those with healthy variant short stature. Knowing the heights of the biological parents aids in making that decision. This study sought to determine the feasibility and functionality of an electronic mid-parental height (MPH) auto-calculator in the clinical assessment of child growth in a pediatric primary care setting. Clinicians completed surveys for 62% of 6803 children (mean height 13 ± 7 percentile) with recorded parent heights. Collecting parent height data required < 30 seconds in 91% of encounters. The MPH tool confirmed clinicians' initial growth assessment in 79% of cases and changed it in 4%; the remainder did not use the tool. Clinicians who changed assessment were more likely (P < .0001) to pursue more comprehensive evaluation. The MPH tool was a quick, functional resource as a component of an electronic health record system in actual, busy, pediatric primary care practices.

### Abusive head trauma in infants and children: technical report [^113XD5Zb]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Accidental trauma differential — obtaining an optimal history and estimating fall heights notes that there are few quantitative studies regarding the most reliable way to elicit a history, but some methods have been suggested, including facilitating an initial uninterrupted narrative of the history, and gathering specific details has been recommended (positioning/holding, impacted anatomic structures and surfaces, and from what height the child fell); most standard furniture dimensions include couches and other seating heights about 18 to 20 inches, beds 1 to 3 feet, and changing tables and countertops 2.5 to 3 feet; children held by parents at shoulder level typically have head-to-ground falls of approximately 4 to 5 feet; biomechanical scene reconstructions have shown that most caregivers overestimate fall height; and most papers define low-height or short-distance falls as under 3 to 4 feet.

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^112qrAyw]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic short stature (ISS) management — In the United States, for children who meet FDA criteria, we suggest a shared decision‑making approach to pursuing growth hormone (GH) treatment for a child with ISS, and we recommend against the routine use of GH in every child with height standard deviation score (HtSDS) less than −2.25. We suggest a follow‑up assessment of benefit in HtSDS and psychosocial impact 12 months after GH initiation and dose optimization. GH increases adult height (AH) in some children with ISS; ISS is heterogeneous and includes familial ISS and nonfamilial ISS, both with and without pubertal delay, and genetic disorders affecting the growth plate such as SHOX and NPR2 defects must be excluded with attention to body proportions. Patients with ISS and their families should be counseled that responses vary and that, on average, there will be an approximately 5‑cm (2‑inch) increase in AH.

### Genetics of early growth traits [^111yKakE]. Human Molecular Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

In recent years, genome-wide association studies have shed light on the genetics of early growth and its links with later-life health outcomes. Large-scale datasets and meta-analyses, combined with recently developed analytical methods, have enabled dissection of the maternal and fetal genetic contributions to variation in birth weight. Additionally, longitudinal approaches have shown differences between the genetic contributions to infant, childhood and adult adiposity. In contrast, studies of adult height loci have shown strong associations with early body length and childhood height. Early growth-associated loci provide useful tools for causal analyses: Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have provided evidence that early BMI and height are causally related to a number of adult health outcomes. We advise caution in the design and interpretation of MR studies of birth weight investigating effects of fetal growth on later-life cardiometabolic disease because birth weight is only a crude indicator of fetal growth, and the choice of genetic instrument (maternal or fetal) will greatly influence the interpretation of the results. Most genetic studies of early growth have to date centered on European-ancestry participants and outcomes measured at a single time-point, so key priorities for future studies of early growth genetics are aggregation of large samples of diverse ancestries and longitudinal studies of growth trajectories.

### Validity of parent-reported weight and height of preschool children measured at home or estimated without home measurement: a validation study [^1144eLDU]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Parental reports are often used in large-scale surveys to assess children's body mass index (BMI). Therefore, it is important to know to what extent these parental reports are valid and whether it makes a difference if the parents measured their children's weight and height at home or whether they simply estimated these values. The aim of this study is to compare the validity of parent-reported height, weight and BMI values of preschool children (3–7 y-old), when measured at home or estimated by parents without actual measurement.

Methods

The subjects were 297 Belgian preschool children (52.9% male). Participation rate was 73%. A questionnaire including questions about height and weight of the children was completed by the parents. Nurses measured height and weight following standardised procedures. International age- and sex-specific BMI cut-off values were employed to determine categories of weight status and obesity.

Results

On the group level, no important differences in accuracy of reported height, weight and BMI were identified between parent-measured or estimated values. However, for all 3 parameters, the correlations between parental reports and nurse measurements were higher in the group of children whose body dimensions were measured by the parents. Sensitivity for underweight and overweight/obesity were respectively 73% and 47% when parents measured their child's height and weight, and 55% and 47% when parents estimated values without measurement. Specificity for underweight and overweight/obesity were respectively 82% and 97% when parents measured the children, and 75% and 93% with parent estimations.

Conclusions

Diagnostic measures were more accurate when parents measured their child's weight and height at home than when those dimensions were based on parental judgements. When parent-reported data on an individual level is used, the accuracy could be improved by encouraging the parents to measure weight and height of their children at home.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^116wPT3L]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity — diagnosis recommendations define preferred measures and thresholds and related genetic considerations. We recommend the use of the BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), with CDC-derived normative percentiles, as the preferred method for the diagnosis of the overweight or obese child (48). We recommend that a child be diagnosed as overweight if the BMI is in at least the 85th percentile but < the 95th percentile for age and sex, and as obese if the BMI is at least the 95th percentile for age and sex. We recommend against a routine laboratory evaluation for endocrine causes of obesity in obese children or early to midpubertal obese adolescents unless the child's height velocity, assessed in relation to stage of puberty and family background, is attenuated. We recommend referral to a geneticist for children whose obesity has a syndromic etiology, especially in the presence of neurodevelopmental abnormalities. We suggest that parents of children who have inexorably gained weight from early infancy and have risen above the 97th percentile for weight by 3 yr of age be informed of the availability of MC4R genetic testing; however, the test is positive in only 2–4% of such patients who are above the 97th percentile for weight and currently will not alter treatment. We recommend that children with a BMI in at least the 85th percentile be evaluated for associated comorbidities and complications.

### Genetic architecture reconciles linkage and association studies of complex traits [^114Uztrg]. Nature Genetics (2024). High credibility.

Linkage studies have successfully mapped loci underlying monogenic disorders, but mostly failed when applied to common diseases. Conversely, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified replicable associations between thousands of SNPs and complex traits, yet capture less than half of the total heritability. In the present study we reconcile these two approaches by showing that linkage signals of height and body mass index (BMI) from 119,000 sibling pairs colocalize with GWAS-identified loci. Concordant with polygenicity, we observed the following: a genome-wide inflation of linkage test statistics; that GWAS results predict linkage signals; and that adjusting phenotypes for polygenic scores reduces linkage signals. Finally, we developed a method using recombination rate-stratified, identity-by-descent sharing between siblings to unbiasedly estimate heritability of height (0.76 ± 0.05) and BMI (0.55 ± 0.07). Our results imply that substantial heritability remains unaccounted for by GWAS-identified loci and this residual genetic variation is polygenic and enriched near these loci.

### Overcoming attenuation bias in regressions using polygenic indices [^116YvW48]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Measurement error in polygenic indices (PGIs) attenuates the estimation of their effects in regression models. We analyze and compare two approaches addressing this attenuation bias: Obviously Related Instrumental Variables (ORIV) and the PGI Repository Correction (PGI-RC). Through simulations, we show that the PGI-RC performs slightly better than ORIV, unless the prediction sample is very small (N < 1000) or when there is considerable assortative mating. Within families, ORIV is the best choice since the PGI-RC correction factor is generally not available. We verify the empirical validity of the simulations by predicting educational attainment and height in a sample of siblings from the UK Biobank. We show that applying ORIV between families increases the standardized effect of the PGI by 12% (height) and by 22% (educational attainment) compared to a meta-analysis-based PGI, yet estimates remain slightly below the PGI-RC estimates. Furthermore, within-family ORIV regression provides the tightest lower bound for the direct genetic effect, increasing the lower bound for the standardized direct genetic effect on educational attainment from 0.14 to 0.18 (+29%), and for height from 0.54 to 0.61 (+13%) compared to a meta-analysis-based PGI.

### Environmental rather than genetic factors determine the variation in the age of the infancy to childhood transition: a twins study [^116BaXFi]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Using a twins study, we sought to assess the contribution of genetic against environmental factor as they affect the age at transition from infancy to childhood (ICT).

Study Design

The subjects were 56 pairs of monozygotic twins, 106 pairs of dizygotic twins, and 106 pairs of regular siblings (SBs), for a total of 536 children. Their ICT was determined, and a variance component analysis was implemented to estimate components of the familial variance, with simultaneous adjustment for potential covariates.

Results

We found substantial contribution of the common environment shared by all types of SBs that explained 27.7% of the total variance in ICT, whereas the common twin environment explained 9.2% of the variance, gestational age 3.5%, and birth weight 1.8%. In addition, 8.7% was attributable to sex difference, but we found no detectable contribution of genetic factors to inter-individual variation in ICT age.

Conclusions

Developmental plasticity impacts much of human growth. Here we show that of the ∼50% of the variance provided to adult height by the ICT, 42.2% is attributable to adaptive cues represented by shared twin and SB environment, with no detectable genetic involvement.

### Why families matter [^112viy4r]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Serious illness puts pressure not only on individual family members but also on the family itself. The care of an acutely ill child requires the family to channel many of its resources toward a single member — an arrangement that can usually be sustained for a while but that cannot continue indefinitely while the other members do without. Illness disrupts ordinary familial functions and, if it is serious enough, threatens to break the family altogether. In this article, I argue that there are situations in which the threat to family integrity is so real and serious that the interests of parents or siblings or sometimes grandparents may override the interests of the pediatric patient.

### Parental anthropometrics, early growth and the risk of overweight in pre-school children: the generation R study [^112Beapv]. Pediatric Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There are limited data regarding the associations of both maternal and paternal anthropometrics with longitudinally measured post-natal growth measures in early childhood.

Objective

To assess the associations of maternal and paternal anthropometrics with growth characteristics and the risk of overweight in pre-school children.

Study Design

Population-based prospective cohort study from early foetal life onwards in the Netherlands.

Methods

Maternal pre-pregnancy anthropometrics and gestational weight gain, and paternal anthropometrics were related to foetal and post-natal growth measures and the risk of overweight until the age of 4 years. Analyses were based on 5674 mothers, fathers and their children.

Results

Both pre-pregnancy maternal and paternal height, weight and body mass index were associated with corresponding foetal and post-natal anthropometric measures. Maternal body mass index had a significantly stronger effect on childhood body mass index than paternal body mass index. As compared to children from parents with normal body mass index, children from two obese parents had an increased risk of overweight at the age of 4 years (odds ratio 6.52 (95% confidence interval 3.44, 12.38). Maternal gestational weight gain was only among mothers with normal body mass index associated with body mass index and the risk of overweight in the children.

Conclusion

Maternal and paternal anthropometrics affect early growth in pre-school children differently. Gestational weight gain in mothers without overweight and obesity is related to the risk of overweight in early childhood.

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^115rGqJg]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Growth hormone therapy after malignancy — neoplasia counseling and timing: We recommend informing at-risk patients about available data on the potential risks of neoplasia, and we recommend shared decision-making that involves the patient, family, oncologist, and treating endocrinologist, including sharing with families the most recent risk data and the potential effect of GH treatment on timing of second neoplasm occurrence before GH initiation. For GH initiation after completion of tumor therapy with no evidence of ongoing tumor, a standard waiting period of 12 months to establish "successful therapy" of the primary lesion is reasonable but may be altered based on individual circumstances. A technical remark notes that although many intracranial tumors are not "malignant", they can recur, and there are no data to support different observation periods than for malignant tumors before initiating GH treatment.

### Quantitative-trait-locus analysis of body-mass index and of stature, by combined analysis of genome scans of five Finnish study groups [^114hFWSk]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2001). Low credibility.

In recent years, many genomewide screens have been performed, to identify novel loci predisposing to various complex diseases. Often, only a portion of the collected clinical data from the study subjects is used in the actual analysis of the trait, and much of the phenotypic data is ignored. With proper consent, these data could subsequently be used in studies of common quantitative traits influencing human biology, and such a reanalysis method would be further justified by the nonbiased ascertainment of study individuals. To make our point, we report here a quantitative-trait-locus (QTL) analysis of body-mass index (BMI) and stature (i.e., height), with genotypic data from genome scans of five Finnish study groups. The combined study group was composed of 614 individuals from 247 families. Five study groups were originally ascertained in genetic studies on hypertension, obesity, osteoarthritis, migraine, and familial combined hyperlipidemia. Most of the families are from the Finnish Twin Cohort, which represents a population-wide sample. In each of the five genome scans, approximately 350 evenly spaced markers were genotyped on 22 autosomes. In analyzing the genotype data by a variance-component method, we found, on chromosome 7pter (maximum multipoint LOD score of 2.91), evidence for QTLs affecting stature, and a second locus, with suggestive evidence for linkage to stature, was detected on chromosome 9q (maximum multipoint LOD score of 2.61). Encouragingly, the locus on chromosome 7 is supported by the data reported by Hirschhorn et al. (in this issue), who used a similar method. We found no evidence for QTLs affecting BMI.

### Short stature is progressive in patients with heterozygous NPR2 mutations [^112imWxn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

NPR2 encodes atrial natriuretic peptide receptor B (ANPRB), a regulator of skeletal growth. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in NPR2 result in acromesomelic dysplasia Maroteaux type (AMDM; OMIM 602875), while heterozygous mutations may account for 2% to 6% of idiopathic short stature (ISS).

Objective

Describe the physical proportions and growth characteristics of an extended family with novel NPR2 mutations including members with AMDM, ISS, or normal stature.

Design and Participants

We performed whole exome sequencing in 2 healthy parents and 2 children with AMDM. Detailed genotyping and phenotyping were performed on members of a multigenerational family in an academic medical center. We expressed mutant proteins in mammalian cells and characterized expression and function.

Results

The sisters with AMDM were compound heterozygotes for missense mutations in the NPR2 gene, a novel p.P93S (maternal) and the previously reported p.R989L (paternal). Both mutant ANPRB proteins were normally expressed in HEK293T cells and exhibited dominant negative effects on wild-type ANPRB catalytic activity. Heterozygous relatives had proportionate short stature (height z-scores -2.06 ± 0.97, median ± SD) compared with their wild-type siblings (-1.37 ± 0.59). Height z-scores progressively and significantly decreased as NPR2-heterozygous children matured, while remaining constant in their wild-type siblings.

Conclusions

Biallelic NPR2 mutations cause severe skeletal dysplasia (AMDM), whereas heterozygous mutations lead to a subtler phenotype characterized by progressive short stature with by increasing loss of height potential with age.

### Cardiovascular risk factors in parents of short children born small for gestational age [^114aXSTB]. Pediatric Research (2008). Low credibility.

Small for gestational age (SGA) children have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors at a young age. It is not known whether this increased risk is caused by their size at birth, a familial predisposition for cardiovascular disease or smallness at birth or a combination of these factors. The cardiovascular risk profile of parents of SGA children is unknown. We compared anthropometry, blood pressure, fasting serum lipid, glucose, and insulin levels of 482 parents (mean age 41 y) and 286 short SGA children with age- and sex-matched references. We also investigated whether these parameters correlated between parents and their offspring. Mothers had higher systolic blood pressure, fathers had a higher body mass index and parents had more frequently high fasting glucose levels than age- and sex-matched references. Children had significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure than sex- and height-matched references. Twenty-four percent (mothers) and 10% (fathers) were born SGA but they did not have more cardiovascular risk factors than those born appropriate for gestational age. Cardiovascular risk factors did not correlate between parents and children. In conclusion, parents of short SGA children have a modest increase in some cardiovascular risk factors but risk factors did not correlate between parents and children.

### Common DNA variants predict tall stature in Europeans [^113mDuCM]. Human Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Genomic prediction of the extreme forms of adult body height or stature is of practical relevance in several areas such as pediatric endocrinology and forensic investigations. Here, we examine 770 extremely tall cases and 9,591 normal height controls in a population-based Dutch European sample to evaluate the capability of known height-associated DNA variants in predicting tall stature. Among the 180 normal height-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously reported by the Genetic Investigation of ANthropocentric Traits (GIANT) genome-wide association study on normal stature, in our data 166 (92.2%) showed directionally consistent effects and 75 (41.7%) showed nominally significant association with tall stature, indicating that the 180 GIANT SNPs are informative for tall stature in our Dutch sample. A prediction analysis based on the weighted allele sums method demonstrated a substantially improved potential for predicting tall stature (AUC = 0.75; 95% CI 0.72–0.79) compared to a previous attempt using 54 height-associated SNPs (AUC = 0.65). The achieved accuracy is approaching practical relevance such as in pediatrics and forensics. Furthermore, a reanalysis of all SNPs at the 180 GIANT loci in our data identified novel secondary association signals for extreme tall stature at TGFB2 (P = 1.8 × 10⁻¹³) and PCSK5 (P = 7.8 × 10⁻¹¹) suggesting the existence of allelic heterogeneity and underlining the importance of fine analysis of already discovered loci. Extrapolating from our results suggests that the genomic prediction of at least the extreme forms of common complex traits in humans including common diseases are likely to be informative if large numbers of trait-associated common DNA variants are available.

### Gene variants in familial short stature: a single-center study [^114bofmy]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

NPR2 variants are associated with various short stature and bone dysplasia, such as acromesomelic dysplasia Maroteaux tyoe, individuals with a phenotype similar to Léri-Weill syndrome (LWD), and idiopathic short stature (ISS). However, few studies have reported on the relationship between familial short stature (FSS) and NPR2 variants. This study aimed to explore the relationship between FSS and NPR2 variants through the detection and identification of NPR2 variants in children with FSS, phenotypic description, clear treatment plan, and follow-up of treatment effect.

Methods

Children who met the FSS diagnostic criteria and had informed consent were included in the study. The trio whole-exome sequencing method (trio-WES) was used to detect and evaluate the NPR2 variants.

Results

A total of 16 children with short stature were included in this study (pretreatment height ≤ -2 standard deviation (SD) in both the patient and the shorter parent, unknown genetic etiology). NPR2 variants were identified in 12.5%(2/16) of the participants. Patient A was a 6-year-old male and 103.7 cm tall (-3.11SD), while Patient B was a 9-year-old female and 123.2 cm tall (-1.88SD). However, their heights increased after recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment. The height of patient A increased by 0.36SD six months after treatment while that of patient B increased by 1.22SD after one and a half years of treatment.

Conclusions

NPR2 variant causes FSS. The growth rate of children significantly improved after rhGH treatment. However, further follow-up study is needed to determine the final height after long-term treatment.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116tgPPP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity — diagnosis and initial evaluation uses body mass index (BMI) with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) normative percentiles in children and adolescents ≥ 2 years of age, with overweight defined as BMI ≥ 85th percentile but < 95th percentile for age and sex, obesity as BMI ≥ 95th percentile, and extreme obesity as BMI ≥ 120% of the 95th percentile or ≥ 35 kg/m². We suggest that clinicians take into account that variations in BMI correlate differently to comorbidities according to race/ethnicity and that increased muscle mass increases BMI, and we suggest calculating, plotting, and reviewing BMI percentile at least annually during well-child and/or sick-child visits. For children < 2 years, we suggest diagnosing obesity if sex-specific weight for recumbent length is ≥ 97.7th percentile on World Health Organization charts. We recommend against routine laboratory evaluations for endocrine etiologies of pediatric obesity unless stature and/or height velocity are attenuated (assessed in relationship to genetic/familial potential and pubertal stage). We recommend evaluating for potential comorbidities when BMI is ≥ 85th percentile and recommend against measuring insulin concentrations when evaluating children or adolescents for obesity.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113BmFeq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society pediatric obesity — endocrine testing guidance states: "We recommend against routine laboratory evaluations for endocrine etiologies of pediatric obesity unless the patient's stature and/or height velocity are attenuated (assessed in relationship to genetic/familial potential and pubertal stage). (1⊕⊕⊕○)". Endocrine and syndromic causes "are rare in children and adolescents and are associated with additional symptoms", and "stature and height velocity are decreased", so "clinicians should not test for endocrine causes of obesity unless the patient is short relative to genetic potential and has decreased growth velocity against the backdrop of continued weight gain". The rule "is not inviolable", as "acquired hypothalamic obesity is a syndrome of intractable weight gain caused by hypothalamic damage from a tumor or its treatment with surgery or radiotherapy", and such patients "may have adequate growth velocity… but have tumor-related signs and symptoms or have already undergone tumor treatment". Values and preferences emphasize "limiting endocrine assessments… to those rare patients… and placed a low value on the unnecessary diagnostic endocrine laboratory screening of children and adolescents who are obese without other signs or symptoms or contributory neurosurgical history".

### Maternal depressive symptoms and attained size among children in the first 2 years of life [^114nhC8P]. Academic Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the relation of maternal depressive symptoms with attained size and whether it is stronger for young children in low-income families.

Methods

Secondary analysis was performed of longitudinal data from enrollment and parents surveys from the Healthy Steps for Young Children National Evaluation among 4745 children who made at least one visit to a Healthy Steps site. Length and weight data from medical records were converted to z scores and percentiles for length for age and weight for length at 6, 12, and 24 months using 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth standards. Analyses evaluated the relation of maternal depressive symptoms at 2 to 4 months using a modified 14-item Center for Epidemiologic Depression Scale with attained size and child, maternal, and family characteristics. Regression models estimated the relation of symptoms with z scores and logistic regression the relation for short stature (below 10th percentile for length for age), adjusted for covariates.

Results

Maternal depressive symptoms were associated with z scores for length for age at 6, 12, and 24 months and short stature at 6 and 24 months for children in low/middle-income families. The z scores at 24 months remained significantly lower for children in low/middle-income families whose mothers reported depressive symptoms, after adjustment for covariates. The odds of short stature were significantly increased at 6 months in the total sample and among low/middle-income families for children whose mothers reported symptoms. Other measures of attained size were not associated with depressive symptoms.

Conclusions

The link between maternal symptoms and young children's risk of short stature reinforces recommendations for increased screening for postpartum depressive symptoms and for clinicians to review growth charts with parents for impaired/unfavorable patterns.

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^116QLpQP]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic short stature (ISS) — GH counseling, monitoring, and dosing state that patients and their parents/guardians should be counseled that not starting GH therapy at all is an option, and since not all children with ISS will respond to GH therapy, HtSDS improvement after 12 months of therapy should be assessed and the discontinuation of GH therapy should be considered if adequate height gain has not been achieved; patients should be monitored for changes in psychological functioning and quality of life. Because there is overlap in response between dosing groups, we suggest initiating GH at a dose of 0.24 mg/ kg/week, with some patients requiring up to 0.47 mg/kg/ week; given the unresolved long-term risks of treatment, there should be caution in using higher doses, and GH therapy should be discontinued in patients who do not respond.

### Comparison of measured and parents' reported height and weight in children and adolescents [^112iJqaR]. Obesity (2011). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to (i) compare parent-reported height and weight to measured height and weight in children between ages 2 and 17 years, (ii) investigate correlations between magnitude of error of parent-reported data or refusal to estimate height and weight with gender, race/ethnicity, child's age, and age-specific BMI z-score, and (iii) determine sensitivity and specificity of identifying obese youth based on parent-reported data. The authors studied 1,430 consecutive outpatients between ages 2 and 17 years at an outpatient orthopedic clinic. At the initial visit, parents completed a questionnaire including their child's height and weight; height and weight were then measured. Mean height error was very small, with slight overestimation in boys and underestimation in girls. Mean weight error increased with age (P < 0.001), and girls had a larger mean weight error (1.29 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65, 1.45) than boys (0.85 kg, 95% CI: 0.8: 0.58, 1.12). Mean weight error also increased with age-specific BMI z-score (r = 0.32, P < 0.001). Correlation between weight error and age-specific BMI z-score was higher among black children (r = 0.45, P < 0.001) than among Hispanic children (r = 0.37, P < 0.001) and was lowest among white children (r = 0.29, P < 0.001). Refusal or inability to estimate weight did not correlate with age-specific BMI z-score. Twenty-one percent of children who were obese would not be identified by using parent-reported data to calculate the BMI.

### The reassuring and misleading myth of familial short stature… [^117JdiVW]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Tamaro G, Fachin A, Tornese G. The Reassuring and Misleading Myth of Familial Short Stature. JAMA Pediatr. Published online July 07, 2025. doi:
10. 1001/jamapediatrics.
2025. 1880. To the Editor We read with interest the Patient Page by Walsh and Thompson, 1 which addresses parental concerns about childhood growth. While we commend the authors for providing clear and accessible guidance, we respectfully believe that the statement, "Children who have short parents, for example, may naturally fall below average height but still be developing normally, " may be misleading and warrants clarification.

### Tall girls… [^111sUvyF]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Children at risk for tall stature due to acromegaly thus became the first recipients of estrogen and testosterone therapy for prevention of excess growth during the 1940s. 6 Clinical trials revealed that estrogen preparations, in contrast to testosterone preparations, were particularly successful for preventing tall stature in children with acromegaly. As a consequence, physicians naturally considered whether the same treatment could be applied in other settings. Girls with constitutional tall stature represented a potential group of patients for whom hormone therapy might prevent further growth, an outcome that some considered desirable.

The scientific literature details that parents were concerned about the social implications of their daughters being too tall, including difficulty and expense in finding clothes that fit, lack of interest in schoolwork and play, and future difficulty in finding employment in some careers, such as air hostess, classical ballet dancer, or military or airline pilot. 17 There was also discussion of the negative psychosocial effects of excessively tall stature, which included depression, social withdrawal, and even "kyphosis an effort to appear smaller and more like the others. "18. This was a relational view of height in which women's height was seen in relation to men's height. These sorts of norms were reflected in the medical rationale for estrogen treatment of girls but not boys. Tall girls were said to be dissatisfied with the "prospect of towering over the average male. "24 They were "less attractive than their shorter, more graceful sisters.

"25 Thus, physicians were charged with preventing excess growth to increase a girl's physical desirability and her chances of a successful marriage. This skepticism may have led to a diminishing interest in the estrogen treatment of tall girls, which was reflected in physician surveys. Whereas mostly girls were evaluated for tall stature and were treated with estrogen in the past, twice as many boys than girls are evaluated for short stature and are treated with GH today. 65, 66 In his book Better Than Well: American Medicine Meets the American Dream, philosopher Carl Elliott argues that one of the sociologic reasons.

Although the increasing social value of height for girls as well as the increasing concern about the adverse effects of estrogen therapy likely influenced the decline in the use of estrogen therapy, the use of GH therapy for short males has replaced estrogen therapy as a means for preventing what was and might still be considered the union most offensive to taste: the union of a tall woman with a short man. 23 In essence, GH treatment of short stature in boys could be considered the 21st-century counterpart to estrogen treatment of tall stature in girls.
