## Question

Treatment for hyperosmolar, nonketotic, hyperglycemia, ivy, fluids

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment approach for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), including the role of fluids and other management steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing HHS from DKA. Then, I should verify the initial priorities, especially fluid resuscitation before insulin. Next, I will examine fluid selection, rates, and targets for osmolality and glucose decline. After that, I need to check insulin timing, dosing, and when to add dextrose. I will then review electrolyte management, particularly potassium, and monitoring cadence. Finally, I should consider precipitating causes, complications, special populations, and the transition plan to subcutaneous insulin, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and severity markers so I don't conflate HHS with DKA. HHS typically presents with marked hyperglycemia, serum glucose usually ≥ 30 mmol/L, serum osmolality ≥ 320 mOsm/kg, minimal or absent ketones, and no significant metabolic acidosis, often with altered mental status; these features distinguish it from DKA, where ketonemia and acidosis predominate, and they anchor both risk stratification and treatment pacing [^113mexdo] [^111BFQNg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about insulin timing. I need to ensure fluids come first because HHS patients are profoundly volume depleted and early insulin without adequate intravascular expansion risks osmotic shifts and circulatory collapse. Fluids alone will lower glucose and osmolality initially, so insulin should be withheld until glucose decline slows or ketonaemia is present, with a target glucose fall of about 3–5 mmol/L/h and osmolality decline of 3–8 mOsm/kg/h to mitigate cerebral edema and osmotic demyelination risk [^112kBuT8] [^115Dc9mH] [^113mexdo].

> Next, I should review fluid choice and initial resuscitation strategy. Isotonic 0.9% saline is the principal crystalloid to restore circulating volume. In adults without renal or cardiac compromise, start 500–1000 mL/h for the first 2–4 hours, then tailor to blood pressure, heart rate, urine output, and sodium trajectory, aiming to replace roughly half the estimated deficit in the first 12 hours and the remainder over the next 12–24 hours, while watching for fluid overload in older adults or those with heart failure [^112YtsdG] [^112kBuT8] [^113XSYQ9].

> Wait, let me verify the sodium and osmolality interplay so I don't misinterpret a rising sodium as a reason to switch to hypotonic fluids too early. As glucose falls, measured serum sodium will rise by about 2.4 mmol/L for each 5.5 mmol/L glucose decrease. This is expected and not an indication for hypotonic fluids unless the osmolality is not declining or the sodium rise is disproportionate, in which case a cautious switch to 0.45% saline may be considered, but never fluids less dilute than 0.45% saline, and the overall sodium correction should not exceed about 10 mmol/L in 24 hours to avoid osmotic demyelination [^113mexdo] [^112kBuT8].

> I will now examine insulin initiation and dosing once glucose decline plateaus with fluids alone. A fixed-rate intravenous insulin infusion at 0.05 units/kg/h is recommended in HHS, lower than DKA, with avoidance of an initial bolus; if already on an infusion, increasing by 1 unit/h is reasonable, and I should double-check that glucose is falling by 3–5 mmol/L/h; if faster, I risk rapid osmotic shifts, and if slower, I should reassess fluids and renal function before escalating insulin [^115Dc9mH] [^112kBuT8] [^113XSYQ9].

> Let me consider when to add dextrose so I don't overshoot hypoglycemia. Once plasma glucose falls below about 14 mmol/L, I should start 5% or 10% dextrose alongside the insulin infusion to maintain a glucose target of roughly 10–15 mmol/L during the first 24 hours, preventing hypoglycemia and allowing continued correction of osmolality; I need to ensure the dextrose rate matches the insulin dose to keep the glucose decline gradual [^112kBuT8] [^113XSYQ9] [^115Dc9mH].

> Next, I should review potassium management because insulin shifts potassium intracellularly and total body potassium is often depleted despite normal or high initial levels. I should replace potassium once urine output is established and renal function is adequate, typically adding 40 mmol/L to replacement fluids with adjustments based on frequent checks; if potassium is below 3.5 mmol/L, I need to be cautious and may delay or reduce insulin until potassium is partially corrected to avoid life-threatening arrhythmias [^112LPPZ5] [^112kBuT8] [^113XSYQ9].

> I need to ensure the monitoring cadence matches the dynamic physiology. Initially, I should check glucose and electrolytes frequently, often hourly for glucose and every 2–4 hours for sodium, potassium, renal function, and calculated osmolality, with continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring. Tracking the rate of change in osmolality, sodium, and glucose on a chart helps me avoid rapid shifts and detect deviations early [^112kBuT8] [^113XSYQ9] [^111DgsB3].

> But wait, what if there is an underlying precipitant driving the crisis. I should actively search for infection, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, pancreatitis, or medication triggers such as glucocorticoids or SGLT2 inhibitors, and treat them in parallel; infection may be occult without fever in older adults, so a low threshold for cultures and empiric antibiotics is prudent while avoiding unnecessary bicarbonate, which does not improve outcomes in DKA and is not indicated in isolated HHS [^112kBuT8] [^116qrwBw] [^1163TwTf].

> I should double-check for complications and prophylaxis that change outcomes. HHS carries a high thrombotic risk, so prophylactic low molecular weight heparin is recommended for the duration of admission unless contraindicated; I also need to monitor for rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, and, in pediatrics, cerebral edema, adjusting therapy to prevent rapid osmolar shifts and ensuring adequate perfusion while avoiding fluid overload [^1154kcnM] [^112kBuT8] [^113XSYQ9].

> Let me think about special populations because adult protocols cannot be directly transplanted to children. In pediatrics, HHS is increasingly recognized and may present with mixed DKA/HHS features; fluids should start with 20 mL/kg isotonic saline boluses, then transition to 0.45–0.75% saline to replace deficits over 24–48 hours, insulin should be delayed until after initial resuscitation and used at lower doses (0.025–0.05 units/kg/h), and osmolality should not fall faster than about 3 mOsm/kg/h to mitigate cerebral edema risk; children generally require ICU-level care and meticulous monitoring [^115KxMA7] [^117TyXp9] [^113Sc85i].

> Hold on, I should verify the transition plan to subcutaneous insulin so rebound hyperglycemia doesn't occur. Before stopping the IV insulin infusion, I need to administer basal subcutaneous insulin 2–4 hours prior and continue dextrose as needed. Resolution of HHS is best defined holistically by osmolality less than 300 mOsm/kg, correction of hypovolemia with urine output at least 0.5 mL/kg/h, return of cognition to baseline, and glucose below about 15 mmol/L, recognizing that full electrolyte normalization may take up to 72 hours [^1163TwTf] [^116tgibD] [^114Hdgjd].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said to use bicarbonate if the pH is low. I should correct that. Routine bicarbonate is not recommended in hyperglycemic crises, and in HHS without significant acidosis it has no role; instead, I should focus on fluids, electrolytes, insulin, and treating the precipitant, reserving bicarbonate only for exceptional circumstances in DKA with pH less than 6.9, and even then evidence is limited [^1163TwTf] [^112kBuT8].

> Let me reconsider the key principle to ensure internal consistency. The safest, evidence-aligned approach is to prioritize isotonic crystalloid resuscitation, correct osmolality and glucose gradually with close monitoring, delay insulin until after initial volume repletion unless ketonaemia mandates earlier therapy, replace potassium proactively, and transition thoughtfully to subcutaneous insulin while addressing precipitating causes and complications, aligning with ADA and JBDS guidance and contemporary reviews [^11244uoH] [^112kBuT8] [^113iRuC9].

The cornerstone of HHS management is **isotonic saline first** [^112YtsdG] to restore intravascular volume and perfusion, then transition to hypotonic fluids as glucose falls to correct free-water deficits [^113mexdo]. Start with **1–1.5 L 0.9% NaCl boluses** [^112YtsdG] for shock, then 500–1000 mL/h for 2–4 h [^112YtsdG], then tailor to a positive balance of 3–6 L by 12 h and full correction over 24–48 h [^114LGv4x] [^112YtsdG]. Add **potassium** [^112LPPZ5] early once urine output is present, and start insulin only after fluids have stabilized glucose and perfusion [^112kBuT8] [^115Dc9mH]. Monitor glucose, sodium, and osmolality closely to avoid rapid shifts and cerebral edema [^111DgsB3] [^115Fcj6U].

## Initial fluid resuscitation

### First-line fluid: isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl)

- **Rationale**: Restores intravascular volume, improves perfusion, and reduces hyperosmolality [^112YtsdG] [^113mexdo].
- **Initial bolus**: 1–1.5 L rapidly (15–30 min) for shock or severe hypovolemia [^notfound].
- **Subsequent rate**: 500–1000 mL/h for the first 2–4 h, then adjust to clinical response and comorbidities [^112YtsdG] [^112kBuT8].

---

### Transition to hypotonic fluids

After glucose declines below 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L), switch to **0.45% saline** to replace free-water deficits and avoid hypernatremia [^notfound]. Typical total fluid needs are 100–220 mL/kg (about 9–12 L in adults), corrected over 24–48 h [^116qrwBw] [^113XSYQ9].

---

## Electrolyte management

### Potassium replacement

- **Timing**: Start once urine output is established and serum potassium is ≤ 5.0 mmol/L [^notfound].
- **Dosing**: 20–40 mmol/L added to IV fluids, titrated to maintain 3.5–5.0 mmol/L [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Check potassium every 2–4 h initially, then every 4–6 h as stable [^notfound].

---

### Sodium correction

Serum sodium may rise as glucose falls; this is expected and not an indication for hypotonic fluids unless osmolality fails to decline [^113mexdo]. Limit the **sodium correction rate** to ≤ 10 mmol/L per 24 h to avoid osmotic demyelination [^113mexdo].

---

## Insulin therapy

Insulin is **not started initially**; begin only after fluids have improved perfusion and glucose is no longer falling with fluids alone [^112kBuT8] [^115Dc9mH]. Use a fixed-rate IV insulin infusion at 0.05 units/kg/h, with no initial bolus, and titrate to a glucose decline of 3–5 mmol/L/h (54–90 mg/dL/h) [^115Dc9mH].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

- **Glucose**: Hourly initially, then every 2–4 h as stable [^112s3yXY].
- **Electrolytes**: Sodium, potassium, and osmolality every 2–4 h initially [^112s3yXY].
- **Clinical status**: Continuous monitoring of mental status, urine output, and vital signs [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications of fluid therapy

- **Cerebral edema**: Risk from rapid osmotic shifts; correct glucose and osmolality gradually [^111DgsB3] [^115Fcj6U].
- **Fluid overload**: Monitor for pulmonary edema, especially in elderly or cardiac patients [^112YtsdG].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia and hypernatremia are common; monitor and correct carefully [^112LPPZ5] [^113mexdo].

## Summary of fluid management protocol

| **Phase** | **Fluid type** | **Rate** | **Goal** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Initial resuscitation | 0.9% saline | 1–1.5 L bolus | Restore perfusion |
| First 2–4 h | 0.9% saline | 500–1000 mL/h | Replace intravascular volume |
| After glucose < 300 mg/dL | 0.45% saline | Adjust to maintain positive balance | Correct free-water deficit |
| Potassium replacement | KCl in fluids | 20–40 mmol/L | Maintain 3.5–5.0 mmol/L |

---

Effective HHS care hinges on **isotonic saline first** to stabilize perfusion, followed by hypotonic fluids to correct free-water deficits, with electrolytes and insulin titrated to prevent rapid osmotic shifts and complications [^112YtsdG] [^112kBuT8].

### Diabetic emergencies-ketoacidosis, hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state and hypoglycaemia [^1137CeQZ]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) and hypoglycaemia are serious complications of diabetes mellitus that require prompt recognition, diagnosis and treatment. DKA and HHS are characterized by insulinopaenia and severe hyperglycaemia; clinically, these two conditions differ only by the degree of dehydration and the severity of metabolic acidosis. The overall mortality recorded among children and adults with DKA is < 1%. Mortality among patients with HHS is ~10-fold higher than that associated with DKA. The prognosis and outcome of patients with DKA or HHS are determined by the severity of dehydration, the presence of comorbidities and age > 60 years. The estimated annual cost of hospital treatment for patients experiencing hyperglycaemic crises in the USA exceeds US$2 billion. Hypoglycaemia is a frequent and serious adverse effect of antidiabetic therapy that is associated with both immediate and delayed adverse clinical outcomes, as well as increased economic costs. Inpatients who develop hypoglycaemia are likely to experience a long duration of hospital stay and increased mortality. This Review describes the clinical presentation, precipitating causes, diagnosis and acute management of these diabetic emergencies, including a discussion of practical strategies for their prevention.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) contribute significantly to the estimated US$174 billion annual cost of diabetes mellitus. Of the $116 billion in medical expenditures attributed to diabetes, approximately 50% ($58 billion) are inpatient costs.DKA and HHS are managed initially by hospital emergency departments (EDs), followed by inpatient medical care. A typical ED visit involves at least a 4-hour wait time, is inconvenient, and the average costs for a visit without admission are estimated at ≥ $1000. Wait time in the ED has increased in the last decade due to an increasing number of patients using the ED at the same time that more EDs are closing their doors.

Nationally recognized management protocols only exist for hospital settings. These protocols exist as initial treatment after the DKA or HHS diagnosis has been established. There is evidence to suggest type 1 diabetes patients with mild DKA can be managed with rapid-acting insulin analogs in an outpatient setting.–It is currently unknown if symptomatic, mild hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes patients can be managed adequately in an outpatient setting. Most diabetes education centers have policies and procedures to contact physicians when a patient presents with high blood glucose (BG) levels. However, no established outpatient hyperglycemia protocol exists. The literature does describe common causes of acute metabolic decompensation: acute illness (ie, infection, myocardial infection), noncompliance with treatment, and new-onset diabetes. Significant contributing factors within the noncompliance group are omission of insulin therapy and substance abuse (especially alcohol and cocaine). Even using the costs in 1998, national estimates for hospitalization for diabetic emergencies are high at $10,876, with an average length of stay of 6.6 days.

### Hyperglycemic crises in adults with diabetes: a consensus report [^112YtsdG]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer isotonic saline or balanced crystalloid solutions at an initial rate of 500–1,000 mL/h during the first 2–4 hours in adult patients with DKA or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state without renal or cardiac compromise. Decide on the subsequent choice for fluid replacement after restoration of intravascular volume based on the state of hydration assessed by BP, HR, fluid input-output balance, and sodium concentration, correcting estimated fluid deficits within the first 24–48 hours. Use caution when rapidly replacing fluids in patients at high risk of fluid overload, including older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with heart or kidney disease or other serious comorbidities.

3 MIXED DKA/HHS

In HHS there is usually no significant ketosis/ketonaemia (blood ketones ≤ 3.0 mmol/L), although a mild acidosis (pH < 7.3, bicarbonate > 15.0 mmol/L) may accompany those affected by acute kidney injury or severe sepsis. Some people have severe hypertonicity and ketosis and acidosis (mixed DKA and HHS). This situation is likely to reflect a relative insulin deficiency due to beta cell exhaustion as a result of temporary glucotoxicity and excess counter‐regulatory hormone production. These individuals may require a modification of this treatment guideline to take into account which aspect predominates. If a predominant diagnosis is unclear (HHS vs. mixed HHS/DKA), early specialist input should be sought to help tailor management according to the individual's need. However, if ketone concentrations are high (blood ketones > 3.0 mmol/L), then the DKA protocol may be appropriate (Figure 4).

FIGURE 4
The overlap between diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) and how to approach management.

Treat as mixed DKA/HHS if all the following criteria are met: marked hypovolaemia, marked hyperosmolality (osmolality ≥ 320 mOsm/kg), pH < 7.3, bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L and blood ketones > 3.0 mmol/L. Start a Fixed Rate Intravenous Insulin Infusion (FRIII) and IV fluids immediately and treat according to DKA pathway using 0.1 units/kg/h. IV fluid replacement should aim to achieve a positive balance of 3–6 L during the first 12 h and the remaining replacement of estimated fluid loss during the following 12 h, although complete normalisation of biochemistry may take up to 72 h.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^115Duguh]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is the most serious acute complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Emergency department management focuses on prompt diagnosis and restoration of hemodynamic stability with appropriate fluid therapy while maintaining electrolyte homeostasis. Identification of any precipitating illness is essential. The emergence of HHS as a critical presentation of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adolescents is highlighted.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^114LxCFu]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is a life-threatening emergency manifested by marked elevation of blood glucose, hyperosmolarity, and little or no ketosis. With the dramatic increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the aging population, this condition may be encountered more frequently by family physicians in the future. Although the precipitating causes are numerous, underlying infections are the most common. Other causes include certain medications, non-compliance, undiagnosed diabetes, substance abuse, and coexisting disease. Physical findings of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state include those associated with profound dehydration and various neurologic symptoms such as coma. The first step of treatment involves careful monitoring of the patient and laboratory values. Vigorous correction of dehydration with the use of normal saline is critical, requiring an average of 9 L in 48 hours. After urine output has been established, potassium replacement should begin. Once fluid replacement has been initiated, insulin should be given as an initial bolus of 0.15 U per kg intravenously, followed by a drip of 0.1 U per kg per hour until the blood glucose level falls to between 250 and 300 mg per dL. Identification and treatment of the underlying and precipitating causes are necessary. It is important to monitor the patient for complications such as vascular occlusions (e.g., mesenteric artery occlusion, myocardial infarction, low-flow syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy) and rhabdomyolysis. Finally, physicians should focus on preventing future episodes using patient education and instruction in self-monitoring.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^116qrwBw]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is a life-threatening emergency manifested by marked elevation of blood glucose and hyperosmolarity with little or no ketosis. Although there are multiple precipitating causes, underlying infections are the most common. Other causes include certain medications, nonadherence to therapy, undiagnosed diabetes mellitus, substance abuse, and coexisting disease. In children and adolescents, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is often present when type 2 diabetes is diagnosed. Physical findings include profound dehydration and neurologic symptoms ranging from lethargy to coma. Treatment begins with intensive monitoring of the patient and laboratory values, especially glucose, sodium, and potassium levels. Vigorous correction of dehydration is critical, requiring an average of 9 L of 0.9% saline over 48 hours in adults. After urine output is established, potassium replacement should begin. Once dehydration is partially corrected, adults should receive an initial bolus of 0.1 units of intravenous insulin per kg of body weight, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 units per kg per hour (or a continuous infusion of 0.14 units per kg per hour without an initial bolus) until the blood glucose level decreases below 300 mg per dL. In children and adolescents, dehydration should be corrected at a rate of no more than 3 mOsm per hour to avoid cerebral edema. Identification and treatment of underlying and precipitating causes are necessary.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^115KxMA7]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) fluid therapy — initial management should focus on volume expansion and perfusion restoration, with a minimum initial bolus of 20 mL/kg of isotonic saline solution (0.9% NaCl) and assumed fluid deficits of approximately 12% to 15% of body weight; subsequently, 0.45% to 0.75% NaCl should be given to replace the deficit over 24 to 48 hours, and isotonic fluids are recommended initially then followed by more hypotonic (0.45%-0.75% saline solution) fluids, with isotonic fluids restarted if perfusion and hemodynamic status worsen as osmolality declines; administration of isotonic fluids (0.9% saline solution) during ongoing osmotic diuresis may increase serum sodium concentration, which is undesirable as it may perpetuate the hyperosmolar state.

### Management of toxicity to isoform α-specific PI3K inhibitors [^11578zGR]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemia, which typically appears within the first two cycles of treatment, has been reported in the range of 51%–65% of patients taking alpelisib with endocrine therapy in clinical trials and was the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse event leading to dose reduction or discontinuation of the drug. However, the majority of patients present with grade 1 or 2 hyperglycemia, which is usually asymptomatic and manageable with diabetes medications. Hyperosmolar and ketoacidotic states are extremely rare but may occur in patients with pre-existing diabetes. To avoid these issues, phase III clinical trials with PI3K inhibitors only include patients with a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≤ 140 mg/dl and HbA1c < 6.5%.

Upon treatment initiation, it may be helpful to instruct patients to follow dietary guidelines according to local and/or institutional standards for management of diabetes, such as those provided by the American Diabetes Association (e.g. small frequent meals, low carbohydrate content, high fiber, balancing carbohydrates over the course of the day, three small meals and two small snacks rather than one large meal), as this strategy may help minimize the severity of hyperglycemia.

### Malignant hyperthermia associated with diabetic hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic state in a young man [^111kR8aW]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a rare complication that often leads to adverse outcomes, catastrophic events, or death. Although various risk factors and underlying diseases are associated with this condition, unusual presentations may be missed. Malignant hyperthermia is an uncommon complication encountered during the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. We present a case of an MH-like syndrome in a young Hispanic man who was diagnosed with new-onset diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic state. The patient had no obvious risk or precipitating factors for MH.

### Severe complications after initial management of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome and diabetic ketoacidosis with a standard diabetic ketoacidosis protocol [^115GLRMT]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is a clinical entity not identical to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and with a markedly higher mortality. Children with HHS can also present with concomitant DKA. Patients with HHS (with or without DKA) are profoundly dehydrated but often receive inadequate fluid resuscitation as well as intravenous insulin therapy based on traditional DKA protocols, and this can lead to devastating consequences. In this article, we briefly review HHS along with a report of an adolescent who presented with HHS and DKA and was initially managed as DKA. She went into hypotensive shock and developed severe, multiorgan failure. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of HHS and its differences from DKA in terms of initial management is crucial to guide management and improve outcomes. Additionally, fluid therapy in amounts concordant with the degree of dehydration remains the mainstay therapy.

2.2 Biochemical abnormalities

HHS should not be diagnosed using biochemical parameters alone. However, the blood glucose is markedly raised (usually ≥ 30 mmol/L), as is the osmolality (usually ≥ 320 mOsm/kg). Osmolality is useful as an indicator of severity and for monitoring the rate of change with treatment. Serum osmolality is often provided in biochemistry reports, either calculated or measured, but can be calculated using the formula [(2×Na +) + glucose + urea]. This formula gives the best approximation to measured osmolality, although a more accurate formula has been derived. For the sake of clarity, calculated osmolarity and measured osmolality is referred to as osmolality in this guideline. Urea is not an effective osmolyte but including it in the calculation is important in the hyperosmolar state, as it is one of the indicators of severe dehydration. The laboratory calculation may use a different formula and that laboratory measurement is a batched procedure, that is, may run once a day, so not usually available for rapid repeat measurements unless it is discussed with the laboratory. An increasing number of emergency departments and critical care units use blood gases machines that provide point of care measurement of osmolality.

Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic State (HHS) is a medical emergency associated with high mortality. It occurs less frequently than diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), affects those with pre-existing/new type 2 diabetes mellitus and increasingly affecting children/younger adults. Mixed DKA/HHS may occur. The JBDS HHS care pathway consists of 3 themes (clinical assessment and monitoring, interventions, assessments and prevention of harm) and 5 phases of therapy (0–60min, 1–6, 6–12, 12–24 and 24–72h). Clinical features of HHS include marked hypovolaemia, osmolality ≥ 320mOsm/kg using [(2×Na +)+glucose+urea], marked hyperglycaemia ≥ 30mmol/L, without significant ketonaemia (≤ 3.0mmol/L), without significant acidosis (pH > 7.3) and bicarbonate ≥ 15mmol/L. Aims of the therapy are to improve clinical status/replace fluid losses by 24h, gradual decline in osmolality (3.0–8.0 mOsm/kg/h to minimise the risk of neurological complications), blood glucose 10–15mmol/L in the first 24h, prevent hypoglycaemia/hypokalaemia and prevent harm (VTE, osmotic demyelination, fluid overload, foot ulceration). Underlying precipitants must be identified and treated. Interventions include: (1) intravenous (IV) 0.9% sodium chloride to restore circulating volume (fluid losses 100–220ml/kg, caution in elderly), (2) fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) should be commenced once osmolality stops falling with fluid replacement unless there is ketonaemia (FRIII should be commenced at the same time as IV fluids). (3) glucose infusion (5% or 10%) should be started once glucose < 14mmol/L and (4) potassium replacement according to potassium levels. HHS resolution criteria are: osmolality < 300mOsm/kg, hypovolaemia corrected (urine output ≥ 0.5 ml/kg/h), cognitive status returned to pre-morbid state and blood glucose < 15mmol/L.

Nonketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is found mostly in type 2 diabetic patients with marked hyperglycemia. HHS is a metabolic emergency and is associated with a high mortality rate. It is characterized by extreme dehydration and neurologic symptoms, which are related directly to the degree of hyperosmolality. We describe a 65-year-old patient who was admitted because of impaired consciousness caused by HHS. The relevant clinical and laboratory findings are discussed, and a brief overview of the pathophysiology and therapeutic management is provided.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in the pediatric patient: a case report and review of the literature [^114iGk7V]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is a potentially deadly complication of diabetes mellitus that can often be the presenting symptom of the condition in the pediatric population. There is a danger that HHS may not be included in the differential of critical patients because it is still a somewhat rare entity in the pediatric population. However, recent data regarding population trends indicate that HHS will continue to appear more and more commonly in the pediatric population with diabetes. The following case describes an adolescent with many of the typical features of the pediatric patient with HHS as the presenting symptom of diabetes mellitus. The literature regarding HHS in children is still sparse, and much must be extrapolated from adult studies given its relatively recent increased incidence. Included is a brief review of the most recent data regarding epidemiology, treatment, and complications that would be pertinent to the pediatric emergency physician.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^116QpD9R]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) in children — presentation, dehydration pathophysiology, cerebral edema risk, and fluid management — shows overlap with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), as HHS is distinct from DKA but patients may present with features of both conditions, and children with HHS are often treated with DKA protocols. The gradually increasing polyuria and polydipsia of HHS may go unrecognized; as a result, both dehydration and electrolyte loss are profound in HHS, with fluid losses in adults estimated to be twice those of DKA, and obesity and hyperosmolality can make assessment of dehydration unreliable. Despite severe electrolyte losses and total body volume depletion, hypertonicity preserves intravascular volume and signs of dehydration may be less evident; during therapy, declining serum osmolality moves water out of the intravascular space with a decline in intravascular volume, osmotic diuresis may persist for hours, and ongoing urinary fluid losses early in treatment may be considerable. Because of these factors, children with HHS require more aggressive replacement of intravascular volume during treatment than do children with DKA to avoid the vascular collapse that contributes to the high mortality rate. Patients are believed to be at risk for cerebral edema if the rate of decline in serum osmolality exceeds brain clearance of osmotically active particles; however, in one case report with severe hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality (435 mosm/Kg) and intracranial pressure monitoring during treatment, no increase in intracranial pressure occurred during fluid resuscitation.

### A case of hemichorea-hemiballismus due to nonketotic hyperglycemia [^116UQCq7]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis is made in the context of typical clinical and radiological features including the presence of ballistic or choreiform movements in the setting of marked hyperglycemia and the absence of ketoacidosis. CT scans typically show an area of hyperdensity in the basal ganglia, which can be distinguished from hypertensive hemorrhage as there is no associated mass effect, edema, or volume loss, and the internal capsule is usually spared. The characteristic finding on the T1-weighted MRI is high signal intensity in the contralateral putamen, which may persist for months despite clinical improvement.

The mainstay of treatment is aggressive glycemic control with resolution of hemichorea-hemiballismus in the majority of cases. In refractory cases, drugs that block postsynaptic dopamine (D2) receptors, such as haloperidol or risperidone, can be used. More recently there have been reports of improvement with topiramate, most likely through its GABAergic properties.

In summary, nonketotic hyperglycemia is an unusual but important differential diagnosis in patients with hemichorea-hemiballismus as prompt diagnosis and treatment of hyperglycemia has an excellent prognosis. All patients with this clinical presentation should be screened for diabetes.

Methods

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Adults 21 to 75 years old with BMI of 30 to 50 kg/m 2, a diagnosis of T2DM 12, 13, a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level ≥ 6.5% and < 10%, and a fasting C‐peptide level > 1.0 ng/mL, who were on a stable diet and exercise routine with or without metformin for ≥ 12 weeks prior to the first day of study drug dosing, were enrolled. Patients with fasting plasma glucose > 240 mg/dL, ≥ 5% weight loss within 8 weeks of screening, symptoms of poorly controlled diabetes or a history of any antihyperglycemic therapy other than metformin for > 3 consecutive days or 7 nonconsecutive days within 12 weeks of screening, a history of insulin therapy within 1 year of screening, osteoporosis, or any history of diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, or bariatric surgery were excluded. Patients with recent alcohol abuse (within 6 months of enrollment) as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) criteria were excluded as were patients who tested positive for hepatitis C antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen.

Study design and procedures

In this phase 2, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group study (MB130‐002, NCT02097277), patients who completed screening were enrolled in a lead‐in period and received training in subcutaneous injection, finger‐stick procedures, glucose monitoring, and diary completion. Patients who completed the lead‐in phase and were ≥ 80% adherent to treatment were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to receive placebo, pegbelfermin 1 mg daily, 5 mg daily, 20 mg daily, or 20 mg weekly, all subcutaneously administered. Randomization occurred according to a computer‐generated scheme. After the 12‐week treatment period, patients were monitored for an additional 6 weeks. All patients were eligible for open‐label rescue medication for hyperglycemia.

### Diagnosis and management of the critically ill adult patient with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [^115Fcj6U]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state is a life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. Therefore, it is important for emergency physicians to be aware of this unique diagnosis and treatment considerations.

Objective

This manuscript reviews the emergency department evaluation and management of the adult patient with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state.

Discussion

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state is diagnosed by an elevated glucose, elevated serum osmolality, minimal or absent ketones, and a neurologic abnormality, most commonly altered mental status. Treatment involves fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolyte abnormalities. It is important to monitor these patients closely to avoid overcorrection of osmolality, sodium, and other electrolytes. These patients are critically ill and generally require admission to an intensive care unit.

Conclusions

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis, management, and disposition of these patients.

5.3 Hyperglycemia and Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State

The use of dextrose infusions in patients with impaired glucose tolerance may worsen hyperglycemia. Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient's utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia, coma, and death.

Hyperglycemia is associated with an increase in serum osmolality, resulting in osmotic diuresis, dehydration and electrolyte losses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Patients with underlying central nervous system disease and renal impairment who receive dextrose infusions, may be at greater risk of developing hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

Monitor blood glucose concentrations and treat hyperglycemia to maintain concentrations within normal limits while administering Potassium Chloride in 5% Dextrose Injection.

Insulin may be administered or adjusted to maintain optimal blood glucose concentrations.

Medications associated with hyperglycemia

Medications associated with hyperglycemia are summarized in table 1 and detailed below:

Table 1
Medications associated with hyperglycemia by medication groups

Glucocorticoids

In the pediatric population, glucocorticoids are widely used to treat numerous conditions, such as asthma, rheumatologic conditions, hematologic malignancies, and post-transplant immunosuppressive regimens. While glucocorticoids are therapeutic for the underlying condition, hyperglycemia is a common adverse effect.

The pathophysiology of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia involves multiple mechanisms: increased insulin resistance, increased gluconeogenesis, and decreased insulin production. Glucocorticoids inhibit appetite suppression leading to increased weight gain and insulin resistance. They increase hepatic gluconeogenesis by activating genes coding for phosphoenol-pyruvate-carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase, and by upregulating the effects of the counter-regulatory hormones including glucagon and epinephrine.

Although all glucocorticoid compounds and routes of administration may result in hyperglycemia, systemic administration, higher doses, and a long duration of treatment are more likely to be associated with it. In adults, older age, history of glucose intolerance and family history of diabetes have been associated with development of hyperglycemia. In children, although some host risk factors have been identified, these are less well understood.

The frequency of hyperglycemia associated with glucocorticoids in children is difficult to establish. Glucocorticoids are used in a myriad of conditions making the population heterogeneous. Second, as the patients' clinical condition evolves, often, different compounds, routes of administration, schedules, and doses are used. In addition, other medications, stress, inflammation, and underlying β cell dysfunction may have additive effects. Finally, with a few exceptions, hyperglycemia is poorly documented as priority is given to the condition that required the use of steroids.

Antineoplastic and immunomodulatory drugs

L-asparaginase

L-asparaginase is a part of the standard treatment for ALL as it depletes available asparagine in leukemic cells, leading to cell death. Insulin synthesis is also dependent on asparagine, making hyperglycemia one of the most common side effects of the medication. Other mechanisms involved in L-asparaginase-induced hyperglycemia may include β cell dysfunction secondary to pancreatitis, impairment in insulin receptor function, and hyperglucagonemia. Because it induces an insulinopenic state, acute hyperglycemic complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar non-ketotic state can occur.

4.9 Anticoagulation

Whilst thrombotic complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke or peripheral arterial thrombosis occur more frequently in HHS, it is not known whether or not these can be prevented by prophylaxis with low dose LMWH or anti‐platelet therapy, or if a full therapeutic dose should be used.

Having diabetes is associated with an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolic disease (VTE). People with HHS have an increased risk of arterial and VTE. A study of hyperglycaemia (not specifically with HHS) during COVID‐19 admissions suggested that the risk of arterial and VTE was three times higher than those without hyperglycaemia. Other work has estimated that people with diabetes and hyperosmolality have a risk of VTE similar, or only marginally above those with acute renal failure, acute sepsis or acute connective tissue disease. The risk of venous thromboembolism is greater than in diabetic ketoacidosis. Other factors, such as hypernatraemia and increasing vasopressin concentrations can promote thrombogenesis by producing changes in haemostatic function consistent with a hypercoagulable state. Everyone with HHS should receive prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for the full duration of admission unless contraindicated. There are no data to recommend that this advice be extended to therapeutic anticoagulation. Full, therapeutic anticoagulation should only be considered in those with suspected thrombosis or acute coronary syndrome.

4.10 Other electrolyte imbalances and complications associated with HHS

Hypophosphataemia and hypomagnesaemia are common in HHS. There are no data looking at the use of replacement of either of these in HHS. It is likely that this represents an epiphenomenon, particularly for magnesium where protein binding is affected by the change in the extracellular milieu and that therefore tissue status is likely normal. Many studies in ICU settings demonstrate no evidence of tissue deficiency nor any benefit from magnesium replacement in acutely ill patients with hypomagnesaemia. If low concentrations persist beyond the acute phase of treatment and the patient is apparently symptomatic with good risk factors for long‐term magnesium deficiency, oral replacement may be considered (IV is associated with high urinary excretion therefore very little of the infusion remains in the circulation so should only be considered if severely deplete and symptomatic, for example, ECG changes or neurological manifestations); see local magnesium replacement guidelines for further advice. Proton pump inhibitor use is common in the same population who develop HHS and the use of these drugs has been associated with hypomagnesaemia.

7 RECOVERY PHASE

Complete correction of electrolyte and osmolality abnormalities may take up to 72 h. Because many of these individuals are elderly with multiple co‐morbidities, recovery will largely be determined by their previous functional status and the underlying precipitant(s) of HHS. Early mobilisation is essential, as is the need for good nutrition. IV insulin can usually be discontinued once they are eating and drinking but IV fluids may be required for longer if intake is inadequate. Most people should be transferred to subcutaneous insulin (the regimen is determined by their circumstances). For those with previously undiagnosed diabetes or who were well‐controlled on oral agents, switching from insulin to the appropriate oral or subcutaneous glucose‐lowering drugs should be considered after a period of stability. This may take weeks or months. Everyone with HHS will require diabetes specialist input (including the offer of education) to reduce the risk of recurrence, prevent long‐term complications and review of other factors that may have led to episodes of HHS (e.g. psychosocial factors in vulnerable adults). Where applicable, holistic multiple cardiovascular risk factor optimisation should also occur.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^117XyrDZ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is an underrecognized diabetic emergency with high morbidity and mortality. Many features of HHS overlap with those of diabetic ketoacidosis but key differentiators for HHS are serum osmolality greater than 320 mOsm/kg, lack of metabolic acidosis, and minimal to no presence of ketones. HHS is often triggered by an underlying illness-most commonly infection but may also be triggered by stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and other acute illnesses. Treatment guidelines recommend aggressive volume-repletion of osmotic losses in addition to insulin therapy, plus treatment of the underlying cause.

10 CARE PATHWAY

The management timelines of HHS are divided into five phases as below.
0–60 min
1–6 h
6–12 h
12–24 h
Beyond 24 h

T = 0 is the time when the intravenous fluids are commenced. It is important to establish adequate intravenous access (preferably 2 large‐bore intravenous cannulas). Line 1 can be dedicated to intravenous fluids replacement and line 2 for insulin (when initiated) and intravenous glucose (later in the pathway). If there is a problem with intravenous access critical care support should be requested immediately.

The pathway is divided into 3 main sections: (1) Clinical assessment and monitoring, (2) Interventions and (3) Assessments and prevention.

All cases of HHS must be referred to the inpatient diabetes team for review and care planning. For full details of the care pathway see Figures 1 and 2.

1 INTRODUCTION

Until the publication of the first edition of this document, national guidelines on the management of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) in adults had been uncommon. As is now well recognised, HHS is different to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and treatment requires a different approach. Although typically occurring in those aged over 45, HHS can present in children and younger adults, often as the initial presentation of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

HHS is uncommon. In the United States, it accounts for only 13% of hyperglycaemia‐related emergency admissionsbut has a higher mortality than DKA. There are no recent publications from the United Kingdom on mortality in HHS, but reported series suggest mortality may have improved though remains high at between 15% and 20%.,

HHS often develops over many days, and consequently, the dehydration and metabolic disturbances are usually more extreme than with DKA. Many people with diabetes have severe but transient elevations of blood glucose — the difference between this and HHS, being the duration of hyperglycaemia and the accompanying dehydration.

As with many serious but rare metabolic emergencies, the evidence for treatment is based more on clinical experience and consensus than randomised controlled trials. What is clear is that the greater mortality and morbidity in HHS is only in part related to age and co‐morbidities. There has been controversy around the speed and type of fluid replacement and when insulin should be introduced. However, the use of the previous edition of this guideline has standardised practice across many parts of the United Kingdom, with most teams feeling they were of good quality and safe.

### Hyperglycemic crisis [^111ek5VT]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemic crisis is a metabolic emergency associated with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus that may result in significant morbidity or death. Acute interventions are required to manage hypovolemia, acidemia, hyperglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and precipitating causes. Despite advances in the prevention and management of diabetes, its prevalence and associated health care costs continue to increase worldwide. Hyperglycemic crisis typically requires critical care management and hospitalization and contributes to global health expenditures.

Objective

Diagnostic and resolution criteria and management strategies for diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic crisis are provided. A discussion of prevalence, mortality, pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management considerations for hyperglycemic crisis are included.

Discussion

Emergency physicians confront the most severe sequelae of uncontrolled diabetes and provide crucial, life-saving management. With ongoing efforts from diabetes societies to incorporate the latest clinical research to refine treatment guidelines, management and outcomes of hyperglycemic crisis in the emergency department continue to improve.

Conclusion

We provide an overview of the evaluation and treatment of hyperglycemic crisis and offer a concise, targeted management algorithm to aid the practicing emergency physician.

Abstract

Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic State (HHS) is a medical emergency associated with high mortality. It occurs less frequently than diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), affects those with pre‐existing/new type 2 diabetes mellitus and increasingly affecting children/younger adults. Mixed DKA/HHS may occur. The JBDS HHS care pathway consists of 3 themes (clinical assessment and monitoring, interventions, assessments and prevention of harm) and 5 phases of therapy (0–60 min, 1–6, 6–12, 12–24 and 24–72 h). Clinical features of HHS include marked hypovolaemia, osmolality ≥ 320 mOsm/kg using [(2×Na +) + glucose+urea], marked hyperglycaemia ≥ 30 mmol/L, without significant ketonaemia (≤ 3.0 mmol/L), without significant acidosis (pH > 7.3) and bicarbonate ≥ 15 mmol/L. Aims of the therapy are to improve clinical status/replace fluid losses by 24 h, gradual decline in osmolality (3.0–8.0 mOsm/kg/h to minimise the risk of neurological complications), blood glucose 10–15 mmol/L in the first 24 h, prevent hypoglycaemia/hypokalaemia and prevent harm (VTE, osmotic demyelination, fluid overload, foot ulceration). Underlying precipitants must be identified and treated. Interventions include: (1) intravenous (IV) 0.9% sodium chloride to restore circulating volume (fluid losses 100–220 ml/kg, caution in elderly), (2) fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) should be commenced once osmolality stops falling with fluid replacement unless there is ketonaemia (FRIII should be commenced at the same time as IV fluids). (3) glucose infusion (5% or 10%) should be started once glucose < 14 mmol/L and (4) potassium replacement according to potassium levels. HHS resolution criteria are: osmolality < 300 mOsm/kg, hypovolaemia corrected (urine output ≥ 0.5 ml/kg/h), cognitive status returned to pre‐morbid state and blood glucose < 15 mmol/L.

### Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state: first presentation of type 1 diabetes mellitus in an adolescent with complex medical needs [^114UmqCT]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

This is a case of hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) as first presentation of type 1 diabetes mellitus in a 14-year-old girl with background complex medical needs. She presented with marked hyperglycaemia (56 mmol/L) without significant ketonaemia (2.6 mmol/L) and serum hyperosmolality (426 mOsm/kg). Managing her profound hypernatraemic (> 180 mmol/L) dehydration was challenging but resulted in good outcome. Paediatric patients with HHS will likely be treated with the diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA) protocol because of perceived rarity of HHS leading to inadequate rehydration and risk of vascular collapse. Hence, emphasis on the differences in the management protocols of DKA and HHS is paramount. Prompt recognition and adequate management are crucial to avert complications. The undesirable rate of decline of hypernatraemia due to the use of hypotonic fluid was captured in this case. We describe the pivotal role of liberal fluid therapy with non-hypotonic fluids.

Introduction

Individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) rely on insulin administration for survival. However, adverse effects of insulin therapy such as weight gain and hypoglycemia often hinder the achievement of glycemic and metabolic targets. Conversely, poor adherence to insulin therapy, strenuous physical activity, intercurrent illnesses, and the use of drugs that affect carbohydrate metabolism may precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This life-threatening metabolic crisis is characterized by the metabolic triad of hyperglycemia (glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL), ketosis (β-hydroxybutyrate ≥ 3.0 mM), and anion-gap acidosis (pH ≤ 7.3). If not promptly treated, its consequences can be fatal, making DKA a leading cause of mortality in young patients with T1D. The pathophysiology of DKA stems from the extreme catabolic milieu induced by insulin deficiency that shifts the body's mode of energy production from hepatic carbohydrates to fat catabolism into ketone bodies (KB). While the synthesis of KB as alternative energy metabolites is part of the normal adaptation to glucose shortage under starvation physiology, upon export to the bloodstream, KB contribute equimolar hydrogen ions. Therefore, high concentrations of blood KB (ketosis or hyperketonemia) increase the anion gap and promote metabolic acidosis, which in the case of uncontrolled diabetes can precipitate DKA. Notably, ketosis with or without acidosis is considered to be an acute complication of poorly controlled or newly diagnosed type I or type II diabetes mellitus, and higher levels of oxidative stress and inflammation were reported in patients with hyperketonemic diabetes. Accordingly, diabetic ketosis by itself serves as a medically important target regardless of its role in potentiating DKA.

4.6 Insulin dose and timing

Fluid replacement alone with 0.9% sodium chloride solution will result in a falling blood glucose. Lowering glucose level by early insulin use in HHS will lower osmolality precipitously and risks osmotic fluid shifts leading to circulatory collapse. There is also higher risk of hypokalaemia and hypoglycaemia. To prevent the serum osmolality falling too quickly, the plasma glucose should ideally fall by no more than 5 mmol/L/h. Insulin treatment prior to adequate fluid replacement may result in cardiovascular collapse because water will move out of the intravascular space, resulting in a reduction in intravascular volume (a consequence of insulin‐mediated glucose uptake and a diuresis from urinary glucose excretion).

Once the glucose has ceased to fall following initial fluid resuscitation, reassessment of fluid intake and evaluation of renal function must be undertaken. Insulin may be started at this point. As with DKA, an FRIII is preferred, though generally lower doses are required. The recommended initial insulin dose is an FRIII given at 0.05 units/kg/h. If an FRIII is already in place, the infusion rate can be increased by 1.0 unit/h.

Glucose infusion (5% or 10%) should be started once blood glucose is < 14 mmol/L and run alongside FRIII and other fluid replacement. Choice of the glucose fluid concentration (5% or 10%) depends on the individual patient factors (e.g. risk of fluid overloads) and/or institutional factors (e.g. cost and availability).

In cases of HHS associated with raised ketones levels, earlier initiation of insulin is required to address the state of ketosis (see Mixed DKA/HHS section).

4.7 Clinical scenarios and interpretation of serum sodium, osmolality and glucose concentrations

During the phases of management of HHS, it is important to observe changes in osmolality, serum sodium and glucose. The flow diagrams in the care pathway illustrate the options (Figure 2).

4.8 Antibiotic therapy

As with all acutely ill people, sepsis may not be accompanied by pyrexia. An infective source should be sought on clinical history and examination. Antibiotics should be given when there are clinical signs, and/or laboratory or radiological evidence of infection. Follow the local infection and sepsis guidelines.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^116mad7F]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Mixed HHS and DKA — children with severe hypertonicity plus substantial ketosis and acidosis — requires combined management: Treatment must take into account potential complications of both diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS), with frequent reassessment of circulatory status and fluid balance to guide therapy. To maintain adequate circulatory volume, the rate of fluid administration will generally exceed that used for treatment of typical DKA, and the rate of electrolyte administration required to maintain normal concentrations is also likely to exceed that used for DKA. Insulin treatment is necessary to resolve ketosis and continuous insulin infusion should be started after the initial fluid bolus(es), recognizing that insulin administration may produce a more rapid decline in glucose concentration and therefore a potential decrease in intravascular volume.

I. When treatment goals are not met

For a variety of reasons, some people with diabetes and their health care providers do not achieve the desired goals of treatment (Table 9). Re-thinking the treatment regimen may require assessment of barriers to adherence including income, educational attainment, and competing demands, including those related to family responsibilities and family dynamics. Other strategies may include culturally appropriate and enhanced DSME, co-management with a diabetes team, referral to a medical social worker for assistance with insurance coverage or change in pharmacological therapy. Initiation of or increase in SMBG, utilization of continuous glucose monitoring, frequent contact with the patient, or referral to an endocrinologist may be useful.

J. Intercurrent illness

The stress of illness, trauma, and/or surgery frequently aggravates glycemic control and may precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or nonketotic hyperosmolar state, life-threatening conditions that require immediate medical care to prevent complications and death. Any condition leading to deterioration in glycemic control necessitates more frequent monitoring of blood glucose and (in ketosis-prone patients) urine or blood ketones. Marked hyperglycemia requires temporary adjustment of the treatment program and, if accompanied by ketosis, vomiting, or alteration in level of consciousness, immediate interaction with the diabetes care team. The patient treated with noninsulin therapies or MNT alone may temporarily require insulin. Adequate fluid and caloric intake must be assured. Infection or dehydration are more likely to necessitate hospitalization of the person with diabetes than the person without diabetes.

The hospitalized patient should be treated by a physician with expertise in the management of diabetes.

### Hyperosmolar diabetic ketoacidosis – review of literature and the shifting paradigm in evaluation and management [^111JLwwY]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperosmolar diabetic ketoacidosis (H-DKA), a distinct clinical entity, is the overlap of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS).

Aim

We describe the clinical presentation, metabolic aberrations, and associated morbidity/mortality of these cases with H-DKA. We highlight the problem areas of medical care which require particular attention when caring for pediatric diabetes patients presenting with H-DKA.

Methods

In our study we reviewed the literature back to 1963 and retrieved twenty-four cases meeting the criteria of H-DKA: glucose > 600 mg/dL, pH < 7.3, bicarbonate < 15 mEq/L, and serum osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg, while adding three cases from our institution.

Results

Average age of presentation of H-DKA was 10.2 years ± 4.5 years in females and 13.3 years ± 4 years in males, HbA1c was 13%. Biochemical parameters were consistent with severe dehydration: serum osmolality = 394.8 ± 55 mOsm/kg, BUN = 48 ± 22 mg/dL, creatinine = 2.81 ± 1.03 mg/dL. Acute kidney injury, present in 12 cases, was the most frequent end-organ complication.

Conclusion

Multi-organ involvement with AKI, rhabdomyolysis, pancreatitis, neurological and cardiac issues such as arrhythmias, are common in H-DKA. Aggressive fluid management, insulin therapy and supportive care can prevent acute and long term adverse outcomes in children and adolescents.

Children and adolescents — initial pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes: In individuals with incidentally diagnosed or metabolically stable diabetes (A1C < 8.5% [< 69 mmol/mol] and asymptomatic), metformin is the initial pharmacologic treatment of choice if kidney function is normal (A). Youth with marked hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL [≥ 13.9 mmol/L] A1C ≥ 8.5% [≥ 69 mmol/mol]) without acidosis at diagnosis who are symptomatic with polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, and/or weight loss should be treated initially with long-acting insulin while metformin is initiated and titrated (B). Initiate subcutaneous or intravenous insulin treatment in individuals with ketoacidosis to rapidly correct the hyperglycemia and the metabolic derangement, and once acidosis is resolved, metformin should be initiated while subcutaneous insulin therapy is continued (A). In individuals presenting with severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 600 mg/dL [≥ 33.3 mmol/L]), consider assessment for hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (A).

Hyperglycemic emergencies (diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar state) — protocols and safety — should follow standardized protocols with aggressive fluid resuscitation, electrolytes replacement, and also insulin therapy, with caution recommended in persons with advanced renal failure because standard IV fluid and insulin replacement may result in increased volume overload and hypoglycemia; severe hypokalemia (K < 2.5 mEq/L) and severe hypoglycemia (BG < 40 mg/dl) have been associated with increased mortality; the addition of noninsulin agents, such as DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs, before admission or during the postoperative period, has not reduced rates of stress hyperglycemia and may increase nausea and vomiting rates among critically ill persons.

Pediatric hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) — insulin initiation and dosing should be conservative: In general, insulin administration should be considered when serum glucose concentrations are no longer declining adequately (< 50 mg/dL/h [< 2.7 mmol/L/h]) with fluid administration alone; when insulin treatment is begun, continuous administration at 0.025 to 0.05 units/kg/h can be used initially, with the dosage titrated to achieve a decrease in glucose concentration of 50 to 75 mg/dl/h (2.7–4.1 mmol/L/h); insulin boluses are not recommended for pediatric patients, and early insulin administration is unnecessary in non-ketotic HHS and may increase the risk of death.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^115ERib3]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric HHS — targets for glucose and sodium correction during fluid therapy emphasize gradual changes: With adequate rehydration, serum glucose concentrations should decline by 75 to 100 mg/dL/hr (4.1–5.5 mmol/L/h), and lack of appropriate decline in serum glucose should prompt reassessment and evaluation of renal function; although there are no data to indicate an optimal rate of decline in serum sodium, a rate of 0.5 mEq/L per hour has been recommended for hypernatremic dehydration; replacement of urinary losses is recommended, and 0.45% saline solution approximates the typical urine sodium concentration during osmotic diuresis.

### Management of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) in adults: an updated guideline from the joint British diabetes societies (JBDS) for inpatient care group [^113mexdo]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Rapid changes in osmolality may be harmful. 0.9% sodium chloride solution should be used as the principal fluid to restore circulating volume and reverse dehydration because it is relatively hypotonic compared to the serum in someone with HHS. Check osmolality every hour initially and the rate of fluid replacement adjusted accordingly to ensure a positive fluid balance sufficient to promote a gradual decline in osmolality. Fluid replacement alone (without insulin) will lower glucose concentrations which will lower serum osmolality by causing a shift of water into the intracellular space. This inevitably results in a rise in serum sodium (a fall in blood glucose of 5.5 mmol/L will result in a 2.4 mmol/L rise in sodium). This is not necessarily an indication to give hypotonic solutions. A rising sodium is only a concern if the osmolality is not declining concurrently. If the inevitable rise in serum sodium is much greater than 2.4 mmol/L for each 5.5 mmol/L fall in blood glucose this would suggest insufficient fluid replacement.

Overall, the rate of fall of serum sodium should not exceed 10 mmol/L in 24 h. A safe rate of fall of plasma glucose should not be more than 5 mmol/h. However, if the osmolality is no longer declining despite adequate fluid replacement with 0.9% sodium chloride solution and an adequate rate of fall of plasma glucose is not being achieved, then 0.45% sodium chloride solution should be substituted. There are no data to justify using fluids that are less concentrated than 0.45% sodium chloride solution.

Complete normalisation of electrolytes and osmolality may take up to 72 h.

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1163TwTf]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state — clinical management details: Presentations vary and include euglycemic DKA defined as plasma glucose levels < 200 mg/dL (< 11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of ketosis and metabolic acidosis, necessitating individualized treatment based on careful clinical and laboratory assessment. In critically ill and hemodynamically unstable individuals with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous insulin is the standard of care, and successful transition to subcutaneous insulin requires administering basal insulin 2–4 h before stopping the intravenous insulin to prevent recurrence and rebound hyperglycemia. For mild or moderate DKA, there is no significant difference in outcomes for intravenous human regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when combined with aggressive fluid management, and selected individuals with uncomplicated DKA may sometimes be treated with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs in the emergency department or step-down unit. The use of bicarbonate in DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to discharge, and its use is generally not recommended.

### Management of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) in adults: an updated guideline from the joint British diabetes societies (JBDS) for inpatient care group [^112kBuT8]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Use of the previous version of this guidelinehas confirmed that fluid replacement alone will lower glucose concentrations. An FRIII should not be started as part of the initial treatment unless significant ketonaemia is present (> 3.0 mmol/L or urine ketones > 2+). In all other circumstances, intravenous fluids should be administered first, and an FRIII only started once the glucose has stopped falling. The risk of adding insulin at the start of treatment will lead to larger osmotic shifts leading to neurological complications. In addition, adding IV insulin too early will also potentially lead to circulatory collapse(see Appendix S2).

If the IV fluids and FRIII are managed appropriately, the fall in serum osmolality should be within the target range of 3.0–8.0 mOsm/kg/h. If the rate is faster than this, it increases the risk of neurological complications such as cerebral oedema and osmotic demyelination.

4.4 Fluid replacement

The aim of treatment should be to replace approximately 50% of estimated fluid loss within the first 12 h and the remainder in the following 12 h. However, this will in part be determined by the initial severity, degree of renal impairment and co‐morbidities such as heart failure, which may limit the speed of correction. An initial target glucose of between 10 and 15 mmol/L is a reasonable goal until the person is eating and drinking normally, and then an individual target glucose (if appropriate 6–10 mmol/L) should be set by the diabetes specialist team and the person with diabetes. Ideally, people will recover quickly enough to replace the water deficit themselves by taking fluids orally.

The goal of the initial therapy is expansion of the intravascular and extravascular volume and to restore peripheral perfusion. There are almost no data on the benefits or risks of particular fluid replacement regimens in HHS. Controversies persist around the speed and type of fluid replacement, and a systematic review is being undertaken. However, a Cochrane review recommended the use of crystalloid fluids rather than colloid in critically ill individuals because the use of crystalloids is associated with less need for further interventions. As the majority of electrolyte losses are sodium, chloride and potassium, the initial fluid replacement of choice should be 0.9% sodium chloride solution with potassium added as required.

### Gaps in our knowledge of managing inpatient dysglycaemia and diabetes in non-critically ill adults: a call for further research [^115gRCUk]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

When considering hyperglycaemic emergencies, DKA is one area of inpatient diabetes care that has been extensively studied over the last 100 years. However, there remain areas of uncertainty. One example is 'what is the correct resuscitation fluid to administer'? Despite the large numbers of people admitted to DKA, there have been very few trials looking at this and the answer remains unclear. Cerebral oedema, another feared complication, was thought to be due to the rate of fluid administration, administration of bicarbonate or the rapid shifts in osmolality. However, the largest randomised controlled trial from 2018 has questioned those theories. Whether the factors that predispose children to develop cerebral oedema are the same in adults remains unknown.

When considering hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic syndrome (HHS), to date there have been no prospective studies assessing the optimal management of this population, despite a 10‐fold higher mortality than DKA. The current protocols used have evolved over time and remain largely based on expert consensus.

Diabetic Ketoacidosis and Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State Management and Treatment Protocols in the Emergency Department/Floor/Intensive Care Unit

Nadine E. Palermo, DO

Brigham and Women's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA

Key ideas

Several studies have demonstrated that the use of subcutaneous rapid acting insulin given every one to two hours can be effective in the treatment of mild/moderate uncomplicated DKA.
Classification of DKA severity can be useful in triage as patients presenting with mild uncomplicated DKA may be treated in an intermediate unit as an alternative to the intensive care unit (ICU).
Special considerations for alternative strategies in the management of hyperglycemic crises may be especially useful during a pandemic, including subcutaneous dosing and extended intervals for glucose monitoring and insulin administration.

Summary

The classification of patients by type of hyperglycemic crisis (mild-severe DKA, HHS, or both) determines appropriate therapy with intravenous or subcutaneous insulin and triage location (such as the ICU). Patients in the emergency department (ED) with hyperglycemia but without hyperglycemic crisis should be considered for rapid follow-up programs if available to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations. Fluids, insulin, and electrolyte repletion remain the mainstays of therapy. Patients may benefit from early administration of basal insulin to decrease rebound hyperglycemia after insulin infusions are discontinued. Studies have shown protocols utilizing subcutaneous insulin every one or two hours are as effective as infusions in patients with mild-moderate DKA. For safe discharge, patients must have had adequate education, prescriptions and needed supplies, and follow-up scheduled. For patients with COVID-19, in order to conserve personal protective equipment, it is possible to effectively treat mild-moderate DKA with subcutaneous insulin every four hours.

### Diabetes in older adults [^116amjWz]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Risks of undertreatment of hyperglycemia.

Although attention has rightly been paid to the risks of overtreatment of hyperglycemia in older adults (hypoglycemia, treatment burden, possibly increased mortality), untreated or undertreated hyperglycemia also has risks, even in patients with life expectancy too short to be impacted by the development of chronic complications. Blood glucose levels consistently over the renal threshold for glycosuria (∼180–200 mg/dL, but can vary) increase the risks for dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, urinary incontinence, dizziness, and falls. Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome is a particularly severe complication of unrecognized or undertreated hyperglycemia in older adults. Although it is appropriate to relax glycemic targets for older patients with a history of hypoglycemia, a high burden of comorbidities, and limited life expectancy, goals that minimize severe hyperglycemia are indicated for almost all patients.

Background notes it is estimated that more than 400 000 people with T1D in the United States are using insulin pumps, and remarks specify that patients with an impaired level of consciousness, inability to appropriately adjust pump settings, critical illness (intensive care unit), diabetic ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state are not candidates for inpatient use of the insulin pump.

If someone with diabetes is found to be hyperglycemic (plasma glucose level > 250 mg·dL−1), assess for HHS or DKA, and individuals with type 1 diabetes should be able to test for blood or urine ketones if they have unexplained hyperglycemia. In HHS, serum glucose level usually > 600 mg·dL−1 with extreme dehydration with a fluid deficit of 8 to 12 L.

### Hypoglycemia during hyperosmolar hyperglycemic crises is associated with long-term mortality [^116GzwuT]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Both HHS and hyperosmolar DKA, which can be collectively referred to as hyperosmolar hyperglycemic crises (HHC), have a high mortality rate, including in the long term. HHC must be treated intensively with fluids and insulin. In the initial phase, intravenous insulin therapy is recommended, with a transition to subcutaneous insulin therapy when the hyperglycemia is corrected and the patient is able to tolerate oral feeding. Intensive insulin therapy carries a risk of hypoglycemia during treatment of hyperglycemic crises. In fact, hypoglycemia, along with hypokalemia, is the most common complication of hyperglycemic crises. Several studies have shown that the incidence of hypoglycemia during hyperglycemic crises depends on the dosage and amount of insulin received. In addition, 2 studies performed in patients admitted for DKA demonstrated a higher incidence of hypoglycemia in patients with low body weight, fever, hepatic disease, and impaired renal function. Thus, few studies have analyzed risk factors other than insulin therapy for the occurrence of hypoglycemia during the treatment of hyperglycemic crises.

Hypoglycemia alone can lead to severe symptoms, such as seizures, coma, or even death. In addition, particularly during HHC, too rapid correction of hyperglycemia, and thus osmolality, could lead to cerebral edema, a rare but potentially fatal complication in adults. For these reasons, it is essential to avoid hypoglycemia during HHC, and it is recommended that glucose should not be lowered below 200–300 mg/dL during the first few hours of treatment, which takes place during the initial intravenous insulin therapy phase (IIITP).

Previous studies in patients hospitalized for any reason have shown that hypoglycemia is a marker of poor short- and long-term prognosis. However, only 1 study has analyzed the prognostic value of hypoglycemia specifically during the management of hyperglycemic crises in adult patients, showing that hypoglycemia of less than 40 mg/dL within 48 h of admission is associated with increased mortality during hospitalization. To our knowledge, no studies in adults have analyzed the long-term prognostic value of hypoglycemia during hyperglycemic crises. The aim of the present study was to analyze, in patients admitted for HHC, the risk factors for the occurrence of hypoglycemia and the mid- and long-term prognostic value of hypoglycemia during the treatment of HHC, both in the IIITP and in the later subcutaneous insulin therapy phase (LSITP). To our knowledge, this is the first study of these characteristics.

Electrolyte imbalances (potassium, phosphate, and magnesium) in pediatric hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) are emphasized as more severe than in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), with specific management guidance: Potassium replacement should begin once concentrations are normal and renal function is adequate, be initiated at 40 mEq/L of replacement fluid, and be monitored at least every 2 to 3 hours during insulin administration with possible hourly monitoring and cardiac monitoring; bicarbonate therapy is contraindicated; phosphate deficits are more severe in HHS and intravenous solutions containing a 50:50 mixture of potassium phosphate and potassium chloride generally permit adequate replacement, with phosphate concentrations monitored at least every 3 to 4 hours; and for patients with hypocalcemia and low magnesium, magnesium replacement should be considered with a recommended dose of 25 to 50 mg/kg/dose for 3 to 4 doses given every 4 to 6 hours, with a maximum infusion rate of 150 mg/min and 2 g/h.

### Serum sodium concentration and tonicity in hyperglycemic crises: major influences and treatment implications [^116Gg35e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Losses of water, sodium, and potassium through hyperglycemic osmotic diuresis can be profound. These losses can be indirectly estimated by computing the volume of water and the amounts of sodium and potassium retained from the replacement solutions during correction of hyperglycemic crises. For example, treatment of severe nonketotic hyperglycemia in the balance study of Arieff and Carroll resulted in average net gains of 9.1 L water, 407 mmol sodium, and 137 mmol potassium. 49 A characteristic feature of osmotic diuresis caused by various solutes other than sodium salts is that the sum of the urinary concentrations of monovalent cations (sodium plus potassium) is routinely lower than the normal [Na] S. 50 Figure 4 shows average urinary sodium and potassium concentrations in patients with hyperglycemic osmotic diuresis reported in Arieff and Carroll's study 49 and 3 studies reporting urine volume plus urine sodium and potassium concentrations in patients with hyperglycemia. 51, 52, 53 The highest reported average value of the sum of urinary sodium and potassium concentrations was < 120 mmol/L. 51 In the 3 studies allowing calculation of urinary cation concentrations in individual patients, 51, 52, 53 all sums of urinary monovalent cation concentrations were substantially < 140 mmol/L.

4 MANAGEMENT

4.1 Goals of therapy

The goals of treatment of HHS are to address the underlying cause(s) and to achieve:
Gradual normalisation of the osmolality
Safe replacement of fluid and electrolyte losses
Safe and gradual normalisation of blood glucose
Prevention of arterial or venous thrombosis
Prevention of potential complications, for example, cerebral oedema, osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)
Prevention of foot ulceration

4.2 General treatment principles

Early senior review by a clinician familiar with the management of HHS is essential to confirm the treatment plan and review progress. The diabetes inpatient specialist team should be involved in the care as soon as possible.

4.3 Osmolality, sodium and glucose

The key parameter in HHS is osmolality. Sodium and glucose are the main contributors to this, and too rapid changes are dangerous because large fluid shifts can lead to neurological complications, in particular cerebral oedema and osmotic demyelination. Because these parameters are interrelated, we advise that they are plotted on a graph or tabulated to permit appreciation of the rate of change (See Appendix S1).

Total body water is divided between the intra and extracellular fluid spaces, and its distribution is determined by the presence of osmotically effective substances on either side of the cell membrane. Intracellular osmotic pressure is exerted principally by potassium, chloride and phosphate ions while extracellular osmotic pressure is primarily dependent upon sodium, chloride and bicarbonate ions. These osmoles play a critical role in the movement of free water across the cell membrane since they are themselves unable to pass freely between the intra and extracellular compartments. Glucose, lipids and proteins also exert an osmotic pressure, being largely confined to the extracellular space, while urea and ethanol are termed ineffective osmoles, recognising that because they are able to freely move across cell membranes they play no role in the distribution of free water.

I. When treatment goals are not met

For a variety of reasons, some people with diabetes and their health care providers do not achieve the desired goals of treatment (Table 11). Rethinking the treatment regimen may require assessment of barriers including income, health literacy, diabetes distress, depression, and competing demands, including those related to family responsibilities and dynamics. Other strategies may include culturally appropriate and enhanced DSME, co-management with a diabetes team, referral to a medical social worker for assistance with insurance coverage, or change in pharmacological therapy. Initiation of or increase in SMBG, utilization of CGM, frequent contact with the patient, or referral to a mental health professional or physician with special expertise in diabetes may be useful. Providing patients with an algorithm for self-titration of insulin doses based on SMBG results may be helpful for type 2 patients who take insulin.

J. Intercurrent illness

The stress of illness, trauma, and/or surgery frequently aggravates glycemic control and may precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or nonketotic hyperosmolar state, life-threatening conditions that require immediate medical care to prevent complications and death. Any condition leading to deterioration in glycemic control necessitates more frequent monitoring of blood glucose and (in ketosis-prone patients) urine or blood ketones. Marked hyperglycemia requires temporary adjustment of the treatment program and, if accompanied by ketosis, vomiting, or alteration in level of consciousness, immediate interaction with the diabetes care team. The patient treated with noninsulin therapies or MNT alone may temporarily require insulin. Adequate fluid and caloric intake must be assured. Infection or dehydration are more likely to necessitate hospitalization of the person with diabetes than the person without diabetes.

The hospitalized patient should be treated by a physician with expertise in the management of diabetes. For further information on management of patients with hyperglycemia in the hospital, see VIII.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) potentially are fatal but largely preventable acute metabolic conditions of uncontrolled diabetes, the incidence of which continues to increase. Mortality from DKA has declined remarkably over the years because of better understanding of its pathophysiology and treatment. The mortality rate of HHS remains alarmingly high, however, owing to older age and mode of presentation of patients and associated comorbid conditions. DKA and HHS also are economically burdensome; therefore, any resources invested in their prevention would be rewarding.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state are the most feared complications of uncontrolled diabetes seen in emergency medicine. The treatment of both conditions must be tailored to individual patients and relies on aggressive fluid resuscitation, insulin replacement, and electrolyte management. Emergency medicine providers must address the underlying causes and monitor for complications of therapy. Improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and application of evidence-based guidelines have significantly improved prognosis and decreased mortality. The purpose of this article is to review the diagnosis, presentation, and emergency department management of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state with an emphasis on current management and treatment guidelines.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state… [^113nZmv5]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is a relatively common, life-threatening endocrine emergency that is reported in all age groups. Treatment The treatment of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state involves a five-pronged approach: vigorous intravenous rehydration, electrolyte replacement, administration of intravenous insulin, diagnosis and management of precipitating and coexisting problems, and prevention. FLUID REPLACEMENT The first and most important step in the treatment of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is aggressive fluid replacement, which should begin with an estimate of the fluid deficit. 5, 13 The use of isotonic fluids may cause fluid overload and hypotonic fluids may correct deficits too rapidly with a potential for diffuse myelinolysis and death. 13 Therefore, 1 L of normal saline should be given per hour to start. If the patient is in hypervolemic shock, plasma expanders also may be needed.

If the patient is in cardiogenic shock, hemodynamic monitoring is required. Details about the addition of potassium to the intravenous fluids are provided in the next section. INSULIN THERAPY The critical point regarding insulin management is to remember that adequate fluids must be given first. If insulin is administered before fluids, the water will move intracellularly, causing potential worsening of hypotension, vascular collapse, or death. Insulin should be given as an initial bolus of 0. 15 U per kg intravenously, followed by a drip of
0. 1 U per kg per hour until the blood glucose level falls to between 250 mg per dL and 300 mg per dL. If the glucose level does not decrease by 50 to 70 mg per dL per hour, this rate of administration may be doubled.

Once the serum glucose concentration is below 300 mg per dL, dextrose should be added to the intravenous fluid and insulin should be titrated by a low-dose sliding scale until the mental obtundation and hyperosmolarity are resolved. When the patient is able to eat, subcutaneous insulin or the previous treatment regimen may be initiated.

1. Complications of Treatment Complications from inadequate treatment include vascular occlusions.

### What is the optimal speed of correction of the hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in diabetic ketoacidosis? An observational cohort study of U.S. intensive care patients [^115Foeww]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The international guidelines for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) advise against rapid changes in osmolarity and glucose; however, the optimal rates of correction are unknown. We aimed to evaluate the rates of change in tonicity and glucose level in intensive care patients with DKA and their relationship with mortality and altered mental status.

Methods

This is an observational cohort study using 2 publicly available databases of U.S. intensive care patients (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV and Electronic Intensive Care Unit), evaluating adults with DKA and associated hyperosmolarity (baseline Osm ≥ 300 mOsm/L). The primary outcome was hospital mortality. The secondary neurologic outcome used a composite of diagnosed cerebral edema or Glasgow Coma Scale score of ≤ 12. Multivariable regression models were used to control for confounding factors.

Results

On adjusted analysis, patients who underwent the most rapid correction of up to approximately 3 mmol/L/hour in tonicity had reduced mortality (n = 2307; odds ratio [OR], 0.21; overall P < .001) and adverse neurologic outcomes (OR, 0.44; P < .001). Faster correction of glucose levels up to 5 mmol/L/hour (90 mg/dL/hour) was associated with improvements in mortality (n = 2361; OR, 0.24; p = 0.020) and adverse neurologic events (OR, 0.52; p = 0.046). The number of patients corrected significantly faster than these rates was low. A maximal hourly rate of correction between 2 and 5 mmol/L for tonicity was associated with the lowest mortality rate on adjusted analysis.

Conclusion

Based on large-volume observational data, relatively rapid correction of tonicity and glucose level was associated with lower mortality and more favorable neurologic outcomes. Avoiding a maximum hourly rate of correction of tonicity > 5 mmol/L may be advisable.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^111SBrDC]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children — conclusions on epidemiology and management: HHS may be occurring with increased frequency in children and adolescents, and although population-based data are lacking, available literature suggests that pediatric HHS may differ from adult HHS. Pediatric HHS appears to occur most often in otherwise healthy children and adolescents with type 2 DM, particularly in obese African American males, and both rhabdomyolysis and a malignant hyperthermia-like syndrome may occur as complications. Mixed features of DKA and HHS may be more common in children than in adults, there may be a tendency toward inadequate rehydration in children with HHS, and increased awareness of pediatric HHS and differences in management strategy between DKA and HHS are needed to improve outcomes.

6 DEFINITION OF RESOLUTION OF HHS

Because the precise definition of HHS has not been agreed, it is difficult to give a precise definition of when HHS has resolved. Different authors have used different criteria for resolution, with some using osmolality as the criteria, others using volume status or cognitive status. It is important to remember that a normal glucose or sodium concentration in isolation is not sufficient to say that the episode has resolved. It can also be difficult to gauge the degree of dehydration at the bedside. However, we propose that a holistic approach be used.

Resolution of HHS can be defined as outlined in Table 3.

These guidelines are evidence based as far as that evidence exists, otherwise, they reflect a consensus derived from an analysis of the published literature in English and the views of specialist diabetes clinicians in the United Kingdom. The emphasis throughout is on ensuring that biochemical evaluation must go hand in hand with clinical evaluation. Correction of the biochemistry alone does not guarantee a good outcome. They are intended for use by any healthcare professional that manages HHS in adults.

Management of those < 18 years old managed by the paediatric team should follow the following guidelines

The care pathway for the management of HHS is divided into timeline phases to emphasise the importance of regular monitoring and updates in treatments and initiate escalations where appropriate (Figures 1 and 2).

### Pathophysiology and management of fluid and electrolyte disturbances in patients on chronic dialysis with severe hyperglycemia [^112oMVvh]. Seminars in Dialysis (2008). Low credibility.

The mechanisms of fluid and solute abnormalities that should be considered in any patient with severe hyperglycemia include changes in the total amount of extracellular solute, osmotic diuresis, intake of water driven by thirst, and influences from associated conditions. The absence of osmotic diuresis distinguishes dialysis-associated hyperglycemia (DH) from hyperglycemia with preserved renal function (HPRF). Mainly because of this absence, comparable degrees of hyperglycemia tend to produce less hypertonicity and less severe intracellular volume contraction in DH than in HPRF, while extracellular volume is expanded in DH but contracted in HPRF. Ketoacidosis can develop in both DH and HPRF. Among DH patients, hyperkalemia appears to be more frequent when ketoacidosis is present than when nonketotic hyperglycemia is present. Among HPRF patients, the frequency of hyperkalemia appears to be similar whether ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperglycemia is present. Usually patients with severe DH have no symptoms or may exhibit a thirst. Infrequent clinical manifestations of DH include coma and seizures from hypertonicity or ketoacidosis and pulmonary edema from extracellular expansion. Insulin infusion is usually the only treatment required to correct the biochemical abnormalities and reverse the clinical manifestations of DH. Monitoring of the clinical manifestations and biochemical parameters during treatment of DH with insulin is needed to determine whether additional measures, such as administration of saline, free water, or potassium salts, as well as emergency hemodialysis (HD) are needed. Emergency HD carries the risk of excessively rapid decline in tonicity; its benefits in the treatment of DH have not been established.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome: review of acute decompensated diabetes in adult patients [^113iRuC9]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS) are life threatening complications that occur in patients with diabetes. In addition to timely identification of the precipitating cause, the first step in acute management of these disorders includes aggressive administration of intravenous fluids with appropriate replacement of electrolytes (primarily potassium). In patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, this is always followed by administration of insulin, usually via an intravenous insulin infusion that is continued until resolution of ketonemia, but potentially via the subcutaneous route in mild cases. Careful monitoring by experienced physicians is needed during treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis and HHS. Common pitfalls in management include premature termination of intravenous insulin therapy and insufficient timing or dosing of subcutaneous insulin before discontinuation of intravenous insulin. This review covers recommendations for acute management of diabetic ketoacidosis and HHS, the complications associated with these disorders, and methods for preventing recurrence. It also discusses why many patients who present with these disorders are at high risk for hospital readmissions, early morbidity, and mortality well beyond the acute presentation.

4.5 Potassium replacement

Hypokalaemia in HHS is multifactorial. Osmotic diuresis and consequent hypertonicity from hyperglycaemia lead to fluids shifts from the intracellular space into the extracellular space. This leads to intracellular potassium loss. In addition, hypoperfusion leads to the activation of aldosterone secretion, further exacerbating the potassium loss. Vomiting, if present, worsens hypokalaemia. Lack of insulin in DKA, accumulation of ketone bodies leading to ketoacidosis and drop in bicarbonate ion concentration leads to a further loss of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space. In both cases (DKA and/or HHS) there is a total body loss of potassium. Treatment with insulin will lead to a shift of potassium back into the intracellular space which unravels hypokalaemia.

Those on diuretics may be profoundly hypokalaemic to start with. It is also worth noting that if acute kidney injury is present, hyperkalaemia may be present owing to reduced clearance and therefore closer monitoring is required.

Potassium level assessment and replacement is crucial in management of HHS and if mixed with ketosis/DKA. For guidance on potassium replacement see Table 2.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome [^114LWYAW]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS) are life-threatening acute metabolic complications of diabetes mellitus. Although there are some important differences, the pathophysiology, the presenting clinical challenge, and the treatment of these metabolic derangements are similar. Each of these complications can be seen in type 1 or type 2 diabetes, although DKA is usually seen in patients with type 1 diabetes and HHNS in patients with type 2 disease. The clinical management of these syndromes involves careful evaluation and correction of the metabolic and volume status of the patient, identification and treatment of precipitating and comorbid conditions, a smooth transition to a long-term treatment regimen, and a plan to prevent recurrence.

### Treatment of extreme hyperglycemia monitored with intracerebral microdialysis [^113tqpuU]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Description of a pediatric patient with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome where the treatment was monitored with intracerebral microdialysis.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Intensive care unit at a university hospital.

Patient

An 11-yr-old boy with new-onset diabetes who presented with a blood glucose concentration of 100 mmol/L (1800 mg/dL) and a serum osmolality of 448 mOsm/kg.

Interventions

Interventions included intracerebral and subcutaneous microdialysis as well as intracranial pressure monitoring during correction of the hyperosmolar condition. The strategy was to decrease osmolality by 1 mOsm.kg(-1).hr(-1) and blood glucose by 1.5 mmol.L(-1).hr(-1) (27 mg/dL).

Measurements and Main Results

The concentrations of glucose in the subcutaneous dialysates corresponded to the blood glucose concentrations. The brain/subcutaneous glucose ratio varied between 0.20 and 1.28 (mean, 0.43; median, 0.4). When the blood glucose decreased quickly after steady state, the brain/subcutaneous ratio increased sharply, demonstrating that the normalization of glucose in the brain was slower than that in blood.

Conclusions

Microdialysis can be used to monitor the brain/subcutaneous glucose ratio in patients with extreme hyperglycemia. A rapid decrease in blood glucose increases the brain/subcutaneous glucose ratio, which may be a potential risk factor for osmotic brain edema. Microdialysis may prove to be a valuable tool in treatment management. The child made a full recovery.

2 DEFINITION AND DIAGNOSIS

International guidelines vary as to the precise definition of HHS, but there are characteristic features that differentiate it from other hyperglycaemic states such as DKA. Defining HHS by osmolality alone is inappropriate without considering other clinical features (Figure 3).

FIGURE 3
Definition and characteristic features of a person with HHS.

Previously called HyperOsmolar Non‐Ketotic (HONK) coma, it was apparent that most of these people were not comatosed but were extremely ill. Changing the name to Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic State (HHS) allows for the fact that some people with severely raised blood glucose may also be mildly ketotic and acidotic. The reasons why these people do not develop ketoacidosis are not fully understood. In HHS, insulin levels are just adequate to prevent ketogenesis but fail to counteract hyperglycaemia. Therefore, the presentation is mainly driven by extreme levels of hyperglycaemia and consequent osmotic diuresis.

People with HHS are generally older than those with DKA, but increasingly, as the diabetes pandemic crosses generational boundaries, it may be seen in young adults and even children as the first presentation of newly diagnosed diabetes.HHS has a slower onset than DKA. This is important because the brain tissue of those who develop HHS, particularly in those who are older, is at higher risk of injury due to rapid shifts in sodium, water and glucose. Therefore, to prevent significant neurological damage, HHS requires less aggressive fluid resuscitation and slower glucose‐lowering than DKA.

### Risk factors for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in pediatric type 2 diabetes [^115VCTMX]. Pediatric Diabetes (2023). Medium credibility.

With the rise in pediatric type 2 diabetes cases, hyperglycemic emergencies will become more prevalent. Strategies that identify at-risk populations have the potential to prevent DKA and HHS. These strategies may include increased screening for type 2 diabetes and improving access to medical care for the at-risk population. Given the increased disease severity and mortality of HHS, there is a pressing need for not only endocrinologists but also emergency medicine physicians to recognize the distinction in presentation and treatment between DKA and HHS. Future studies are also needed to study the prevalence, disease severity, and mortality of hyperosmolar DKA. Current guidelines for hyperosmolar DKA and HHS are adapted from adult practice guidelines. However, the lack of consensus on optimal fluid rates in children with obesity and concern for cerebral edema remain treatment conundrums. A multicenter clinical trial is needed to provide evidence-based treatment for fluid and insulin infusion rates for children with hyperosmolar DKA and HHS, to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with these hyperglycemic crises.

### Thirty years of personal experience in hyperglycemic crises: diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [^116kkeVh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) cause major morbidity and significant mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. For more than 30 yr, our group, in a series of prospective, randomized clinical studies, has investigated the pathogenesis and evolving strategies of the treatment of hyperglycemic crises. This paper summarizes the results of these prospective studies on the management and pathophysiology of DKA.

Setting

Our earliest studies evaluated the comparative efficacy of low-dose vs. pharmacological amounts of insulin and the use of low-dose therapy by various routes in adults and later in children. Subsequent studies evaluated phosphate and bicarbonate therapy, lipid metabolism, ketosis-prone type 2 patients, and use of rapid-acting insulin analogs as well as leptin status, cardiac risk factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and the mechanism of activation of T lymphocytes in hyperglycemic crises.

Main Outcome

The information garnered from these studies resulted in the creation of the 2001 American Diabetes Association (ADA) technical review on DKA and HHS as well as the ADA Position and Consensus Paper on the therapy for hyperglycemic crises.

Conclusions

Areas of future research include prospective randomized studies to do the following: 1) establish the efficacy of bicarbonate therapy in DKA for a pH less than 6.9; 2) establish the need for a bolus insulin dose in the initial therapy of DKA; 3) determine the pathophysiological mechanisms for the absence of ketosis in HHS; 4) investigate the reasons for elevated proinflammatory cytokines and cardiovascular risk factors; and 5) evaluate the efficacy and cost benefit of using sc regular insulin vs. more expensive insulin analogs on the general ward for the treatment of DKA.

Seven obese African American youth were considered to have died from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) due to type 1 diabetes, despite meeting the criteria for hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state and not for DKA.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^116CbpMu]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children — management in mixed DKA/HHS: In children with mixed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS), guidelines for adjusting insulin and dextrose infusions should be similar to those generally recommended of DKA, with frequent reassessment of circulatory status and readjustment of fluid administration rates as dictated by clinical status. Insulin therapy dictates close attention to potassium and phosphate concentrations. In these patients, the risk of CE is higher than in classical HHS, so fluid treatment should therefore be aimed at ensuring adequate circulatory volume and cerebral perfusion while avoiding excess fluid administration, and frequent monitoring of mental status is essential.

### Prediabetes directly deteriorates into diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome triggered by acute pancreatitis: a case report illustrating a "Chicken and egg" paradigm in ketosis-prone diabetes [^117PHdzp]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

DKA and HHS are common clinical presentations that require clinical considerations beyond the well-established protocol-guided treatment of metabolic derangements. First, in addition to early initiation of IV fluid and IV insulin therapy, clinicians should search for and treat the triggers in order to achieve more favorable outcomes. Second, DKA can produce abdominal pain mimicking acute abdomen and thus delay the diagnosis of the underlying etiology. Clinicians should be vigilant and consider a broad differential diagnosis, with special consideration for pathologies that can cause both abdominal pain and trigger DKA. Third, prediabetes can directly evolve into DKA, which is a less recognized clinical phenomenon and represents an atypical type of diabetes called ketosis-prone diabetes. These patients should be closely followed since they require early recognition, appropriate Aβ classification, and prompt insulin treatment to prevent the deterioration into diabetic crises, especially under stressful conditions.

### Diagnosis and acute management of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children and adolescents [^112JvPBU]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is an indolent process characterized by significantly increased levels of serum glucose, high osmolality, and electrolyte abnormalities. The incidence of HHS has steadily risen in the pediatric population over the past several years. Patients with HHS often present with profound dehydration, fatigue, and early mental status changes. Primary emergency management of HHS involves fluid replacement, hemodynamic support, correcting electrolyte derangements, and addressing complications and underlying illnesses. Insulin is not an initial therapy in HHS and should be considered only after the patient's fluids and electrolytes have been repleted. Unlike in diabetic ketoacidosis, HHS patients are not acidotic, although children may present with mixed HHS/diabetic ketoacidosis syndromes. Complications of HHS include thrombosis, rhabdomyolysis, and, rarely, malignant hyperthermia.

### Management of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state in adults with diabetes [^114vVwFU]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) is a medical emergency, which differs from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and requires a different approach. The present article summarizes the recent guidance on HHS that has been produced by the Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care, available in full at http://www.diabetologists-abcd.org.uk/JBDS/JBDS_IP_HHS_Adults.pdf. HHS has a higher mortality rate than DKA and may be complicated by myocardial infarction, stroke, seizures, cerebral oedema and central pontine myelinolysis and there is some evidence that rapid changes in osmolality during treatment may be the precipitant of central pontine myelinolysis. Whilst DKA presents within hours of onset, HHS comes on over many days, and the dehydration and metabolic disturbances are more extreme. The key points in these HHS guidelines include: (1) monitoring of the response to treatment: (i) measure or calculate the serum osmolality regularly to monitor the response to treatment and (ii) aim to reduce osmolality by 3–8 mOsm/kg/h; (2) fluid and insulin administration: (i) use i.v. 0.9% sodium chloride solution as the principal fluid to restore circulating volume and reverse dehydration, (ii) fluid replacement alone will cause a fall in blood glucose (BG) level, (iii) withhold insulin until the BG level is no longer falling with i.v. fluids alone (unless ketonaemic), (iv) an initial rise in sodium level is expected and is not itself an indication for hypotonic fluids and (v) early use of insulin (before fluids) may be detrimental; and (3) delivery of care: (i) The diabetes specialist team should be involved as soon as possible and (ii) patients should be nursed in areas where staff are experienced in the management of HHS.

### An extremely high blood glucose level in a child with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state and type 1 diabetes [^116cjfGP]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) is one of the most severe acute complications of diabetes mellitus (DM) characterized by severe hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality without significant ketosis and acidosis. What is new? Since HHS in the pediatric population is rare and potentially life-threatening, every reported case is very valuable for raising awareness among healthcare professionals.

Case Presentation

A 7-year-old boy with previously diagnosed Joubert syndrome was admitted due to vomiting, polydipsia and polyuria started several days earlier. He was severely dehydrated, and the initial blood glucose level was 115 mmol/L. Based on clinical manifestations and laboratory results, he was diagnosed with T1DM and HHS. The treatment with intravenous fluid was started and insulin administration began later. He was discharged after 10 days without any complications related to HHS.

Conclusions

Since HHS has a high mortality rate, early recognition, and proper management are necessary for a better outcome.

### Emergency department management of uncomplicated hyperglycemia in patients without history of diabetes [^1134LKFW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemia is a common finding in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). Recommendations addressing uncomplicated hyperglycemia in the ED are limited, and the management of those without a prior diagnosis of diabetes presents a challenge.

Objective

This narrative review will discuss the ED evaluation and management of hyperglycemic adult patients without a history of diabetes who do not have evidence of a hyperglycemic crisis, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

Discussion

Many adults who present to the ED have risk factors for diabetes and meet American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for diabetes screening. A new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes can be established in the ED by the ADA criteria in patients with a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) and symptoms of hyperglycemia. The diagnosis should be considered in patients with an elevation in random blood glucose > 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). Treatment may begin in the ED and varies depending on the presenting severity of hyperglycemia. Treatment options include metformin, long-acting insulin, or deferring for close outpatient management.

Conclusions

Emergency clinician knowledge of the evaluation and management of new-onset hyperglycemia and diabetes is important to prevent long-term complications.

History of Diabetic Ketoacidosis and Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State

Robert Rushakoff, MD

USCF, San Francisco, CA, USA

Key ideas

The Bradshawe Lecture on Diabetic Coma by Julius Dreschfeld classified the cases of diabetic coma, according to the symptoms, into three groups: drowsiness, alcohol intoxication, and dyspnea.
The use of insulin in the treatment of diabetic coma at home and in the hospital began around 1945.
Further treatment methods such as bicarbonate therapy for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) continued to be developed.

Summary

A foundational reference for the clinical presentation of hyperglycemic crisis is the 1886 Bradshawe Lecture by Julius Dreschfeld. He describes three presentations of "diabetic coma". The most common one demonstrates dyspnea, severe abdominal pain, and includes Adolph Kussmaul's description of breathlessness and "expelled air with a chloroform-like smell". Another occurs in "stout" patients beyond age 40, with a rapid pulse and urine with high sugar but no acetone. These represent DKA and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS); the third form described is less clear. Identified precipitants included excessive exercise, physiologic or mental stress, and an exclusively meat diet, with treatment by avoiding the same. In the 1970s, low dose insulin (on average 46 units of insulin) vs high dose (236 units of insulin) was found to cause less hypokalemia and hypoglycemia and became standard. Further studies showed all insulin delivery routes effectively treated DKA, but no improvement with the use of bicarbonate.

### Diazoxide [^114JqTCd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

The antidiuretic property of diazoxide may lead to significant fluid retention. In patients with compromised cardiac reserve, fluid retention may precipitate congestive heart failure. If fluid retention develops, manage according to standards of care.

Co-administration of diazoxide with thiazides may potentiate the hyperglycemic and hyperuricemic actions of diazoxide (see DRUG INTERACTIONS and ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND/OR TOXICOLOGY).

Ketoacidosis and nonketotic hyperosmolar coma have been reported in patients treated with diazoxide, usually during intercurrent illness. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential (see OVERDOSAGE), and prolonged surveillance following the acute episode is necessary because of the long drug half-life of approximately 30 hours. Advise patients to monitor urine glucose and ketones and to promptly report abnormal findings and symptoms of ketoacidosis to their healthcare provider. Transient cataracts occurred in association with hyperosmolar coma in an infant, and subsided on correction of the hyper-osmolarity. Cataracts have been observed in several animals receiving daily doses of intravenous or oral diazoxide.

The development of abnormal facial features in four children treated chronically (> 4 years) with diazoxide for hypoglycemia hyperinsulinism in the same clinic has been reported.

Pulmonary Hypertension in Neonates and Infants

There have been postmarketing reports of pulmonary hypertension occurring in infants and neonates treated with diazoxide. The cases were reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. Monitor patients, especially those with risk factors for pulmonary hypertension, for respiratory distress and discontinue diazoxide if pulmonary hypertension is suspected.

Pitfalls in the Management of Diabetic Ketoacidosis and Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State

Mary Korytkowski, MD

University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

Key ideas

Much of the literature for managing patients admitted to the hospital with DKA and HHS focuses on acute management. However, goal-directed therapy of these hyperglycemic emergencies extends beyond acute management.
Hypoglycemia and hypokalemia are commonly encountered complications of therapy that can adversely affect patient morbidity and mortality in the hospital. Ineffective transitioning from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin results in recurrent hyperglycemia and DKA.
Patients presenting with hyperglycemia emergencies are at risk for adverse outcomes beyond the acute hospitalization, including frequent hospital readmissions, and mortality. This indicates a need for addressing issues that extend beyond acute management. Protocols targeting metabolic and glycemic management pitfalls are effective at reducing the frequency of adverse events, but there is a need to identify patients at risk for recurrent hospital admissions with DKA and HHS.

Summary

The most commonly identified risk factors for hyperglycemic crisis include insulin omission and infection. Alcohol use, pancreatitis, and new onset diabetes are also frequent causes. Insulin omission can occur due to financial constraints, mental stress, fear of hypoglycemia, a misunderstanding about stopping insulin when ill, or a maladaptive desire to lose weight. While acute management is often protocolized, several pitfalls can be encountered during subsequent care. These include stopping the insulin infusion prior to anion gap closure, failure to overlap subcutaneous and intravenous insulin, and recurrent hyperglycemia and increased anion gap after transition. Hypoglycemia and hypokalemia are common (occurring in 12%-35%and 16%-62%of patients, respectively) and associated with an increase in hospital mortality. Patients are also at risk for hospital readmission and have an increase in mortality at one year. Potentially modifiable risk factors for readmission include poor glycemic control, comorbid depression, substance use and psychiatric illness, underinsurance, and homelessness.
