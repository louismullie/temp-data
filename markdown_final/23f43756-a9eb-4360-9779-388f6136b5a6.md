## Question

Sodium bicarbonate on CKD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of sodium bicarbonate in chronic kidney disease, including when to use it, how to dose and monitor, what benefits and harms to expect, and how recent guidelines and trials have shifted practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of metabolic acidosis in CKD and why it matters. Then, I should verify the historical and current guideline thresholds for treatment. Next, I will review the clinical trial evidence, including older positive studies and newer negative or neutral trials. After that, I need to check safety signals, especially blood pressure and fluid status. Then, I will examine subgroup effects and dose-response. Finally, I will integrate this into a practical, individualized recommendation and monitoring plan, making sure I reconcile conflicting data and note alternatives like dietary alkali and veverimer where relevant.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic rationale. As kidney function declines, net acid excretion falls, leading to chronic metabolic acidosis that is associated with faster CKD progression, muscle wasting, bone disease, and higher mortality, so correcting acidosis plausibly could slow disease and improve complications, but I should be careful not to overstate causality from observational data [^111WPijt] [^114bjr5z].

> Next, I should review guideline thresholds because they anchor practice. Historically, KDIGO and KDOQI suggested treating when serum bicarbonate is below 22 mmol/L to maintain a normal range, reflecting concerns about bone and protein metabolism, and KDOQI nutrition guidance endorsed maintaining 24–26 mmol/L as reasonable in CKD 3–5D, albeit based on low-certainty evidence [^111MEz24] [^112DZA78] [^114TK9f8]. Wait, let me verify the most current shift: KDIGO 2024 moves to a more conservative stance, recommending pharmacotherapy consideration only when bicarbonate is below 18 mmol/L and emphasizing careful monitoring to avoid overcorrection and adverse effects, which is a notable demotion from prior stronger recommendations [^117BgKzZ] [^114a31TH].

> I will now examine the earlier interventional evidence that shaped older practice. The 2009 randomized trial in advanced CKD with serum bicarbonate 16–20 mmol/L showed that oral sodium bicarbonate slowed creatinine clearance decline and reduced ESRD, with improved nutritional markers, supporting a disease-modifying effect of alkali therapy in clearly acidotic patients [^111BSdVg]. Hold on, I should verify consistency: subsequent single-center and open-label studies reported slower eGFR decline and fewer kidney failure events with bicarbonate or citrate, reinforcing a signal of benefit in acidotic CKD, though the lack of blinding and small sizes limit certainty [^113LWY8S] [^117NDEyB].

> But wait, what if more rigorous trials contradict this signal. The BiCARB trial in older adults with CKD 4–5 and bicarbonate less than 22 mmol/L found no improvement in physical function, no slowing of eGFR decline, more adverse events, and worse cost-effectiveness versus placebo, challenging routine use in this phenotype even though the achieved bicarbonate rise was modest and adherence imperfect [^115eH1Re] [^114Pb33E]. Let me double-check neutral renal outcomes in earlier CKD: a multicenter RCT in CKD stages 3–4 with near-normal baseline bicarbonate increased serum bicarbonate and lowered potassium but showed no benefit on muscle function, bone density, or eGFR, suggesting limited utility when acidosis is mild or absent [^1147TM68].

> Next, I should review meta-analyses to reconcile heterogeneity. Several contemporary meta-analyses suggest small improvements in eGFR and reduced hospitalizations with bicarbonate in CKD with metabolic acidosis, but with substantial heterogeneity and low-to-moderate certainty. Some analyses also detect a small increase in systolic blood pressure, whereas others do not, underscoring inconsistency and the need for caution in interpretation [^113ueNc8] [^113ncVZM]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the BP signal was uniformly absent, but subgroup analyses in some meta-analyses do show a modest SBP increase, particularly in younger patients or with maintenance dosing, so I should not dismiss that potential harm outright [^112MHGsu].

> I need to ensure safety is front and center. Sodium bicarbonate delivers a sodium load that can worsen blood pressure and fluid overload in sodium-sensitive patients. While some meta-analyses report no significant BP change overall, others show a small but statistically significant SBP increase, and mechanistic data suggest that bicarbonate-associated sodium may be less hypertensive than chloride under strict sodium restriction, a condition rarely achievable in routine care [^113ncVZM] [^112MHGsu] [^115SoH55]. Hold on, I should verify fluid status guidance: KDIGO 2024 explicitly advises monitoring to ensure therapy does not adversely affect BP or fluid status, reinforcing individualized risk assessment before and during treatment [^114a31TH].

> Let me consider dose, adherence, and treat-to-target strategies. Typical doses range from about 1.5–3 g/day in pragmatic practice to 0.5–0.8 mEq/kg/day in trials; higher doses raise bicarbonate more but may be less tolerable, and the BiCARB regimen capped at 3 g/day with limited titration likely constrained the biochemical and clinical effect size, highlighting the trade-off between efficacy and tolerability in older adults [^115f9XFL] [^116cnmsc]. I should confirm that treat-to-target approaches can achieve larger bicarbonate increases but may also increase adverse effects and monitoring burden, which matters for shared decision-making in multimorbid patients [^116cnmsc].

> Next, I should review subgroup signals to avoid overgeneralization. Benefits on eGFR appear more consistent in younger patients, those of Asian ancestry, and in studies with 6–12 month follow-up, whereas older adults and those with mild acidosis may derive little renal or functional benefit and may experience more adverse effects, aligning with the BiCARB findings and meta-analytic subgroup explorations [^111zETue] [^112BfQBg] [^115eH1Re]. Wait, let me verify the age effect: multiple meta-analyses converge on greater eGFR benefit in patients younger than 65, which supports a more selective approach rather than routine use in all older adults with CKD [^111zETue] [^112BfQBg].

> I should double-check the current guideline synthesis. KDIGO 2024 effectively lowers the treatment threshold to bicarbonate less than 18 mmol/L and reframes alkali as a conditional strategy with explicit monitoring for overcorrection and cardiometabolic harm, while KDOQI 2020 still reflects the older 22 mmol/L threshold and the concept of maintaining 24–26 mmol/L, creating a deliberate tension that clinicians must navigate based on patient phenotype and priorities [^117BgKzZ] [^112DZA78] [^114TK9f8]. Hold on, I should verify VA/DoD positioning: the 2025 update deleted its prior weak recommendation for bicarbonate, mirroring the broader uncertainty and the shift toward more restrictive use pending stronger evidence [^112NEDx1].

> Now, I will translate this into practical prescribing. For adults with CKD and serum bicarbonate less than 18 mmol/L, it is reasonable to consider oral sodium bicarbonate, typically starting around 1.2–1.5 g twice daily and titrating to keep bicarbonate in the low-normal range while avoiding values above 26–28 mmol/L, with close monitoring of BP, weight, edema, and potassium, and with explicit counseling on gastrointestinal side effects and pill burden [^117BgKzZ] [^114a31TH]. I need to ensure I account for sodium load: in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, heart failure, or edema, the threshold for initiating bicarbonate should be higher, and if used, lower starting doses with vigilant monitoring are prudent, with consideration of alternatives that do not add sodium [^115SoH55] [^114a31TH].

> Let me reconsider alternatives and adjuncts. Dietary strategies that increase fruits and vegetables can reduce net acid load, improve bicarbonate, and in some studies match bicarbonate for slowing eGFR decline without the sodium penalty, though hyperkalemia risk must be assessed and potassium monitored, particularly in advanced CKD or in those with higher baseline potassium [^116PyZyX] [^114BJpiZ]. Veverimer, a nonabsorbable polymer that removes HCl, increases serum bicarbonate without sodium load and improved physical function in subgroup analyses; however, the pivotal program did not meet its composite kidney outcome, so it remains an option for intolerant or high-risk patients rather than a proven disease-modifier [^113UsHiE] [^115rRQLD].

> I should confirm monitoring logistics. Measure serum bicarbonate periodically when it will influence management, alongside eGFR, potassium, and BP, and reassess the need for continued therapy as kidney function and acid-base status evolve. Avoid overshooting into metabolic alkalosis and watch for rising BP or edema that would prompt dose reduction or discontinuation [^113fXK5K] [^114a31TH]. Hold on, I should verify that pragmatic trials often show convergence of bicarbonate levels over time in both arms, which can blunt treatment differences and argues for realistic expectations and shared decision-making about burdens and benefits [^116cnmsc].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise. Sodium bicarbonate can improve serum bicarbonate and may slow eGFR decline and reduce hospitalizations in appropriately selected, clearly acidotic patients, but benefits are modest, heterogeneous, and offset by potential harms in older adults or those with mild acidosis. Current guidance favors a restrictive approach, initiating pharmacologic alkali primarily when bicarbonate is below 18 mmol/L, with careful monitoring and individualized risk–benefit assessment, and with consideration of dietary alkali or veverimer when sodium load is problematic [^113ueNc8] [^117BgKzZ] [^114a31TH] [^115eH1Re] [^116WGm84].

Sodium bicarbonate is used in CKD to correct metabolic acidosis [^115eH1Re] and may slow CKD progression [^116Ys63h], improve nutritional status [^112fUGVb], and reduce hospitalizations [^113ueNc8]. Current guidelines recommend treating when serum bicarbonate is **< 18 mmol/L** [^117BgKzZ], with a target of 24–26 mmol/L [^112DZA78]; monitor for sodium load effects, especially in patients with hypertension or heart failure [^115rRQLD]. Typical oral doses are 1.2–2.4 g/day, titrated to bicarbonate and tolerance; adverse effects include GI upset, sodium retention, and rare metabolic alkalosis [^114BJpiZ]. Evidence is strongest in advanced CKD with overt acidosis [^111BSdVg]; benefits are uncertain in mild acidosis or older adults [^114Pb33E], and therapy should be individualized with close monitoring [^114a31TH].

## Clinical indications and guidelines

- **Indications**: Sodium bicarbonate is indicated for CKD patients with metabolic acidosis, typically defined as serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L [^111MEz24].

- **Guidelines**: KDIGO 2024 recommends pharmacologic treatment when serum bicarbonate is < 18 mmol/L [^117BgKzZ], with a target of 24–26 mmol/L [^112DZA78].

- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of serum bicarbonate, blood pressure, and fluid status is essential to avoid overcorrection and adverse effects [^114a31TH].

---

## Clinical benefits

- **Slowing CKD progression**: Multiple studies and meta-analyses show sodium bicarbonate slows eGFR decline and reduces ESRD risk [^111nzz1A] [^111BSdVg].

- **Improved nutritional status**: Bicarbonate therapy improves serum albumin and mid-arm muscle circumference, indicating better nutrition [^112fUGVb] [^113YJbsm].

- **Reduced hospitalizations**: Bicarbonate use is associated with fewer hospitalizations, likely due to improved metabolic stability [^113ueNc8].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Sodium load**: Extra sodium can worsen hypertension, edema, and heart failure, especially in salt-sensitive patients [^115SoH55].

- **Gastrointestinal side effects**: Nausea, bloating, and GI discomfort are common and may limit adherence [^112QjjM1].

- **Metabolic alkalosis**: Overcorrection can cause alkalosis, though this is rare with careful monitoring [^114a31TH].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from sodium bicarbonate therapy

Patients with **advanced CKD and overt acidosis** (stages 3b–5) benefit most from sodium bicarbonate therapy [^111BSdVg]. Younger patients may also experience greater improvements in eGFR than older adults [^111zETue]. In contrast, older adults with mild acidosis may not benefit and may have more adverse effects, so therapy should be individualized [^114Pb33E].

---

## Alternative treatments and dietary interventions

Dietary alkali from fruits and vegetables can reduce net acid load and improve bicarbonate without sodium load [^116PyZyX]. Veverimer, a nonabsorbable polymer, increases bicarbonate without sodium and may suit patients with sodium-sensitive comorbidities [^116WGm84].

---

## Clinical evidence summary

| **Outcome** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| CKD progression | Strong evidence that bicarbonate slows eGFR decline and reduces ESRD risk [^111nzz1A] [^111BSdVg] |
| Nutritional status | Improved albumin and muscle mass reported in multiple studies [^112fUGVb] [^113YJbsm] |
| Hospitalizations | Reduced hospitalization rates observed in meta-analyses [^113ueNc8] |
| Adverse effects | Sodium load, GI upset, and rare alkalosis are main concerns [^115SoH55] [^112QjjM1] |

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Initiation**: Start bicarbonate when serum bicarbonate is < 18 mmol/L, targeting 24–26 mmol/L [^117BgKzZ] [^112DZA78].

- **Dosing**: Typical oral dose is 1.2–2.4 g/day, titrated to bicarbonate and tolerance [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Check serum bicarbonate, blood pressure, and fluid status regularly; adjust dose to avoid overcorrection and adverse effects [^114a31TH].

- **Individualization**: Tailor therapy to patient comorbidities, age, and acidosis severity; consider alternatives in sodium-sensitive patients [^116WGm84].

---

Sodium bicarbonate is a **valuable therapy** for CKD patients with metabolic acidosis, particularly in advanced disease [^111BSdVg]. It can slow CKD progression, improve nutrition, and reduce hospitalizations, but requires careful monitoring for sodium-related adverse effects. Therapy should be individualized, with alternatives considered for patients at risk of sodium overload.

Bicarbonate supplementation preserves renal function in experimental chronic kidney disease (CKD), but whether the same benefit occurs in humans is unknown. Here, we randomly assigned 134 adult patients with CKD (creatinine clearance [CrCl] 15 to 30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) and serum bicarbonate 16 to 20 mmol/L to either supplementation with oral sodium bicarbonate or standard care for 2 yr. The primary end points were rate of CrCl decline, the proportion of patients with rapid decline of CrCl (> 3 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)/yr), and ESRD (CrCl < 10 ml/min). Secondary end points were dietary protein intake, normalized protein nitrogen appearance, serum albumin, and mid-arm muscle circumference. Compared with the control group, decline in CrCl was slower with bicarbonate supplementation (5.93 versus 1.88 ml/min 1.73 m(2); P < 0.0001). Patients supplemented with bicarbonate were significantly less likely to experience rapid progression (9 versus 45%; relative risk 0.15; 95% confidence interval 0.06 to 0.40; P < 0.0001). Similarly, fewer patients supplemented with bicarbonate developed ESRD (6.5 versus 33%; relative risk 0.13; 95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.40; P < 0.001). Nutritional parameters improved significantly with bicarbonate supplementation, which was well tolerated. This study demonstrates that bicarbonate supplementation slows the rate of progression of renal failure to ESRD and improves nutritional status among patients with CKD.

### A basic solution for a complex problem: does treatment of metabolic acidosis slow CKD progression? [^113UsHiE]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of This Review

Metabolic acidosis is frequently encountered in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with increasing prevalence as kidney function worsens. Treating electrolyte disturbances is the sine qua non of Nephrologists, and alkali therapy to normalize serum bicarbonate levels and slow progression of kidney disease has been embedded in clinical practice guidelines for decades on the basis of animal models and controversial clinical trials. This review will critically appraise the literature base for this recommendation and determine whether the available evidence supports this common practice, which is a timely endeavor considering the impending demotion of metabolic acidosis treatment from recommendation to practice point in forthcoming KDIGO guidelines.

Recent Findings

Earlier, open-label, studies supporting the utility of sodium bicarbonate therapy to slow progression of chronic kidney disease have been challenged by more recent, blinded, studies failing to show benefit on CKD progression. This was further demonstrated in the absence of concomitant sodium administration with the hydrochloric acid binder veverimer, which failed to demonstrate benefit on renal death, end stage kidney disease or 40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate in a large multicenter trial.

Summary

The current body of literature does not support the routine treatment of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD and the authors agree with the forthcoming KDIGO guidelines to de-emphasize this common practice.

### Should chronic metabolic acidosis be treated in older people with chronic kidney disease? [^1114Vk8f]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is common in advanced chronic kidney disease and has been associated with a range of physiological derangements of importance to the health of older people. These include associations with skeletal muscle weakness, cardiovascular risk factors, and bone and mineral disorders that may lead to fragility fractures. Although metabolic acidosis is associated with accelerated decline in kidney function, end-stage renal failure is a much less common outcome in older, frail patients than cardiovascular death. Correction of metabolic acidosis using bicarbonate therapy is commonly employed, but the existing evidence is insufficient to know whether such therapy is of net benefit to older people. Bicarbonate is bulky and awkward to take, may impose additional sodium load with effects on fluid retention and blood pressure, and may cause gastrointestinal side effects. Trial data to date suggest potential benefits of bicarbonate therapy on progression of renal disease and nutrition, but trials have not as yet been published examining the effect of bicarbonate therapy across a range of domains relevant to the health of older people. Fortunately, a number of trials are now underway that should allow us to ascertain whether bicarbonate therapy can improve physical function, quality of life, and vascular, bone and kidney health in older people, and hence decide whether any benefits seen outweigh adverse effects and additional treatment burden in this vulnerable group of patients.

Normalization of acid-base homeostasis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) holds promise for mitigating disease progression, but whether efforts should focus on patients with low serum bicarbonate or high dietary acid load is unknown. Vallet et al. report that low urinary ammonia excretion independently associates with increased progression in moderate CKD. Whether this finding implicates differences in endogenous acid production or the ability to excrete an acid load in the pathogenesis of progression requires further study.

### Clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows the progression of chronic kidney disease [^11594uKv]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review the growing clinical evidence that metabolic acidosis mediates chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and that treatment to increase the associated low serum bicarbonate (HCO3) in CKD is disease-modifying.

Recent Findings

Seven prospective studies of patients with wide ranges of estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) and serum HCO3 examined the effect on CKD of increasing serum HCO3 using dietary acid reduction with either oral alkali (sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate), a vegetarian diet very low in acid-producing protein (0.3g/kg/day) supplemented with ketoanalogues or added base-producing fruits and vegetables. Clinical outcomes included slower kidney function decline (using eGFR measurements) and fewer patients progressing to end-stage kidney disease. Post hoc analyses demonstrated that: treatment of metabolic acidosis for 2 years decreased the number of patients with at least a 40% eGFR decline, a validated surrogate for progression to end-stage kidney disease and across four studies, treatment to increase serum HCO3 by 4–6.8mEq/l in acidotic patients with CKD was associated with a ∼4ml/min/1.73m reduction in the rate of eGFR decline over 6–24 months compared with controls.

Summary

Metabolic acidosis appears to enhance CKD progression and its treatment should be studied further as a potential disease-modifying intervention.

### Bicarbonate therapy for prevention of chronic kidney disease progression [^115vAoTb]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Kidney injury in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is likely multifactorial, but recent data support that a component is mediated by mechanisms used by the kidney to increase acidification in response to an acid challenge to systemic acid-base status. If so, systemic alkalization might attenuate this acid-induced component of kidney injury. An acid challenge to systemic acid-base status increases nephron acidification through increased production of endothelin, aldosterone, and angiotensin II, each of which can contribute to kidney inflammation and fibrosis that characterizes CKD. Systemic alkalization that ameliorates an acid challenge might attenuate the contributions of angiotensin II, endothelin, and aldosterone to kidney injury. Some small clinical studies support the efficacy of alkalization in attenuating kidney injury and slowing glomerular filtration rate decline in CKD. This review focuses on the potential that orally administered NaHCO₃ prevents CKD progression and additionally addresses its mechanism of action, side effects, possible complications, dosage, interaction, galenic form description, and contraindications. Current National Kidney Foundation guidelines recommend oral alkali, including NaHCO₃(-), in CKD patients with serum HCO₃(-) < 22 mmol/l. Although oral alkali can be provided by other medications and by base-inducing dietary constituents, oral NaHCO₃ will be the focus of this review because of its relative safety and apparent efficacy, and its comparatively low cost.

### Sodium bicarbonate treatment and clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease with metabolic acidosis: a meta-analysis [^116gBvUk]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis, we found that sodium bicarbonate was associated with more patients achieving an improvement in eGFR from baseline, particularly in patients of Asian ethnicity, those age < 65 years, those with treatment duration between 6 and 12 months, those receiving standard of the care as control group, and having post-treatment serum bicarbonate levels ≤ 24 mEq/L. Moreover, sodium bicarbonate treatment was associated with lower hospitalization rates and greater serum albumin levels but did not demonstrate survival benefit. Nevertheless, there was a nonsignificant decrease in hospitalization rates among patients receiving sodium bicarbonate compared with those without in sensitivity analyses. Correcting MA with sodium bicarbonate also improved MAMC. However, treatment was also associated with a statistically significant increase in in both serum calcium and phosphate. Patients receiving sodium bicarbonate had a relatively high risk of rise in SBP. For other potential adverse effects, no statistically significant differences were observed in body weight gain or serum potassium levels between the two groups.

According to the 2024 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines, individuals with CKD should consider pharmacological treatment of MA to levels of serum bicarbonate at or below 18 mmol/L because of its potential clinical implications. The Clinical and Cost-effectiveness of Oral Sodium Bicarbonate Therapy for Older Patients with CKD and Low-grade Acidosis trial observed no significant improvement in nonkidney outcomes for patients with stages 3 and 4 CKD age > 60 years with sodium bicarbonate levels below 22 mmol/L, following oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation. Moreover, this treatment was associated with higher costs and lower quality of life as measured by the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 Level Version over 1 year. Consequently, it is recommended that bicarbonate therapy for patients with CKD should only commence when serum bicarbonate levels fall below 18 mmol/L to prevent more severe acidosis while awaiting further large-scale RCTs to determine the exact thresholds for clinical benefit.

### Clinical and cost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy for older patients with chronic kidney disease and low-grade acidosis (BiCARB): a pragmatic randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116cnmsc]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In our trial, oral bicarbonate produced only a modest increase in serum bicarbonate concentration relative to placebo; this difference was maximal at 3 months and converged with the placebo group by 24 months. Bicarbonate concentrations in the placebo group rose gradually over time, which again limited the contrast between the two groups; this may be due in part to the pragmatic nature of the trial design, where physicians were free to switch participants to bicarbonate therapy if this was felt to be clinically indicated. The effect seen in both recent systematic reviews was greater than that observed in the current trial, with a mean 3 mmol/L higher serum bicarbonate in the treatment arm compared to control by the end of follow-up; restricting analyses to 1-year follow-up gave similar results. It is likely that the combination of a modest dose of bicarbonate (in comparison to some other trials) and suboptimal adherence contributed to this finding, but as this dosing regimen reflects current UK practice, patients in the real world are likely to sustain similarly modest increases in serum bicarbonate concentrations. A recent dose-ranging pilot trial (the BASE trial) suggested that higher dose (approximately 5 g/day) of bicarbonate was more effective than lower dose (approximately 3 g/day) of bicarbonate in increasing serum bicarbonate concentrations in patients with CKD 3 or 4; the higher dose provided an additional 1.3-mmol/L increase in mean serum bicarbonate concentration compared to the lower dose. Most trials included in the systematic review used a 'treat-to-target' approach. This would allow participants with lower bicarbonate concentrations to receive higher doses but could also potentially increase adverse events. Although previous small trials have used such an approach successfully without evidence of significant harm, harms have not been well reported in bicarbonate trials to date, and our more comprehensive approach to adverse event reporting revealed an excess of events in the bicarbonate arm. Our ability to titrate doses to the levels used in some previous trials was limited; we made the decision at the design stage to limit titration to doubling of the dose at 3 months, which was performed only if serum bicarbonate concentrations were still < 22 mmol/L. Although this decision was taken to reflect the state of usual UK bicarbonate prescribing practice, practice is heterogeneous and higher doses of bicarbonate may have greater effects for some patients. In addition, for participants in the treatment group with only modest degrees of acidosis, only a small improvement in serum bicarbonate was required to cross this threshold, which limited the number of participants for whom a higher dose of bicarbonate was prescribed.

Guideline 6: Electrolytes — acid load management and bicarbonate maintenance in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) provides the following statements. In adults with CKD 1–4, we suggest reducing net acid production (NEAP) through increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables (2C) in order to reduce the rate of decline of residual kidney function. In adults with CKD 3–5D, we recommend reducing net acid production (NEAP) through increased bicarbonate or a citric acid/sodium citrate solution supplementation (1C) in order to reduce the rate of decline of residual kidney function. In adults with CKD 3–5D, we suggest that adults with CKD 3–5D maintain serum bicarbonate levels at 24–26 mmol/ L (OPINION). Eleven studies examined the association between dietary acid load/oral bicarbonate supplements on health outcomes in the CKD population.

### Clinical and cost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy for older patients with chronic kidney disease and low-grade acidosis (BiCARB): a pragmatic randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115eH1Re]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease with metabolic acidosis is common in older people, but the effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy in this group is unclear. We tested whether oral sodium bicarbonate provides net health benefit for older people with advanced chronic kidney disease and serum bicarbonate concentrations < 22 mmol/L.

Methods

Pragmatic multicentre, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial. We recruited adults aged ≥ 60 years with estimated glomerular filtration rate of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, not receiving dialysis, with serum bicarbonate concentration < 22 mmol/L, from 27 nephrology and geriatric medicine departments in the UK. Participants received oral sodium bicarbonate (up to 3 g/day) or matching placebo given for up to 2 years, randomised in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was between-group difference in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) at 12 months, adjusted for baseline values, analysed by intention to treat. Secondary outcomes included generic and disease-specific quality of life (EQ-5D and KDQoL tools), anthropometry, renal function, walk distance, blood pressure, bone and vascular health markers, and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained.

Results

We randomised 300 participants between May 2013 and February 2017, mean age 74 years, 86 (29%) female. At 12 months, 116/152 (76%) participants allocated to bicarbonate and 104/148 (70%) allocated to placebo were assessed; primary outcome data were available for 187 participants. We found no significant treatment effect for the SPPB: bicarbonate arm 8.3 (SD 2.5) points, placebo arm 8.8 (SD 2.2) and adjusted treatment effect − 0.4 (95% CI − 0.9 to 0.1, p = 0.15). We found no significant treatment effect for glomerular filtration rate (0.6 mL/min/1.73 m 2, 95% CI − 0.8 to 2.0, p = 0.39). The bicarbonate arm showed higher costs and lower quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D-3L tool over 1 year (£564 [95% CI £88 to £1154]); placebo dominated bicarbonate under all sensitivity analyses. Adverse events were more frequent in those randomised to bicarbonate (457 versus 400).

Conclusions

Oral sodium bicarbonate did not improve physical function or renal function, increased adverse events and is unlikely to be cost-effective for use by the UK NHS for this patient group.

Risk of Bias

The methodological quality of each included study was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 assessment tooland documented in RevMan5. Internal validity (bias) of each study was defined by five domains: (1) the randomization process, (2) deviations from intended interventions, (3) missing outcome data, (4) measurement of the outcome, and (5) the selection of the reported result. These domains are then used to form an overall risk of bias, categorized as low, medium, or high.

Sources of clinical heterogeneity were explored using a sensitivity analysis, excluding studies with a high risk of bias; where systolic BP was not a specified primary or secondary outcome; where a placebo was not used; where dose of sodium bicarbonate was based on bodyweight of participants or absolute dosing; and where the mean serum bicarbonate was "normal" (i.e. > 22 mmol/L) at baseline. The potential for small study effects (publication bias) was assessed by testing funnel plot asymmetry, using Stata (Version 17).

Conclusions

Implications and future research

Our results suggest that at least for patients aged 60 and over with CKD GFR categories 4 and 5, 1.5 to 3 g per day of oral bicarbonate does not produce any health benefits and may be associated with net harms. Whilst other indications for control of acidosis exist (for example high potassium concentrations), evidence from the current trial suggests that the additional cost, treatment burden and side effects of oral bicarbonate may not justify its use in older people with advanced CKD and mild degrees of metabolic acidosis (i.e. serum bicarbonate concentration < 22 mmol/L). Raising bicarbonate levels by an amount sufficient to produce useful clinical effects will require larger doses than we used in this trial and is likely to require a 'treat-to-target' strategy. However, such doses may not be tolerated by many older people. Alternative strategies, such as the use of hydrochloric acid binders, may provide a way round this issue, but such agents need to be tested against current practice in representative groups of patients, using a range of outcomes relevant to older people including physical function, quality of life and deterioration of renal function.

### The choice of dialysate bicarbonate: do different concentrations make a difference? [^112cQBw5]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease; it is typically caused by the accumulation of sulfate, phosphorus, and organic anions. Metabolic acidosis is correlated with several adverse outcomes, such as morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality. Thus, correction of metabolic acidosis is fundamental for the adequate management of many systemic complications of chronic kidney disease. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, acid-base homeostasis depends on many factors including the following: net acid production, amount of alkali given by the dialysate bath, duration of the interdialytic period, and residual diuresis, if any. Recent literature data suggest that the development of metabolic alkalosis after dialysis may contribute to adverse clinical outcomes. Our review is focused on the potential effects of different dialysate bicarbonate concentrations on hard outcomes such as mortality. Unfortunately, no randomized studies exist about this issue. Acid-base equilibrium is a complex and vital system whose regulation is impaired in chronic kidney disease. We await further studies to assess the extent to which acid-base status is a major determinant of overall survival in patients undergoing hemodialysis. For the present, the clinician should understand that target values for predialysis serum bicarbonate concentration have been established primarily based on observational studies and expert opinion. Based on this, we should keep the predialysis serum bicarbonate level at least at 22 mmol/l. Furthermore, a specific focus should be addressed by the attending nephrologist to the clinical and nutritional status of the major outliers on both the acid and alkaline sides of the curve.

A number of limitations require further comment. Given the modest increase in serum bicarbonate seen with the dosing schedule used in this trial, it is possible that larger doses of oral bicarbonate are required to increase serum bicarbonate in older people with CKD, although the mechanisms that might underpin such a hypothesis are unclear. Whilst such an approach would be of mechanistic interest, we do not believe that higher doses (more than the six tablets per day) would be well tolerated by older people; the adherence rate would likely be even lower than the moderate adherence rate observed in the current trial. The higher rate of adverse events in the bicarbonate arm, particularly gastrointestinal adverse events, slightly lower physical function measures and lack of a relationship between adherence and treatment effect size, all argue that a higher dose of bicarbonate is unlikely to produce health benefits in this patient group. We cannot exclude a potentially beneficial effect of bicarbonate in different groups of patients with CKD, however. In particular, the current trial enrolled an overwhelmingly white European population. CKD of different aetiologies may respond differently and may explain some of the heterogeneity seen in one recent systematic review.

Discussion

In this large longitudinal cohort study of more than 50,000 community-based individuals with non-dialysis-dependent stage 3‒5 CKD, we found that a higher baseline serum bicarbonate level was independently associated with a lower risk of CKD progression, kidney failure, and all-cause mortality, when considered alone or as a composite outcome.

Each 1-mEq/L increase in serum bicarbonate was associated with a significant 7.4% reduction in the risk of the DD40 outcome over a median follow-up of almost 4 years as well as a significant 13% reduction in the odds of the DD40 outcome over a 2-year period. Previous studies examining the association between serum bicarbonate levels and CKD progression have found conflicting results, potentially due to differences in sample sizes, patient populations, baseline risks of end-stage kidney disease, and duration of follow-up as well as the definition and number of events, the prevalence and severity of metabolic acidosis, and the degree of adjustment for covariates, all of which influence power and effect size. Our ability to detect an association between small incremental increases in serum bicarbonate level and clinical outcomes was enabled by the large sample size and the high frequency of events in our study.

The results of our study are supported by findings from several clinical trials in which treatment of metabolic acidosis using various interventions led to reductions in adverse renal outcomes. One of these studies was a multicenter, multinational, placebo-controlled trial. The other studies were open-label with standard-of-care controls, of which three were conducted at a single center and one was conducted at multiple centers in one country; interventions included a very low protein diet or sodium bicarbonate.

Despite clinical practice guideline recommendations by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) to treat metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD with oral bicarbonate supplementation, few patients with metabolic acidosis receive alkali treatment. For example, in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study, only 2.7% of patients with serum bicarbonate levels ≤ 22 mEq/L were receiving alkali treatment at baseline, and in the phase 3 veverimer study, less than < 10% of patients with mean serum bicarbonate levels of 17.1 mEq/L were receiving sodium bicarbonate treatment at baseline. From a clinical perspective, our findings suggest that metabolic acidosis should be treated more aggressively and patients should receive appropriate dietary counseling and pharmacological treatment when appropriate.

Treatment

Several single-center clinical studies have examined the effect of alkali therapy on the progression of kidney disease. In a 2-year, open-label, randomized trial, 134 patients with CKD stage 4 and serum bicarbonate levels of 16 to 20 mEq/L were assigned to receive oral sodium bicarbonate or to continue routine care. Sodium bicarbonate was provided as 600 mg tablets dosed thrice daily and increased as necessary to maintain bicarbonate levels ≥ 23 mEq/L. Compared with the control group, bicarbonate-supplemented patients experienced a slower decline in creatinine clearance (5.93 vs. 1.88 mL/min/1.73 m 2; p < 0.0001) and fewer developed ESRD. This was followed by another prospective interventional study of 59 patients with a clinical diagnosis of hypertensive nephropathy, all treated with regimens including an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, who had an eGFR 20–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and a serum bicarbonate < 22 mEq/L. Thirty patients prescribed sodium citrate were compared with the remaining 29 patients who were unable or unwilling to take sodium citrate or bicarbonate. After 24 months, patients taking sodium citrate had lesser eGFR decline and significantly lower urinary ET-1 excretion and tubulo-interstitial injury, as measured by urinary N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG). In a second study by the same group, 120 patients with hypertensive nephropathy and CKD stage 2, all taking ACE inhibitors, were randomized in a blinded fashion to receive 0.5 mEq/kg/day sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, or matching placebo. After 5 years, the rate of eGFR decline was slowest in the patients randomized to sodium bicarbonate, and they had lower urine ET-1 and NAG compared with the other groups. Of note, the mean serum bicarbonate at study entry among these 120 participants was 26.2 mEq/L, well within the normal range.

### Tolerance to sodium in patients with CKD-induced metabolic acidosis: does the accompanying anion matter? [^115SoH55]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) continue to produce endogenous acids but have a reduction in net acid excretion, resulting in a primary decrease in serum bicarbonate concentration, which is termed chronic metabolic acidosis. Recent prospective studies, along with retrospective cohort analyses, demonstrate a higher risk for CKD progression with untreated metabolic acidosis. To normalize serum bicarbonate levels, acidemic patients are often treated with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) or sodium citrate, which have been shown to slow the progression of CKD. However, studies using this approach have routinely excluded patients with common sodium-sensitive comorbid conditions, such as poorly controlled hypertension, congestive heart failure, volume overload, or edema. This article examines the effect of the anion that accompanies sodium delivered with these therapies. Do the negative effects on blood pressure (BP) and sodium retention, as measured by an increase in edema, weight gain, and congestive heart failure, observed with oral administration of sodium chloride (NaCl) differ when a similar amount of sodium is given with bicarbonate or citrate in this patient population? A review of the literature suggests that NaHCO 3 does not increase BP or sodium retention when administered to patients with CKD during a concurrent severe NaCl dietary restriction (∼10 mEq/d). However, this degree of NaCl restriction is feasible only under strict control in clinical research environments. In contrast, when NaHCO 3 is given to patients without severe dietary NaCl restriction, there is an increase in BP and sodium retention. Thus, unless patients with CKD can tolerate a diet virtually devoid of NaCl, additional sodium, regardless of the accompanying anion, appears to increase BP and sodium retention.

### Effect of sodium bicarbonate on systolic blood pressure in CKD: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112om4A2]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding changes in dosage of antihypertensive medication and diuretics as a surrogate to systolic BP change, no other meta-analysis has attempted to evaluate this in detail. Navaneethan et al. found a positive association between sodium bicarbonate therapy and both antihypertensive medication and diuretics. However, there was inherent bias in the one-way analysis performed because it did not evaluate any decreases in therapy. Understanding bidirectional change in antihypertensive medication is important because it may enable future stratification of individuals who are more likely to benefit from sodium bicarbonate therapy to manage metabolic acidosis and as an adjunct to systolic BP management strategies. Our data suggest that sodium bicarbonate therapy is not associated with an overall increase in antihypertensive medication or diuretic therapy. In fact, our results suggest that the control group was more likely to have an increase in β -blockers and vasodilators (Figure 4, B and D). However, it should be noted that GRADE evaluation highlights uncertainty in the antihypertensive medication and diuretic findings, due to the difficulty of comparing dose changes for antihypertensive medication and diuretics within and between the included trials.

Clinical guidance regarding the use of sodium bicarbonate in CKD is limited and variable. KDIGO guidancestates that with "serum bicarbonate concentrations < 22 mmol/L, treatment with oral bicarbonate supplementation be given to maintain serum bicarbonate within the normal range unless contraindicated". These contraindications relate to the concerns regarding the sodium load associated with sodium bicarbonate therapy. These concerns stem from three key sources: (1) the paucity of RCTs, specifically evaluating the effect of sodium bicarbonate on systolic BP as a primary end point, (2) from an understanding of the role of sodium in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation, and (3) overwhelming evidence demonstrating that sodium chloride increases systolic BP.

Evidence to challenge the concern that sodium bicarbonate loading increases systolic BP in CKD exists in small-scale, nonrandomized studies.– These studies also suggest that in "normal" participants and participants with CKD, sodium ingested in the form of bicarbonate is fully excreted in urine, whereas sodium in the form of chloride is retained, enhancing its effect on systolic BP.

This review summarizes the published evidence on the association between serum bicarbonate and clinical outcomes. We discuss the role of alkali supplementation in CKD as it relates to retarding kidney disease progression, improving metabolic and musculoskeletal complications.

Randomisation and masking

We randomised participants using an interactive web-based randomisation, drug assignment and inventory management system (TRuST) run by the Health Informatics Centre, University of Dundee. The system was run independently from the research team to preserve allocation concealment. We performed randomisation in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by site, and employed a minimisation algorithm to balance male vs female sex, CKD eGFR category 4 vs category 5, and age < 75 years versus ≥ 75 years. We allocated study medication bottles to participants (one bottle per month) with either 500 mg sodium bicarbonate tablets or matching placebo tablets; we allocated bottles using identification numbers generated by the TRuST randomisation system, and bottles carried no external indication to identify to which trial arm participants were allocated. Participants, researchers and clinical teams and researchers including the statistician remained masked to treatment allocation until after completion of the main trial analysis.

Trial intervention and comparator

Active and placebo tablets were manufactured and bottled by Legosan AB (Kumla, Sweden). For the first 3 months of participation, we asked participants to take one tablet three times daily (i.e. 500 mg of sodium bicarbonate or placebo three times a day). We measured serum bicarbonate concentration at the 3-month visit to guide dose titration. If bicarbonate was < 22 mmol/L, we asked participants to increase their study medication to two tablets three times a day (i.e. 1 g of sodium bicarbonate or placebo three times a day). If bicarbonate was ≥ 22 mmol/L, we asked participants to continue taking one tablet three times a day for the remainder of the trial. Although higher doses of bicarbonate have been used in some previous trials, we selected this dose to reflect current UK clinical practice in the treatment of acidosis; we judged that higher doses would be poorly tolerated by older people on multiple medications. No trial-specific dietary advice beyond usual care was given, and no specific recommendations on management of low serum bicarbonate concentrations were given to study physicians.

Introduction

Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor in the development of CKD and associated cardiovascular disease. As kidney function declines, systolic BP progressively increases. The Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study suggests that adults with stage G3–5 CKD are up to three times more likely to suffer from hypertension compared with the general population. Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidance focuses on the treatment of systolic BP to manage cardiovascular risk in CKD and recommends systolic BP treatment targets of < 120 mm Hg for nondiabetic individuals with high BP and CKD. Clinical strategies to achieve these BP targets include dietary sodium chloride (salt) restriction.

Metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate level < 22 mmol/L) is associated with poorer health outcomes. Metabolic acidosis results from an inability to maintain acid-base balance by excreting organic acids and hydrogen ions while conserving bicarbonate ions. This increases dependency on generating bicarbonate ions by ammoniagenesis, an inflammatory process that has been linked with deterioration of kidney function. The prevalence of metabolic acidosis varies from 7% in CKD stage G2 to 37% in CKD stage G4. For acidotic individuals with CKD, KDIGO guidancerecommends supplementation with sodium bicarbonate, unless there is a clinical concern that the associated sodium load will exacerbate hypertension and/or fluid overload. A large body of evidence supports a direct relationship between sodium consumption and hypertension, which is exacerbated in individuals with CKD. This relationship has raised clinical concerns regarding the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy in CKD. However, research suggests that sodium salts have varying effects on BP depending on their anion base. Indeed, some studies suggest that sodium chloride has a detrimental effect on BP, whereas sodium bicarbonate may improve BP. Large trials supporting these findings are lacking, and recent meta-analyses did not analyze changes in antihypertensive medication or diuretics, which may mask BP changes. – In this study, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of sodium bicarbonate therapy (or its precursor sodium citrate) on systolic BP in CKD stage G1–5 non–dialysis-dependent population and analyze antihypertensive and diuretic medication changes.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Duplicated records were removed, and two reviewers (T.-Y. Yang and J.-Y. Chen) independently examined titles and abstracts, followed by full-text screening to determine study eligibility. In instances of multiple publications from the same trial, we selected the publication with the most complete or the latest updated data set. In studies with more than two intervention groups, – we only included the patients with oral sodium bicarbonate to compare with the control group, and those not relevant to the comparison group were omitted (e.g. fruit, vegetable, N -acetyl-cysteine). To ensure the integrity of our analysis on the outcome of eGFR, we deleted studies with short follow-up periods, such as Aigner et al.as short-term trials might not provide an accurate reflection of CKD progression.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was change in eGFR following sodium bicarbonate. Secondary outcomes included changes in baseline SBP, treatment-associated adverse events (e.g. all-cause mortality, hospitalization rates, CV events), changes in body weight, 24-hour urine sodium excretion, serum bicarbonate, albumin, potassium, calcium, phosphate, iPTH level, and MAMC.

Risk of Bias and Certainty of Evidence Assessment

Methodological quality of the selected studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (ROB 2.0). Each domain was judged as either low, high, or some concerns. Two reviewers (T.-Y. Yang and H.-M. Lin) carried out the assessment independently. Any discrepancies were addressed by discussion.

The Certainty of Evidence for outcome was determined by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology.

Data Synthesis and Statistical Analysis

Given the potential heterogeneity in population demographics and sodium bicarbonate dosage, we adopted the random-effects model for outcome analysis. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, version 3 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ) was used for all statistical analyses. A P value < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. For continuous outcomes, the results were expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Dichotomous outcomes were presented as odds ratios (ORs) with their associated 95% CIs. Leave-one-out sensitivity analyses were performed on SBP and hospitalization rates.

Introduction

Advanced CKD impairs the ability to excrete acid loads, leading to acid retention and metabolic acidosis (MA).MA is linked with several complications, including CKD progression, cardiovascular (CV) disease, and an increased risk of mortality.

Sodium bicarbonate has emerged as a therapeutic option for MA in CKD populations, with several studies suggesting its clinical benefits in preventing kidney function deterioration. – However, some studies have not identified the benefits of sodium bicarbonate in slowing eGFR decline. Previous research indicated improved eGFR with sodium bicarbonate in patients with CKD with low to normal bicarbonate levels, but its effects in patients with MA have not been specifically studied, leaving its role in CKD with concurrent MA controversial. In addition, there is currently no clear evidence regarding the effects of sodium bicarbonate on serum albumin, muscle mass, calcium and phosphate, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) in CKD populations with MA.

To address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis to provide definitive evidence concerning the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate on prognostic markers and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD and MA.

INCREASING SERUM BICARBONATE SLOWS PROGRESSION OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

Five studies have examined the impact of metabolic acidosis treatment with oral alkali or base-producing dietary interventions on the progression of kidney disease in CKD stage 3–5 patients with reduced serum HCO 3 (< 22 mEq/l) (Table 1). The study by de Brito-Ashurst et al. represented an important first step in linking correction of low serum HCO 3 and improved outcomes in patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis. In this single-center, open-label, prospective, parallel-group study, 134 CKD stage 4–5 patients with metabolic acidosis (serum HCO 3 > 16 and < 20 mEq/l) were randomized 1:1 to intervention with oral sodium bicarbonate, administered as 600 mg tablets three times per day and increased as necessary to achieve and maintain serum HCO 3 at least 23 mEq/l, or standard of care for 2 years. The objectives of the study were to assess the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy on progression of CKD and on nutritional status in these predialysis patients. The study population had an average baseline creatinine clearance of ∼20 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and an average baseline serum HCO 3 level of ∼20 mEq/l. Study criteria excluded patients with poorly controlled blood pressure (BP; > 150/90 mmHg, despite use of four agents), overt congestive heart failure, morbid obesity, and chronic sepsis, all conditions with potential fluid balance complications that could be worsened with ingestion of ∼500 mg of sodium that accompanied the average oral sodium bicarbonate daily dose administered in this study (1.82 ± 0.80 g/day). At the end of the 2-year study, serum HCO 3 increased in the treated patients by approximately 4 mEq/l compared with the control group (Fig. 1 a); these results were clinically meaningful and statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Compared with the control group, decline in creatinine clearance was slower with sodium bicarbonate supplementation (−1.88 versus −5.93 ml/min/1.73 m 2; P < 0.0001), a difference of approximately 4 ml/min/1.73 m 2 over the 2-year treatment period (Fig. 1 b). Patients who received treatment for their metabolic acidosis were also significantly less likely than controls to experience rapid progression of kidney failure (9 versus 45%; P < 0.0001) or to develop ESKD (6.5 versus 33%; P < 0.001) over the 2-year treatment period (Fig. 2). Thus, this landmark study demonstrated the beneficial effects of increasing serum HCO 3 on slowing the progression of kidney disease to an extent that was both statistically significant and clinically meaningful.

Hospitalization

Sodium bicarbonate users exhibited a significantly lower risk of hospitalization compared with the control group (7.94% versus 18.58%; OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.55; P < 0.001, I 2 < 0.001) based on data from three studies (Figure 2 B).

Impact on SBP

Analysis of 11 RCTs on the outcome of SBP demonstrated a higher SBP at the end of study in patients with sodium bicarbonate compared with those without (SMD, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.20; P = 0.03, I 2 < 0.001) (Figure 2 C). The funnel plot indicated a low risk of publication bias.

All-Cause mortality

The pooled OR of all-cause mortality from six studies showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.31; P = 0.29, I² = 12.16%) (Figure 2 D).

CV Event Rates

Most studies did not report any de novo CV events associated with the use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with CKD and MA. Both De Brito et al. and Kittiskulnam et al. did not observe de novo cases of decompensated heart failure during their study period. Conversely, Witham et al. reported a higher incidence of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome in the bicarbonate group (6.6%) compared with the control group (1.4%).

### Relationship between mortality and use of sodium bicarbonate at the time of dialysis initiation: a prospective observational study [^117CXFGa]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 8–16% of the population worldwide and is often under-recognised by both patients and clinicians. CKD is the 16th leading cause of years of life lost worldwide. In patients with CKD, the risk of death increases as kidney function worsens and such deaths are largely attributable to cardiovascular disease, although cancer incidence and mortality are also increased in these patients. Moreover, patients with CKD often experience metabolic acidosis resulting from a fundamental disturbance of acid-base balance. As serum bicarbonate (HCO 3 −) is below the normal range in patients with CKD, generally considered as 22–29 mEq/L, the risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or death is higher compared to those with CKD but without metabolic acidosis. The treatment for metabolic acidosis in CKD is oral alkali supplementation, which has been shown to slow CKD progression. When the bicarbonate level is below 22 mmol/L, prescription of sodium bicarbonate is recommended. However, the available evidence only provides general guidance for clinicians and has substantial variability in clinical practice.

Oral sodium bicarbonate has been used for decades to counteract metabolic acidosis. Oral sodium bicarbonate may have a residual renal function-preserving effect in peritoneal dialysis patients. Moreover, bicarbonate supplementation modestly improved renal function and serum bicarbonate levels compared to placebo or conventional CKD management in non-haemodialysis dependent CKD patients. In contrast, there are concerns that the sodium content might increase blood pressure or circulatory overload, leading to the deterioration of heart failure. Nonetheless, it is unknown how oral bicarbonate supplementation can affect patients who start dialysis therapy both positively and negatively.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy on mortality in patients with ESKD who were initiated on dialysis therapy. Our study is novel and significant because we focused on the efficacy of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy in patients before dialysis therapy initiation.

### Advances in management of chronic metabolic acidosis in chronic kidney disease [^112Q1bih]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with adverse consequences, such as CKD progression and muscle wasting. We review the findings from recent clinical trials that have examined the effects of sodium bicarbonate therapy and veverimer in patients with CKD and chronic metabolic acidosis.

Recent Findings

There are four recent clinical trials on chronic metabolic acidosis of CKD. In a pilot, cross-over study, 6 weeks of sodium bicarbonate therapy improved vascular endothelial function, measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation. In a single-center, randomized, open-label study, 6 months of sodium bicarbonate therapy increased muscle mass and lean body mass, and preserved kidney function. The other two clinical trials (phase 1/2 and phase 3 studies) examined the effects of veverimer, which is a hydrochloric acid binder. The phase 3 study showed that 12-weeks of veverimer increased serum bicarbonate levels and might improve physical function. The effects of veverimer on CKD progression, physical function and cardiovascular endpoints as well as its long-term safety are yet to be determined.

Summary

Recent studies suggest that sodium bicarbonate therapy may improve vascular endothelial function and muscle mass, and preserve renal function. Veverimer increases serum bicarbonate level and could be a potential new therapeutic option for treating chronic metabolic acidosis.

### Clinical and cost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy for older patients with chronic kidney disease and low-grade acidosis (BiCARB): a pragmatic randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116dPuqK]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Although no studies have studied the association between serum bicarbonate levels and our primary outcome of the Short Physical Performance Battery, observational data suggest a 7–8% increase in incident functional limitation for each 1 mmol/L lower bicarbonate level in a cohort of older people, although few of this cohort had CKD. Similarly, participants in NHANES with a serum bicarbonate concentration < 23 mmol/L had a 14% higher risk of low gait speed for every 1 mmol/L lower bicarbonate concentration. These results are not incompatible with our trial results; larger increases in serum bicarbonate concentration may be required to produce clinically meaningful changes in physical performance measures or biochemical parameters such as bone metabolism markers.

Most trials in the systematic review did not use placebo. The unmasked nature of these trials is likely to have contributed to the larger treatment effects observed and may also have influenced decision-making about the commencement of renal replacement therapy in some trials. Differential dropout is unlikely to explain the small difference we observed in the current trial as dropout numbers at each timepoint were similar in each arm. Although adherence was not optimal in the current trial, the dose of bicarbonate prescribed was similar to that used in a previous trial that observed greater increases in serum bicarbonate, and both the dose used and the adherence levels observed in our trial are likely to reflect those seen in clinical practice, especially amongst older people taking a large number of medications. A modest difference in eGFR at both 1 year and at the end of follow-up was seen in the recent systematic review, although too few data were available to calculate the mean rate of decline in eGFR. No significant treatment effect on blood pressure or body weight was seen in the systematic review, and our findings are consistent with these observations.

Methods

Study design

We conducted a parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial. The trial was designed in response to a commissioning brief issued by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment board. We recruited participants from nephrology and geriatric medicine outpatients at 27 UK hospitals. Ethical approval was granted by the East of Scotland NHS Research Ethics Committee (approval 12/ES/0023); the trial was also approved by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority (EudraCT number 2011–005271–16; Clinical Trial Authorisation number 41692/0001/001–0001). The trial was co-sponsored by the University of Dundee and NHS Tayside (Tayside Academic Health Sciences Collaboration). The trial was registered at(ISRCTN09486651). The protocol has been published.

Participants

Participants were eligible for inclusion if they were ≥ 60 years with advanced CKD (estimated GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study four variable (MDRD4) equation), not receiving dialysis, with serum bicarbonate concentrations < 22 mmol/L. No lower limit on bicarbonate concentration was stipulated. The MDRD4 equation was used as this was the equation in common use in the UK at the time that the trial was designed. We excluded participants if they were currently taking bicarbonate (such participants could however enter a 3-month washout period, after which they became eligible), had a diagnosis of renal tubular acidosis, were taking a bisphosphonate, were terminally ill, could not give written informed consent, had uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure > 150/90 despite four or more antihypertensive agents) or decompensated chronic heart failure, were participating in another clinical trial, or were allergic to sodium bicarbonate tablets or lactose (excipient in the tablets). All participants gave written informed consent.

We relaxed the exclusion criteria for the trial part-way through recruitment, both to improve slow recruitment rates, in part influenced by the lack of equipoise amongst clinicians and to better reflect current UK clinical practice. We reduced the lower age limit from 65 to 60; we included patients taking calcium acetate or sevelamer; we included patients with blood pressure controlled on home readings even if office blood pressure was high, and we allowed those currently taking bicarbonate to undergo a 3-month washout period with assessment of eligibility at the end of the washout period.

### Bicarbonate therapy in end-stage renal disease: current practice trends and implications [^116WdCAt]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

Management of metabolic acidosis covers the entire spectrum from oral bicarbonate therapy and dietary modifications in chronic kidney disease to delivery of high doses of bicarbonate-based dialysate during maintenance haemodialysis (MHD). Due to the gradual depletion of the body's buffers and rapid repletion during MHD, many potential problems arise as a result of our current treatment paradigms. Several studies have given rise to conflicting data about the adverse effects of our current practice patterns in MHD. In this review, we will describe the pathophysiology and consequences of metabolic acidosis and its therapy in CKD and ESRD, and discuss current evidence supporting a more individualized approach for bicarbonate therapy in MHD.

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^1164oP2q]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

In a study comparing high consumption of fruits and vegetables against sodium bicarbonate and control conditions, fruit and vegetable consumption was as effective as sodium bicarbonate in reducing acidosis and slowing the decline in eGFR without increasing serum potassium. In addition, high fruit and vegetable consumption was superior to sodium bicarbonate in lowering body weight, systolic blood pressure, and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. It is important to note that dietary modifications are now recommended only to treat hyperkalemia and not as a preventative measure. When possible, individuals with CKD should be encouraged to eat a variety of plant foods for dietary fibre, cardio‐protection, and the beneficial effect on gut microbiome. In the past decade, there has been a paradigm shift in the nutritional management of CKD. The focus has moved away from management of specific nutrients and towards the broader perspective of whole diets and dietary patterns.

Table 5 shows the current recommendations from the 2020 KDIGO Guidelines for Diabetes in CKDand 2020 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Guidelines for nutrient requirements in adult patients with CKD. A caloric intake of 25–35 kcal/kg/day is recommended to compensate for excessive resting energy expenditure due to inflammation and comorbidities and to maintain a neutral or positive nitrogen balance. However, this recommendation should be individualized to the patient's profile, including age, lean body mass, physical activity, and underlying aetiology of kidney disease.

TABLE 5
Nutritional requirements for patients with CKD according to 2020 KDIGO and KDOQI Guidelines,

The recommended protein intake for stable patients with CKD is 0.55–0.60 g/kg/day, which can be reduced to 0.28–0.43 g/kg/day if it is supplemented with 7–15 g/day of KAs and essential AAs. For patients with diabetes, the 2020 KDIGO guidelines suggest maintaining a higher protein intake up to 0.8 g/kg/day to glycemic control. Substantial sodium restriction (< 2 g/day) is recommended to achieve better volume control, lower blood pressure, and treat proteinuria synergistically with available pharmacologic interventions. However, a daily fibre intake of 25–30 g/day or more may also be recommended for patients with CKD, which is the recommended amount for the general population. In general, patients with CKD do not require aggressive dietary potassium restriction until advanced stages or when the risk of hyperkalemia is considered high.

### Treatment of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD [^117WeUbk]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease and is believed to contribute to a number of sequelae, including bone disease, altered protein metabolism, skeletal muscle wasting, and progressive glomerular filtration rate loss. Small trials in animal models and humans suggest a role for alkali therapy to lessen these complications. Recent studies support this notion, although more definitive evidence is needed on the long-term benefits of alkali therapy and the optimal serum bicarbonate level. The role of dietary modification also should be given greater consideration. In addition, potential adverse effects of alkali treatment must be taken into consideration, including sodium retention and the theoretical concern of promoting vascular calcification. This teaching case summarizes the rationale for and benefits and complications of base therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease.

### Effects of veverimer on serum bicarbonate and physical function in women with chronic kidney disease and metabolic acidosis: a subgroup analysis from a randomised, controlled trial [^115rRQLD]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis in patient with CKD is currently managed on the principles of decreasing metabolic acid production by increasing dietary base-producing (e.g. vegetables and fruits) and/or by neutralizing acid with supplemental alkali salts such as sodium bicarbonate. Based on evidence that chronic metabolic acidosis is harmful to multiple organs and systems including muscle, bone, kidneys, and heart, the international practice guidelines for nephrology (KDIGO) recommends treating patients with CKD when the serum bicarbonate is < 22 mmol/L. The National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) also states that a reasonable target for serum bicarbonate is between 24 and 26 mmol/L. Even with these guideline suggestions, the percentage of patients currently treated with alkali salts is low. As an example, in the well-described cohort from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study, only 2.7% of patients were treated with alkali despite a serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L. Sodium bicarbonate treats metabolic acidosis by entering the systemic circulation to supply bicarbonate that neutralizes retained acid. This causes a systemic sodium load that may be contraindicated in patients with CKD as these patients often have inadequate blood pressure control, edema, or heart failure. It is important to note that women comprise the majority of patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure.

A limitation of this study is that it involved a subgroup analysis that, although pre-specified, should still be considered as hypothesis generating. Further, the study population lacked significant racial heterogeneity and sex was classified by self-report. Strengths of this study include its randomized multicenter design and pre-specification of the subgroup. Previous placebo-controlled trials examining the effect of metabolic acidosis on muscle function all used sodium bicarbonate as the intervention and did not find any differences in the overall population or by sex. This study, using a novel method to remove acid, is therefore the first to find a positive effect on measured physical function and physical function related quality of life.

### What should define optimal correction of metabolic acidosis in chronic kidney disease? [^113Byfax]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Correction of metabolic acidosis is an important goal in the management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there is no consensus as to what constitutes an optimal correction of metabolic acidosis in this setting - various expert groups from around the world have set different goals for serum bicarbonate levels for patients with CKD. Accumulating evidence seems to indicate that achieving an arterial pH closer to the upper limit of the reference range may have even greater benefits than maintaining the arterial pH closer to the lower limit of the reference range. This benefit seems to be particularly relevant for patients with protein-energy wasting and we present a review of the evidence that supports this argument. Routine measurement of arterial pH, however, is not feasible in clinical practice; using the Henderson equation, a high-normal arterial pH is generally expected to be associated with a serum bicarbonate level of 24–30 mEq/l and should be the therapeutic goal for chronic kidney disease patients with protein-energy wasting.

### Metabolic acidosis of CKD: an update [^114bjr5z]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The kidney has the principal role in the maintenance of acid-base balance. Therefore, a decrease in renal ammonium excretion and a positive acid balance often leading to a reduction in serum bicarbonate concentration are observed in the course of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The decrease in serum bicarbonate concentration is usually absent until glomerular filtration rate decreases to < 20 to 25mL/min/1.73 m(2), although it can develop with lesser degrees of decreased kidney function. Non-anion gap acidosis, high-anion gap acidosis, or both can be found at all stages of CKD. The acidosis can be associated with muscle wasting, bone disease, hypoalbuminemia, inflammation, progression of CKD, and increased mortality. Administration of base may decrease muscle wasting, improve bone disease, and slow the progression of CKD. Base is suggested when serum bicarbonate concentration is < 22 mEq/L, but the target serum bicarbonate concentration is unclear. Evidence that increments in serum bicarbonate concentration > 24 mEq/L might be associated with worsening of cardiovascular disease adds complexity to treatment decisions. Further study of the mechanisms through which metabolic acidosis contributes to the progression of CKD, as well as the pathways involved in mediating the benefits and complications of base therapy, is warranted.

### Effect of sodium bicarbonate on systolic blood pressure in CKD: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ncVZM]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Individuals with CKD are at a higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Acidosis is positively correlated with CKD progression and elevated systolic BP. Sodium bicarbonate is an efficacious treatment of acidosis, although this may also increase systolic BP. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we summarize the evidence evaluating systolic BP and antihypertensive medication change (which may indicate systolic BP change) in response to sodium bicarbonate therapy in individuals with CKD.

Methods

Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and World Health Organization (WHO) trials registry databases were searched for randomized control trials where sodium bicarbonate was compared with placebo/usual care in CKD stage G1–5 non-dialysis-dependent populations. Random effects meta-analyses were used to evaluate changes in systolic BP and BP-modifying drugs after sodium bicarbonate intervention.

Results

Fourteen randomized control trials (2110 individuals, median follow-up 27 [interquartile range 97] weeks, mean age 60 [SD 10] years, mean systolic BP 136 [SD 17] mm Hg, mean eGFR 38 [SD 10] ml/min, mean serum bicarbonate 22 [SD 4] mmol/L) were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analysis suggested that sodium bicarbonate did not influence systolic BP in individuals with CKD stage G1–5. Results were consistent when stratifying by dose of sodium bicarbonate or duration of intervention. Similarly, there was no significant increase in the use of antihypertensive medication or diuretics in individuals taking sodium bicarbonate, whereas there was a greater decrease in antihypertensive medication use in individuals taking sodium bicarbonate compared with controls.

Conclusions

Our results suggest, with moderate certainty, that sodium bicarbonate supplementation does not adversely affect systolic BP in CKD or negatively influence antihypertensive medication requirements.

Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies

Given the association between metabolic acidosis and a range of adverse outcomes seen in CKD, it would be expected that amelioration of acidosis (i.e. increasing serum bicarbonate) could improve physical function, lessen deterioration in renal function and improve measures of cardiovascular health and bone and mineral metabolism in patients with CKD. A recent systematic review found no randomised controlled trial evidence around the effect of bicarbonate on physical function or quality of life; the current trial therefore provides an important test of the effect of bicarbonate on these important patient-centred outcomes. A previous single-centre trial of bicarbonate versus usual care found progressive increases in serum bicarbonate over a 2-year period in the bicarbonate group; measures of anthropometry were better in the bicarbonate group, and fewer participants progressed to end-stage renal disease in the bicarbonate group (4/67 vs 22/67). However, this trial did not use placebo, and thus, healthcare providers and participants were aware of group allocation. It is possible that the lack of masking could inflate the effect size seen in this trial, perhaps by an impact on decision-making around renal replacement and on other treatment decisions driven by knowledge of whether a participant was receiving bicarbonate. Participants in this previous trial were recruited from a single centre and were much younger (mean age 55 years), and a high percentage were of south Asian or black origin.

### Effects of sodium bicarbonate in CKD stages 3 and 4: a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial [^1147TM68]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Metabolic acidosis associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may contribute to muscle dysfunction and bone disease. We aimed to test whether treatment with sodium bicarbonate improves muscle and bone outcomes.

Study Design

Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial.

Setting & Participants

149 patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 between July 2011 and April 2016 at 3 centers in Cleveland, OH, and the Bronx, NY.

Intervention

Sodium bicarbonate (0.4 mEq per kg of ideal body weight per day) (n = 74) or identical-appearing placebo (n = 75).

Outcomes

Dual primary outcomes were muscle function assessed using sit-to-stand test and bone mineral density. Muscle biopsies were performed at baseline and 2 months. Participants were seen at baseline and 2, 6, 12, and 24 months.

Results

Mean baseline serum bicarbonate level was 24.0 ± 2.2 (SD) mEq/L and mean baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate was 36.3 ± 11.2mL/min/1.73m 2. Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. Mean serum bicarbonate levels in the intervention arm during follow-up were 26.4 ± 2.2, 25.5 ± 2.3, 25.6 ± 2.6, and 24.4 ± 2.8 mEq/L (at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months). These were significantly higher than in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Compared to the placebo group, participants randomly assigned to sodium bicarbonate treatment had no significant differences in sit-to-stand time (5 repetitions: P = 0.1; and 10 repetitions P = 0.07) or bone mineral density (P = 0.3). Sodium bicarbonate treatment caused a decrease in serum potassium levels that was of borderline statistical significance (P = 0.05). There were no significant differences in estimated glomerular filtration rates, blood pressure, weight, serious adverse events, or levels of muscle gene expression between the randomly assigned groups.

Limitations

Initial mean serum bicarbonate level was in the normal range.

Conclusions

Sodium bicarbonate therapy in patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 significantly increases serum bicarbonate and decreases potassium levels. No differences were found in muscle function or bone mineral density between the randomly assigned groups. Larger trials are required to evaluate effects on kidney function.

### A randomized trial comparing the safety, adherence, and pharmacodynamics profiles of two doses of sodium bicarbonate in CKD: the BASE pilot trial [^115f9XFL]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) may preserve kidney function in CKD, even if initiated when serum bicarbonate concentration is normal. Adequately powered trials testing this hypothesis have not been conducted, partly because the best dose for testing is unknown.

Methods

This multicenter pilot trial assessed the safety, tolerability, adherence, and pharmacodynamics of two doses of NaHCO 3 over 28 weeks in adults with eGFR 20–44 or 45–59 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 with urinary albumin/creatinine (ACR) ≥ 50 mg/g and serum bicarbonate 20–28 meq/L. We randomly assigned 194 participants from ten clinical sites to receive higher-dose (HD-NaHCO 3; 0.8 meq/kg of lean body wt per day; n = 90) or lower-dose (LD-NaHCO 3; 0.5 meq/kg of lean body wt per day; n = 52) NaHCO 3 or matching placebo (n = 52). The dose was adjusted depending on side effects. The prescribed dose at week 28 was the primary outcome; a dose was considered acceptable for a full-scale trial if ≥ 67% of participants were on full-dose and ≥ 80% were on ≥ 25% of the per-protocol dose.

Results

Mean ± SD baseline eGFR was 36 ± 9 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, serum bicarbonate was 24 ± 2 meq/L, and median (IQR) ACR was 181 (25–745) mg/g. Both doses were well tolerated without significant changes in BP, weight, or serum potassium. The proportions of adverse events and hospitalizations were similar across the groups. Consequently, 87% in HD-NaHCO 3, 96% in LD-NaHCO 3, and 87% in placebo were on full dose at week 28; and 91% in HD-NaHCO 3, 98% in LD-NaHCO 3, and 92% in placebo were on ≥ 25% of the per-protocol dose. Mean urinary ammonium excretion was 25% lower and serum bicarbonate concentration was 1.3 meq/L higher in HD-NaHCO 3 compared with LD-NaHCO 3 at week 28. However, mean ACR increased by 12% in the lower-dose group and 30% in the higher-dose group.

Conclusions

Both NaHCO 3 doses were well tolerated over 28 weeks with no significant difference in adverse events or hospitalization compared with placebo. The higher dose lowered urinary ammonium excretion and increased serum bicarbonate more than the lower dose but was associated with a greater increase in ACR. The higher 0.8 meq/kg of lean body wt per day dose of NaHCO 3 may be a reasonable choice for future trials.

### Chronic kidney disease CKD: guideline recommendations and supporting information (2020) [^116LPZ8G]. AND (2020). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) metabolic acidosis — In dialysis, the oral bicarbonate group had higher overall SGA scores starting at 24 weeks (p-value < 0.0003). In CKD 4–5 pre-dialysis, the oral sodium bicarbonate group had significant lower nPNA (nPCR) at 12 and 24 months (p < 0.05) and significant higher serum albumin at 12 and 24 months (p < 0.05). In a group of CKD 5 hemodialysis patients, there was no significant difference in serum albumin among time points (p > 0.05), whereas in CKD 5 hemodialysis, oral sodium bicarbonate increased serum albumin level (p = 0.01). It should also be noted that high dialysate bicarbonate concentrations are associated with increased mortality in observational studies. Among CKD 4–5 pre-dialysis, oral sodium bicarbonate increased both serum albumin and prealbumin levels between before and after intervention (p < 0.05). Among CKD 1–2 compared to control and HCO3, the fruit and vegetable group had significantly greater decrease in body weight at the end of the intervention for both individuals with CKD 1–2 (p < 0.05 for both), with no difference between HCO3 and control. Thus there does not appear to be a significant effect of reduction in NEAP on nutritional status in patients with CKD 1–2. In CKD 4 compared to CKD 3, the FV group had lower weight at 1-year follow up (p < 0.01), and baseline weight did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.24). In CKD 3, fruits and vegetables had greater net body weight loss than both HCO3 and control (p < 0.05), and the control group had greater net body weight loss than the HCO3 group (p < 0.05). The evidence supporting the recommendations on dietary management of NEAP with fruits and vegetables and bicarbonate supplementation is based on Grade III /Grade C evidence, and the recommendation regarding bicarbonate maintenance based on Consensus/expert opinion.

Metabolic acidosis in CKD — practice points, treatment thresholds, and dietary guidance are as follows: Practice Point 3.10.1 states to consider use of pharmacological treatment with or without dietary intervention to prevent development of acidosis with potential clinical implications (e.g., bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l in adults). Practice Point 3.10.2 advises monitoring to ensure therapy does not result in serum bicarbonate concentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal and does not adversely affect BP control, serum potassium, or fluid status. The KDOQI Work Group agrees that acidosis in adults should only be treated with pharmacologic agents when bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l or if there is a clear indication to do so, and notes a large clinical trial of veverimer did not demonstrate a decline in a composite CKD progression outcome. Pediatric clinicians may choose to treat milder acidosis more aggressively to help optimize growth and bone health. Nutrition guidance supports prevention and treatment via increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables, including the statement: In adults with CKD 1–4, we suggest reducing net endogenous acid production through increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables (2C) to reduce the rate of decline of residual kidney function.

### Metabolic acidosis and the progression of chronic kidney disease [^116WYD4r]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

More recently, dietary modification has been examined by Goraya and colleagues. In patients with CKD stage 2 due to hypertensive nephropathy, 30 days of increased fruit and vegetable consumption produced similar reductions in urinary NAG and albuminuria as did oral sodium bicarbonate. Similar results were found in 71 patients with stage 4 CKD and serum bicarbonate < 22 mEq/L who were randomized to 1 year of sodium bicarbonate at 1.0 mEq/kg per day or increased fruits and vegetables to reduce dietary acid by half. The serum bicarbonate increased with the dietary intervention, although less than in the bicarbonate group, whose alkali dose would be expected to nearly completely neutralize the dietary acid load. The aforementioned markers of kidney injury declined similarly in the 2 groups. It is encouraging that there were no complications from hyperkalemia, but it should be noted that only patients with plasma K + ≤ 4.6 mEq/L were enrolled in the study.

Thus, accumulating evidence suggests that treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis could slow the progression of CKD. However, the evidence base is not yet definitive. A systemic review was performed examining the published literature regarding alkali therapy through July 2011. The authors concluded that although oral alkali might afford a long-term benefit in slowing the progression of CKD, differences in study protocols and small sample sizes precluded definitive conclusions. Additional, more nuanced questions also remain unanswered. If alkali therapy does retard progression, what serum bicarbonate level should be targeted? Is there a risk to overcorrection of acidosis? Higher serum bicarbonate was associated with increased risk of congestive heart failure in the CRIC study, but to date interventional studies have not demonstrated significant metabolic alkalosis or fluid overload with even high-dose alkali. Is serum bicarbonate even the right target, given evidence of acid retention and deleterious effects within the normal range of serum bicarbonate? To what extent should dietary interventions to reduce the dietary acid load be employed in lieu of, or in addition to, oral alkali? There are 3 ongoing randomized controlled trials of alkali therapy in patients with CKD that have the potential to answer some of these questions and to impact clinical practice (NCT01640119; NCT01452412; EUDRACT Number 2012–001824–36). A summary of these trials is provided in Table 2. Several smaller studies are examining other effects of base, including changes in urinary TGF-β1 (NCT01574157), vascular endothelial function (NCT02031770), and its role in sickle cell disease (NCT01894594).

### Sodium bicarbonate treatment and clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease with metabolic acidosis: a meta-analysis [^112MHGsu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Further subgroup analyses consistently revealed an increase of SBP in the bicarbonate group compared with the control group, especially within patients enrolled in the single-center study designs (SMD, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.40), those age < 65 years (SMD, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.38), those with bicarbonate level ≤ 24 mEq/L after treatment (SMD, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.35), and those using maintenance doses (SMD, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.89). No significant interactions were found on the effect of sodium bicarbonate on SBP (P > 0.05) (Figure 3 B).

### Metabolic acidosis and kidney disease: does bicarbonate therapy slow the progression of CKD? [^115yMkMG]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication associated with progressive loss of kidney function. The diminishing ability of the kidneys to maintain acid-base homeostasis results in acid accumulation, leading to various complications such as impairment in nutritional status, worsened uremic bone disease and an association with increased mortality. In addition to these adverse effects which are related to acid retention, metabolic acidosis may also cause kidney damage, possibly through the stimulation of adaptive mechanisms aimed at maintaining acid-base homeostasis in the face of decreasing kidney function. Recent clinical trials have suggested that correction or prevention of metabolic acidosis by alkali administration is able to attenuate kidney damage and to slow progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and may hence offer an effective, safe and affordable renoprotective strategy. We review the physiology and pathophysiology of acid-base homeostasis in CKD, the mechanisms whereby metabolic acidosis may be deleterious to kidney function, and the results of clinical trials suggesting a benefit of alkali therapy, with special attention to details related to the practical implementation of the results of these trials.

Moreover, sodium bicarbonate supplementation significantly increased serum albumin and MAMC. MA accelerates protein catabolism and decreases muscle mass. Correction of MA would attenuate protein degradation, thereby facilitating an increase in serum albumin level and MAMC, an index of muscle mass.

Furthermore, treating with sodium bicarbonate notably raised serum calcium and phosphate, with a concurrent elevated trend in iPTH level. MA detrimentally affects calcium–phosphate metabolism in patients with CKD, leading to a 50%–74% incidence of hyperphosphatemia. Progression of CKD also elevates fibroblast growth factor-23 and reduced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels, stimulating iPTH secretion, triggering bone calcium release, and leading to hypercalcemia. These findings indicate that alkali therapy may not reverse this condition.

The current meta-analysis has some strengths. First, we specifically targeted CKD concurrent with MA, which is different from the previous meta-analyses. Second, our study conducted subgroup analyses and interaction tests to assess treatment effect variables based on participants' baseline characteristics, offering comprehensive insights for treatment approach and enhancing result reliability. Nevertheless, our study has several limitations. First, some studies were associated with high heterogeneity, which may be attributable to the variation in therapeutic dosage, modality, treatment duration, and baseline kidney function. Despite conducting subgroup analyses to address confounding factors, observed associations may be subject to residual confounding. Second, the forest plot for CV event rates with sodium bicarbonate supplementation could not be performed as several of the included studies reported no incidence of CV events. Third, there is an absence of efficacy data for sodium bicarbonate therapy across different etiologies of CKD, detailed in. Fourth, concerns must be raised regarding bias from the lack of double-blind designs and inconsistent control groups definitions. Fifth, dietary adjustments stand as a valuable alternative or adjunctive alkali treatment for patients with CKD with MA. However, studies focusing on dietary interventions were excluded to maintain our study's homogeneity. Hence, the evidence-based findings presented herein should be interpreted cautiously.

In conclusion, oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation may improve kidney function and enhance nutritional status along with muscle mass on patients with CKD with MA. Notably, physicians should be aware that administering sodium bicarbonate could negatively impact SBP. Further large-scale RCTs and more rigorous studies are necessary to definitively determine the benefits and potential harms of bicarbonate therapy in patients with CKD with MA.

### Clinical and cost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy for older patients with chronic kidney disease and low-grade acidosis (BiCARB): a pragmatic randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112rYWDP]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) becomes increasingly common with older age, with approximately 2% of the population aged 70 years and over suffering from advanced (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2) chronic kidney disease. Impaired ability to excrete hydrogen ions means that advanced CKD is accompanied by metabolic acidosis in approximately 20% of cases, with rates higher at lower levels of renal function. Metabolic acidosis has been associated in observational studies with a range of adverse health outcomes in patients with CKD, including worse cardiovascular health, lower bone mineral density and increased fracture risk, impaired muscle function and more rapid progression of kidney disease. The extent to which acidosis causes these phenomena remains unclear.

Oral sodium bicarbonate has been used for decades to counteract metabolic acidosis. Few trials have tested whether sodium bicarbonate is effective at preventing adverse outcomes from advanced CKD, and is safe in the context of increased sodium load, as opposed to merely increasing the concentration of circulating bicarbonate. Two recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of small trials of moderate quality suggested a modest beneficial effect on estimated GFR and serum bicarbonate, an uncertain effect on progression to end-stage kidney disease and contrasting effects on blood pressure (no effect in one review, and a small increase in the risk of hypertension in the other), and found no data on the effect of bicarbonate on physical function or quality of life. The mean age of participants in included trials was young, ranging from 41 to 65 years. Sodium bicarbonate carries risks of gastrointestinal side effects, the large tablets and large number of tablets required are awkward for patients to take long term, and there are concerns that the sodium content might increase blood pressure or circulatory overload. These issues are of particular relevance for older people, who make up the majority of people in the UK with advanced kidney disease and are more likely to suffer side effects due to coexisting multimorbidity and polypharmacy. Current guidelines for the management of chronic kidney disease recommend using oral sodium bicarbonate to treat metabolic acidosis but acknowledge the dearth of evidence in this area.

Methods

For current analyses, we analyzed the first 145 subjects (83 men and 62 women) with Diabetes Mellitus type 2 not treated with insulin participating in the Use of Bicarbonate in Chronic Renal Insufficiency (UBI) study (NCT NCT01640119) with at least 1 year of follow-up. The UBI study protocol has been published previously. Briefly, the UBI study is an on-going multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled study designed to test the impact of metabolic acidosis correction on CKD progression to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). CKD-3b-4 patients of 18 to 80 year of age, able to provide written informed consent and serum bicarbonate levels below 24 mEql/l are randomized (allocation ratio 1:1) to either oral sodium bicarbonate (treatment group) or conventional therapy for CKD (control group). Study investigators are free to adjust medications to achieve the targets for glycated hemoglobin, bone mineral metabolism, blood pressure, anemia, iron status, dyslipidemia as suggested by guidelines on CKD patients' management available at the time of the study design. The randomization process is centralized to ensure allocation concealment. Patients with evidence of neoplastic diseases, autoimmune diseases, chronic heart failure NYHA class III-IV, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, severe peripheral arterial disease (defined as limb amputation), cerebrovascular disease, neobladder or ureterosigmoidostomy, severe metabolic acidosis (defined as serum bicarbonate < 18 mEq/l) or use of calcium carbonate in the 3-month prior to study inclusion are excluded from the trial. Oral sodium bicarbonate is administered at the dose of 0.5 mmol/kg of body weight (1 g of sodium bicarbonate contains 11.9 mmol – initial dose about 3–4 g) two times a day until the achievement of the desired serum bicarbonate target of 24–28 mmol/l. If a serum value of 28 mmol/l is exceeded, the administration of bicarbonate is tapered each 3 days until the desired serum target level is achieved.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression — net endogenous acid production (NEAP) reduction using sodium bicarbonate or fruits and vegetables is reported across randomized and observational studies. The evidence base included 4 RCTs, 1 NRCT, 3 noncontrolled studies, 2 prospective cohort studies, and 1 retrospective cohort study. In CKD stages 4–5, oral sodium bicarbonate produced significantly greater creatinine clearance after 18 and 24 months (P < 0.05) and reduced CKD progression defined as creatinine clearance loss > 3 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year (RR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.06–0.40) and development of ESRD (RR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04–0.49). Other studies found no significant difference in creatinine clearance (P > 0.05) or in eGFR after sodium bicarbonate 0.4 mEq/kg ideal body weight per day for 24 months versus placebo. In CKD stage 4 comparing fruits and vegetables with bicarbonate, serum creatinine and eGFR at baseline and 1 year were comparable (P = 0.99 and P = 0.49; P = 0.84 and P = 0.32, respectively). Albuminuria outcomes varied by stage: in stage 1 there was no difference among groups (P > 0.05), whereas in stage 2 fruits and vegetables decreased net urine albumin excretion more than bicarbonate and control (P < 0.05), and bicarbonate decreased it more than control (P < 0.05).

Discussion

Key findings

Our study is the first to examine the effect of oral bicarbonate therapy on physical function, health-related quality of life and healthcare costs in older people with advanced CKD. In this trial, administration of oral sodium bicarbonate using a dose regime similar to that currently used in UK practice did not improve physical function or quality of life, increased adverse events and had no impact on the rate of progression of CKD compared to placebo in older people with CKD category 4 or 5 and serum bicarbonate concentrations of < 22 mmol/L. Consistent with these findings, health economic analysis showed that bicarbonate was less cost-effective than placebo.

Strengths and weaknesses

Important strengths of this trial were its large size in comparison to previous trials in this area, the fact that it enrolled the age group most likely to suffer the consequences of CKD; clinically relevant follow-up time; participant, clinician and researcher masking; and broad inclusion criteria. In contrast to almost all previous trials, our use of a placebo control reduced the opportunities for bias. An additional strength was the broad range of outcome measures examined, with a particular focus on physical function and quality of life. These are the outcomes that older people report being most important to them, and this focus is of particular importance in this group of patients with extensive multimorbidity. A narrow focus on a single disease — even in patients with advanced CKD — may not be helpful for holistic decision-making; considering physical function and quality of life enables an assessment of the overall benefit of treatment to patients in a way that organ-specific measures do not.

Statistical Analyses

For continuous data outcomes (systolic BP and mean serum bicarbonate), the effect measure is expressed as a mean difference and calculated using a Der Simonian–Laird random-effects model. For these outcomes, the average systolic BP and serum bicarbonate at the end of the intervention period were extracted with SD, where available. Where SD values were not expressed, they were imputed from the data available as per Cochrane guidelines. The use of end-of-intervention data represented a deviation from the review protocol, which stated that mean difference values would be used. Unfortunately, mean difference values were not available for most of the studies. The imputation of mean difference values as per the Cochrane Handbook was not possible because a correlation coefficient could not be imputed and applied from other included studies because of the heterogeneity of those studies. For dichotomous outcomes relating to change in antihypertensive and diuretic medications, the effect measure is expressed as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated using a Mantel–Haenszel random-effects model.

Subgroup analyses were conducted for stage of CKD, dose of sodium bicarbonate, and duration of the study. One studyincluded a control and two intervention arms using different doses of sodium bicarbonate. To avoid double counting of the control data, two meta-analyses were conducted for each outcome, one including the high-dose and the other the low-dose sodium bicarbonate intervention group. We stratified the dose of sodium bicarbonate as follows: low dose < 2.5 mEqM/kg, medium dose 0.26–0.5 mEqm/kg, and high dose > 0.51 mEqM/kg. In a 70-kg individual, this would equate to sodium bicarbonate doses of < 1.2, 1.8–2.9, and > 3 g for low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively, which reflects local practice. For the duration of intervention, we classified the studies as follows: short term 4–12 weeks, medium term 24–28 weeks, and long term 104–520 weeks.

Heterogeneity across the studies was estimated using χ 2 (Cochrane Q) and I 2 statistics. A χ 2 < 0.05 suggests the presence of heterogeneity while I 2 values of 25%, 50%, and 75% are used to quantify heterogeneity as low, medium, and high, respectively.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common public health problem affecting nearly one in eight individuals worldwide. The kidney's capacity to excrete the daily acid load is impaired in people with CKD, which leads to metabolic acidosis, one of the first recognized complications of advanced disease. With a definition of plasma or venous bicarbonate concentration < 22 mmol/L, the prevalence of metabolic acidosis is 20% in people with CKD Stages G3–G5. If left untreated, metabolic acidosis can lead to CKD progression, muscle wasting, bone disease, stimulating inflammation and increased mortality.

Oral bicarbonate supplementation has been used to correct metabolic acidosis for decades, and has been hypothesized to delay the progression of kidney failure. A recent meta-analysis, including 3695 participants comparing oral alkali therapy with placebo or standard of care, showed beneficial effects of alkali therapy in delaying kidney failure and preserving function, with no effects on proteinuria, all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. Despite these favorable effects, clinical studies have reported a number of notable side effects in regard to alkali therapy, including gastric discomfort, belching and flatulence. The latest Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline (2024) for the evaluation and management of CKD adopts a more conservative approach regarding alkali therapy in metabolic acidosis. It recommends considering pharmacological treatment for adults with bicarbonate levels < 18 mmol/L, with or without dietary interventions, while closely monitoring to ensure that serum bicarbonate levels do not exceed the upper limit of normal and that the treatment does not negatively impact blood pressure control, serum potassium levels or fluid status.

CKD: Sodium restriction — rationale and evidence summary — In the general population, short‑term intervention studies show significant reductions in blood pressure, including 5.8 mmHg systolic BP with 100mmol reduction in sodium intake, while findings from a small number of long‑term studies (> 6 months) were underpowered to adequately examine these outcomes. Within CKD, five randomised controlled trials (1 parallel and 4 cross‑over) in CKD (Stage 2 to 5, non‑dialysis) examined reduced dietary sodium intake, but overall the evidence comes from randomised controlled trials of short duration and typically small sample size with limited evaluation of hard outcomes.

Subgroup Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis

Between-trial heterogeneity was determined by using I 2 statistic and I 2 > 50% indicated significant heterogeneity. To investigate the potential sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were undertaken based on the following criteria: geographic regions (Asian or non-Asian region), study setting (single or multiple centers), age (< 65 or ≧65 years), CKD stage (3a, 3b, 4, or 5), sodium bicarbonate dosage (low, medium, or high), follow-up duration which was categorized in two ways (duration 1 define as ≤ 12 or > 12 months or duration 2 defined as < 6, 6–12, or > 12 months), classification of control groups (placebo, standard care, or rescue therapy), post-treatment bicarbonate level (≤ 24 or > 24 mEq/L), administration modality (target or maintenance dose), and use of eGFR equations (CKD Epidemiology Collaboration or Modification of Diet in Renal Disease). We stratified the dose of sodium bicarbonate as follows: low dose: < 0.5 mEq/kg of lean body weight/day; medium dose: 0.5–0.79 mEq/kg of lean body weight/day; or high dose: ≧0.8 mEq/kg of lean body weight/day, which was based on a study assessing the efficacy and safety at higher (0.8 mEq/kg per day) or lower (0.5 mEq/kg per day) dosages of sodium bicarbonate. We delineated two distinct time end points for evaluating the temporal effects of sodium bicarbonate on changes of eGFR and SBP, with cut-points at 6 months and 1 year postinitiation of therapy. For administration modality, the target dose was defined by titrating sodium bicarbonate to achieve a desired serum bicarbonate concentration. Conversely, the maintenance dose implied a consistent dosage throughout the study. To examine whether the effect of sodium bicarbonate on clinical outcomes differed across predefined subgroups, we tested P for interaction for two outcomes: SBP and eGFR. A P value threshold of < 0.05 was established a priori to denote significant interaction effects. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the robustness of the effect size. In addition, meta-regression analyses were also conducted to evaluate the treatment effects of daily sodium bicarbonate doses. A funnel plot was used to identify potential publication biases. We used the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, version 3 (Biostat) for all statistical analyses.

### Clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows the progression of chronic kidney disease [^116NKtp6]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose of review

We review the growing clinical evidence that metabolic acidosis mediates chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and that treatment to increase the associated low serum bicarbonate (HCO 3) in CKD is disease-modifying.

Recent findings

Seven prospective studies of patients with wide ranges of estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) and serum HCO 3 examined the effect on CKD of increasing serum HCO 3 using dietary acid reduction with either oral alkali (sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate), a vegetarian diet very low in acid-producing protein (0.3 g/kg/day) supplemented with ketoanalogues or added base-producing fruits and vegetables. Clinical outcomes included slower kidney function decline (using eGFR measurements) and fewer patients progressing to end-stage kidney disease. Post hoc analyses demonstrated that: treatment of metabolic acidosis for 2 years decreased the number of patients with at least a 40% eGFR decline, a validated surrogate for progression to end-stage kidney disease and across four studies, treatment to increase serum HCO 3 by 4–6.8 mEq/l in acidotic patients with CKD was associated with a ∼4 ml/min/1.73 m 2 reduction in the rate of eGFR decline over 6–24 months compared with controls.

Summary

Metabolic acidosis appears to enhance CKD progression and its treatment should be studied further as a potential disease-modifying intervention.

### Update on the management of chronic kidney disease [^113iUbSr]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is common and associated with significant morbidity. Given the high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease, it is important to identify and treat related risk factors. However, there is growing uncertainty about the benefits of some recommended treatment targets. The National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines recommend an A1C level of less than 7 percent in patients with diabetes mellitus, although there is no evidence that treatment to this goal reduces cardiovascular events or progression to end-stage renal disease. Optimal blood pressure goals are controversial, and further study is needed to determine these goals in relation to amount of proteinuria. Concurrent use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers leads to worsening kidney function and is not recommended. Lipid-lowering therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, but not progression of chronic kidney disease. The treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease, particularly the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and optimal hemoglobin goals, is also controversial. Studies have shown increased morbidity and mortality with use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents aimed at normalizing hemoglobin levels. Patients with chronic kidney disease are at high risk of morbidity and mortality from the use of intravenous contrast agents. Isotonic intravenous hydration with sodium bicarbonate or saline has been shown to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy. Gadolinium-based contrast agents should be avoided if the glomerular filtration rate is less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m2 because of the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.

### Approach to the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis in CKD [^111dGcTu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic metabolic acidosis is not uncommon in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Clinical practice guidelines suggest that clinicians administer alkali to maintain serum bicarbonate level at a minimum of 22 mEq/L to prevent the effects of acidosis on bone demineralization and protein catabolism. Small interventional studies support the notion that correcting acidosis slows CKD progression as well. Furthermore, alkaline therapy in persons with CKD and normal bicarbonate levels may also preserve kidney function. Observational studies suggest that targeting a serum bicarbonate level near 28 mEq/L may improve clinical outcomes above and beyond targeting a value ≥ 22 mEq/L, yet values > 26 mEq/L have been reported to be associated with incident heart failure and mortality in the CRIC (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort) Study. Furthermore, correcting acidosis may provoke vascular calcification. This teaching case discusses several uncertainties regarding the management of acidosis in CKD, such as when to initiate alkali treatment, potential side effects of alkali, and the optimum serum bicarbonate level based on current evidence in CKD. Suggestions regarding the maximum sodium bicarbonate dose to administer to patients with CKD to achieve the target serum bicarbonate concentration are offered.

In PD, "the oral bicarbonate group had higher overall SGA scores starting at 24 weeks (P < 0.0003)". In CKD stages 4–5, one study found the oral sodium bicarbonate group had "significant lower nPNA (nPCR) at 12 and 24 months (P < 0.05)" and "significant higher serum albumin levels at 12 and 24 months (P < 0.05)". Among MHD cohorts, one study reported "no significant difference in serum albumin levels among time points (P > 0.05)", while another found "oral sodium bicarbonate increased serum albumin levels (P = 0.01)". Additional data show that in CKD stage 4, "the fruits and vegetables group had lower weight at the 1-year follow up (P < 0.01)… baseline weight did not differ… (P = 0.24)", and in CKD stage 3, fruits and vegetables led to "greater net body weight loss than both bicarbonate and control (P < 0.05)" with control also greater than bicarbonate (P < 0.05). The guideline notes, "There does not appear to be a significant effect of reduction in NEAP on nutritional status in patients with CKD 1–2".

Methods

This meta-analysis was undertaken following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelinesand registered in the prospective register of systematic reviews database (registration number ID: CRD42023443212).

Search Strategy

We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library from their inception up to November 11, 2023, without restrictions regarding language or geographic locations. Detailed information is shown in.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Alkali therapy for CKD-related MA is typically delayed until serum total carbon dioxide drops below 22 mEq/L, leading to only 15% of patients with CKD receiving it, potentially overlooking those with subclinical acidosis who may benefit. Previous studies, show that patients with CKD with total carbon dioxide of 20–24 mEq/L can safely receive sodium bicarbonate, improving quadriceps strength and preserving GFR. Our study thus targets patients with CKD with bicarbonate levels under 24 mEq/L to address subclinical acidosis. Therefore, studies that met the following criteria were included: (1) Participants: adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with CKD and MA, in which CKD was defined as persistently reduced eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and MA was defined as a baseline serum bicarbonate level ≤ 24 mEq/L; (2) intervention: alkali therapy with oral sodium bicarbonate; (3) comparators: placebo, standard care (routine biochemical laboratory measurements with/without diet intervention suggested by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guideline), or those receiving rescue therapy; (4) outcomes: assessed one of the following outcomes: change in eGFR, systolic BP (SBP), the risk of hospitalization rate, all-cause mortality, CV event rates, body weight change, 24-hour urine sodium excretion rates, serum potassium, creatinine clearance, bicarbonate, albumin, calcium, phosphate, iPTH level, and mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC). Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included (1) trials that included animals or pregnant women; (2) research designs other than RCTs, such as protocols and conference abstracts; (3) trials evaluating interventions for MA other than sodium bicarbonate (such as veverimer); (4) those adopting other interventions as a control group (e.g. fruit and vegetable-based diet); (5) studies focusing on populations with dialysis-dependent kidney failure or kidney transplant recipients; (6) participants with serum bicarbonate level more than 24 mEq/L; or (7) those without explicitly mention MA.–

An initial search yielded 425 publications from electronic databases and manual searches. After removing duplications (n = 118), 307 studies underwent title and abstract screening. The full text of 101 articles were retrieved for assessment of eligibility, and we excluded 87 articles for the following reasons: mismatched study design (n = 56) including meta-analyses (n = 9) and non-RCTs (n = 47); ongoing trials or protocols (n = 6); same material from one study (n = 3); conference abstracts (n = 13); no control group (n = 3); and those without compatible with MA criteria (n = 6). A studyassessing the effect of a high versus low dosage of sodium bicarbonate in patients with CKD was reviewed but excluded for enrolling individuals with serum bicarbonate concentrations up to 28 mEq/L. Similarly, a study by Melamed et al. was excluded because of serum bicarbonate level up to 26 mEq/L. Consequently, 14 eligible RCTs were enrolled. A comprehensive Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram is shown in Figure 1.

### Sodium bicarbonate treatment and clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease with metabolic acidosis: a meta-analysis [^111zETue]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sodium bicarbonate had emerged as a therapeutic option, demonstrating its beneficial effects via several potential mechanisms. Increased ammonium ion concentration activates the alternative complementary pathway, leading to tissue injury and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, driving GFR decline. Sodium bicarbonate serves as an alkali agent by lowering interstitial ammonium levels, which ameliorates intrakidney complement activation. Another possible mechanism is that decreasing tubular hydrogen ion secretions following sodium bicarbonate may prevent tubular cast formation. These pathways could explain that sodium bicarbonate was a kidney-protective approach to delay the deterioration of kidney function, which was consistent with the findings in our meta-analysis.

In subgroup analyses, sodium bicarbonate conferred a more significant treatment benefit on eGFR in patients age < 65 years. A previous studyreported a favorable impact of sodium bicarbonate on eGFR, with the mean age ranging from 41 to 65 years. In light of this, our subgroup analysis of age was conducted with a threshold value of 65 years, revealing that those age < 65 years experienced a better kidney protective effect, which was in line with evidence from a previous study. The possible explanation is that eGFR typically declines with age. Hence, we can speculate that in patients with CKD coexisting with MA, sodium bicarbonate demonstrates greater efficacy in kidney function improvement in younger individuals. Stronger therapeutic benefit in eGFR outcomes among Asian patients was observed; however, further P value for interaction test was NS, suggesting the observed benefit on kidney function may not be exclusively attributed to ethnicity.

Clinicians should be cautious about potential side effects by using sodium bicarbonate in treating patients with CKD with MA, including sodium overload leading to fluid retention and higher BP due to impaired natriuresis. In our study, oral sodium bicarbonate showed a small but significant positive increase in SBP (SMD, 0.1) compared with controls, without significantly increasing body weight, but a trend toward weight gain was noted, suggesting cautious prescription by medical practitioners. Besides, the bicarbonate group was associated with nutritional benefits, evidenced by a significant rise in serum albumin. We also found higher urinary sodium in the bicarbonate group because of the additional sodium load. There is a positive correlation between urinary sodium excretion and SBP, especially in moderate-to-severe CKD populations because of heightened salt sensitivity as the disease progresses. This could also explain our findings.

### Acidosis and progression of chronic kidney disease [^116f2tSu]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic kidney disease progressively impairs the ability of kidneys to excrete hydrogen ions owing to the reduced capacity of the kidney to synthesize ammonia resulting in metabolic acidosis. There is good experimental evidence that metabolic acidosis contributes to protein energy wasting disorder and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there was a lack of robust clinical evidence to support these experimental observations.

Recent Findings

Three recent publications have confirmed the experimental evidence and the only randomized controlled study of its kind has suggested that the correction of acidosis by sodium bicarbonate in patients with advanced CKD is associated with attenuation of the rate of decline of renal function, reduction in the incidence of end stage renal disease and improvement of nutritional parameters.

Summary

In light of these recent studies, it appears that this cheap and simple strategy, which is in line with current renal recommendations, has the potential of translating into significant economic, quality of life and clinical outcome benefits in an expanding pool of patients with CKD.

### Short-and long-term effects of alkali therapy in chronic kidney disease: a systematic review [^111nzz1A]. American Journal of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines recommend alkali therapy in patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) and metabolic acidosis to prevent complications from metabolic acidosis. We systematically reviewed the effect of sodium bicarbonate on benefits and harms in patients with CKD.

Methods

We searched for randomized controlled trials in MEDLINE (through July 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and scientific abstracts. We included trials that compared sodium bicarbonate to standard-of-care therapy or placebo that reported on kidney-related outcomes. We performed random-effects model meta-analyses to compute net changes (for continuous variables) and risk ratios (for binary variables).

Results

Two short-term (≤ 7 days) crossover trials and 4 long-term (≥ 2 months) parallel-design randomized controlled trials met eligibility (312 patients). All 6 trials prescribed sodium bicarbonate in the alkali-treated group. In the long-term studies, alkali therapy was associated with a net decrease in serum creatinine (-0.07 mg/dl, 95% CI -0.09, -0.05; p < 0.001; I(2) = 0), a net improvement in GFR (3.2 ml/min/1.73 m(2), 95% CI 1.6, 4.7; p < 0.001; I(2) = 0), and a lower incidence of dialysis initiation (risk ratio 0.21, 95% CI 0.08, 0.54; p = 0.001; I(2) = 0). No benefit was observed on the serum creatinine or GFR in short-term studies. Alkali therapy was not associated with a higher likelihood of initiating or escalating anti-hypertensive medications.

Conclusions

Alkali therapy is associated with an improvement in kidney function, which may afford a long-term benefit in slowing the progression of CKD. However, differences in study protocols and small sample sizes preclude definitive conclusions.

### Veverimer: an emerging potential treatment option for managing the metabolic acidosis of CKD [^116WGm84]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Sodium bicarbonate is the mainstay treatment of the metabolic acidosis of chronic kidney disease but associated concerns center on administering sodium to patients with hypertension and sodium-retentive states. Veverimer (formerly referred to as TRC101), a drug candidate for which Tricida, Inc is seeking approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, is a novel nonabsorbable polymer that binds hydrogen cations and chloride anions in the gastrointestinal tract and then is excreted fecally, thereby increasing serum bicarbonate concentration without administering sodium. We examine the published evidence on the investigational use of veverimer in patients with chronic kidney disease and metabolic acidosis. We highlight the achieved increase in serum bicarbonate concentration without coadministering sodium, effects on physical functioning, and the safety record of the drug. We also scrutinize certain unanticipated findings: a lack of dose dependency in the increase in serum bicarbonate concentration observed and that despite the presumed large hydrogen chloride losses in feces, veverimer induces an isochloremic increase in serum bicarbonate concentration that is accompanied by a decrease in serum anion gap. We propose likely explanations for these puzzling findings and raise questions about veverimer's mode of action and its potential interaction with colonic bacterial flora. Additional work is required to fill these knowledge gaps that could have important clinical implications.

### Clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows the progression of chronic kidney disease [^115TqLY2]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The importance of normalizing serum HCO 3 in CKD patients with metabolic acidosis is reflected in the leading treatment guidelines for CKD. The US-based National Kidney Foundation's KDOQI guidelines state that serum HCO 3 levels should be maintained at 22 mEq/l or greater and recommend the use of oral alkali supplements to attain this goal, whereas maintaining an awareness of the complications related to the use of such supplements. Similarly, guidelines from KDIGO suggest that in patients with CKD and serum bicarbonate less than 22 mEq/l treatment with oral bicarbonate supplementation can be given to maintain serum bicarbonate within the normal range unless contraindicated. Several large retrospective database analyses show that clinical outcomes for CKD patients with serum HCO 3 levels that are below normal (i.e. < 22 mEq/l) are significantly worse compared with patients with normal serum HCO 3 (i.e. 22–29 mEq/l). In addition, several single-center, prospective studies examining the effects of sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, or dietary interventions have also elucidated the beneficial effects of treating chronic metabolic acidosis. In four of the seven key interventional studies discussed here, the provision of oral bicarbonate supplementation increased serum HCO 3 in enrolled CKD patients with baseline serum HCO 3 less than 22 mEq/l, often within 6 months of treatment initiation. Further, long-term treatment of metabolic acidosis (1–3 years) or treatment of hypertension-associated nephropathy patients with normal serum HCO 3 belying an increased acid load (5 years), showed direct benefit on reducing eGFR decline and improving kidney outcomes. Importantly, these improvements were accompanied by a reduction in the expression of urine biomarkers that reflect continued injury to kidneys exposed to chronic acid loading. A post hoc analysis of data from the Phisitkul et al. study showed that the provision of oral alkali to CKD patients with metabolic acidosis reduced the number of patients who experienced at least 40% decline in eGFR, an accepted surrogate endpoint of kidney disease progression to ESKD. Although 27.6% of control patients in this study showed at least 40% decline in eGFR over the 2-year treatment interval, no patients in the sodium citrate treatment group experienced eGFR declines of this magnitude (Table 3; Fig. 2). A limitation of the studies reviewed here is in the enrollment of patients who did not have severe comorbidities commonly found in CKD (e.g. edema, heart failure, poorly-controlled hypertension), as treatment with sodium-based oral alkali might aggravate fluid homeostasis in such patients. Based on these findings, it seems likely that nutritional and pharmacologic management of metabolic acidosis preserves kidney function, and larger scale, multicenter testing of this hypothesis is warranted.

ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS RELATING SERUM BICARBONATE INCREASE AND REDUCTION OF ESTIMATED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE DECLINE IN PATIENTS TREATED WITH ORAL BICARBONATE SUPPLEMENTATION

The findings of the above prospective studies and the association of better kidney outcomes with treatment of metabolic acidosis in CKD suggest a promising new approach to slowing disease progression, apart from current renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition therapy. There is a clear medical need for new therapies for CKD. In view of this need, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has considered new recommendations for kidney outcome measures used in the evaluation of new therapies. The FDA accepts a 57% decline in eGFR, corresponding to a doubling of serum creatinine, as an endpoint for clinical trials of kidney disease progression because it represents a marked loss of kidney function that is predictive of eventual kidney failure. Recent initiatives coordinated by the National Kidney Foundation and the FDA are evaluating alternative endpoints to shorten the duration of clinical trials, reduce sample size, and include patients with earlier stages of CKD. Based on a series of meta-analyses of cohorts and clinical trials, as well as simulations of trial designs and analytic methods, these efforts have shown that an eGFR decline of 40% is an acceptable surrogate endpoint to assess treatment effects of new therapies designed to slow CKD progression. It is instructive then to see how this endpoint might be used in light of the prospective studies reported above.

### Correction of chronic metabolic acidosis for chronic kidney disease patients [^112mroH8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Metabolic acidosis is a feature of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the reduced capacity of the kidney to synthesise ammonia and excrete hydrogen ions. It has adverse consequences on protein and muscle metabolism, bone turnover and the development of renal osteodystrophy. Metabolic acidosis may be corrected by oral bicarbonate supplementation or in dialysis patients by increasing the bicarbonate concentration in dialysate fluid.

Objectives

To examine the benefits and harms of treating metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD, both prior to reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or whilst on renal replacement therapy (RRT), with sodium bicarbonate or increasing the bicarbonate concentration of dialysate.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, issue 4 2005), Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register (October 2005), MEDLINE (1966 - October 2005) and EMBASE (1980 - October 2005).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), crossover RCTs and quasi-RCTs investigating the correction of chronic metabolic acidosis in adults or children with CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Outcomes were analysed using relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (MD) for continuous measures.

Main Results

We identified three trials in adult dialysis patients (n = 117). There were insufficient data for most outcomes for meta-analysis. In all three trials acidosis improved in the intervention group though there was variation in achieved bicarbonate level. There was no evidence of effect on blood pressure or sodium levels. Some measures of nutritional status/protein metabolism (e.g. SGA, NP NA) were significantly improved by correction in the one trial that looked in these in detail. There was heterogeneity of the effect on serum albumin in two trials. Serum PTH fell significantly in the two trials that estimated this, there was no significant effect on calcium or phosphate though both fell after correction. Complex bone markers were assessed in one study, with some evidence for a reduction in bone turnover in those with initial high bone turnover and an increase in low turnover patients. The studies were underpowered to assess clinical outcomes, in the one study that did there was some evidence for a reduction in hospitalisation after correction.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for the benefits and risks of correcting metabolic acidosis is very limited with no RCTs in pre-ESRD patients, none in children, and only three small trials in dialysis patients. These trials suggest there may be some beneficial effects on both protein and bone metabolism but the trials were underpowered to provide robust evidence.

### High serum bicarbonate level within the normal range prevents the progression of chronic kidney disease in elderly chronic kidney disease patients [^114YNZCA]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, the serum bicarbonate levels of the elderly CKD patients were controlled within the normal range. We demonstrated that a high serum bicarbonate level was associated a low risk of CKD progression in elderly CKD patients. Our findings are consistent with previous reports that a low serum bicarbonate level is associated with CKD progression. There has been no study of serum bicarbonate level in elderly CKD patients. The participants in our present study were older than those in other studies. This study also showed that, although the average serum bicarbonate level of the low-bicarbonate group was controlled within the normal range in accordance with K/DOQI guidelines 2000, being in the lowest quartile of serum bicarbonate levels was associated with a high risk of CKD progression. In this analysis, a low serum bicarbonate level remained independently related to a high HR of CKD progression. These findings suggest that a high serum bicarbonate level within the normal range may prevent CKD progression in elderly CKD patients.

The optimal management of acidemia or metabolic acidosis in CKD patients, including the monitoring of serum bicarbonate level and sodium bicarbonate administration, has not been established yet. Our study showed that the patients with a serum bicarbonate level lower than 25.5 mEq/l had a high risk of CKD progression. The K/DOQI guidelines 2000 and CARI guidelines recommend that the serum bicarbonate level should be maintained at or above 22 mEq/l. In a trial, the effect of sodium bicarbonate on CKD progression was compared between the bicarbonate-treated group and the control group. The average serum bicarbonate level of the control group at baseline was 19.9 mEq/l, and the average serum bicarbonate level of the bicarbonate-treated group gradually became higher than 22 mEq/l. As the lower limit, 22 mEq/l may be a useful target serum bicarbonate level in clinical practice presently.

### Effect of sodium bicarbonate on systolic blood pressure in CKD: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114sinoA]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

As a surrogate of sodium bicarbonate therapy, we explored serum bicarbonate after therapy. However, we note the high heterogeneity in this analysis. This intriguing finding can be a sign of poor adherence to the intervention, perhaps because of medication tolerance, need for up-titration of sodium bicarbonate to counterbalance the ongoing intake of high acid-containing Western diets, or interindividual variability in response to sodium bicarbonate. Indeed, high interindividual variability has been shown across a number of independent studies, and requires more evaluation.

This systematic review and meta-analysis is strengthened by several factors. We included a larger number of trials compared with previous meta-analyses, spanning more than 2000 participants. We used stringent inclusion criteria limited to RCTs and performed risk-of-bias assessment using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. We also conducted several subgroup analyses and meta-regression to ascertain the role of potential confounders. However, we also acknowledge some limitations. First, systolic BP and/or antihypertensive medication change was not a primary or secondary outcome for a number of studies, and this can undermine confidence in the effect measured. Moreover, treatment allocation is not randomized, thus antihypertensive medication analyses are prone to confounding by indication. Second, there was a paucity of RCTs that account for bidirectional changes in medication data. Third, the eligibility criteria of the included studies excluded individuals with uncontrolled high BP, and we are unable to comment on the effects on participants with severe or moderately uncontrolled hypertension. Fourth, the granularity of data when conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis prevents us from truly accounting for interindividual variability. As discussed above, more research is needed in this area. Finally, the medication data retrieved is also heterogeneous, presenting a possible residual confounding factor that we cannot account for.

In the first systematic review and meta-analysis of sodium bicarbonate, BP, and metabolic acidosis to account for changes in medication, we find that sodium bicarbonate supplementation does not change systolic BP. Consequently, clinical hesitation for the use of sodium bicarbonate in participants with CKD seems unwarranted. We also show no effect when stratifying our analysis by dose administered or duration of intervention. More effort is needed within the CKD–sodium bicarbonate field to record thorough data regarding changes in medication from intervention.

### High serum bicarbonate level within the normal range prevents the progression of chronic kidney disease in elderly chronic kidney disease patients [^113Nxkcs]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our data showed a possibility that a high serum bicarbonate level within the normal range may more effectively prevent CKD progression in elderly CKD patients, and suggested that the upper limit of the target serum bicarbonate level may be that of the normal range of serum bicarbonate levels. For the prevention of CKD progression, there are issues that should be resolved: when to start the treatment with sodium bicarbonate and how much sodium bicarbonate should be administered. Clinical trials using a large sample size are required to obtain strong evidence that can help guide therapies with sodium bicarbonate.
