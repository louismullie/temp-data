## Question

Why did they collect cordless at delivery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why they collect cordless at delivery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "cordless" likely refers to in this context. Then, I should verify the main clinical reasons for collecting cord blood at delivery. Next, I will distinguish between postnatal cord blood sampling for neonatal diagnostics versus cord blood banking for transplantation. After that, I need to check how delayed cord clamping affects collection feasibility and what guidelines say about prioritization. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically grounded answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "cordless" is not standard. Wait, let me verify the likely intent: in obstetrics and neonatology, the relevant practice is umbilical cord blood collection at delivery, which can mean either postnatal cord blood sampling for neonatal laboratory testing or cord blood banking for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, so I should interpret the question as "why collect cord blood at delivery" rather than literally "cordless".

> Next, I should review the two distinct clinical purposes. Postnatal cord blood sampling (PCBS) draws neonatal blood from the umbilical cord to obtain admission labs without painful infant phlebotomy and with larger volumes for cultures, which is especially beneficial in very low birth weight infants and can reduce early transfusions and hemodynamic instability, whereas cord blood banking collects and cryopreserves cord blood for potential allogeneic or directed autologous transplantation in select hematologic, genetic, or malignant diseases [^114Jr6qs] [^115hzk6S] [^notfound].

> I will now examine the rationale for PCBS in more detail. Hold on, I should verify the key benefits: PCBS avoids neonatal blood loss during transition, enables larger-volume blood cultures that improve pathogen detection, and in VLBW infants has been associated with more stable blood pressure, less vasopressor use, fewer transfusions, and possibly less intraventricular hemorrhage; feasibility is high, with success around 95% even after delayed cord clamping when the cord remains clamped until sampling [^114Jr6qs] [^115hzk6S] [^1151CLKK] [^116wzbtj] [^115Uw9xJ].

> Now, let me consider cord blood banking. I need to ensure I capture both public and private contexts: public banking is recommended to increase the pool of ethnically diverse, high-quality units for allogeneic transplantation, while private banking may be reasonable when a family member has a known indication for transplantation; routine private banking is not supported by evidence for autologous use, and only a minority of collected units meet public bank standards, partly due to volume and sterility constraints [^115qHAFd] [^111oCNRr] [^112iqJbY] [^115FhY4r].

> But wait, what if delayed cord clamping is planned — does that preclude collection? I should double-check the interaction. Delayed cord clamping reduces the volume and nucleated cell yield available for banking, and guidelines emphasize that neonatal benefits of placental transfusion generally outweigh banking yield; nonetheless, PCBS remains feasible after DCC if the cord is kept clamped until sampling, and in VLBW infants, PCBS should be prioritized over banking when both are desired [^116G4VQC] [^116J8Mbh] [^114ppMCT] [^115Uw9xJ].

> Let me synthesize the answer succinctly. They collect cord blood at delivery for two main reasons: first, to obtain neonatal blood samples for early diagnostics and sepsis evaluation without infant phlebotomy and with larger culture volumes, which is especially beneficial for preterm and VLBW infants; second, to bank hematopoietic stem cells for potential transplantation, with public banking favored for societal benefit and private banking considered selectively for known familial indications, while recognizing that delayed cord clamping can reduce banking yield but does not negate the value of PCBS when planned appropriately [^114Jr6qs] [^115hzk6S] [^114QZSva] [^111oCNRr] [^114ppMCT].

Cord blood is collected at delivery because it is a **rich source of hematopoietic stem cells** used to treat over 80 diseases, including leukemia, lymphoma, and inherited metabolic disorders [^116oN2Sp]. Collection is **safe, painless, and does not affect maternal or neonatal outcomes** when done properly [^114ws2kL] [^114Jr6qs]. It can be stored publicly for altruistic use or privately for family use, though public banking is generally recommended due to broader access and quality standards [^114QZSva] [^111oCNRr]. Delayed cord clamping can reduce the volume collected, but collection can still be feasible and valuable [^116G4VQC] [^115Uw9xJ].

## Clinical and therapeutic value of cord blood

Cord blood is **rich in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)** [^116dJhjj], which can differentiate into all blood cell types and are used in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to treat a variety of diseases, including:

- **Leukemia and lymphoma**: HSCs replace diseased blood cells after chemotherapy or radiation [^notfound].
- **Inherited metabolic disorders**: Such as Hurler syndrome and adrenoleukodystrophy [^notfound].
- **Immune deficiencies**: Including severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome [^notfound].

Cord blood transplantation offers several advantages over bone marrow, including **lower risk of graft-versus-host disease**, greater availability, and less stringent HLA matching requirements [^notfound].

---

## Safety and feasibility of cord blood collection

Cord blood collection is **safe and painless** for both mother and infant [^114Jr6qs]. It is performed after the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, and does not interfere with delivery or immediate neonatal care [^114QZSva]. Studies show no significant differences in maternal blood loss, postpartum hemorrhage, or neonatal outcomes between collections performed before or after placental delivery [^114ws2kL].

---

## Impact of delayed cord clamping on cord blood collection

Delayed cord clamping (DCC) — waiting 30–60 seconds after birth before clamping — is recommended for its neonatal benefits, including improved iron stores and reduced anemia [^116J8Mbh]. However, DCC can reduce the volume of cord blood available for collection, potentially affecting the total nucleated cell count and suitability for banking [^116G4VQC]. Despite this, **collection remains feasible** [^115Uw9xJ], and strategies such as in utero collection or optimized timing can mitigate volume loss [^113RKqbR].

## Public vs. private cord blood banking

Cord blood can be stored in **public or private banks**:

| **Aspect** | **Public banking** | **Private banking** |
|-|-|-|
| Purpose | Altruistic donation for public use | Autologous or family use |
| Cost | Free | Significant fees for collection and storage |
| Access | Available to anyone in need | Reserved for the family |
| Quality standards | Strict regulatory oversight | Variable standards |

---

Public banking is **generally recommended** due to broader access, higher quality standards, and greater likelihood of use [^114QZSva] [^115FhY4r]. Private banking may be considered for families with known genetic disorders or when a sibling could benefit from transplantation [^111oCNRr].

---

## Ethical and regulatory considerations

Cord blood collection and banking are governed by **ethical and regulatory frameworks** that address informed consent, quality control, and equitable access [^116F7Vpv]. Public banks are subject to stringent regulations and accreditation standards, ensuring the safety and efficacy of stored units [^115FhY4r].

---

## Current research and future directions

Ongoing research explores the use of cord blood in **regenerative medicine**, including treatment of cerebral palsy, autism, and type 1 diabetes [^116oN2Sp]. While preliminary results are promising, further clinical trials are needed to establish definitive therapeutic benefits [^notfound].

---

Cord blood collection at delivery is a **valuable medical practice** that provides life-saving stem cells for transplantation while being safe and feasible. Public banking is encouraged to maximize societal benefit, and ongoing research continues to expand the therapeutic applications of cord blood.

### Maternal blood contamination of collected cord blood can be identified using DNA methylation at three CpGs [^11294QPk]. Clinical Epigenetics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Neonatal blood from the umbilical cord at the time of delivery is increasingly being collected for both research and medical purposes. In research, interest in the developmental origins of health and disease has made cord blood a popular choice for genetic, epigenetic, and environmental studies. Cord blood has several physiological differences from adult blood, such as the presence of nucleated red blood cells and fetal hemoglobin, and is an excellent window into the in utero environment, free of confounding post-natal exposures. Medically, cord blood is banked for transplantation as a source of progenitor cells for replenishing the hematopoietic system. Cord blood can be collected after caesarian or vaginal delivery, either preceding or following delivery of the placenta. Both processes typically involve venipuncture of the umbilical artery and collection into a blood bag by gravity. Problems can arise when the collected cord blood becomes contaminated with other cells, most frequently maternal white blood cells. In some cases, maternal blood cells may enter fetal circulation through the placenta. Previous studies have shown that such contamination can occur relatively frequently, estimated at 2–20% of collected samples, but it makes up a very small fraction of fetal blood, with ~10⁻⁴ to 10⁻⁵ fetal nucleated cells estimated as maternal. This small amount of contamination should have negligible effects on the assessment of DNA or RNA. However, contamination in larger amounts, which could occur through mixing of blood during collection, is of greater concern.

### Umbilical cord stem cells [^116dJhjj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Until recently, blood that remained in the umbilical cord and placenta after delivery was routinely discarded. Now that this blood is known to contain both hematopoietic stem cells and pluripotent mesenchymal cells, there has been a substantial increase in the clinical use and research investigation of umbilical cord blood in hematopoietic transplantation and regenerative medicine. Until now, standards for collection and processing were not well established. The debate continues regarding the private banking of autologous blood for "biologic insurance" versus public banking for access by the general population. Obstetricians should support the acquisition of cord units for public banking in their geographic location where cord blood banks have established collection procedures. Issues related to cost, quality control, and the need for ethnic diversity in public banks preclude the universal collection of units from all obstetric deliveries. Directed donation of cord blood should be considered when there is a specific diagnosis of a disease within a family known to be amenable to stem cell transplantation.

### Knowledge gaps in optimal umbilical cord management at birth [^111DZdVq]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2014 the World Health Organisation recommended providing placental blood to all newborn infants by waiting for at least one minute before clamping the umbilical cord. Mounting evidence supports providing a placental transfusion at the time of birth for all infants. The optimal time before clamping and cutting the umbilical cord is still not yet known, and debate exists around other cord management issues. The newborn's transition phase from intra- to extra-uterine life and the effects of blood volume on the many necessary adaptations are understudied. How best to support these adaptations guides our suggested research questions. Parents' perceptions of enrolling their unborn infant into a study play important parts in the conduct of such trials. This article aims to address these topics and suggest research questions for further studies.

### Postnatal cord blood sampling: clinical report [^115NDJR9]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Postnatal cord blood sampling (PCBS) for genetic studies — scope and volume — describes that "Whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing, chromosomal microarray analysis, and karyotyping are the most common tests to evaluate various neonatal conditions and diseases that may be associated with chromosomal abnormalities", and for perinatal or neonatal death "this may be the only opportunity to obtain important diagnostic information"; "significant blood volumes of 2 to 6 mL are often required", and "Obtaining this volume of blood is more feasible with PCBS than with standard phlebotomy of the neonate after birth", with additional candidates including "stillborn infants or infants who die in the delivery room or other delivery settings"; the key action states "PCBS can be used to obtain genetic studies".

### ACOG committee opinion no. 771: umbilical cord blood banking [^114QZSva]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Umbilical cord blood collection — obstetric and neonatal care, including delayed cord clamping, should be preserved during donation. Umbilical cord blood collection should not compromise obstetric or neonatal care or alter routine practice of delayed umbilical cord clamping with the rare exception of medical indications for directed donation. It is important to inform patients that the medical condition of the woman or neonate may prevent adequate umbilical cord blood collection. There is no current evidence to support the use of an autologous umbilical cord blood sample in regenerative medicine.

### Postnatal cord blood sampling: clinical report [^114Jr6qs]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Blood contained in the umbilical cord after placental separation originates from the infant and can be used for neonatal blood sampling and testing after birth. The most common indications for phlebotomy after birth include care processes for any infant admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, early-onset sepsis evaluations, and congenital anomalies. Postnatal umbilical cord blood sampling (PCBS), rather than obtaining blood from the neonate, avoids significant neonatal blood loss at a critical time of extrauterine transition and prevents phlebotomy pain in infants without a catheter for blood drawing. Studies of PCBS in very low birth weight infants have demonstrated additional benefits including stable blood pressure, less need for vasopressors and erythrocyte transfusions in the first week, and a potentially decreased risk for intracranial hemorrhage. PCBS can be used for any full-term or preterm infant when the need for phlebotomy is known at or shorty after delivery. PCBS can be the first option and reliably used for complete blood cell counts, blood cultures, blood typing and crossmatching, newborn screening and metabolic tests, genetic testing, blood chemistries, and coagulation studies. Additionally, PCBS allows the collection of larger blood volumes for blood culture, thereby improving positivity rate. Finally, PCBS can be performed after delayed cord clamping or cord milking and in conjunction with research studies and/or cord blood banking. This report describes the evidence, safety, and methods for collecting cord blood after delivery.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 771: umbilical cord blood banking [^112Fz3xz]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Umbilical cord blood banking — counseling and collection considerations include that families of all ethnicities and races should consider the societal benefit of public umbilical cord blood donation to increase the availability of matched cord blood units for people of all backgrounds. Obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should be aware of state and local laws regarding umbilical cord blood banking, including the law in some states that requires physicians to inform patients about umbilical cord blood banking options. Health care providers with a financial interest in private umbilical cord blood banking should disclose these interests, incentives, or other potential conflicts of interest. If a patient requests information about umbilical cord blood banking, balanced and accurate information regarding the advantages and disadvantages of public and private umbilical cord blood banking should be provided. A variety of circumstances may arise during the process of labor and delivery that may preclude adequate collection. Umbilical cord blood collection should not compromise obstetric or neonatal care or alter routine practice of delayed umbilical cord clamping with the rare exception of medical indications for directed donation. It is important to inform patients that the medical condition of the woman or neonate may prevent adequate umbilical cord blood collection.

### Postnatal cord blood sampling: clinical report [^114MCg2h]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Postnatal cord blood sampling (PCBS) — CBC with differential: CBC with differential using PCBS has been validated; white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet counts may be slightly lower, although not clinically significant, than arterial/venous/capillary samples; differences are minimized when phlebotomy is timed closest to delivery and within 10 to 30 minutes after delivery, or within 30 minutes if using an isolated double‑clamped cord segment; key action statement: PCBS can be used to obtain a reliable CBC with differential.

### Postnatal cord blood sampling: clinical report [^115hzk6S]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Postnatal cord blood sampling (PCBS) — indications and key procedural requirements: PCBS collects neonatal blood and is a painless procedure that has been well studied and successful 95% of the time in obtaining admission laboratory studies, and PCBS can be used to obtain a reliable blood culture, CBC with differential, blood type and crossmatch, genetic and metabolic testing, chemistries, and coagulation studies. If it is determined that blood tests are needed at or shortly after delivery, PCBS should be the first choice for phlebotomy and can be used in newborns of any gestational age in the first hour after birth, and PCBS is most commonly performed for infants being admitted to the NICU, early-onset sepsis evaluations, initial and follow-up genetic testing, studies needed for infants with congenital anomalies, and deaths that occur prior to or shortly after delivery. For PCBS to be successful in obtaining optimal blood volumes for admission laboratory studies after delayed cord clamping, the umbilical cord must remain clamped until PCBS is performed, and PCBS facilitates obtaining larger blood culture volumes potentially improving early-onset sepsis pathogen detection compared to infant phlebotomy and must be performed as an aseptic procedure. PCBS for admission laboratory tests can be coordinated with research cord studies and cord blood banking, and there may be deliveries where PCBS should be prioritized, for example in VLBW infants, where it prevents hypotension, the need for vasopressors, blood transfusions and potentially intraventricular hemorrhage.

### Postnatal cord blood sampling: clinical report [^114ppMCT]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Postnatal cord blood sampling (PCBS) — key action statements for cord clamping, admission testing, and cord blood banking — specifies: "For PCBS to produce optimal blood volumes, the umbilical cord must remain clamped after DCC until PCBS is performed". If there is a need for admission laboratory testing, "PCBS should be used in all infants". PCBS can be performed when cord blood is also collected for research or banking, and "PCBS has significant potential benefits in VLBW infants and should be attempted and performed when feasible in infants of all gestational ages". Regarding banking, "The volume available for cord banking for infants ≥ 1500 g is not significantly affected by PCBS", and "Cord blood banking should neither take precedence nor serve as a reason not to perform PCBS (or DCC) in VLBW infants". Another key action states that "PCBS followed by research studies if needed and/or cord blood banking using the same or different phlebotomy sites can all be successful in most cases with discussion and planning prior to the delivery", and "In VLBW infants, PCBS should be prioritized over cord blood banking in most cases".

### Assisted reproductive technology surveillance-United States, 2012… [^112sNAUQ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract Problem/Condition: Since the first U. S. infant conceived with Assisted Reproductive Technology was born in 1981, both the use of advanced technologies to overcome infertility and the number of fertility clinics providing ART services have increased steadily in the United States. ART includes fertility treatments in which eggs or embryos are handled in the laboratory. Among women aged < 35 years, eSET procedures warrant consideration because these patients might have extra embryos available for cryopreservation, which is a good predictor of embryo quality, and might have a more favorable prognosis for a live birth than older patients. However, on average, two embryos were transferred per cycle in ART procedures among women aged < 35 years, influencing the overall multiple-birth rates in the United States. Introduction Since the birth of the first U. S.

infant conceived with Assisted Reproductive Technology in 1981, use of advanced technologies to overcome infertility has increased steadily, as has the number of fertility clinics providing ART services and procedures in the United States. ART procedures are classified into four types on the basis of the source of the egg and the status of the embryos. Both fresh and thawed embryos can result from either the patient's eggs or from the donor's eggs. ART procedures involving fresh embryos include an egg-retrieval stage. ART procedures that use thawed embryos do not include egg retrieval because the eggs were fertilized during a previous procedure, and the resulting embryos were frozen until the current procedure. An ART procedure can be discontinued at any step for medical reasons or by patient choice.

Elective single-embryo transfer is a procedure in which one embryo, selected from a larger number of available embryos, is placed in the uterus, with extra embryos cryopreserved. Fresh transfer procedures in which only one embryo was transferred but no embryos were cryopreserved are not considered eSET. The remaining embryos might be set aside for future use through cryopreservation. In this report, both eSET procedures and the average number of embryos transferred were calculated for fresh, nondonor cycles in which at least one embryo was transferred. Transfer procedures in which only one embryo was transferred but no embryos were cryopreserved were excluded from the calculation of eSET percentages.

### Cord blood collection before and after placental delivery: levels of nucleated cells, haematopoietic progenitor cells, leukocyte subpopulations and macroscopic clots [^113RKqbR]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

The number of nucleated cells infused into the recipient of a cord blood (CB) transplant has emerged as the most important factor affecting the probability and speed of engraftment. At present, there is no international consensus on the procedure of CB collection in the maternity ward. In order to maximise the yield of viable cells in a CB unit, we aimed to investigate the efficiency of CB collection, with respect to the time of delivery of the placenta. We analysed stem and progenitor cells in terms of CD34+ cell content and colony-forming activities, lymphocyte subpopulations and the presence of macroscopic clots in 93 paired CB samples, collected before and after the delivery of the placenta. Our results demonstrated that the median concentrations of nucleated cells and total colony-forming unit (CFU) were significantly lower in CB collected after placenta delivery by 9.5% (P < 0.001) and 11.6% (P = 0.015), respectively, when compared to their counterparts collected before placental delivery. A reduction of granulocytes (P < 0.001), monocytes (P < 0.001) and CD19+ B lymphocytes (P = 0.031) was observed, with no significant change in the proportion of T cell subsets (CD4+, CD8+ cells) or activated T cells (CD25+, CD45RO+ cells) in samples collected after placenta delivery. The incidence of macroscopic clots was also higher in these samples (31% vs 1%, P < 0.001). The reduction of stem and progenitor cells correlated significantly with that of major cell populations, indicating a general cell loss, possibly due to clotting activities developed with time. Our study has documented strong evidence for recommending the collection of CB before the delivery of the placenta.

### Implications of maternal-fetal health on perinatal stem cell banking [^1147YkGk]. Gene Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

The impact of delivery methods on perinatal cell banking

Another consideration is the limitation placed on perinatal stem cell banking due to the method of delivery. Currently, cord blood can be collected from both vaginal and caesarean births. However, public donations of other gestational tissues usually require sterile collection from caesarean sections in an effort to avoid microbial contamination. Furthermore, majority of births including those that happen in hospitals are vaginal deliveries. In the USA, 68% of hospital births in 2017 were vaginal deliveries with 26% being low-risk cases. In the same year, the rate of vaginal deliveries in Australia was similar, at ~70%. Considering that most low-risk pregnancies are delivered vaginally, and majority of the research to date has focused on perinatal stem cells from healthy pregnancies, this severely limits the availability of potential donors for gestational tissues other than cord blood. While private banks offering tissue collection alongside with cord blood collection claim to bank tissues from both vaginal and caesarean births, there are concerns about sterility and perinatal stem cell quality when standardised collection procedures for vaginal births are lacking. At the time of writing, there are no published guidelines on bioburden reduction or indicating the time between collection and processing for tissues banked from vaginal births. Standard collection procedures should be developed in order to increase researcher access to tissues from low-risk/healthy pregnancies and standardise public and private banking procedures.

A further consideration with regards to the impact of delivery, specifically on cord blood collection, is the increasing trend of delayed cord clamping, where a delay of 60 s has been reported to significantly reduce blood volume collected and cell count. Gestational tissues from home births are less likely to impact perinatal stem cell banking due to the low rates of home births. Home births remains below 5% in most countries despite a recent increase with 1.6% in US, 4% in New Zealand in 2017, and 0.48% in Australia between 2000 and 2015. Home births are more common in countries like The Netherlands, accounting for approximating 20% of all births. However, there are clear challenges in the sterile collection of gestational tissues in home birth settings, and timely processing for cell isolation.

The impact of pregnancy complications on perinatal cell banking

Given that limited research has been undertaken to understand the impact of pregnancy complications and maternal health on perinatal stem cells, it is important to consider the significant proportion of caesarean deliveries that are affected by complications of maternal-fetal health.

### FY2018 GDUFA science and research report… [^116f2wdG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

- FYs 2013–2017 GDUFA Science and Research Report: Physiologically-Based Absorption and Pharmacokinetic Models for Non-Oral Routes Introduction For many drug products that are delivered through non-oral routes, the assessment of bioequivalence can. be challenging as: 1) measurement of drug concentrations at the site of action in humans may not be possible, feasible, or ethical; and 2) systemic drug concentrations can be irreflective of local concentrations, or not measurable at all. FDA is currently advancing through research the development and use of physiologically-. both a CFD and an empirical model to predict regional deposition of OIDPs, as well as a lung PBPK model that was to be coupled to a whole-body PBPK model. CFD predictions of budesonide dry powder inhaler drug delivery suggested that the inclusion of cartilaginous rings may have a significant effect of tracheal deposition.

In addition to the CFD model, a quasi-3D CFD model was developed which can predict airflow as well as dissolution, absorption, and mucociliary clearance of deposited aerosols. Grant #1U01FD005837 developed CFD models capable of predicting large and small airway deposition of orally inhaled drug products in healthy. internal research project uses CFD to predict regional deposition from "soft mist inhalers, " a term that was coined by the brand name manufacturer, Boehringer Ingelheim. These products produce aqueous droplets which may be reasonably expected to stay in solution during inhalation. Product performance will also be evaluated using in vitro testing, including particle image velocimetry and particle size testing. Results from these.

### An Indian perspective for umbilical cord blood haematological parameters reference interval [^116ChaCw]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Some studies confirm that cord blood haemoglobin and newborn weight showed a significant variation due to maternal anaemia, even though it has been reported that routine haematological values of newborns have no dependency on the maternal haematological values. Maternal habits like smoking or alcohol consumption, medical problems like diabetes mellitus, eclampsia, hypertension and also the mode of delivery, frequency of pregnancy, obstetrics and abortion history affect the haematological profile of neonates. This kind of variation in the reference intervals on the basis of geographical locations, lifestyle of a person and other above-mentioned factors sets forth the absolute need and rationale to establish reference intervals on consideration of such variations.

Umbilical cord blood collection (UCBC) can be done as a non–invasive method and poses no harm to the mother or the foetus. Other than minor risks involving a delay in the clamping of the cord and its milking that may alter the haematological parameters, UCBC is a relatively safe and simple manner of collection of the blood sample. Additionally, studies prove that, a higher sensitivity and accuracy for predicting a disease manifestation of patients by UCBC method against peripheral venous blood collection (PVBC) method concludes that UCBC can be considered as a reliable tool in order to predict a final outcome. Hence, to conduct the current study, we have used the cord blood collection method. This study aimed at providing such intervals for cord blood samples from tertiary care hospital in western part of Maharashtra.

### Evaluating otherwise-discarded umbilical cord blood as a source for a neonate's complete blood cell count at various time points [^111PyVep]. Neonatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies have reported the use of cord blood for admission laboratory complete blood counts (CBCs). However, no studies have investigated its stability for the first 30 min after delivery.

Objectives

We quantified blood cells drawn from the umbilical vein to determine the effect of (1) the time after placental delivery, and (2) the site of blood sampling (umbilical vein on an isolated cord segment vs. umbilical vein on the placental surface).

Methods

Timed phlebotomies were drawn at 2, 10, and 30 min from (1) the umbilical vein on an isolated, double-clamped cord segment, and (2) the umbilical vein near or on the placental surface. Leukocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and fibrinogen were measured on each phlebotomy sample.

Results

Blood drawn from the isolated umbilical cord segments had leukocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and fibrinogen that remained unchanged between the phlebotomies at 2, 10, and 30 min after delivery. However, blood drawn from the umbilical vein on the placental surface had, at 30 min, a leukocyte count (p = 0.002), hemoglobin (p = 0.01), and platelet count (p = 0.001) that were statistically different from the values at 2 and 10 min after delivery. There was no difference in fibrinogen at 2, 10, or 30 min.

Conclusions

If cord blood is used for a neonate's initial CBC, the blood should be drawn within 10 min of the placental delivery when it is taken from the umbilical vein on or near the placenta. If an umbilical cord segment is obtained, the phlebotomy can be delayed for up to 30 min.

### Effect of umbilical cord blood sampling versus admission blood sampling on requirement of blood transfusion in extremely preterm infants: a randomized controlled trial [^1151CLKK]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of blood sampling from the placental end of the umbilical cord compared with initial blood sampling from neonates, on the need for first packed red blood cell transfusion in extremely preterm infants. We hypothesized that cord blood sampling could delay the time to first blood transfusion.

Study Design

In this single-center, assessor blind, randomized controlled trial, we included extremely low birth weight neonates < 28 weeks of gestational age at birth. Five milliliter of blood for initial laboratory investigations was collected either from the placental end of the umbilical cord (study group) or from the neonate upon neonatal intensive care unit admission (control group). Both groups received similar anemia prevention strategies. The primary outcome was the time (in days) to the first packed red blood cell transfusion, and was compared using survival analysis.

Results

Eighty neonates were enrolled. The time to first transfusion was significantly delayed in the cord sampling group (30 vs 14 days, hazard ratio: 0.44, [95% CI 0.27–0.72], P < .001). Fewer neonates in the cord sampling group were transfused in the first 28 days of life (30% vs 75%, P < .001). Overall transfusion requirements and other clinical outcomes were similar in the groups.

Conclusions

Initial blood sampling from placental end of umbilical cord, when combined with anemia prevention strategies, significantly prolonged the time to first transfusion and reduced the need for early transfusions among extremely premature neonates.

### Volume of umbilical cord blood collection in the era of delayed cord clamping: a multicentre, prospective, feasibility study [^115Paqqv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the percentage of adequate umbilical cord blood (UCB) collections defined as ≥ 70mL of UCB after delayed cord clamping for 3min was applied. Second, to correlate the UCB volume to gestational age at birth, birth weight and sex.

Design

We conducted a multicentre, prospective, feasibility study in near-term infants delivered through caesarean section between November 2023 and December 2024. UCB was collected ex-utero, immediately after the placenta was removed from the womb.

Results

A total of 195 UCB collections were attempted. In 11 cases (5.6%), the attempt failed due to rupture of the umbilical cord or damaged placenta by removal of the placenta from the uterus. The median volume of the remaining 184 UCB collections was 72mL (IQR 56-86mL). In only 54% (100/184), the UCB volume reached the target volume of ≥ 70mL. We found that UCB volume was positively associated with birth weight (R² = 0.0813, F(1181) = 16.02, p value < 0.001) but not with gestational age at birth (R² = 0.0014, F(1181) = 0.2553, p value = 0.614).

Conclusions

A sufficient UCB volume (≥ 70mL) was obtained in approximately half of the attempts. A higher birth weight was associated with a larger volume of UCB collection.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 771: umbilical cord blood banking [^115qHAFd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Umbilical cord blood collection technique and counseling in obstetric care: To ensure adequate cells for transplantation, at least 40 mL of cord blood must be collected, and collection can be performed before or after removing the placenta; after cleansing a section of umbilical cord, blood is obtained from the umbilical vein by venipuncture and allowed to drain by gravity into a bag supplied by the bank. Blood should be collected as soon as feasible after birth to minimize coagulation and maximize volume, and if the specimen is not sterile or is not of sufficient quantity, the bank will discard it. Obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should be aware of state and local laws, and health care providers with a financial interest in private umbilical cord blood banking should disclose these interests, incentives, or other potential conflicts of interest; if a patient requests information, balanced and accurate information on public and private banking should be provided. Umbilical cord blood collection is not part of routine obstetric care, patients should be aware that delayed umbilical cord clamping significantly decreases the volume and total nucleated cell counts of cord blood donations, and umbilical cord blood collection should not compromise obstetric or neonatal care or alter routine practice of delayed umbilical cord clamping with the rare exception of medical indications for directed donation; therefore, it is important to inform patients that the medical condition of the woman or neonate may prevent adequate umbilical cord blood collection.

### Comparison between two strategies for umbilical cord blood collection [^113Z8N2t]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

The use of cord blood (CB) for transplantation has increased greatly in recent years. The collection strategy is the first step in collecting good-quality CB units. There are two main techniques for collecting CB from the umbilical vein: in the delivery room while the placenta is still in the uterus by midwives and obstetricians or in an adjacent room after placental delivery by CB bank trained personnel. In this study, the benefits and disadvantages between the two different CB collection strategies were evaluated, in order to improve CB bank methodology. Valencia CB bank maintains the two different collection strategies. CB was obtained from 569 vaginal and 70 caesarean deliveries and obstetrical and clinical charts were reviewed. Before processing CB units, volume was calculated and samples were drawn for cell counts. After processing and before cryopreservation samples were drawn for cell counts, CD34+cell analysis, viability, clonogenic assays and microbiology were drawn directly from the bags. We compared the efficiency of the two collection techniques. Obstetric data and umbilical CB were obtained from 569 vaginal (264 collected in utero and 305 collected ex utero) and 70 caesarean deliveries. The proportion of excluded CB units before processing was 33% for vaginal ex utero, 25% for vaginal in utero and 46% for caesarean deliveries. Differences were statistically significant. For vaginal deliveries a larger volume and a higher number of nucleated cells, percentage of CD34+ cells and colony-forming units (CFUs) were harvested in the in utero collection group. There was no statistical difference between CB collected after placental expulsion from vaginal and caesarean deliveries. Comparison between all vaginal and caesarean deliveries did not show any difference. We conclude that the mode of collection influences the haematopoietic content of CB donations. Collection before placental delivery is the best approach to CB collection and allows optimisation of CB bank methodology. Caesarean deliveries seem to contain similar progenitor content to vaginal deliveries.

### Cord blood banking for potential future transplantation [^114MYhZ9]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Informed consent and conflicts — timing and disclosure: The optimal time to obtain informed consent and to decide on public versus private cord blood banking is at the first prenatal visit in an unhurried environment, and parents should not be asked to make a decision after labor has begun. Disclosure of any medical personnel with conflicts of interest in cord blood collection should be made to the expectant family at this time, and a declaration of potential conflict of interest needs to be made to the institution in which the collection of cord blood cells is to be made.

Cord blood

Up to 40 mL of cord blood was collected from infant umbilical cords within 4 h post-delivery, either by directly dripping into EDTA tubes for normal deliveries, or extracted through a syringe for cords delivered through cesarean section deliveries, then stored in EDTA tubes. Blood samples were then centrifuged at 3000 g at 4 °C for 5 min to separate the blood into three distinct layers – plasma, buffy coat, and erythrocytes. The top plasma layer was then carefully extracted (without disturbing the buffy coat), followed by extraction of the buffy coat layer. The buffy coat was stored at −80 °C. DNA extraction from the buffy coat was performed using QIAsymphony DNA kits as per the manufacturer's instructions.

### Adiponectin levels in maternal serum and umbilical cord blood at birth by mode of delivery: relationship to anthropometric measurements and fetal sex [^113cqJVy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Blood collection & adiponectin measurement

Umbilical cord blood and maternal serum samples were collected without fasting after birth and within 24 h after delivery, respectively. Blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min and aliquots of serum were frozen without delay at − 70 °C until analysis. The concentration of adiponectin (μg/ml) was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using commercial kit (Human Adiponectin, Zell Bio GmbH, Ulm, Germany) according to the standard protocol from the manufacturer with a sensitivity of 0.1 μg / ml. The intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was 6.3%. A standardized checklist was utilized to gather anthropometric and laboratory data from mothers and infants.

Statistical analysis

Data are presented as mean (SD). A Mann-Whitney test was used to compare serum adiponectin levels in maternal and umbilical cord blood in different modes of delivery; and to determine the relationship between maternal adiponectin and umbilical cord blood with the baby's gender. Spearman correlation test was also utilized to determine the correlation between serum adiponectin levels in maternal and umbilical cord blood with anthropometric indices. P -value < 0.05 was considered as the significance level for all tests. The data were analyzed using SPSS (version 16, SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) software.

### Fetal blood sampling [^116TViaD]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Medium credibility.

Fetal blood sampling — sampling site at the placental cord insertion (PCI) versus free loop of cord indicates FBS is most commonly performed via the umbilical vein close to the PCI, but there are currently no published randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of these techniques. Advantages of PCI include relative stability and shorter procedure time, but a disadvantage is potential maternal blood contamination requiring confirmation of fetal origin, whereas free loop sampling avoids placental penetration yet may result in more bleeding and longer bleeding time. In one large study, PCI (n = 559) versus free loop (n = 1655) showed a shorter mean procedure duration in the PCI group (4.5 vs 6.7 minutes, P = 0.001) and lower maternal blood contamination in the free loop group (0.6% vs 2.3%, P = 0.001), with no differences in success rates, fetal bradycardia, or fetal loss between groups.

### Health care professionals' knowledge, attitudes and practices relating to umbilical cord blood banking and donation: an integrative review [^116oN2Sp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Parents today have the option to donate or to privately bank their infant's umbilical cord blood for use at a later date if therapeutic need arises. How parents come to make this decision is multi-factorial, and arguably significantly influenced by those caring for them during the antenatal period. This paper presents a discussion regarding umbilical cord blood banking and donation with a review of the published literature addressing the knowledge, attitudes and practices of health care professionals involved with pregnant women and their families during the perinatal period.

Umbilical cord blood banking is the process of collecting and storing umbilical cord blood, in the immediate period after the birth of a baby. Umbilical cord tissue banking is the process of collecting and storing a small segment of the umbilical cord after the delivery of the placenta.

For the past 25 years cord blood has been used as an alternative to bone marrow for treatment of blood, immune system and metabolic disorders because of its rich source of haematopoietic stem cells. Cord blood stem cell transplants are now an approved therapy for over 80 medical conditions. Cord tissue is a rich source of mesenchymal stem cells which show great potential for use in regenerative medicine. There are many clinical trials underway investigating the benefit of haematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells for neurological and autoimmune disorders such as Cerebral Palsy, Autism and Type 1 Diabetes.

As a result, cord blood banking is a growing phenomenon, with an increasing number of cord blood units being collected and stored. The first public cord blood bank opened in New York in 1993. Currently, an international network of 158 public cord blood banks in 36 countries, houses over 731 000 umbilical cord blood units. To date, public cord blood banks do not collect and store cord tissue. Private cord blood banking has had the most rapid rise in uptake. There are currently 207 private cord blood banks which have been established in 54 countries, marketing services to a further 35 countries. Over one million cord blood units have been stored privately and the growth rate is estimated to be approximately 12–15% per annum. Since 2008, many private banks also collect and store cord tissue.

### Obstetric predictors of placental / umbilical cord blood volume for transplantation [^116ZxghB]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Umbilical cord blood is an effective alternative to bone marrow as a source of hematopoietic stem cells in transplantation. However, the amount of donor blood and the cell content that are collected may be insufficient for engraftment in some adult recipients. This study identifies obstetric factors that affect retrievable placental cord blood volume.

Study Design

A retrospective analysis of factors that were obtained by direct observation or medical record review that were related to harvested cord blood volume was conducted; the analysis involved 9205 deliveries from mothers who donated placental cord blood through the obstetric services of two New York City hospitals between 1993 and 1999.

Results

Obstetric factors that influenced significantly the total volume of blood that was collected were route of delivery, induction of labor, presence of a nuchal cord, infant birth weight, multiple births, placental weight, and duration of labor. The length of the umbilical cord from the venipuncture site and the length of time to cord blood collection also affected the volume that was retrieved. Maternal ethnicity was associated with cord blood yield; Caucasian mothers provided larger quantities than either African American or Asian mothers.

Conclusion

Our results confirm that the volume of residual placental cord blood that is collected for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is influenced by several factors, the presence of which predict the likelihood of an adequate collection. Collected volumes can be improved when a longer length of the cord is left with the placenta and when there is a shorter time between the delivery of the placenta and the collection.

### A comprehensive study of umbilical cord blood cell developmental changes and reference ranges by gestation, gender and mode of delivery [^111QVjaS]. Journal of Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the normal hematological values in cord blood during gestation, the impact of the type of delivery and differences in gender.

Study Design

The database included 10287 live births of 30–44 weeks gestation from cesarean or vaginal deliveries. Cord blood was collected into bags containing lyophilized heparin. Specimens were stored for 24h or less and analyzed using the SysmexXE-2100. Data from cesarean births were used to evaluate developmental hematopoietic changes.

Result

Increases during maturation occurred in hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, and decreases in mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin. The number of nucleated red blood cells per 100 white blood cells decreased but absolute counts remained constant. Quantitative counts of white blood cells, neutrophils, monocytes (MON), eosinophils and lymphocytes (LYMP) increased, but percentages of lymphocytes and monocytes decreased. Platelets increased from 30–35 weeks.

Conclusion

Reference ranges were established for cord blood. Erythroid and myeloid cells show developmental changes. Mode of delivery has a significant effect on hematologic values. Only a rare parameter showed differences based on gender. The cord blood complete blood cell count has the potential for providing relevant clinical information for managing neonatal patients.

### A pilot study to understand feasibility and acceptability of stool and cord blood sample collection for a large-scale longitudinal birth cohort [^114MCx41]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study provides evidence about biological sample collection rates from women in late pregnancy, at around the time of delivery and from their babies, and provides insight into whether or not women feel comfortable with sample collection. Overall, sample collection success was good, with 66% (113/171) of women recruited providing at least one sample and most reporting that they found the study acceptable.

In general, samples were more likely to be provided when delivery was by planned pre-labour caesarean section (except maternal stool), probably because pre-labour caesarean sections were easier to plan and prepare for, as the time of delivery was known in advance. The Monday to Friday working pattern of the study's research midwives may also have impacted on sample collection success; 54% of women who consented to participate delivered outside of normal office hours. A major constraint on sample collection may therefore have been this practical issue rather than a lack of willingness from women having vaginal deliveries. This is reflected in both the percent of those approached who consented to participate (171/265, 65%) and in generally high levels of acceptability for most samples in responses to pre-sample questionnaires.

The collection rate for maternal stool samples was low at 31%. This may have been due in part to our deliberate selection of women who delivered by planned pre-labour caesarean section, from whom fewer stool samples were collected, probably because passing of stool during C-section delivery is unlikely. Since fewer deliveries would be by caesarean section in a population-based study, we anticipate that maternal stool sample collection may be higher in our main study.

It was encouraging that the proportion of women from whom cord blood was collected was high (79%), despite the fact that cord blood banking was given precedence over our own sample collection. In the absence of cord blood banking, samples could potentially be collected from a higher number of participants, and/or larger volumes obtained.

### A pilot study to understand feasibility and acceptability of stool and cord blood sample collection for a large-scale longitudinal birth cohort [^114sjMmS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Of 265 women approached, 171 (65%) of women consented to participate and 113 (66%) of these women gave at least one sample (Fig. 1). Seventeen women consented to participate but did not provide any samples or complete a pre-sample questionnaire.

Fig. 1
Study recruitment and sample collection

The mean age of women who consented to participate was 34 years. Women were primarily of white ethnicity (130/166, 78%) and half were nulliparous (86/169, 51%) (Table 1). Among 168 women where mode of delivery was recorded, 57% delivered vaginally (unassisted or instrumental), nearly one third (29%) by planned pre-labour caesarean section, and 15% by intrapartum caesarean section. For 140 women who consented to participate and where information on day and time of birth were recorded, approximately half delivered outside of normal office hours (75/140, 54%).

Table 1
Demographic characteristics of women who consented to participate, and the proportion providing ≥ 1 sample

a In participants where data were available

Women who delivered by planned pre-labour caesarean section were most likely to provide at least one sample (98%) and those delivering by unassisted spontaneous vaginal (50%) or ventouse were least likely (50%) to provide a sample (Table 1). In 110 women who provided at least one sample and where information on day and time of birth were recorded, 47% (52/110) delivered outside of normal office hours. We observed no significant difference between whether a sample was given and maternal age (p = 0.09, continuous variable), ethnicity (p = 0.56) or parity (p = 1.00), although we note the relatively small sample size in this pilot study, which may have been underpowered to detect any difference.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for umbilical cord management, more specifically with respect to timing of cord clamping, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to delayed umbilical cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds after delivery of a stable infant to reduce neonatal anemia, recognizing that it slightly increases the risk of hyperbilirubinemia and polycythemia.

### Postnatal cord blood sampling: clinical report [^115Uw9xJ]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Postnatal cord blood sampling (PCBS) — procedural approaches and feasibility after delayed cord clamping (DCC) — can be performed by phlebotomy of the cord attached to the placenta or by isolating and drawing from a ~ 30 cm segment of blood-filled umbilical cord, and one study demonstrated that PCBS can be obtained approximately 95% of the time with the first success rate unaffected by DCC. Clinical conditions such as placental abruption and severe intrauterine growth restriction may affect placental blood volume, and once the cord is clamped, ideally after DCC, the clamp needs to remain on the cord or be replaced with a disposable clamp until PCBS is performed to ensure optimal volume.

Umbilical cord blood banking — delayed umbilical cord clamping significantly decreased the volume and total nucleated cell counts of cord blood donations, with the proportion of units meeting initial screening decreasing from 39% with immediate umbilical cord clamping to 17% in cases with a 60-second delay; immediate cord clamping may increase yield when a patient and family are planning donation, but in the absence of directed donation the benefits to the infant of transfusion of additional blood volume at birth likely exceed the benefits of banking that volume, and families considering banking should be counseled accordingly.

### Adiponectin levels in maternal serum and umbilical cord blood at birth by mode of delivery: relationship to anthropometric measurements and fetal sex [^112JPEUJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The rate of cesarean section is increasing worldwide. Adiponectin is a hormone related to anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effects; and it′s concentrations may change in response to inflammatory situations including surgical intervention. The aim of the current study was to investigate serum adiponectin levels in maternal and umbilical cord blood according to different modes of delivery and their relationship with anthropometric measurements and fetal sex.

Methods

The study population initially comprised 90 healthy pregnant women referred to the teaching hospital. Eventually, 40 participants in the vaginal delivery group and 35 subjects in the cesarean delivery group were recruited in to the study. Umbilical cord blood and maternal serum samples were analyzed according to the standard protocol from the manufacturer. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS-16 software. P -value < 0.05 was considered as the significance level for all tests.

Results

Our results indicated a significant association between maternal adiponectin and the mode of delivery, with adiponectin levels significantly higher in vaginal delivery compared to cesarean section (P < 0.001). However, no difference was found in umbilical cord blood adiponectin between the two groups (P = 0.51). A significant positive correlation was found between maternal serum adiponectin in the first day after birth and umbilical cord blood adiponectin in the vaginal delivery group (P = 0.007). Nevertheless, this correlation was not statistically significant in the cesarean delivery group (P = 0.62). There was also no significant correlation between fetal sex and anthropometric measurements with maternal adiponectin (P = 0.44) and umbilical cord blood adiponectin (P = 0.86).

Conclusions

The result of the current study revealed that maternal adiponectin concentration was significantly higher in vaginal delivery compared to cesarean section, which might be due to the increased levels of maternal adiponectin release during labor.

### Influence of mode of delivery on cytokine expression in cord blood [^116HS8bR]. Human Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

The mode of delivery is a known risk factor for immune-related disorders. Normal term vaginal delivery is an inflammatory process and several cytokines are suggested to be involved. The purpose of the study was to evaluate differences in cord blood cytokine expression between modes of delivery in term-born children. Cord blood was collected from 49 elective Caesarean section (C-section) cases and from 49 normal vaginal term deliveries. Plasma was tested for 17 cytokines with Bio-Plex®-200-system. Mann-Whitney test was used for comparing the groups with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Four cytokines showed significant differences between the modes of delivery. Interleukin-6, Interleukin-8 showed a significantly higher expression in the vaginal delivery group, while Tumor-Necrosis Factor-a, Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor showed a significantly higher level of expression in the C-section cord blood. Our study shows that there is differential expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in elective C-section compared with normal term vaginal delivery.

### Umbilical cord blood hematological parameters reference interval for newborns from addis ababa, Ethiopia [^116xrWVp]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Reference intervals (RIs) aid in the interpretation of laboratory data in patient management, clinical trials, and selection of eligible participants for vaccine trials. These values are affected by several factors including age, sex, race, geographical location and dietary pattern. A wealth of published studies demonstrated the age related changes in hematological parameters. Neonates exhibit profound quantitative as well as qualitative hematologic differences compared to older children and adults. At birth, hematological parameters of term newborns are significantly higher than those of older children and adults. Thus, it is inappropriate to use adult reference ranges for the assessment of pediatric blood.

On the other hand, utilizing a reference interval obtained from somewhere else to a population of interest could potentially lead to inappropriate patient management and unnecessary use of resources. Cord blood hematological parameters reference intervals are vital in neonatal care and transplantation medicine. Cord blood is a blood collected from long and helical cord that connects the fetus with the mother for substances exchange. Establishing normal neonatal reference interval has been difficult because of drawing blood from healthy neonates. Challenges of getting ethical approval for this vulnerable group and consent from the mothers also explain why limited RIs established from cord blood. Moreover, apart from the neonates other maternal factors are also needed to be considered.

According to different studies, maternal anemia had effect on cord blood hemoglobin and newborn weight, although it has been reported that routine hematological values of newborns are independent to that of maternal hematological values. A likely explanation given by those stating the dependency on maternal status is the high micronutrient intake inadequacy during pregnancy. Maternal factors like smoking habit, heavily drinking alcohol, medical problems like diabetic mellitus, eclampsia, hypertension and mode of delivery and frequency of pregnancy affect the hematological profile of neonates. Delayed cord clamping and umbilical cord milking also affect hematological parameters. Otherwise, cord blood collection is a safe way to collect sample compared to cannula and other vascular catheters which cause thrombophlebitis, infection, and extravasation. Thus, in the current study we used cord blood collection method.

In spite of the fact that reference intervals can play an important role in guiding the assessment of hematological changes in neonatal care, there is no published reference interval for hematological parameters in cord blood of Ethiopians except some earlier efforts from Central Ethiopia and recently from Northwest. This study aimed at providing such intervals for cord blood samples from Addis Ababa.

### Effect of prenatal EPA and DHA on maternal and umbilical cord blood cytokines [^113H16Ye]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Sample collection and biochemical assessment

We obtained venous blood after a four hour fast. Fetal cord blood was collected at delivery. Cord blood was obtained after severance of the umbilical cord by passive flow of mixed arterial and venous blood into EDTA-containing tubes. All blood samples were processed by centrifugation within 12 h of collection and the resultant plasma was stored at − 80 °C. Multiplex immunoassays for cytokines IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IFNγ, MCP-1, TNFα, and TNFβ were performed on plasma samples using the Q-Plex™ Human Cytokine - Screen IR (16-plex), a fully quantitative ELISA-based Infrared (IR) assay system (Quansys Biosciences, Logan, UT).

Serum EPA and DHA, had been previously assayed from sample collection of maternal and cord blood into red top non-additive tubes at the same time points, with DHA and EPA being evaluated as a measure of compliance. As we have previously reported, supplementation with the DHA-rich fish oil significantly increased serum DHA levels in maternal and cord blood. Similarly, supplementation with EPA-rich fish oil significantly increased maternal serum EPA fraction but not cord blood EPA. These variables were available from prior study to evaluate as predictors of maternal and cord blood plasma cytokine levels.

Ethics

The procedures followed were approved and conducted in accordance with the institutional review boards of the University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, MI, St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ypsilanti, MI, and The University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Human Research Protections Office. All subjects gave written informed consent to participate in the study.

### Fetal blood sampling [^1118CYLK]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to review indications, technical aspects, risks, and recommendations for fetal blood sampling (FBS).

Methods

A systematic review was performed using MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library using the terms "fetal blood sampling", "percutaneous umbilical blood sampling", and "cordocentesis". The search was restricted to English-language articles published from 1966 through July 2012. Priority was given to articles reporting original research, in particular randomized controlled trials, although review articles and commentaries also were consulted. Abstracts of research presented at symposia and scientific conferences were not considered adequate for inclusion in this document. Evidence reports and guidelines published by organizations or institutions such as the National Institutes of Health, Agency for Health Research and Quality, American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine were also reviewed, and additional studies were located by reviewing bibliographies of identified articles. Grade (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology was employed for defining strength of recommendations and rating quality of evidence. Consistent with US Preventive Task Force guidelines, references were evaluated for quality based on the highest level of evidence.

Results and Recommendations

Ultrasound-guided FBS is the only procedure that provides direct access to the fetal circulation. When invasive testing is planned for suspected severe fetal anemia or thrombocytopenia, we recommend FBS as the procedure of choice, with availability of immediate transfusion if confirmed. We recommend against the use of FBS for indications in which other less invasive, and therefore lower risk, alternatives are available. The overall success rate of FBS is high, and blood samples can be obtained in > 98% of patients. We suggest that counseling for FBS include discussion about the potential risk of FBS that may include, but may not be limited to: bleeding from puncture site (20–30%); fetal bradycardia (5–10%); pregnancy loss (≥ 1.3%, depending on indication, gestational age, and placental penetration); and vertical transmission of hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus. We recommend that FBS be performed by experienced operators at centers with expertise in invasive fetal procedures when feasible.

### ACOG clinical practice update: an update to clinical guidance for delayed umbilical cord clamping after birth in preterm neonates [^112x9bgE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for umbilical cord management, more specifically with respect to umbilical cord milking, ACOG 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing umbilical cord milking as an alternative to immediate cord clamping in preterm neonates born at 28 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks of gestation who do not receive deferred cord clamping to improve neonatal hematologic outcomes.

### Evidence-based advances in transfusion practice in neonatal intensive care units [^117754Mn]. Neonatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Transfusions to neonates convey both benefits and risks, and evidence is needed to guide wise use. Such evidence is accumulating, but more information is needed to generate sound evidence-based practices.

Objective

We sought to analyze published information on nine aspects of transfusion practice in neonatal intensive care units.

Methods

We assigned 'categories of evidence' and 'recommendations' using the format of the United States Preventive Services Task Force of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Results

The nine practices studied were: (1) delayed clamping or milking of the umbilical cord at preterm delivery - recommended, high/substantial A; (2) drawing the initial blood tests from cord/placental blood from very low birth weight (VLBW, < 1,500 g) infants at delivery - recommended, moderate/moderate B; (3) limiting phlebotomy losses of VLBW infants - recommended, moderate/substantial B; (4) selected use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to prevent transfusions - recommended, moderate/moderate-moderate/small B, C; (5) using platelet mass, rather than platelet count, in platelet transfusion decisions - recommended, moderate/small C; (6) permitting the platelet count to fall to < 20,000/µl in 'stable' neonates before transfusing platelets - recommended, low/small I; (8) permitting the platelet count to fall to < 50,000/µl in 'unstable' neonates before transfusing platelets - recommended, moderate/small C, and (9) not performing routine coagulation test screening on every VLBW infant - recommended, moderate/small C.

Conclusions

We view these recommendations as dynamic, to be revised as additional evidence becomes available. We predict this list will expand as new studies provide more information to guide best transfusion practices.

### Maternity health professionals' perspectives of cord clamp timing, cord blood banking and cord blood donation: a qualitative study [^114GQ3XY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Parents today have several options for the management of their infant's cord blood during the third stage of labour. Parents can choose to have their infant's cord clamped early or to have deferred cord clamping. If the cord is clamped early, cord blood can be collected for private cord blood banking or public cord blood donation for use later if needed. If cord clamping is deferred, the placental blood physiologically transfuses to the neonate and there are physiological advantages to this. These benefits include a smoother cardiovascular transition and increased haemoglobin levels while not interfering with the practice of collecting cord blood for gases if needed. The aim of this study is to explore Australian maternity health professionals' perspectives towards cord clamp timing, cord blood banking and cord blood donation.

Methods

Fourteen maternity health professionals (midwives and obstetricians) from both private and public practice settings in Australia participated in semi-structured interviews either in person or by telephone. Interviews were transcribed and data analysed using thematic analysis.

Results

Overall there was strong support for deferred cord clamping, and this was seen as important and routinely discussed with parents as part of antenatal care. However, support did not extend to the options of cord blood banking and donation and to routinely informing parents of these options even when these were available at their birthing location.

Conclusion

Formalised education for maternity health professionals is needed about the benefits and implications of cord blood banking and cord blood donation so that they have the confidence to openly discuss all options of cord clamp timing, cord blood banking and cord blood donation to facilitate informed decision-making by parents.

### Physiological-based cord clamping: when the baby is ready for clamping [^114VFG4v]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Debate about the consequences of umbilical cord clamping at birth and its optimal timing has been ongoing throughout history. Over the centuries, both well-known and lesser-known historical figures have indicated that immediate cord clamping after birth might not be in the best interest of the newborn. While waiting to clamp the cord has been, and still is, commonly practiced by some midwives and obstetricians, it is not entirely clear when or why early cord clamping became the standard of care worldwide. Early cord clamping was incorporated into clinical guidelines as part of active management of the third stage of labor to reduce the risk of maternal blood loss after birth. However, this occurred despite a significant reduction in infant birth weight after immediate clamping and a meta-analysis showing no difference in maternal blood loss between early and late cord clamping. But even before guidance around active management of the third stage of labor, early cord clamping became the standard of care in the early 20th century which also coincided with an increase in hospital births.

It took some time before the policy of immediate cord clamping was corrected. Studies in the 1960s found that delaying cord clamping resulted in higher blood volumes in newborns, suggesting that blood is transferred from the placenta into the infant (placental transfusion), which was confirmed by meta-analyses showing an increase in birth weight. Other meta-analyses over the last 2 decades have shown that delaying cord clamping (by at least 30 s) compared to immediate cord clamping (0–30 s) provides significant health benefits for (near) term newborns. These include higher birth weight and hematocrit and lower incidence of anemia and iron deficiency. For preterm infants, there was a greater chance of survival, higher hematocrit with fewer blood transfusions, and a trend toward fewer brain hemorrhages. This led to the recommendation in international guidelines to wait at least 60 s before clamping the cord in newborns who do not require assistance with breathing, whereas if stabilization or resuscitation is necessary, immediate cord clamping is recommended. In addition, the latest meta-analysis comparing different clamping strategies demonstrated the effect on increased survival was greatest when clamping was delayed by 2 min or longer.

### Effect of timing of umbilical cord clamping of term infants on maternal and neonatal outcomes [^117XNpgT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Policies for timing of cord clamping vary, with early cord clamping generally carried out in the first 60 seconds after birth, whereas later cord clamping usually involves clamping the umbilical cord more than one minute after the birth or when cord pulsation has ceased. The benefits and potential harms of each policy are debated.

Objectives

To determine the effects of early cord clamping compared with late cord clamping after birth on maternal and neonatal outcomes

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (13 February 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing early and late cord clamping.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 15 trials involving a total of 3911 women and infant pairs. We judged the trials to have an overall moderate risk of bias. Maternal outcomes: No studies in this review reported on maternal death or on severe maternal morbidity. There were no significant differences between early versus late cord clamping groups for the primary outcome of severe postpartum haemorrhage (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.65; five trials with data for 2066 women with a late clamping event rate (LCER) of ~3.5%, I² 0%) or for postpartum haemorrhage of 500 mL or more (RR 1.17 95% CI 0.94 to 1.44; five trials, 2260 women with a LCER of ~12%, I(2) 0%). There were no significant differences between subgroups depending on the use of uterotonic drugs. Mean blood loss was reported in only two trials with data for 1345 women, with no significant differences seen between groups; or for maternal haemoglobin values (mean difference (MD) -0.12 g/dL; 95% CI -0.30 to 0.06, I(2) 0%) at 24 to 72 hours after the birth in three trials. Neonatal outcomes: There were no significant differences between early and late clamping for the primary outcome of neonatal mortality (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.41, two trials, 381 infants with a LCER of ~1%), or for most other neonatal morbidity outcomes, such as Apgar score less than seven at five minutes or admission to the special care nursery or neonatal intensive care unit. Mean birthweight was significantly higher in the late, compared with early, cord clamping (101 g increase 95% CI 45 to 157, random-effects model, 12 trials, 3139 infants, I² 62%). Fewer infants in the early cord clamping group required phototherapy for jaundice than in the late cord clamping group (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.96, data from seven trials, 2324 infants with a LCER of 4.36%, I(2) 0%). Haemoglobin concentration in infants at 24 to 48 hours was significantly lower in the early cord clamping group (MD -1.49 g/dL, 95% CI -1.78 to -1.21; 884 infants, I² 59%). This difference in haemoglobin concentration was not seen at subsequent assessments. However, improvement in iron stores appeared to persist, with infants in the early cord clamping over twice as likely to be iron deficient at three to six months compared with infants whose cord clamping was delayed (RR 2.65 95% CI 1.04 to 6.73, five trials, 1152 infants, I² 82%). In the only trial to report longer-term neurodevelopmental outcomes so far, no overall differences between early and late clamping were seen for Ages and Stages Questionnaire scores.

Authors' Conclusions

A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants. Delayed cord clamping is likely to be beneficial as long as access to treatment for jaundice requiring phototherapy is available.

### Effect of delayed versus immediate umbilical cord clamping in vaginal delivery at term: a randomized clinical trial [^113o9gj6]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

2.4 Randomization and masking

Eligible participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either immediate or delayed cord clamping. Women were randomized by a web‐based system, and the randomization sequence was prepared by an independent statistician. The recruiters and the trial coordinator did not have access to the randomization sequence. The trial was open‐label given the nature of the interventions.

Women were approached by the research staff and counseled about the trial at the time of active stage of labor in case of spontaneous onset of labor. At that time eligible women received a complete blood count with hemoglobin level assessment. Eligible women who agreed to take part in the study were randomized at the time of delivery of the baby in case of spontaneous vaginal delivery.

2.5 Sample size calculation

Calculation of the sample size was based on the following consideration: a mean ± standard deviation change in hemoglobin level for spontaneous vaginal delivery of −0.9 ± 1.0 g/dl with immediate cord clampingand of 1.5 g/dl with delayed cord clamping group, and an anticipated 20% crossover rate from delayed to immediate cord clamping. Based on these considerations, setting a power of 80% to detect a significant greater drop in postdelivery day 1 maternal hemoglobin level, with a two‐sided type 1 error of 5%, a sample size of 122 participants was planned.

2.6 Statistical analysis

Data are shown as means, or as number (percentage). Univariate comparisons of dichotomous data were performed with the use of the χ² test with continuity correction. Comparisons between groups were performed with the use of the t test to test group means by assuming equal within‐group variances.

The primary analysis was an intention‐to‐treat comparison of the treatment assigned at randomization. The effect of immediate or delayed cord clamping on each outcome was quantified as relative risk or as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

A two‐sided P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19.0 (IBM Inc.).

### Health care professionals' knowledge, attitudes and practices relating to umbilical cord blood banking and donation: an integrative review [^114ws2kL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Obstetricians

Attitudes and perceptions

Unlike the midwives discussed by Machin and colleagues, the obstetricians surveyed by Tada and colleagues were generally accommodating of cord blood collection. Over two thirds (n = 26, 68.4%) reported that cord blood collection in addition to their routine obstetric care did not place pressure on them, with only a few participants indicating that the consent process and collection documentation was extra work and time consuming. Roh and colleagues reported that 21% of obstetricians (n = 12/57) indicated that cord blood collection distracted the labour process, and 15.8% (n = 9/57) were concerned about delayed bleeding control as a maternal risk, especially in caesarean deliveries. One obstetrician reported concerns about the risk to the baby, but did not specify details. The majority of obstetricians surveyed by Tada and colleagues (n = 32, 84%) though believed cord blood collection was a safe procedure and did not pose a threat to women before or after delivery.

Practices

Midwives and maternity nurses

Education role

No papers investigated the role of midwives and maternity nurses in patient education on cord blood banking, although two papers briefly acknowledged their key role in antenatal education. Duffy and colleagues outlined midwives' responsibility for providing a large volume of information to pregnant women, often requiring explanations and discussions so that patients are able to make informed choices about their care. Moustafa and Youness also briefly examined the maternity nurse role in education for pregnant women. Over half of the study participants (n = 81, 54%) found that the time required to educate antenatal women on cord blood banking was one of the barriers to providing this education.

Practices

In response to concerns about risk associated with cord blood collection, Duffy and colleagues conducted a risk assessment to investigate if cord blood collection interfered with labour outcome. Three groups of cord blood collection methods were analyzed: in-utero (n = 25), ex-utero (n = 21), and no collection (n = 15). In-utero collection occurs after the birth of the baby but before the delivery of the placenta. Ex-utero collection occurs after the baby and the placenta have been delivered. No difference was recorded between the three groups in maternal blood loss, timing of cord clamping to placental delivery, infant APGAR scores and time of discharge from labour ward.

### Committee opinion no.543: timing of umbilical cord clamping after birth [^115HDpB6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

The optimal timing for clamping the umbilical cord after birth has been a subject of controversy and debate. Although many randomized controlled trials in term and preterm infants have evaluated the benefits of delayed umbilical cord clamping versus immediate umbilical cord clamping, the ideal timing for cord clamping has yet to be established. Several systematic reviews have suggested that clamping the umbilical cord in all births should be delayed for at least 30–60 seconds, with the infant maintained at or below the level of the placenta because of the associated neonatal benefits, including increased blood volume, reduced need for blood transfusion, decreased incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in preterm infants, and lower frequency of iron deficiency anemia in term infants. Evidence exists to support delayed umbilical cord clamping in preterm infants, when feasible. The single most important clinical benefit for preterm infants is the possibility for a nearly 50% reduction in intraventricular hemorrhage. However, currently, evidence is insufficient to confirm or refute the potential for benefits from delayed umbilical cord clamping in term infants, especially in settings with rich resources.

### Storage of placental blood – A feasibility study for development of a fetal blood bank [^1179oRUh]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Neonates transfused with adult donor blood (rich in HbA) have a precipitous drop in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels. This study evaluates the feasibility of collection and storage of placental cord blood.

Methods

Prospective study patients with uncomplicated term pregnancies undergoing scheduled cesarean section were recruited from July 2022 - December 2023. Cord blood was collected after delivery for processing and storage in our institutional blood bank. Samples were analyzed at 0, 7, 14, and 21 days.

Results

Thirty patients were recruited (55% Caucasian with median maternal age 34 years, gestational age 39 weeks, birth weight 3.48 kg). Median collection volume was 83 mL; 8 collections were excluded due to inadequate volume. The median hemolysis was 0.10% on Day 0 and 0.23% on Day 21 with median loss 2.5%. Median biochemical storage lesion at 21 days was within expectations (24.5 mmol/L potassium, 71.2 mg/dL free hemoglobin, pH 6.38, LDH 191 IU/L). All day 21 blood cultures were negative. Hemoglobin fractions remained unchanged between 0 and 21 days (16.2–17.8% HbA and 83.8–82.2% HbF).

Conclusion

Placental cord blood can be safely collected, processed, and stored for 21 days as a potential autologous blood product for neonates.

### Maternity health professionals' perspectives of cord clamp timing, cord blood banking and cord blood donation: a qualitative study [^113VYBoq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Parents today have several available options for the management of their infant's umbilical cord blood during the third stage of labour: physiological transfusion of blood from placenta to newborn; banking of the cord blood for private use; or donation of cord blood for public banks to be used for therapeutic use in conditions of the blood and the immune system.

The timing of cord clamping after birth has been controversial for decades, although in recent years there has been a growing interest from health professionals and professional bodies in the physiology of placental transfusion and the optimal time to clamp the umbilical cord. Interdisciplinary international guidelines now recommend deferred cord clamping for a minimum of 1 min after the birth of the infant. This renewed interest and focus on cord clamping is the result of research surrounding the benefits to the infant associated with the timing of cord clamping at birth. These include a more stable cardiovascular transition, increased haemoglobin level at birth, increased iron stores for up to 6 months of age, improved fine motor and social domain scores at age 4 years, and no interference with the collection of valid cord blood gas samples.

Advances in scientific knowledge and the introduction of new technologies into the clinical arena increasingly challenge health professionals' knowledge and traditional practices. Knowledge of the value of full placental transfusion and the unique properties of cord blood stem cells could be argued to be the foundations upon which health professionals should develop their practices relating to third stage labour management, and the options that are subsequently provided to parents. In addition, the timing of cord clamping impacts the volume of blood for collection and banking purposes. Several studies have investigated maternity health professionals' knowledge, attitudes and practices pertaining to third stage labour options for parents internationally. However, there is a paucity of knowledge regarding health professionals' knowledge, perspectives and practices towards third stage labour options in the Australian context. Therefore, a gap exists in understanding health professionals' knowledge of, and perspectives towards, current third stage labour options for parents and their practice of informing parents of these options. An explanatory mixed methods study involving sequential data collection in two phases (a cross-sectional survey and interviews) was recently conducted in Australia to explore maternity health professionals' knowledge, perspectives, self-reported practices and their perspectives, of cord clamp timing, cord blood banking and cord blood donation for term infants. The survey study will be reported in detail, elsewhere.

This study described herein aimed to explore Australian health professionals' perspectives of cord clamp timing, cord blood banking and cord blood donation for term infants.

### Placental cord drainage and its outcomes at third stage of labor: a randomized controlled trial [^115dUKPq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The third stage of labor begins with the newborn's birth and ends with the delivery of the placenta and embryonic membranes. Currently, the usual method of managing the third stage of labor is that both sides of the umbilical cord are clamped and cut, then wait for signs of placental separation; in this time, the common practice is to deliver the placenta with the Brandt-Andrews maneuver. The prolongation of the third stage of labor, placental retention, and subsequent issues such as postpartum hemorrhage, manual removal of the placenta, general anesthesia, and blood transfusions have some adverse outcomes, which eventually might affect the positive experience of a delivery. Accordingly, researchers have been trying to manage the third stage of labor and to recommend the most effective and least risky management method. Based on several suggestions, placental drainage is one of the methods proposed to facilitate placental expulsion. In the drainage method, the clamp at the mother's side is opened, and the blood of the placenta and the umbilical cord is drained. The drainage of the blood reduces the volume of the placenta, allows the uterus to contract and return to its original state faster, and may reduce the length of the third stage.

Few studies have been published about placental drainage. An early randomized study using placenta drainage as a method of placental delivery reported that it significantly reduced the duration of the third stage of labor in vaginal deliveries. Later on, a study confirmed that placental drainage of fetal blood before spontaneous placental delivery significantly reduced the incidence of fetomaternal transfusion in cesarean section. Also, more recent studies indicated benefits for placenta drainage as a part of active management after the third stage of labor after spontaneous vaginal delivery. For instance, a study showed a significant reduction in postpartum blood loss and the duration of the third stage in normal vaginal birth. In contrast, a recent study reported that placental cord drainage had no effect in reducing duration or blood loss during the third stage of labor.

However, a review suggested that further studies are needed to reach a definitive conclusion. The review indicated the most important shortcomings to address were the lack of attention to the similarity of the groups studied and the lack of detailed explanation of the method in which the study was conducted. Therefore, we designed this clinical trial to evaluate the effect of placental drainage on the duration of the third stage of labor and determine the safety of this method in terms of retained placenta, the manual removal of the placenta, and postpartum hemorrhage.

### Effect of prenatal EPA and DHA on maternal and umbilical cord blood cytokines [^114v8uKT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Investigators have hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may modulate the immune response. However, available evidence is conflicting. We performed this study to investigate the effect of prenatal eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)- and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-rich fish oil supplementation on maternal and fetal cytokine production.

Methods

This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial designed to assess whether prenatal EPA- or DHA-rich fish oil supplementation would prevent perinatal depressive symptoms among women at risk. Enrolled participants received EPA-rich fish oil (1060 mg EPA plus 274 mg DHA), DHA-rich fish oil (900 mg DHA plus 180 mg EPA) or soy oil placebo. Maternal venous blood was collected at enrollment (12–20 weeks gestation) and after supplementation (34–36 weeks gestation). Umbilical cord blood was collected at delivery. We analyzed stored plasma specimens for 16 human cytokines using multiplex immunoassays. Maternal and cord blood cytokine levels were compared among the treatment groups. Associations of serum DHA and EPA with maternal and cord blood cytokines were explored via regression analysis.

Results

We enrolled 126 women, of whom 118 completed the trial. Prenatal supplementation with EPA-rich fish oil significantly lowered maternal IL6, IL15, and TNFα concentrations. However, supplementation with DHA-rich fish oil had no significant effect on maternal cytokine profiles. Maternal serum DHA fraction was significantly associated with IL1α, and maternal serum DHA and EPA fractions were significantly associated with IL 10 concentrations after supplementation. Compared with placebo, supplementation with EPA- or DHA-rich fish oils had no significant effect on cord blood cytokine concentrations.

Conclusions

Prenatal supplementation with EPA-rich fish oil significantly reduced levels of several inflammatory cytokines in maternal plasma, while prenatal DHA-rich fish oil had no significant effect on cytokine concentrations. Supplementation with EPA- and DHA- rich fish oil had no significant effect on umbilical cord blood cytokine concentrations.

### Time to implement delayed cord clamping [^1161sQUC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Immediate umbilical cord clamping after delivery is routine in the United States despite little evidence to support this practice. Numerous trials in both term and preterm neonates have demonstrated the safety and benefit of delayed cord clamping. In premature neonates, delayed cord clamping has been shown to stabilize transitional circulation, lessening needs for inotropic medications and reducing blood transfusions, necrotizing enterocolitis, and intraventricular hemorrhage. In term neonates, delayed cord clamping has been associated with decreased iron-deficient anemia and increased iron stores with potential valuable effects that extend beyond the newborn period, including improvements in long-term neurodevelopment. The failure to more broadly implement delayed cord clamping in neonates ignores published benefits of increased placental blood transfusion at birth and may represent an unnecessary harm for vulnerable neonates.

### Antitetanus toxoid antibodies in mothers and neonates: a single-centre study from Uganda [^116Ghf8o]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design and setting

We conducted a cross-sectional study at KNRH from 1 February to 31 March 2020. KNRH is a teaching hospital for Makerere University School of Medicine. Specimen processing and experiments were performed at the Immunology Laboratory of the Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University College of Health Sciences.

Study setting

Uganda is one of the countries that administers booster TT/tetanus diphtheria (TD) doses for girls and women of reproductive age (15–49 years)and TT/TD remains a mandatory vaccine given to all pregnant women attending ANC visits. KNRH is a level 5 hospital which has delivery rooms and operating theatres. Mothers in labour are triaged at admission and only mothers in active labour are admitted in the delivery rooms. Those that needed emergency caesarean sections are transferred to theatre for surgery. The hospital is about 6.4 km from the central business district. The hospital is open 24 hours, 7 days a week. An average of 70–100 mothers are delivered daily and 30 000 babies annually with a caesarean section rate of 22%. The mothers who deliver within this labour suite are often referred from lower-level facilities due to complicated/high-risk pregnancies or difficult deliveries.

Sample size and sampling

We calculated a sample size of 293 mother-baby pairs using the formula for sample size of a single proportion at a 5% level of significance. We assumed that 74.4% of babies had protective tetanus antibodies basing on a study from Nigeria. We approached every fifth mother recorded in the vertical maternity register for enrolment until sample size was reached. The first participant was chosen randomly from the first five mothers registered that day.

Eligibility criteria

The study enrolled mothers and their newborns delivered at KNRH who consented to study activities during the period of the study. We excluded all babies born before arrival to KNRH, as they already had their umbilical cords ligated and placentae detached. We also excluded mothers admitted in second stage of labour, mothers with intrauterine fetal deaths, mothers too sick to consent and mothers with significant mental disabilities.

Blood sample processing

Two millilitres of venous or cord blood was collected from the mothers and newborns at delivery. To collect the cord blood, the umbilical cord was clamped immediately after delivery of the baby and a needle was used by the obstetrician to collect the blood from the umbilicus. Blood was centrifuged at 1500× g for 15 min and two 0.5 mL aliquots made and stored frozen at −20°C until analysed.

### A pilot randomized controlled trial of controlled cord traction to reduce postpartum blood loss [^115F1s5w]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether controlled cord traction (CCT) for management of the third stage of labor reduced postpartum blood loss compared with a "hands-off" management protocol.

Methods

Women with imminent vaginal delivery were randomly assigned to either a CCT group or a hands-off group. The women received prophylactic oxytocin. The primary outcome was blood loss during the third stage of labor.

Results

In total, 103 women were allocated to the CCT group and 101 were allocated to the hands-off group. Median blood loss in the CCT group and the hands-off group was 282.0 mL and 310.2 mL, respectively. The difference in blood loss (-28.2 mL) was not significant (95% confidence interval, -92.3 to 35.9; P = 0.126). Blood collection in the hands-off group took 1.2 minutes longer than in the CCT group, which may have contributed to this difference.

Conclusion

CCT may reduce postpartum blood loss. The present findings support conducting a large trial to determine whether CCT can prevent postpartum hemorrhage.

### Placental cord drainage impact on third stage of labor: a randomized controlled trial [^115P8TCS]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The third stage of labor is a pivotal phase in obstetric care. Management may be physiological or active. Although the use of prophylactic placental cord drainage has been assessed in prior data, there is still no clear-cut evidence supporting its effectiveness in improving key obstetric outcomes.

Objective

The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of placental cord drainage during the third stage of labor on the amount of maternal bleeding, duration of the third stage, and incidence of postpartum hemorrhage.

Study Design

A randomized controlled trial was conducted at a high-volume tertiary obstetric center between May 2021 and December 2022. A total of 212 pregnant women with a singleton uncomplicated pregnancy were randomly assigned to undergo placental cord drainage or standard care without drainage. The randomization was manual, using premarked cards drawn by the participants. The power calculation determined a sample size of 92 participants per group to achieve 80% power at a 5% significance level, aiming to detect 20% difference in bleeding amount between the groups. In practice, we included more than 100 women in each group. The primary outcome was the amount of bleeding during the third stage of labor, while secondary outcomes included the duration of the third stage and incidence of postpartum hemorrhage. After delivery, all participants received 10 units of oxytocin via intravenous drip, and delayed cord clamping was performed. In the study group, the maternal umbilical cord was then unclamped. Blood was allowed to drain into a plastic bag placed under the women's buttocks. If an episiotomy or perineal tear was observed, pressure packing was applied to reduce bleeding. The collected blood was measured in milliliters after placental expulsion.

Results

A total of 212 women were recruited of whom 104 underwent placental cord drainage and 108 received standard care without drainage. No significant differences were observed between the intervention and control groups in mean duration of the third stage of labor (10.56 ± 6.12 vs 10.95 ± 6.33 minutes, P = 0.65), incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (3.84% vs 7.41%, P = 0.38), or mean amount of bleeding during the third stage of labor (292 ± 200 vs 300 ± 242 mL, P = 0.79). Furthermore, there were no significant between-group differences in the mean amount of bleeding on separate analysis of nulliparous women (356 ± 246 vs 330 ± 240 mL, P = 0.68), multiparous women (265 ± 171 vs 289 ± 244 mL, P = 0.50), women who were not exposed to external oxytocin during labor (287 ± 204 vs 317 ± 250 mL, P = 0.59), and women who were exposed to external oxytocin (296 ± 198 vs 289 ± 238 mL, P = 0.39).

Conclusion

Placental cord drainage during the third stage of labor showed no statistically significant impact on bleeding amount, third-stage length, or postpartum hemorrhage rate. The findings suggest that placental cord drainage may not offer additional benefits in preventing postpartum hemorrhage in women with uncomplicated pregnancies.

### Umbilical cord blood hematological parameters reference interval for newborns from addis ababa, Ethiopia [^1172a8qr]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Quality Assurance

Cord blood was collected by experienced midwives or OR nurses following the guideline for cord blood sample collection. In addition, orientation was given on proper collection and handling of CB. Three level whole blood controls were used to ensure the quality of CBC using Sysmex KX-21 N. All procedures were performed following standard operating procedures (SOPs).

Statistical Analysis

Data from the questionnaires and laboratory results were coded and checked for completeness. Data were then entered and analyzed using IBM SPSS-version 23 statistical software for windows. Following the CLSI guide, 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles for hematological parameters were calculated for 139 newborns of both genders. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the distribution of the parameters between genders, delivery modes (other than Instrument assisted delivery), and gestational age groups. Additionally descriptive statistics (minimum, maximum, mean, SD, median) were also determined. P value less than 0.05 was sued to declare statistical significance.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 771: umbilical cord blood banking [^111oCNRr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 771 — umbilical cord blood banking recommendations identify appropriate use and bank selection. Umbilical cord blood collected from a neonate cannot be used to treat a genetic disease or malignancy in that same individual (autologous transplant) because stored cord blood contains the same genetic variant or premalignant cells that led to the condition being treated. The routine collection and storage of umbilical cord blood with a private cord blood bank is not supported by the available evidence. The current indications for umbilical cord blood transplantation are limited to select genetic, hematologic, and malignant disorders. Private umbilical cord blood banking may be considered when there is knowledge of a family member with a medical condition (malignant or genetic) who could potentially benefit from cord blood transplantation. Public umbilical cord blood banking is the recommended method of obtaining umbilical cord blood for use in transplantation, immune therapies, or other medically validated indications.

Association Between Se Level During Pregnancy and Child Psychomotor Development

Table 4 presents the association between maternal Se levels in the first trimester of pregnancy, at delivery, and in cord blood and child neurodevelopment. In the model adjusted for the examiner, a statistically significant positive association was observed between Se levels in the blood collected during the first trimester of pregnancy and child motor skills at 1 (β = 0.2, P = 0.001) as well as 2 (β = 0.2; P = 0.04) y of age, and cognitive development at 2 y of age (β = 0.2; P = 0.03). For language abilities at 2 y of age, the association was of borderline significance (β = 0.2, P = 0.05). In the same model for Se levels in the blood collected from the mothers at delivery, no statistically significant associations with any domains of child neurodevelopment were observed (P > 0.05), whereas for Se levels in cord blood, a statistically significant positive association was observed in the case of language development at 2 y of age (β = 0.3, P = 0.02). The analysis with adjustment for a variety of confounders confirmed a statistically significant positive association between Se levels in blood collected in the first trimester of pregnancy and motor functions at 1 (β = 0.2, P = 0.002) and language functions at 2 y of age (β = 0.2, P = 0.03). For cognitive abilities at 2 y of age, the association was of borderline significance (β = 0.2, P = 0.05).

### Effect of maternal smoking on fetal catecholamine concentrations at birth [^1166C13o]. Pediatric Research (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare catecholamine concentrations in the fetal umbilical artery cord blood from the offspring of smokers versus the offspring of nonsmokers. Pregnant women who were self-identified as smokers (≥ 10 cigarettes per day throughout pregnancy) or nonsmokers were recruited for study participation. Maternal blood was collected for cotinine concentrations. Umbilical artery cord blood was collected at delivery for arterial pH and catecholamine concentrations. Cord blood was obtained from 51 subjects, including 21 smokers and 30 nonsmokers. Median epinephrine concentrations [304 pg/mL versus 597 pg/mL (Mann-Whitney U = 170; p = 0.006)] and median norepinephrine concentrations [3148 pg/mL versus 6558 pg/mL (Mann-Whitney U = 191; p = 0.006)] were significantly lower in smokers compared with nonsmokers, respectively. After controlling for gestational age, route of delivery, and arterial pH, log-transformed epinephrine concentrations between smokers and nonsmokers were statistically significant (p = 0.03), with a similar trend for log-transformed norepinephrine concentrations (p = 0.07). Analyses of the data using cotinine < 20 ng/mL to classify nonsmokers also showed differences in epinephrine concentrations between groups (p = 0.02). These results are consistent with results from animal studies showing that catecholamine concentrations may be affected by prenatal nicotine exposure. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and to examine the specific mechanism by which these differences may arise.

### Fetal blood sampling [^112tDcpY]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Medium credibility.

Fetal blood sampling — specimen handling and verification practices include aspirating blood into a previously heparinized syringe after needle placement, sending an initial sample to determine fetal origin using methods such as mean corpuscular volume and the Kleihauer-Betke test, and in some centers comparing to a maternal sample because fetal MCV and hemoglobin/hematocrit differ; when the IHV, a free umbilical cord loop, or AC are accessed, or with fetal cardiocentesis, verification is not needed since these sites assure lack of maternal contamination; in suspected fetal anemia, immediate hemoglobin/hematocrit analysis guides IUT volume; after completion the needle is withdrawn, evidence is insufficient regarding puncture-site bleeding monitoring, and during IUT the fetal heart can be observed by ultrasound or Doppler.

Fetal blood sampling procedural capabilities — Ultrasound-guided fetal blood sampling (FBS), also known as cordocentesis, or percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling, was first described in the early 1980s, and inserting a needle to gain access into the fetal circulation allows the operator to sample or transfuse blood or other blood products such as platelets. FBS also allows medication or other substances, such as contrast media, to be injected directly into the fetal circulation, fetal blood can be collected for laboratory markers of fetal health or disease, and use of fetal blood can allow rapid karyotyping when indicated for prenatal genetic diagnosis.

### Cord blood banking for potential future transplantation [^116F7Vpv]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) — recommendations on cord blood banking state that public cord blood banking is the preferred method of collecting, processing, and using cord blood cells for use in transplantation in infants and children with fatal diseases, and that there is a more limited role of private cord blood banking with families with a known fatal illness that can be rescued by a healthy cord blood transplant within the family. It is important that the concepts of autologous and allogeneic use of cord blood units be explained to parents by physicians and medical staff. Physicians need to convey accurate information about the potential benefits and limitations of allogeneic and autologous cord blood banking and transplantation to parents, including that autologous cord blood would not be used as a stem cell source if the donor developed leukemia later in life, and it is important for parents to be aware that at this time, there are no scientific data to support the claim that autologous cord blood is a tissue source proven to be of value for regenerative medical purposes. It is expected that physicians and designated medical staff obtain specific permission for maintaining demographic medical information and that the potential risks of breaches of confidentiality be disclosed to parents, and specific efforts need to be made to recruit underserved ethnic minorities; before the onset of active labor, written permission needs to be obtained from parents to collect the cord blood for banking purposes, and if the cord blood bank is conducting therapeutic human research involving cord blood, review and approval of the recruitment strategies and parental consent forms by the institutional review board are necessary. The AAP advocates for regulatory agencies to have an active role in providing oversight of the cord blood program, and it is important that all cord blood banking programs comply with FACT or equivalent accreditation standards. Physicians or other professionals who recruit pregnant women and their families for for-profit placental cord blood stem cell banking need to disclose any financial interest or other potential conflict of interest to their patients and need to make annual financial-disclosure and potential-conflicts-of-interest statements to an appropriate institutional review committee that possesses oversight authority.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 771: umbilical cord blood banking [^112iqJbY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Umbilical cord blood banking — indications and banking options: The current indications for umbilical cord blood transplantation are limited to select genetic, hematologic, and malignant disorders, and the estimated lifetime probability of an individual to develop an indication for autologous transplantation ranges from 1 in 400 to 1 in 2,500. Routine collection and storage with a private cord blood bank is not supported by the available evidence, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists concurs with the American Academy of Pediatrics that such routine storage is not recommended; there is no current evidence to support the use of an autologous umbilical cord blood sample in regenerative medicine. Private umbilical cord blood banking may be considered when there is knowledge of a family member with a medical condition (malignant or genetic) who could potentially benefit, and patients should be made aware of oversight mechanisms and the financial obligation for processing and annual storage fees; private banks are not subject to the same regulatory mechanisms as public banks and may not produce samples that meet expected standards. Public umbilical cord blood banking is the recommended method for medically validated indications; there are currently 28 public umbilical cord blood banks identified in North America, and every unit of unrelated donor cord blood to be transplanted in the United States must be licensed or covered under an investigational new drug application approved by the FDA; minority populations are significantly underrepresented in public and private banks.

Blood antibody levels and ratio of transplacental antibody transfer

We collected blood samples from mothers and umbilical cords at delivery and conducted IgG antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2. In both maternal and umbilical cord blood, IgG levels in the infected group were significantly higher than those in the uninfected groups at different stages of pregnancy, showing a statistical difference. The highest IgG levels were found in samples from the reinfection group. In umbilical cord blood, the reinfection group's IgG levels significantly increased compared to those in the early and late groups. The median transplacental antibody transfer ratio for all infected individuals was 1.15 (0.98, 1.30), exceeding 1 across all four infection groups with no significant differences among them (Fig. 2).

Breastmilk antibody levels

IgA antibody levels specific to SARS-CoV-2 were measured in breast milk samples collected shortly after delivery and one month postpartum. Generally, IgA concentration in breast milk is low. However, the reinfection group showed significantly higher IgA levels during pregnancy compared to other groups, indicating a statistically significant difference. IgA concentration sharply decreases after one month postpartum, resulting in only 9 samples collected at the second time point (Fig. 3).

### Effect of preeclampsia on umbilical cord blood hematopoietic progenitor-stem cells [^111PKE8K]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the present study was to determine the influence of preeclampsia on cord blood hematopoietic progenitor-stem cells obtained at delivery because cord blood is increasingly used clinically for stem cell retrieval as an alternative to bone marrow.

Study Design

Umbilical cord blood was collected from patients fulfilling the criteria for preeclampsia and from gestational age- and birth weight-matched control subjects at delivery (patient/control subjects ratio, 1:2). Cord blood volume and nucleated cell content were measured, and the number of hematopoietic progenitor-stem cells was determined by means of fluorescence-activated cell sorting with the CD34(+) epitope and by means of colony assays with different hematopoietic growth factors. In addition, the expression of adhesion molecules by CD34(+) progenitor-stem cells was examined.

Results

In pregnancies affected by preeclampsia, volume and nucleated cell and total CD34(+) cell contents in the collected cord blood were significantly smaller compared with those of control subjects. Furthermore, there was a trend toward a smaller relative number of CD34(+) cells and colony-forming units per nucleated cell in cord blood samples from preeclamptic patients. No difference in the expression of the cell-adhesion molecules leukocyte function-associated antigen 1, very late activation antigen 4, and L-selectin by CD34(+) cells could be found.

Conclusion

This study shows that preeclampsia affects umbilical cord blood volume and nucleated cell and progenitor-stem cell numbers obtained at birth.

### Parents' knowledge, awareness and attitudes of cord blood donation and banking options: an integrative review [^1144orB8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

For over 25 years cord blood has been used as an alternative to bone marrow for therapeutic use in conditions of the blood, immune system and metabolic disorders. Cord blood is now one of the main haematopoietic stem cell sources. Umbilical cord blood banking is the process of collecting and storing umbilical cord blood, in the immediate period after the birth of a baby. Cord blood can be collected and stored either publicly or privately.

Public cord blood banks operate in all developed countries, and within most developing countries. By 2014, the international cord blood banking network comprised over 160 public cord blood banks in 36 countries, with over 731,000 umbilical cord blood units stored. Public cord blood banks collect, transport, process, test and store cord blood units which have been altruistically donated for allogeneic use, at no financial cost to the donating parents. The donated cord blood unit is not reserved for the use of the donating family, who relinquish their rights of ownership of the blood to the banking facility.

Private cord blood banks charge parents a fee for the collection, processing and storage of their infant's cord blood for exclusive autologous or family use. Some private cord blood banks now also store cord tissue.

Parents can decide if they would like to privately store their infant's cord blood for later use if needed, publicly donate it, defer cord clamping to allow their infant to receive optimal volumes of cord blood at birth or to discard the remaining cord blood with the placenta after birth. Parents need to be aware of the options that exist for their infant's cord blood and have access to the relevant information to inform their choice. Parents' knowledge and understanding of cord blood banking and donation has been reported to be low and little is known about their source of information on this topic and the quality of the information provided. Thus, accuracy of information is difficult to assess and there is limited understanding of how parents use this information to inform their decision making about cord blood banking and donation.

### Maternal implications of placental transfusion [^116vwT8R]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Placental transfusion for 30–60 s after delivery is recommended by numerous professional societies and is now a common practice. Numerous studies document neonatal benefit with minimal maternal risk when routine neonatal stabilization and active management of the third stage of labor are undertaken during the period of delayed cord clamping. Maternal outcomes do not show any increased incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, or need for blood product transfusion in the case of vaginal delivery or cesarean section. Fetomaternal hemorrhage is also likely decreased with delayed cord clamping. In the case of fetal anomalies, cord management should be individualized according to each special circumstance, but is unlikely to lead to increased maternal morbidity. While few studies have investigated maternal outcomes with umbilical cord milking, this practice has not been as widely adopted. With careful monitoring of maternal and fetal well-being, a period of placental transfusion following delivery is advised for benefit of the neonate without significant maternal risk.

### An Indian perspective for umbilical cord blood haematological parameters reference interval [^115pTVzF]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Data collection procedure

All professionals who participated in the collection of the data were oriented about the aim of the study, selection of participants, data confidentiality, safety precautions during collection, transportation, and storage of cord blood samples before the collection of data was initiated. A predesigned questionnaire was utilised in order to assimilate the demographic information and a brief history from all those mothers who had consented for the research and fit into the eligibility criteria. The mothers of neonates gave informed consent after informing them about the aim of study, voluntary participation, confidentiality of the information and their right to withdraw from the study anytime. It is only after the complete separation and expulsion of the placenta from the mother and cutting the umbilical cord post clamping, the cord blood sampling is carried out. The umbilical cord was clamped within 1 min after birth and 2–3 mL of cord blood was collected by operation room (OR) nurse into vacutainers containing EDTA (for complete blood analysis). The sample was well mixed and immediately transported to haematology laboratory for further analysis.

Screening tests

As a part of the antenatal care (ANC) follow up, all subjects were screened for HIV via antibody tests, Hepatitis B surface antigen and syphilis which are routinely performed for pregnant women. Ultrasonography (USG) was done to rule out any foetal congenital anomalies.

Quality assurance

The collection of cord blood samples was carried out by experienced OR nurses following the guideline for the cord blood sample collection. A descriptive and informative orientation was given on the proper collection and handling the samples. All procedures that were performed, followedthe standard operating procedures (SOPs).

Haematological analysis

Complete blood count (CBC) namely white blood cell (WBC), Differential count: neutrophil (NEU#), lymphocyte (LYM#), Basophil (BAS#), Eosinophil (EOS#) and Monocyte (MON#); neutrophil percentages (NEU%), lymphocyte percentages (LYM%), eosinophil percentage (EOS%), Basophils percentage (BAS%), Monocytes percentage (MON%), red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), haematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and platelets (PLT) were analysed using an automated haematology analyser. In order to investigate the RBC morphology, WBC and PLT abnormalities, peripheral blood smears from cord blood samples were prepared and stained using Wright's stain.

### Effect of delayed vs immediate umbilical cord clamping on maternal blood loss in term cesarean delivery: a randomized clinical trial [^1146fDXx]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends a delay in umbilical cord clamping in term neonates for at least 30 to 60 seconds after birth. Most literature supporting this practice is from low-risk vaginal deliveries. There are no published data specific to cesarean delivery.

Objective

To compare maternal blood loss with immediate cord clamping vs delayed cord clamping in scheduled cesarean deliveries at term (≥ 37 weeks).

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial performed at 2 hospitals within a tertiary academic medical center in New York City from October 2017 to February 2018 (follow-up completed March 15, 2018). A total of 113 women undergoing scheduled cesarean delivery of term singleton gestations were included.

Interventions

In the immediate cord clamping group (n = 56), cord clamping was within 15 seconds after birth. In the delayed cord clamping group (n = 57), cord clamping was at 60 seconds after birth.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was change in maternal hemoglobin level from preoperative to postoperative day 1, which was used as a proxy for maternal blood loss. Secondary outcomes included neonatal hemoglobin level at 24 to 72 hours of life.

Results

All of the 113 women who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 32.6 [5.2] years) completed the trial. The mean preoperative hemoglobin level was 12.0 g/dL in the delayed and 11.6 g/dL in the immediate cord clamping group. The mean postoperative day 1 hemoglobin level was 10.1 g/dL in the delayed group and 9.8 g/dL in the immediate group. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome, with a mean hemoglobin change of -1.90 g/dL (95% CI, -2.14 to -1.66) and -1.78 g/dL (95% CI, -2.03 to -1.54) in the delayed and immediate cord clamping groups, respectively (mean difference, 0.12 g/dL [95% CI, -0.22 to 0.46]; P = 0.49). Of 19 prespecified secondary outcomes analyzed, 15 showed no significant difference. The mean neonatal hemoglobin level, available for 90 neonates (79.6%), was significantly higher with delayed (18.1 g/dL [95% CI, 17.4 to 18.8]) compared with immediate (16.4 g/dL [95% CI, 15.9 to 17.0]) cord clamping (mean difference, 1.67 g/dL [95% CI, 0.75 to 2.59]; P < .001). There was 1 unplanned hysterectomy in each group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among women undergoing scheduled cesarean delivery of term singleton pregnancies, delayed umbilical cord clamping, compared with immediate cord clamping, resulted in no significant difference in the change in maternal hemoglobin level at postoperative day 1.

### Effect of delayed versus immediate umbilical cord clamping in vaginal delivery at term: a randomized clinical trial [^116Ugf8u]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This randomized trial aimed to compare maternal blood loss with immediate cord clamping versus delayed cord clamping. The study showed that among women undergoing spontaneous vaginal delivery at term, delayed umbilical cord clamping, compared with immediate umbilical cord clamping, resulted in no significant change in maternal hemoglobin level 1 day after delivery.

The major limitations of the trial were the small sample size and the single‐center study design. Moreover, the unblinded study design limited the generalizability of our findings. In the delayed cord clamping group, there was a 14.5% crossover rate with 9 of 62 women receiving cord clamping before 5 min. However, this rate was lower than expected. The mean decrease in hemoglobin level at postdelivery day 1 was lower than the mean expected in the sample size calculation. This may have affected our results and made the primary outcome underpowered. The trial was underpowered for uncommon but important outcomes, such as maternal transfusions. The study included only spontaneous vaginal deliveries of singleton pregnancies, and therefore results cannot be generalizable to multiple gestations and operative vaginal delivery. Almost all included participants were Caucasian, limiting the findings to this population.

Delayed cord clamping has been associated with several neonatal benefits in both term and preterm pregnancies. Concern about the risk of PPH associated with delayed cord clamping has been identified as a barrier to implementation of this procedure in term pregnancies. Among low‐ and middle‐income countries, several have maternal mortality rates in excess of 1000 women per 100 000 live births, and World Health Organization statistics suggest that 60% of maternal deaths in low‐ and middle‐income countries are due to PPH, accounting for more than 100 000 maternal deaths per year.

In a recent Cochrane review, McDonald et al.included 15 trials involving a total of 3911 women undergoing term delivery. Participants generally had low‐risk pregnancies and underwent vaginal delivery. Few included trials reported data on maternal outcomes. The timing of cord clamping was not shown to be associated with PPH or increased mean blood loss. Only three trials reported data on maternal postpartum hemoglobin. Pooled data showed that maternal hemoglobin values were not significantly different between the women in the early and late cord clamping groups with an MD of −0.12 g/dl.

Among women undergoing spontaneous vaginal delivery at term, delayed umbilical cord clamping, compared with immediate umbilical cord clamping, resulted in no significant difference in change in maternal hemoglobin level 1 day after delivery. Our study supports the routine use of delayed umbilical cord in spontaneous vaginal delivery at term. Further multicenter studies were needed to confirm our findings.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for umbilical cord management, more specifically with respect to considerations for delayed cord clamping, SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that relative contraindications to delayed cord clamping in term infants include the following, and consider performing immediate cord clamping in these situations:

- risk factors for significant hyperbilirubinemia (such as significant polycythemia, severe intrauterine growth restriction, pregestational diabetes)

- high maternal antibody titers

- the first infant in a pair of monochorionic twins is delivered.

Similar strong perspectives have been identified by other researchers with CBB being described by midwives as a 'trendy, grim, useless and selfish act'. This finding is concerning because these strong and negative statements indicate that personal values and biases likely affect the presentation of evidence, and that midwives position themselves as advocates for the infant, and that the philosophy of woman/parent centred care and choice is not always translated into practice. The practice of not providing information on all options available to parents in the third stage of labour is concerning because maternity health professionals can influence how parents' rights to quality information during pregnancy and birth are promoted and upheld.

In comparison, most midwives interviewed revealed that when parents enquired about CBB, they simply referred them to do their own research. This finding is important as it is contrary to midwives' practice of openly and transparently discussing cord clamp timing. Lack of transparency and openness about CBB creates concerning discourse about provision of evidence-based information for parental informed decision making because women/parents want to be informed of their options, and they are aware that the internet had the potential to provide 'unreliable' information.

Parents value information about CBB and their preference is that their maternity health care provider/s share this. Participant narratives revealed a greater level of knowledge about the potential use of cord blood and current clinical trials is necessary if maternity health professionals are to provide parents with evidence-based information. Participants verbalised they would like this information, identifying a need for open and frank discussions with parents and being confident to respond to questions about CBB.

Request for evidence-based CBB scientific information may reflect the current information available for maternity health professionals provided by CBBs, who market CBB as an insurance policy for possible future use as opposed to evidence-based scientific focus on actual current benefits of collecting and storing cord blood. Informal mechanisms such as CBB literature have been identified as the most common source of information on CBB for maternity health professionals. Informal sources may not have undergone rigorous quality assurance process, may lack governance or not been peer assessed so the validity of the content may not be entirely accurate and evidence-based.

### Umbilical cord management at term and late preterm birth: a meta-analysis [^114yfZ1C]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation prioritized scientific review of umbilical cord management at term and late preterm birth.

Objective

To assess effects of umbilical cord management strategies (clamping timing and cord milking) in infants ≥ 34 weeks' gestational age.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and trial registries searched July 2019.

Study Selection

Two authors independently assessed eligibility of randomized controlled trials.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed evidence certainty (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluations).

Results

We identified 46 studies (9159 women and their infants) investigating 7 comparisons. Compared with early cord clamping (ECC) < 30 seconds, delayed cord clamping (DCC) ≥ 30 seconds (33 studies), intact-cord milking (1 study), and cut-cord milking (2 studies) probably improve hematologic measures but may not affect survival without neurodisability, anemia in early infancy, or maternal postpartum hemorrhage. No differences in major neonatal morbidities are seen in studies comparing methods of optimizing placental transfusion (DCC versus cut-cord milking [3 studies], longer delays in clamping [7 studies], or physiologic parameters [3 studies]). Strategies that promote increased placental transfusion may be associated with greater phototherapy use. Evidence for all outcomes was low or very low certainty.

Limitations

Incompleteness and low certainty of findings limit applicability.

Conclusions

Compared with ECC, DCC or cord milking increases hemoglobin and hematocrit immediately after birth in infants ≥ 34 weeks' gestational age. The uncertain effects of DCC and cord milking compared with ECC on major morbidities limit usefulness of available evidence for policy and practice.

### Effect of timing of umbilical cord clamping and other strategies to influence placental transfusion at preterm birth on maternal and infant outcomes [^114L9LJC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal timing for clamping the umbilical cord at preterm birth is unclear. Early clamping allows for immediate transfer of the infant to the neonatologist. Delaying clamping allows blood flow between the placenta, the umbilical cord and the baby to continue. The blood which transfers to the baby between birth and cord clamping is called placental transfusion. Placental transfusion may improve circulating volume at birth, which may in turn improve outcome for preterm infants.

Objectives

To assess the short- and long-term effects of early rather than delaying clamping or milking of the umbilical cord for infants born at less than 37 completed weeks' gestation, and their mothers.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (31 May 2011). We updated this search on 26 June 2012 and added the results to the awaiting classification section.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing early with delayed clamping of the umbilical cord and other strategies to influence placental transfusion for births before 37 completed weeks' gestation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors assessed eligibility and trial quality.

Main Results

Fifteen studies (738 infants) were eligible for inclusion. Participants were between 24 and 36 weeks' gestation at birth. The maximum delay in cord clamping was 180 seconds. Delaying cord clamping was associated with fewer infants requiring transfusions for anaemia (seven trials, 392 infants; risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.81), less intraventricular haemorrhage (ultrasound diagnosis all grades) 10 trials, 539 infants (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.85) and lower risk for necrotising enterocolitis (five trials, 241 infants, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.90) compared with immediate clamping. However, the peak bilirubin concentration was higher for infants allocated to delayed cord clamping compared with immediate clamping (seven trials, 320 infants, mean difference 15.01 mmol/L, 95% CI 5.62 to 24.40). For most other outcomes (including the primary outcomes infant death, severe (grade three to four) intraventricular haemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia) there were no clear differences identified between groups; but for many there was incomplete reporting and wide CIs. Outcome after discharge from hospital was reported for one small study; there were no significant differences between the groups in mean Bayley II scores at age seven months (corrected for gestation at birth (58 children)). No studies reported outcomes for the women.

Authors' Conclusions

Providing additional placental blood to the preterm baby by either delaying cord clamping for 30 to 120 seconds, rather than early clamping, seems to be associated with less need for transfusion, better circulatory stability, less intraventricular haemorrhage (all grades) and lower risk for necrotising enterocolitis. However, there were insufficient data for reliable conclusions about the comparative effects on any of the primary outcomes for this review.

### Cord blood banking for potential future transplantation [^1117nVqf]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

European and international policy perspectives — European countries "have advocated for the adoption of strict guidelines regarding public collection and use of cord blood for transplant in the case of life-threatening illnesses", with an Italian Committee statement noting "(1) the total absence of scientifically valid data proving that the therapeutic use of autologous cord blood stored for preventive purposes is appropriate, effective, and risk free; (2) the for-profit nature of the private collection and storage of umbilical cord blood; and (3) the contrast between this type of storage of cord blood and both the general interest and the principle of altruistic donations and solidarity repeatedly affirmed by the European Parliament". Canada and Australia "advocate for a cooperative relationship between public and private cord blood banks". A hybrid model "was found to be of less benefit to patients than either public or private cord blood banks separately", and the authors "concluded that continued emphasis should be placed on public cord blood banking".

### Umbilical cord management for newborns [^111B5uYp]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation prioritized scientific review of umbilical cord management strategies at preterm birth.

Objective

To determine the effects of umbilical cord management strategies (including timing of cord clamping and cord milking) in preterm infants < 34 weeks' gestation.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and trial registries were searched through July 2019 for randomized controlled trials assessing timing of cord clamping and/or cord milking.

Study Selection

Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, appraised risk of bias, and assessed evidence certainty (GRADE).

Data Extraction

We identified 42 randomized controlled trials (including 5772 infants) investigating 4 different comparisons of cord management interventions.

Results

Compared to early cord clamping, delayed cord clamping (DCC) and intact-cord milking (ICM) may slightly improve survival; however, both are compatible with no effect (DCC: risk ratio: 1.02, 95% confidence interval: 1.00 to 1.04, n = 2988 infants, moderate certainty evidence; ICM: risk ratio: 1.02, 95% confidence interval: 0.98 to 1.06, n = 945 infants, moderate certainty evidence). DCC and ICM both probably improve hematologic measures but may not affect major neonatal morbidities.

Limitations

For many of the included comparisons and outcomes, certainty of evidence was low. Our subgroup analyses were limited by few researchers reporting subgroup data.

Conclusions

DCC appears to be associated with some benefit for infants born < 34 weeks. Cord milking needs further evidence to determine potential benefits or harms. The ideal cord management strategy for preterm infants is still unknown, but early clamping may be harmful.

### Using umbilical cord blood for the initial blood tests of VLBW neonates results in higher hemoglobin and fewer RBC transfusions [^116wzbtj]. Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

We previously described a method for reducing early phlebotomy losses from very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates by obtaining the initial blood tests from otherwise discarded fetal blood from the placenta. In the present study we sought to; (1) measure the feasibility of performing this method in actual practice, (2) test the hypothesis that this method would result in higher hemoglobin concentrations and lower erythrocyte transfusion rates in the first week after birth.

Methods

We conducted two studies in three Intermountain Healthcare NICUs. The first was a feasibility analysis involving 96 VLBW neonates, measuring the success of obtaining the NICU admission laboratory blood tests this way. The second study used case-control methodology to test the hypothesis that this method would result in a higher blood hemoglobin 12 to 24 h after birth, and a lower proportion receiving an erythrocyte transfusion in the first week.

Result

In 91 of 96 VLBW neonates (95%) the initial blood tests were successfully obtained with this method. The success rate was not diminished by delayed cord clamping or cord milking, as it was successful in 35 of 36 (97%) such instances. Cases and controls were well matched on demographic and level of illness comparisons. Among cases the hemoglobin generally increased between birth and 12 to 24 h later, but among controls the hemoglobin generally decreased (P < 0.05). In the week following birth fewer cases received vasopressors (P < 0.01) and erythrocyte transfusions (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

We judge that it is feasible to collect the initial blood tests of VLBW neonates using otherwise discarded umbilical cord/placental blood, in that this can be accomplished in about 95% of VLBW deliveries. This method, which can be used in addition to either delayed clamping of the umbilical cord or cord milking, results in higher hemoglobin concentrations, less vasopressor use and fewer transfusions in the first week.

### Fetal blood sampling [^114K6Wys]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Medium credibility.

Fetal blood sampling — IHV approach outcomes report that the first large series via the IHV had a 91% success rate for obtaining a sample and a successful IUT in 90% of attempts, with the needle left unheld after a 20-gauge entry through the fetal abdominal wall; the dislodgement rate was 8.7%, and all of the 2.3% of intraperitoneal bleeding cases resolved. In a retrospective comparison of IHV and cordocentesis, 210 procedures in 139 pregnancies included 100 IHV only, 80 cordocentesis only, 19 IHV following failed cordocentesis, and 11 cordocentesis following failed IHV; success rates for these were 95%, 83%, 91%, and 84%, and postprocedure streaming was significantly less common with IHV (1% vs 31%), with no differences in nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns, need for urgent delivery, or fetal/neonatal deaths. In another series of 382 procedures, IHV sampling occurred in 76%, cordocentesis in 18%, and cardiocentesis in 5%, and multivariable analysis showed a statistically significant increased risk of fetal loss for the cardiocentesis group only.

### Delayed umbilical cord clamping after birth: ACOG committee opinion, number 814 [^116J8Mbh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion 814 — delayed umbilical cord clamping after birth — states that in term infants, delayed umbilical cord clamping increases hemoglobin levels at birth and improves iron stores in the first several months of life, which may have a favorable effect on developmental outcomes, and in preterm infants it is associated with significant neonatal benefits including improved transitional circulation, better establishment of red blood cell volume, decreased need for blood transfusion, and lower incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and intraventricular hemorrhage. It notes a small increase in the incidence of jaundice that requires phototherapy in term infants undergoing delayed umbilical cord clamping, and consequently obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric care providers adopting delayed umbilical cord clamping in term infants should ensure that mechanisms are in place to monitor and treat neonatal jaundice. Delayed umbilical cord clamping was not associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage or increased blood loss at delivery, nor was it associated with a difference in postpartum hemoglobin levels or the need for blood transfusion. Given these benefits, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends a delay in umbilical cord clamping in vigorous term and preterm infants for at least 30–60 seconds after birth, and also states that the ability to provide delayed umbilical cord clamping may vary among institutions and settings; decisions in those circumstances are best made by the team caring for the mother–infant dyad.

### Effect of cord puncture site in cordocentesis at mid-pregnancy on pregnancy outcomes [^113QeyeM]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the procedure and pregnancy outcomes of pregnancies undergoing cordocentesis between a group of cord insertion puncture and that of free loop puncture.

Materials and Methods

Pregnancies undergoing cordocenteses meeting the following inclusion criteria were recruited: (1) singleton pregnancies at gestational ages of 18–22 weeks; (2) no fetal abnormalities; (3) the procedures performed by experienced operators; and (4) the procedures of no placenta penetration. The recruited cases were classified into two groups: a group of cordocenteses with puncture site at placental cord insertion (Group 1) and those with puncture site at cord free loop (Group 2). The primary outcomes to be compared were rates of fetal loss, newborns with low birth weight and preterm birth. The secondary outcomes included a rate of successful procedures, umbilical cord bleeding, fetal bradycardia, maternal blood contamination, and duration of the procedure time.

Results

Of 6147 cordocenteses recruited, 2214 met inclusion criteria. The mean duration to complete the procedure in Group 1 was significantly shorter than that in Group 2 (4.5 ± 5.4 vs. 6.7 ± 8.5 min, Student's t-test; p = 0.001). The mean birth weight and gestational age at delivery were comparable between the two groups. No significant differences between the two groups were seen in rates of fetal loss, low birth weight, preterm birth, successful procedures, umbilical cord bleeding, or fetal bradycardia. However, the rate of maternal blood contamination was significantly higher in the group of puncture at the cord insertion site.

Conclusion

Of cordocenteses performed based on accessibility and quality of visualization, cord insertion puncture may cause more maternal blood contamination but free loop puncture may be associated with more difficult procedures, while the safety was comparable.

### Implementation and outcomes of universal delayed umbilical cord clamping at term [^111BnVwu]. American Journal of Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the implementation of an institutional protocol for universal delayed umbilical cord clamping (DCC) at term on maternal, neonatal, and umbilical cord blood gas outcomes.

Study Design

This is a retrospective cohort study of singleton term gestations from April through July 2017. On June 1, 2017, a protocol was implemented for DCC in all deliveries. Outcomes were compared between patients delivered prior to and those delivered after implementation. The primary outcome was postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Secondary outcomes were additional adverse maternal, neonatal, and umbilical cord blood gas outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders.

Results

Of 682 patients, 341 were delivered preprotocol and 341 were delivered postprotocol. After implementation, there was 91.8% adherence to the protocol. Overall, there was no significant difference in PPH between patients delivered preprotocol and those delivered postprotocol (8.2 vs. 13.2%; adjusted relative risk [aRR]: 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98–1.51). There was a significant decrease in the ability to obtain paired arterial and venous umbilical cord blood gases from preprotocol to postprotocol (83 vs. 63.6%; aRR: 0.62 [95% CI: 0.50–0.76]). There were no significant differences in abnormal umbilical cord blood gases or neonatal outcomes.

Conclusion

We did not find an increased risk of adverse outcomes associated with the widespread use of DCC.

### Cochrane update: effect of timing of umbilical cord clamping at birth of term infants on mother and baby outcomes [^114opo21]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Policies for timing of cord clamping vary, with early cord clamping generally carried out in the first 60 seconds after birth, whereas later cord clamping usually involves clamping the umbilical cord greater than one minute after the birth or when cord pulsation has ceased.

Objectives

To determine the effects of different policies of timing of cord clamping at delivery of the placenta on maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Child Birth Group's Trials Register (December 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing early and late cord clamping.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 11 trials of 2,989 mothers and their babies. No significant differences between early and late cord clamping were seen for postpartum hemorrhage or severe postpartum hemorrhage in any of the five trials (2236 women) which measured this outcome (relative risk (RR) for postpartum hemorrhage 500 mls or more 1.22, 95% (CI) 0.96 to 1.55). For neonatal outcomes, our review showed both benefits and harms for late cord clamping. Following birth, there was a significant increase in infants needing phototherapy for jaundice (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.92; five trials of 1,762 infants) in the late compared with early clamping group. This was accompanied by significant increases in newborn hemoglobin levels in the late cord clamping group compared with early cord clamping (weighted mean difference 2.17 g/dL; 95% CI 0.28 to 4.06; three trials of 671 infants), although this effect did not persist past six months. Infant ferritin levels remained higher in the late clamping group than the early clamping group at six months.

Authors' Conclusion

One definition of active management includes directions to administer an uterotonic with birth of the anterior shoulder of the baby and to clamp the umbilical cord within 30–60 seconds of birth of the baby (which is not always feasible in practice). In this review delaying clamping of the cord for at least two to three minutes seems not to increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. In addition, late cord clamping can be advantageous for the infant by improving iron status which may be of clinical value particularly in infants where access to good nutrition is poor, although delaying clamping increases the risk of jaundice requiring phototherapy.
