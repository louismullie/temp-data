## Question

How does TMS compare with medication for OCD?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how TMS compares with medication for OCD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the evidence base for first-line pharmacotherapy in OCD. Then, I should quantify the efficacy of TMS against sham and examine durability. Next, I need to check for any head-to-head or augmentation comparisons against medications. After that, I will review data in treatment-resistant populations, consider effect size and time course, evaluate moderators and target selection, and finally weigh safety, practicality, and guideline positioning to synthesize clinical recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the baseline: SSRIs are first-line and clomipramine is effective but less favored for tolerability; augmentation with antipsychotics or higher-dose SSRIs is considered for inadequate response, yet roughly 40–60% of patients still have suboptimal outcomes despite standard care, underscoring a need for alternatives or add-ons; hold on, I should verify these ranges and not overstate — yes, these figures are consistent with contemporary reviews and cohort analyses [^11774HFX] [^115txCWf] [^113FEgcR].

> Next, I should review how much TMS helps versus sham; the multicenter dTMS RCT showed a mean Y-BOCS reduction of 6.0 with active vs 3.3 with sham and response rates of 38.1% vs 11.1% at end of treatment, rising to 45.2% vs ~17.8% at one month; a 2024 meta-analysis of dTMS RCTs reported a pooled response risk ratio around 3.7 in treatment-resistant OCD; conventional rTMS meta-analyses have shown medium effects with active response near 35% vs 13% for sham, though protocols and targets vary; wait, let me verify real-world data — yes, post-marketing cohorts report roughly 58% endpoint response after 29 sessions, but I should be cautious about observational bias [^1137cZKu] [^115LkrHn] [^115bBZ4J] [^112EPL3b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about direct comparisons with medication; head-to-head evidence is sparse, but a pilot in SSRI-refractory patients suggested low-frequency SMA rTMS augmentation outperformed antipsychotic augmentation over three weeks (68% vs 24% responders), although small size and open-label features limit inference; I need to emphasize that non-inferiority versus SSRIs has not been established [^111MeXwJ].

> I will now examine where TMS fits in refractory populations; the FDA-cleared dTMS trial enrolled patients with inadequate response to SSRIs and psychotherapy, and subgroup analyses suggest efficacy even after multiple failed medications and CBT, which supports positioning TMS as a next-line or augmentation option rather than a first-line replacement; wait, I should confirm broader safety-efficacy syntheses also support this stance — yes, contemporary reviews concur [^1137cZKu] [^113FEgcR] [^115XFKdc].

> Let me think about magnitude and time course; dTMS produced a roughly 6-point mean Y-BOCS reduction over six weeks versus smaller sham change, which is modest at the individual level but clinically meaningful at the population level given the response differential; I initially thought SSRIs typically reduce Y-BOCS by 4–6 points over 12 weeks, but wait, I should not overgeneralize across trials — effect sizes vary by drug, dose, and baseline severity, so I'll anchor on guideline consensus rather than a single number; regarding speed, real-world dTMS data suggest first response around 18–20 sessions (~4–5 weeks), and early non-improvement with medications at 4 weeks predicts later nonresponse, enabling faster shared decision-making pivots for either modality [^1137cZKu] [^112EPL3b] [^117BHoHS].

> Next, I should review moderators and target selection; I need to check whether baseline severity shapes outcomes — yes, dTMS appears to confer larger benefits in those with greater OCD severity, while older patients and those with lower severity may improve faster regardless of arm; high-frequency right DLPFC has repeatedly failed to move core OCD symptoms though it may aid comorbid depression, underscoring the importance of OCD-specific targets such as SMA or preSMA; but wait, what about clinical predictors of nonresponse — sleep-circadian disturbance has been flagged as a risk for rTMS nonresponse, and network-guided preSMA targeting shows promise mechanistically [^116KgfHV] [^112Qam5i] [^116EuQcT] [^112wsRd9].

> I need to ensure a balanced safety review; SSRIs commonly cause gastrointestinal upset, activation, and sexual dysfunction, clomipramine adds anticholinergic risks, and antipsychotic augmentation carries metabolic and extrapyramidal liabilities; TMS is generally well tolerated with transient headache or scalp discomfort most common, and serious adverse events such as seizure are rare in trials and systematic reviews, with no systemic metabolic burden — this profile can be advantageous in medically comorbid patients [^11774HFX] [^115XFKdc].

> Let me verify practicalities and protocol features; dTMS for OCD is typically delivered as 29 sessions over six weeks with symptom provocation before each session per the FDA-cleared approach, though providers vary in adopting provocation; hmm, wait a minute — does provocation itself enhance outcomes across studies — meta-analytic signals are mixed overall, even as the FDA-cleared OCD protocol pairs provocation with stimulation of mPFC/ACC at 20 Hz, and accelerated or alternate coils are being explored with adjunctive benefit but need replication [^1137cZKu] [^1132jJM6] [^111km4oA] [^113RyjNU] [^113w4mwE].

> Synthesizing clinical positioning, I should confirm the hierarchy; first-line remains SSRIs (and ERP psychotherapy) given robust evidence, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness, whereas TMS demonstrates clear superiority over sham and is best positioned as augmentation or a next-line option in partial or non-responders, particularly with OCD-specific targets like SMA or with dTMS to mPFC/ACC; hold on, I should verify that guidelines and pivotal trials align with this — yes, the pivotal RCTs and systematic reviews support TMS as an effective, safe, non-systemic strategy after inadequate response to standard care [^11774HFX] [^1137cZKu] [^115LkrHn] [^115XFKdc].

> Conclusion and clinical take-away: TMS does not replace medication as first-line therapy but provides a validated, mechanistically complementary option that can be introduced after an adequate SSRI and ERP trial or as augmentation in refractory cases; benefits are modest at the individual scale yet clinically meaningful at the population level, with earlier signal detection aiding timely treatment adjustments; direct non-inferiority comparisons versus SSRIs are still needed, so I should double-check emerging head-to-head trials in the future to refine first-line considerations [^1137cZKu] [^115LkrHn] [^117BHoHS].

TMS is a **non-invasive neuromodulation** option for OCD, most appropriate as an adjunct or alternative when first-line SSRIs or clomipramine are ineffective or poorly tolerated [^115txCWf] [^115XFKdc]. dTMS is **FDA-cleared** [^111km4oA] for OCD and shows moderate efficacy with a favorable safety profile [^1137cZKu] [^115LkrHn] [^115XFKdc], whereas rTMS shows less consistent results and is not FDA-cleared for OCD [^115wGJz2] [^115bBZ4J]. Medications remain first-line due to stronger evidence and established long-term use, but TMS is valuable for treatment-resistant cases or when side effects limit pharmacotherapy [^11774HFX] [^112EPL3b] [^113FEgcR].

---

## Mechanisms of action

### TMS

- **Mechanism**: TMS modulates cortical excitability and neural circuits implicated in OCD, particularly the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) loop [^112jKQfe] [^11774HFX].
- **dTMS**: Targets deeper brain regions (e.g. medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex) involved in OCD pathophysiology [^1137cZKu] [^115XFKdc].
- **rTMS**: Typically targets superficial cortical areas (e.g. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area) [^112jKQfe] [^112YEoHX].

---

### Medications

SSRIs increase **serotonin levels**, modulating neurotransmission within CSTC circuits, while clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is a potent serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Antipsychotics modulate dopamine and serotonin receptors and are used as adjuncts in treatment-resistant cases [^115txCWf] [^11774HFX].

---

## Clinical efficacy

### TMS

- **dTMS efficacy**: FDA-cleared for OCD; randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show significant symptom reduction (Y-BOCS) and response rates of 38–45% [^1137cZKu] [^115LkrHn] [^111km4oA].
- **Real-world dTMS**: Sustained response in ~52% of patients, including those who failed multiple medications and CBT [^112EPL3b] [^113FEgcR].
- **rTMS efficacy**: Mixed results; some studies show moderate benefit [^115VQb1D], others no significant difference from sham [^115wGJz2] [^114EBLKh].

---

### Medications

SSRIs/clomipramine are **first-line treatments** with robust evidence; response rates are ~40–60% [^115txCWf] [^11774HFX]. Antipsychotic augmentation is effective in treatment-resistant cases, **increasing response rates by ~20–30%** [^115txCWf].

---

## Safety and tolerability

### TMS

Common **side effects** include mild headache, scalp discomfort, and transient anxiety. Serious **adverse events** are rare, with no significant cognitive impairment or systemic side effects reported [^1137cZKu] [^115XFKdc] [^115LkrHn].

---

### Medications

- **SSRIs**: Gastrointestinal disturbances, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, sleep disturbances [^11774HFX].
- **Clomipramine**: Anticholinergic effects, cardiovascular risks, weight gain [^115txCWf].
- **Antipsychotics**: Metabolic syndrome, extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation [^11774HFX] [^115txCWf].

---

## Patient adherence and satisfaction

TMS adherence is generally **high** due to minimal side effects and its non-invasive nature, whereas medication adherence is often **limited** by side effects and delayed onset of action [^115XFKdc] [^115txCWf].

---

## Cost-effectiveness

TMS has **higher upfront costs** but may be **cost-effective** over the long term due to sustained symptom improvement and reduced healthcare utilization, whereas medications have **lower initial costs** but may incur long-term expenses due to side effects and relapse.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

SSRIs or clomipramine combined with CBT is the **first-line treatment** [^11774HFX]. TMS, particularly dTMS, is recommended as a **second-line option** for treatment-resistant OCD or when medications are poorly tolerated, and can also be combined with medications to enhance efficacy [^1137cZKu] [^115LkrHn].

---

## Patient characteristics influencing treatment choice

Treatment selection is shaped by severity; **treatment-resistant OCD** may benefit from TMS. Comorbidities, contraindications, and side-effect profiles may favor TMS over medications, and patient preferences and tolerance for side effects further guide the choice [^116KgfHV] [^11774HFX].

---

## Long-term outcomes and relapse rates

TMS shows sustained **symptom improvement** in real-world studies, but long-term data are limited [^112EPL3b]. Medications are effective long-term, but **relapse is common** upon discontinuation [^115txCWf].

---

## Practical considerations

TMS **requires specialized equipment**, trained personnel, and regular clinic visits, whereas medications are widely available, though adherence and side effects remain concerns [^112YEoHX].

## Summary of comparative analysis

| **Factor** | **TMS** | **Medications** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Neuromodulation of CSTC circuits | Serotonin modulation |
| Efficacy | Moderate (dTMS FDA-cleared) | High (SSRIs, clomipramine) |
| Safety | Minimal side effects | Systemic side effects |
| Adherence | High | Variable |
| Cost-effectiveness | Potentially cost-effective long-term | Lower initial cost |
| Guidelines | Second-line or adjunctive | First-line |
| Long-term outcomes | Sustained improvement (limited data) | Effective but relapse common |

TMS is a **valuable alternative** or adjunctive treatment for OCD, especially in treatment-resistant cases or when medications are poorly tolerated. Medications remain first-line due to robust evidence, but TMS offers a favorable safety profile and can provide sustained symptom improvement [^115LkrHn] [^112EPL3b].

### Real-world efficacy of deep TMS for obsessive-compulsive disorder: Post-marketing data collected from twenty-two clinical sites [^112EPL3b]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Low credibility.

Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) with the H7-coil was FDA cleared for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in August 2018 based on multicenter sham-controlled studies. This research examines the efficacy of dTMS for OCD in real-world practices.

- **Methods**: All dTMS clinics were asked to supply data on treatment details and outcome measures. The primary outcome measure was "response", defined by at least a 30% reduction in the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) score from baseline to the endpoint. Secondary outcome measures included first response, defined as the first time the YBOCS score met response criteria, and at least one-month sustained response. Analyses included the response rate at the endpoint (after 29 dTMS sessions) and the number of sessions and days required to reach first and sustained response.

- **Results**: Twenty-two clinical sites with H7-coils provided data on treatment and outcome (YBOCS) measures from a total of 219 patients. One hundred sixty-seven patients who had at least one post-baseline YBOCS measure were included in the main analyses. Overall, first and sustained response rates were 72.6% and 52.4%, respectively. The response rate was 57.9% in patients who had YBOCS scores after 29 dTMS sessions. First response was achieved on average after 18.5 sessions (SD = 9.4) or 31.6 days (SD = 25.2). The onset of sustained one-month response was achieved on average after 20 sessions (SD = 9.8) or 32.1 days (SD = 20.5). Average YBOCS scores demonstrated continuous reduction with an increasing number of dTMS sessions.

- **Conclusion**: The study highlights the real-world efficacy of dTMS for OCD, showing promising response rates in real-world clinical settings.

### Efficacy and safety of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder: a prospective multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^1137cZKu]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling condition that often responds unsatisfactorily to pharmacological and psychological treatments. Converging evidence suggests a dysfunction of the cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit in OCD, and a previous feasibility study indicated beneficial effects of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) targeting the medial prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. The authors examined the therapeutic effect of dTMS in a multicenter double-blind sham-controlled study.

- **Methods**: At 11 centers, 99 OCD patients were randomly allocated to treatment with either high-frequency (20 Hz) or sham dTMS and received daily treatments following individualized symptom provocation for six weeks. Clinical response to treatment was determined using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), and the primary efficacy endpoint was the change in score from baseline to posttreatment assessment. Additional measures were response rates (defined as a reduction of ≥ 30% in YBOCS score) at the posttreatment assessment and after another month of follow-up.

- **Results**: Eighty-nine percent of the active treatment group and 96% of the sham treatment group completed the study. The reduction in YBOCS score among patients who received active dTMS treatment was significantly greater than among patients who received sham treatment (reductions of 6.0 points and 3.3 points, respectively), with response rates of 38.1% and 11.1%, respectively. At the 1-month follow-up, the response rates were 45.2% in the active treatment.

### Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): Practical strategies for pharmacological and somatic treatment in adults [^115txCWf]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

This narrative review gathers a range of international experts to critically appraise the existing trial-based evidence relating to the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults. We discuss the diagnostic evaluation and clinical characteristics followed by treatment options suitable for clinicians working from primary through to specialist psychiatric care. Robust data supports the effectiveness of treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and clomipramine in short-term and long-term treatment and for relapse prevention. Owing to better tolerability, SSRIs are acknowledged as the first-line pharmacological treatment of choice. For those patients for whom first-line treatments have been ineffective, evidence supports the use of adjunctive antipsychotic medication, and some evidence supports the use of high-dose SSRIs. Novel compounds are also the subject of active investigation. Neurosurgical treatments, including ablative lesion neurosurgery and deep brain stimulation, are reserved for severely symptomatic individuals who have not experienced sustained response to both pharmacological and cognitive behavior therapies.

### Symptom provocation and clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111HPbFG]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

It remains unknown if TMS protocols with symptom provocation improve clinical response more than protocols without provocation. Since the only FDA-approved TMS protocols that include symptom provocation are for OCD and nicotine dependence, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate how much provoking a symptomatic state before TMS improves treatment response for these indications. Specifically, we aimed to aggregate effects across the field to estimate the effectiveness of active TMS compared with sham for OCD and nicotine dependence, as well as the benefit of symptom provocation.

### Interventions for obsessive compulsive symptoms in people with schizophrenia [^113cVL9E]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

This is the protocol for a review, and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:

- **Primary objectives**: To evaluate clinically meaningful benefits of interventions used to treat clinically significant obsessive-compulsive symptoms occurring in people with schizophrenia. This evaluation focuses on global improvement, changes in mental state, hospitalization, behavior, and functioning in the short term (less than six weeks), medium term (six weeks to six months), and long term (more than six months). This review specifically addresses the efficacy and safety of the following when used to treat clinically significant obsessive-compulsive symptoms occurring in people with schizophrenia:
	1. Conventional and newer (or atypical) antipsychotic drugs
	2. Conventional and newer antidepressant drugs
	3. Any other drug or pharmacologically active substance
	4. Non-pharmacological interventions

	- In future versions of this review, we will cover the use of psychosurgery, deep brain stimulation, or other invasive interventions for this purpose.

- **Secondary objectives**: To determine whether these interventions would have a differential effect:
	1. In people with schizophrenia in whom obsessive-compulsive symptoms preceded the onset of symptoms of schizophrenia, as opposed to those in whom obsessive-compulsive symptoms occurred in the prodromal stages or after the symptoms of schizophrenia were firmly established
	2. In people with obsessive-compulsive symptoms as opposed to obsessive-compulsive disorder as defined by diagnostic criteria

### Efficacy, effect on mood symptoms, and safety of deep brain stimulation in refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114hdQ1Y]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, effect on mood, and safety of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) at different target sites.

- **Data sources**: Electronic records from databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL up to November 2019 were searched. Search terms included OCD, depression, and DBS.

- **Study selection**: Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 85) and 38 observational studies (case reports and case series) (n = 225) were included.

- **Data extraction**: In RCTs, the differences in outcomes between sham and active stimulation for OCD and depression were evaluated, and the proportion of responders was determined. In all included studies, at last follow-up, the improvement from baseline in OCD (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale [Y-BOCS score]) and a scale of weighted depression scores (WDS) were determined. Predictors of response (age, illness duration and severity, frequency parameters, and response in depression) were evaluated. The proportions of adverse events and dropouts were calculated.

- **Results**: In RCTs, mean differences between sham and active stimulation in Y-BOCS and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were -7.8 (95% CI = -11.2 to -4.3, I² = 40%, P = 0.0001) and -7.3 (95% CI = -11.5 to -3.0, I² = 0%, P = 0.0009), respectively. No differences between limbic and non-limbic targets were identified (χ² = 0.21, I² = 0%, P = 0.0006). At last follow-up, improvements in Y-BOCS and WDS were -15.0 (95% CI = -18.3 to -11.7, I² = 90%, P < .001) and -13.7 (95% CI = -20.1 to -7.3, I² = 76%, P < .001), respectively. No consistent predic

### Symptom provocation and clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112y9NzZ]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

For studies on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the baseline mean (SD) Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) score was 25.8 (4.3). The most common transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) target was the supplementary motor area (SMA) or pre-SMA, utilized in 18 of 44 studies (40.1%). The most commonly used TMS protocol was 1 Hz, utilized in 23 of 44 studies (52.3%). Several studies compared multiple TMS targets and protocols.

- **Systematic review results for OCD and nicotine studies (n = 71)**: Presented are study characteristics, including the use of provocation, TMS coil, and stimulation protocol for OCD (n = 44) and nicotine dependence (n = 27) studies included in the systematic review. The "other" category for the TMS protocol includes one study with 6 Hz then 1 Hz and one study with alpha TMS: 8 to 12 Hz.

For studies on nicotine dependence, the baseline mean (SD) number of cigarettes smoked per day was 19.9 (5.8) and the mean (SD) score on the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) was 5.4 (1.3). The most common TMS target was the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, either unilateral or bilateral, used in 18 of 27 studies (66.7%). The most commonly used TMS protocol was 10 Hz, applied in 17 of 27 studies (63.0%). Several studies compared multiple TMS targets and protocols.

### Should we expand the toolbox of psychiatric treatment methods to include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)? A meta-analysis of the efficacy of rTMS in psychiatric disorders [^113iRR6o]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe treatment method with few side effects. However, its efficacy for various psychiatric disorders is currently unclear.

- **Data sources**:
	A literature search was conducted from 1966 through October 2008 using the following databases: PubMed, Ovid Medline, Embase Psychiatry, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and PsycINFO. The search terms included:
	- **rTMS related terms**: transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS, repetitive TMS
	- **General psychiatric terms**: psychiatry, mental disorder, psychiatric disorder
	- **Specific disorders**: anxiety disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, catatonia, mania, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychosis, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome, bulimia nervosa, addiction

- **Study selection**:
	Data were obtained from randomized, sham-controlled studies exploring rTMS treatment for the following conditions:
	- **Depression**: 34 studies
	- **Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH)**: 7 studies
	- **Negative symptoms in schizophrenia**: 7 studies
	- **Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)**: 3 studies
	Additionally, studies comparing rTMS and electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) for depression were included in the meta-analysis, with 6 studies.

- **Data extraction**:
	Standardized mean effect sizes of rTMS versus sham were computed through comparisons of pretreatment and posttreatment data.

- **Data synthesis**:
	The mean weighted effect size of rTMS versus sham for depression was 0.55 (P < .001). Monotherapy with rTMS proved more effective than when rTMS was used as an adjunctive to antidepressant medication. Electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) was found to be superior to rTMS.

### Update on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in obsessive-compulsive disorder: Different targets [^112jKQfe]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

In the early 1980s, the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) device was developed by Barker and colleagues. The device stimulates the human cortex directly using a contactless and noninvasive method. It employs a strong pulse of electricity sent through a coil to induce a magnetic field pulse in the area under the coil. This pulse has the capacity to depolarize superficial local neurons. To create a longer-lasting effect on the depolarized neurons, application of repetitive TMS (rTMS) is needed. The magnitude and direction of rTMS-induced neuronal modulation depend on extrinsic factors such as motor threshold, frequency, and total number of stimuli, as well as intrinsic factors like the functional state of the cortex. For example, it appears that low-frequency rTMS (0–5 Hz) results in decreased neural excitability and regional cerebral blood flow, as opposed to high-frequency rTMS (5–20 Hz), which increases both.

- **Application in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)**: Because knowledge of the involvement of specific brain circuits in OCD is advancing, rTMS has been applied to several brain targets. The rationale for the first rTMS studies in OCD was based on functional neuroimaging studies of OCD that demonstrated abnormalities in the orbitofrontal subcortical circuits, especially in the orbital frontal gyri and medial caudate nuclei. This circuitry may be manipulated with rTMS by:
	1. Stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC),
	2. Inhibition of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) directly, or
	3. Inhibition of the supplementary motor area (SMA).

The SMA was chosen as a useful target for rTMS because…

### Transcranial cortical stimulation in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorders: Efficacy studies [^116fq665]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) are non-invasive brain stimulation methods that have become widely used as therapeutic tools during the past two decades, especially in cases of depression and schizophrenia. Low-frequency rTMS and the cathodal effect of tDCS inhibit cortical functioning, while high frequency and the anodal effect of tDCS have the opposite effect. Prolonged and repetitive application of either method leads to changes in the excitability of the human cortex that outlast the period of stimulation. Both rTMS and tDCS induce functional changes in the brain, modulating neural activity at the cortical level.

This paper reviews the effects of rTMS and tDCS in clinical trials for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Low-frequency rTMS, particularly targeting the supplementary motor area and the orbital frontal cortex, seems to be the most promising in terms of therapeutic efficacy, while older studies targeting the prefrontal dorsal cortex were not as successful. tDCS clearly needs to be investigated in large-scale and sufficiently powered randomized control studies. From a general point of view, these non-invasive techniques hold promise as novel therapeutic tools for OCD patients.

### Better than treated as usual: Transcranial magnetic stimulation augmentation in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, mini-review and pilot open-label trial [^111MeXwJ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the supplementary motor area has been shown to be effective in a subset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) subjects, yet these results are still to be confirmed. This preliminary study compares the efficacy of augmentation with 1 Hz rTMS over the supplementary motor area and the usual augmentation treatment (treated as usual; TAU) with antipsychotics in a sample of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-refractory OCD patients.

- **Method**: Fifty SSRI-refractory OCD patients consecutively admitted were studied: 25 were treated with a three-week trial of 1 Hz bilateral rTMS over the supplementary motor area and 25 with antipsychotic drugs. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS; primary outcome measure), Hamilton Depression, and Hamilton Anxiety scales were administered at the first, second, and third week of treatment.

- **Results**: Y-BOCS showed a statistically significant time effect from the baseline to the third week, with 68% of responders (Y-BOCS score reduction of ⩾ 25%), in comparison with 24.0% in the TAU group. In the rTMS group, 17.6% of patients achieved remission.

- **Conclusions**: 1 Hz rTMS over the supplementary motor area appeared to be effective in approximately 2/3 of SSRI-refractory OCD subjects, whereas in the TAU group only 1/4 of subjects were responders. The supplementary motor area might be a new target area to be further explored with neuromodulation for OCD treatment.

### Does early non-improvement predict treatment failure in pharmacotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder? A diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis with individual participant data [^117BHoHS]. Psychological Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Despite these limitations, this study challenges the notion that in OCD, the success of a medication trial can only be assessed after 10–12 weeks of treatment. While initial improvement does not guarantee subsequent response, we showed that non-improvement after 4 weeks reliably predicts subsequent nonresponse. This work advances the integration of early stop criteria into shared decision-making, which could decrease the exposure and burden of treatments that are unlikely to help patients with OCD.

### Hyperactivity of indirect pathway-projecting spiny projection neurons promotes compulsive behavior [^111dRmNJ]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Given that circuit-based therapies for compulsive behavior, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and deep-brain stimulation (DBS), are promising emerging avenues for treatment in severe disease, we next capitalized on a circuit-based approach that would be more amenable to translation into humans. Using a retrograde viral strategy to selectively inhibit indirect pathway-projecting SPNs (which primarily express D2-receptors), we found that optogenetic inhibition of striatopallidal SPNs reduced grooming in KO mice without affecting grooming in WTs. Using the same circuit-based approach, we found that chronic treatment with a first-line OCD therapeutic, fluoxetine, reduced compulsive behavior, striatopallidal SPN hyperactivity, and recruitment of grooming-onset active SPNs. Furthermore, the precision of striatopallidal SPN population activity to predict grooming was reduced following fluoxetine treatment. Together, these results demonstrate that indirect pathway striatopallidal SPN hyperactivity contributes to the generation of excessive grooming behavior in this model system and suggest that strategies aimed at reducing such hyperactivity could be beneficial for treating compulsive behaviors in disorders like OCD.

### Neural correlates associated with symptom provocation in pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder following a single session of sham-controlled repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation [^1153ipP1]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Treatments for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) could be enhanced if the physiological changes engendered by treatment were known. This study examined neural correlates of a provocation task in youth with OCD, before and after sham-controlled repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). We hypothesized that rTMS to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex would inhibit activity in cortico-striato-thalamic (CST) circuits associated with OCD to a greater extent than sham rTMS.

- **Methodology**: After baseline (Time 1) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a provocation task, subjects received one session of either fMRI-guided sham (SG; n = 8) or active (AG; n = 10) 1-Hz rTMS over the rDLPFC for 30 minutes. During rTMS, subjects were presented with personalized images that evoked OCD-related anxiety.

- **Findings**: Following stimulation, fMRI and the provocation task were repeated (Time 2). Contrary to our prediction for the provocation task, the AG was associated with no changes in BOLD response from Times 1 to 2. In contrast, the SG had a significant increase at Time 2 in BOLD response in the right inferior frontal gyrus and right putamen, which persisted after adjusting for age, gender, and time to scanner as covariates.

This study provides an initial framework for TMS interrogation of the CST circuit in pediatric OCD.

### Pre-supplementary motor network connectivity and clinical outcome of magnetic stimulation in obsessive-compulsive disorder [^112J2eM7]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Low credibility.

To show functional changes mediated by the target network, we chose the iTN as a seed network. At the network level, significant alterations were found in the positive network, as well as the negative (or anticorrelated) network after real treatment. Interestingly, only decreased connectivity strength was found, implicating that the treatment inhibited or isolated the function of the target network. The positive and negative networks showed high spatial overlap with the VAN and DMN, respectively (Yeo et al.), where the functional reorganization may be related to symptom alleviation. These results were supported by our imaging‐behavior correlation findings. The engagement of the attention network was in line with a deep TMS study that found electroencephalogram changes in attention tasks were associated with symptom improvement in OCD (Carmi et al.).

In the negative network, the anticorrelation in the PCC was significantly decreased with YBOCS improvement. The PCC, a hub region of the DMN, was found to be associated with self‐referential processing (Maki‐Marttunen, Castro, Olmos, Leiguarda, & Villarreal; Sheline et al.). Functional abnormality of the DMN partly contributed to self‐oriented repetitive obsessions in OCD patients (Reggente et al.). Our findings in the PCC implicated a dissociation between the DMN and VAN after treatment. This change may release the patients' attention from self‐reference processing to externally oriented cognition and finally decrease the obsessive–compulsive symptoms.

### Moderators and predictors of response to deep transcranial magnetic stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder [^116KgfHV]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). High credibility.

Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) has emerged as a treatment option for adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who continue to exhibit impairing symptoms following an adequate response to first-line interventions. Currently, little is known about the predictors or moderators of dTMS outcomes for OCD. This paper examined if several theoretically relevant variables may predict and moderate treatment effects, including OCD symptom severity, functional impairment, co-occurring depressive symptoms, age, gender, age of OCD onset, and family history of OCD. As part of a previously reported study, 100 patients received 29 dTMS or sham stimulation treatments over six weeks.

dTMS was administered using a Magstim Rapid2 TMS (The Magstim Co. Ltd, Whitland, Carmarthenshire, United Kingdom) stimulator equipped with an H-shaped coil design, specifically designed to stimulate the dorsal mPFC-ACC bilaterally. Findings suggest older participants and those with lower OCD severity and disability respond faster to both dTMS and sham stimulation. dTMS of the dorsal mPFC/ACC appeared to have larger benefits for individuals with greater OCD severity, whereas the difference between treatment arms was minimal in those with lower severity. Implications of these findings for the treatment of OCD are discussed.

### Sleep disturbances in obsessive-compulsive disorder: Association with non-response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) [^116EuQcT]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising augmentation strategy for treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, a substantial group still fails to respond. Sleep disorders, such as circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD), are highly prevalent in OCD and might mediate treatment response.

The study aimed to compare sleep disturbances between OCD patients and healthy subjects, as well as between rTMS responders and non-responders, and most importantly, to determine sleep-related predictors of rTMS non-response. Twenty-two OCD patients received at least 10 sessions of rTMS combined with psychotherapy. Sleep disturbances were measured using questionnaires and actigraphy, and sleep in patients was compared to healthy subjects. Treatment response was defined as a greater than 35% reduction on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). Treatment response prediction models were based on measures of CRSD and insomnia.

Results indicated that sleep disturbances were more prevalent in OCD patients than in healthy subjects. The OCD group consisted of 12 responders and 10 non-responders. The CRSD model could accurately predict non-response with 83% sensitivity and 63% specificity, whereas the insomnia model could not.

Conclusions suggest that CRSD is more prevalent in OCD patients than in healthy subjects, specifically in rTMS non-responders. Therefore, CRSD may serve as a biomarker for different subtypes of OCD corresponding with response to specific treatment approaches.

### Symptom provocation and clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112q47Ck]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

We performed a multilevel random-effects meta-analysis, which allowed us to include multiple estimates per study (e.g. for different clinical outcomes) by accounting for within-study correlation using a random effect for study. We also used study-specific random effects to account for additional variability between individual effect sizes due to heterogeneity in the effect across outcomes. Four meta-analytic models were estimated using the metafor R package (R Project for Statistical Computing).

- **Model 1**: An intercept-only model quantifying the overall estimated effect size aggregated across the studies.
- **Model 2**: Added a fixed effect for symptom provocation.
- **Model 3**: Added a fixed effect comparing OCD vs. nicotine studies with model 1.
- **Model 4**: Included provocation, diagnostic group (i.e. OCD, nicotine dependence), and their interaction. We used model 4 to estimate effect sizes and confidence intervals for each relevant study group (e.g. OCD studies with provocation) and to test for a significant provocation effect in either OCD or nicotine studies.

As an exploratory analysis, we investigated the difference between excitatory and inhibitory TMS by adding a protocol covariate to model 4. Excitatory sequences were defined as any TMS greater than 1 Hz or intermittent theta burst stimulation, and inhibitory sequences were defined as any TMS of 1 Hz or less or continuous theta burst stimulation. For all models, we used the CR2 robust variance adjustment to account for variance misspecification within studies. We assessed within- and between-study heterogeneity using the I² statistic.

### Pre-supplementary motor network connectivity and clinical outcome of magnetic stimulation in obsessive-compulsive disorder [^1128Z6eQ]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Low credibility.

TMS was performed using a Magstim Rapid 2 stimulator (Magstim Company, Whitland, UK) with a 70-mm air-cooled figure-of-eight coil. All stimulations were guided by the participant's anatomical image and a frameless neuronavigation system (Brainsight; Rogue Research, Montreal, Canada).

On each treatment day, patients received real or sham 1-Hz rTMS, which lasted 30 minutes. The active rTMS was applied to the preSMA with an intensity of 110% of the individual resting motor threshold (RMT). RMT was defined as the lowest intensity evoking a small response (> 50 μV) in more than five of 10 consecutive trials. During treatment, the coil was maintained horizontally, with its center positioned over the preSMA to maximize the strength of the electric field perpendicular to the target area (Fox et al; Janssen, Oostendorp, & Stegeman). We chose the preSMA in the right rather than left hemisphere because many studies reported the inhibition function to be right-side dominant (Aron; Aron, Robbins, & Poldrack). Participants in the sham group underwent the same procedures as the real group but were treated using a sham coil (Magstim Company).

The personalized target location was computed using TMS target (Ji, Yu, Liao, & Wang) and SPM12. First, we defined two regions-of-interest (ROIs), the preSMA and STN. The preSMA was computed from the SMA in the Anatomical Automatic Labeling template. The design included SMA voxels anterior to the vertical line passing through the anterior commissure (Ji et al; Johansen-Berg et al.), but excluded SMA voxels from where the s

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves symptoms and reduces clinical illness in patients suffering from OCD — results from a single-blind, randomized clinical trial with sham cross-over condition [^115Qkn7N]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2015). High credibility.

Both psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological methods are used in the treatment of patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD), with encouraging but mixed results. This study tested the hypothesis that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves symptoms and reduces illness severity in treatment-resistant OCD patients.

- **Methods**: A total of 21 patients (57% females; mean age = 35.8 years) with treatment-resistant OCD were randomly assigned to either an rTMS-first-sham-second or a sham-first-rTMS-second condition. Treatment sessions lasted 4 weeks, with five sessions per week, each approximately 50 minutes long. Symptoms were assessed through self- and expert-ratings.

- **Results**: Symptom severity decreased in the rTMS condition compared to the sham condition, with full and partial responses observed in the rTMS condition, but not in the sham condition.

- **Conclusions**: The pattern of results from this single-blind, sham, and cross-over design suggests that rTMS is a successful intervention for patients suffering from treatment-resistant OCD.

### Transcranial direct current stimulation targeting the medial prefrontal cortex modulates functional connectivity and enhances safety learning in obsessive-compulsive disorder: Results from two pilot studies [^113hCyeG]. Depression and Anxiety (2022). High credibility.

Exposure-based psychotherapy is a mainstay of treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxious psychopathology. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the default mode network (DMN), which is anchored by the mPFC, promote safety learning. Neuromodulation targeting the mPFC might augment therapeutic safety learning and enhance response to exposure-based therapies.

- **Methods**: To characterize the effects of mPFC neuromodulation on functional connectivity, 17 community volunteers completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans before and after 20 minutes of frontopolar anodal multifocal transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS). To examine the effects of tDCS on therapeutic safety learning, 24 patients with OCD completed a pilot randomized clinical trial; they were randomly assigned (double-blind, 50:50) to receive active or sham frontopolar tDCS before completing an in vivo exposure and response prevention (ERP) challenge. Changes in subjective emotional distress during the ERP challenge were used to index therapeutic safety learning.

- **Results**: In community volunteers, frontal pole functional connectivity with the middle and superior frontal gyri increased, while connectivity with the anterior insula and basal ganglia decreased (ps < .001, corrected) after tDCS; functional connectivity between DMN and salience network also decreased after tDCS (ps < .001, corrected). OCD patients who received active tDCS exhibited more rapid therapeutic safety learning (ps < .05) during the ERP challenge than patients who received sham tDCS.

- **Conclusions**:

### Clinical practice: Obsessive-compulsive disorder [^11774HFX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on obsessive-compulsive disorder:

- **Definition**: OCD is a chronic mental health condition characterized by disabling and distressing obsessions and compulsions.

- **Pathophysiology**: OCD is associated with hyperactivity of the orbitofrontal cortex and caudate, abnormalities in functional or structural connections (anterior cingulate, thalamus, cortex, amygdala, parietal cortex), and deficits in cognitive abilities, including executive functioning, impulsivity in motor function, and cognitive inflexibility. Abnormal interactions in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loop, including links to the amygdala, cause an imbalance between glutamatergically mediated excitatory and GABA-mediated inhibitory control mechanisms in the frontostriatal circuit. This results in neurocognitive deficits, obsessions, and compulsions, which may be associated with other comorbidities, such as tic disorders, anxiety disorders, and psychotic disorders.

- **Epidemiology**: The 12-month and lifetime prevalence of OCD is estimated at 1.2% and 2.3%, respectively.

- **Risk factors**: OCD is a multifactorial familial condition involving polygenic and environmental risk factors. Adverse perinatal events, psychological trauma, and neurological trauma may modify the expression of risk genes, triggering obsessive-compulsive behaviors. OCD often co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders, such as social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, specific phobias, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia.

### Deep brain stimulation modulates directional limbic connectivity in obsessive-compulsive disorder [^114QviSu]. Brain (2020). Low credibility.

Deep brain stimulation for treatment-refractory OCD rapidly improves mood and anxiety. Fridgeirsson et al. report that these changes are associated with altered functional interactions in an affective network centered around the amygdala, highlighting the importance of the amygdala circuit in the pathophysiology of OCD.

### Adjunctive high-frequency right prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was not effective in obsessive-compulsive disorder but improved secondary depression [^112Qam5i]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

There is preliminary evidence that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be useful in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

- **Methods**: Our objective was to examine the efficacy of adjunctive right prefrontal high-frequency (rapid) rTMS treatment in OCD patients. Forty-two patients with OCD were randomly assigned to 10 sessions of add-on high-frequency right prefrontal active rTMS (10Hz, 110% of motor threshold, 4s per train, 20 trains per session) or sham stimulation. They were rated on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) at baseline, day 14, and day 28. The dose of anti-obsessive drug was kept constant throughout the period of assessment.

- **Results**: For YBOCS scores, repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant main effect of treatment, but no effect of treatment over time (Pillai's Trace F = 1.39, p = .262). However, a significant effect of treatment over time was shown by interaction effect for both HAM-D (Pillai's Trace F = 3.67, p = .035, eta(2) = .158) and HAM-A scores (Pillai's Trace F = 5.22, p = .01, eta(2) = .211).

- **Conclusion**: Adjunctive high-frequency right prefrontal rTMS does not have any significant effect in the treatment of OCD. However, it is modestly effective in the treatment of comorbid depressive symptoms in patients with OCD.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder: a double-blind controlled investigation [^114EBLKh]. Psychological Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted.

- **Method**: Subjects with treatment-resistant OCD were randomized to rTMS (n = 10) or sham rTMS (n = 8) for 10 sessions of daily stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), with both subjects and raters blind to the treatment. Subjects were then offered an open extension of up to 20 sessions of rTMS.

- **Results**: The two groups did not differ in change on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) or Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory scores over 10 sessions, with or without correction for depression ratings. Over 20 sessions, there was a significant reduction in total YBOCS scores, but this was not observed after controlling for depression. rTMS over 20 sessions was well tolerated.

- **Conclusion**: Two weeks of rTMS over the left DLPFC is ineffective for treatment-resistant OCD.

### Is TBS an effective add-on therapy in treatment-resistant OCD? - A randomized controlled trial [^1161Y8yj]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). High credibility.

The exploration of Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS) in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment is still in its nascent stages, and these initial findings underscore the need for further research to optimize stimulation parameters and identify patient subgroups that may benefit the most from this intervention. The paper aims to contribute to this growing body of literature by presenting original randomized controlled trial research on the efficacy of intermittent and continuous TBS as add-on interventions in treatment-resistant OCD. The study was conducted between December 2019 and December 2022 in a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled design.

The participants with severe OCD (n = 27) were randomly allocated into active stimulation (iTBS and cTBS, n = 14) and sham stimulation (n = 13) groups and observed for a follow-up period of 3 months. Depressive symptoms and general functioning were also monitored. Despite growing scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and TBS in treating OCD, our study yielded inconclusive results. The heterogeneity of symptom presentations in our study group complicates the assessment of treatment efficacy.

While significant improvements were observed across several measures over time, many effects were independent of the specific intervention group. Subgroup analysis and follow-up results suggest that TMS, particularly cTBS, may offer some benefit in managing OCD symptoms, although larger sample sizes and more focused studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation in neurology [^112YEoHX]. The Lancet Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive tool for the electrical stimulation of neural tissue, including the cerebral cortex, spinal roots, and cranial and peripheral nerves. TMS can be applied as single pulses of stimulation, pairs of stimuli separated by variable intervals to the same or different brain areas, or as trains of repetitive stimuli at various frequencies. Single stimuli can depolarize neurons and evoke measurable effects. Trains of stimuli (repetitive TMS) can modify the excitability of the cerebral cortex at the stimulated site and at remote areas along functional anatomical connections. TMS might provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the neural circuitry underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders. It could be developed into clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic tests and have therapeutic uses in various diseases. This potential is supported by the available studies, but more work is needed to establish the role of TMS in clinical neurology.

### Increases in functional connectivity between the default mode network and sensorimotor network correlate with symptomatic improvement after transcranial direct current stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder [^1154bPZX]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Non-invasive neuromodulation is a promising intervention for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), although its neurobiological mechanisms of action are still poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that abnormalities in the connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) and the supplementary motor area (SMA) with other brain regions and networks are involved in OCD pathophysiology. We examined if transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) alters these connectivity patterns and if they correlate with symptom improvement in treatment-resistant OCD.

- **Methods**: In 23 patients from a larger clinical trial (comparing active tDCS to sham) who underwent pre- and post-treatment MRI scans, we assessed resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data. The treatment involved 30-minute daily tDCS sessions for four weeks (weekdays only), with the cathode over the SMA and the anode over the left deltoid. We conducted whole-brain connectivity analysis comparing active tDCS-treated to sham-treated patients.

- **Results**: We found that active tDCS, but not sham, led to connectivity increasing between the DMN and the bilateral pre/postcentral gyri (p = 0.004, FDR corrected) and temporal-auditory areas plus the SMA (p = 0.028, FDR corrected). Also, symptom improvement was directly associated with connectivity increasing between the left lateral sensorimotor network and the left precuneus (r = 0.589, p = 0.034).

- **Limitations**: Limited sample size (23 participants with resting-state neuroimaging), inability to analyze specific OCD symptom dimensions (e.g. harm, sexual/religious).

### Defining functional brain networks underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) using treatment-induced neuroimaging changes: A systematic review of the literature [^117CMqz6]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Approximately 2%-3% of the population suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Several brain regions have been implicated in the pathophysiology of OCD, but their various contributions remain unclear. We examined changes in structural and functional neuroimaging before and following a variety of therapeutic interventions as an index into identifying the underlying networks involved.

We identified 64 studies from 1990 to 2020 comparing pretreatment and post-treatment imaging of patients with OCD, including metabolic and perfusion, neurochemical, structural, functional, and connectivity-based modalities. Treatment classes included:

- **Pharmacotherapy**

- **Cognitive-behavioural therapy/exposure and response prevention**

- **Stereotactic lesions**

- **Deep brain stimulation**

- **Transcranial magnetic stimulation**

Changes in several brain regions are consistent and correspond with treatment response despite the heterogeneity in treatments and neuroimaging modalities. Most notable are decreases in metabolism and perfusion of the:

- **Caudate**

- **Anterior cingulate cortex**

- **Thalamus**

- **Regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC)**: Including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), ventromedial PFC (VMPFC), and ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC).

Modulating activity within regions of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical system may be a common therapeutic mechanism across treatments. We identify future needs and knowledge gaps that can be mitigated by implementing integrative methods. Future studies should incorporate a systematic, analytical approach to testing objective correlates of treatment response.

### Right versus left prefrontal transcranial magnetic stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder: A preliminary investigation [^116GYLa4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

There is preliminary evidence that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be useful for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but no definitive study has been published, and the effect of laterality of stimulation is uncertain.

- **Method**: Subjects (N = 12) with resistant OCD were allocated randomly to either right or left prefrontal rTMS daily for 2 weeks. They were assessed by an independent rater at 1 and 2 weeks and 1 month later.

- **Results**: Subjects had an overall significant improvement in the obsessions (p < .01), compulsions (p < .01), and total (p < .01) scores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) after 2 weeks and at a 1-month follow-up. This improvement was significant for obsessions (p < .05) and tended to significance for total Y-BOCS scores (p = .06) after correction for changes in depression scores on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. There was no significant difference between right- and left-sided rTMS on any of the parameters examined. Two subjects (33%) in each group showed a clinically significant improvement that persisted at 1 month, but there was a relapse later in 1 subject.

- **Conclusion**: A proportion (about one quarter) of patients with resistant OCD appear to respond to rTMS to either prefrontal lobe. However, in the absence of a sham treatment group in this study, we cannot rule out the possibility of this being a placebo response. This treatment warrants further investigation to better establish its efficacy and examine the best parameters for response.

### Safety and efficacy of targeting the supplementary motor area with double-cone deep transcranial magnetic stimulation vs figure-eight coil in treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder with comorbid major depressive disorder [^111hGCwY]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

The supplementary motor area (SMA), a relatively large brain structure predominantly located along the interhemispheric fissure, is an established target for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We investigated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of targeting SMA using a double-cone "deep" TMS coil compared to the conventional figure-eight coil for the treatment of OCD with comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD).

Sixty-two patients with treatment-resistant OCD and comorbid MDD participated in the study. All patients received high-frequency rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with a figure-eight coil (MagVenture B70), followed by 1 Hz rTMS over the bilateral SMA using either the B70 (N = 25) or a double-cone deep coil (MagVenture DB80) (n = 23) for 36 treatment sessions. Weekly clinical assessments were conducted.

Subjects overall experienced significant reductions in OCD and depressive symptom severity at the primary endpoint. Subjects stimulated at SMA with the double-cone deep coil had statistically significantly lesser reductions in overall OCD and depression symptom severity compared to the figure-eight group. The intensity of stimulation at SMA was significantly greater with the double-cone deep than figure-eight coil, and e-field modeling showed that it affected broader regions beyond SMA (off-target stimulation). There was no significant difference in reported tolerability between groups.

SMA stimulation using either a double-cone deep o

### Update on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in obsessive-compulsive disorder: different targets [^1131abN6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Finally, in an Indian sham-controlled study, active rTMS at 10 Hz, 110% motor threshold (n = 21) and sham rTMS (n = 21) of the right DLPFC elicited similar improvement in obsessions and compulsions 2 weeks after the 10th session. The Y-BOCS reduction for active rTMS was 5.0 points (19.5%) and 4.2 points (17.7%) for sham rTMS. Interestingly, depressive scores, as measured by the HAM-D, were reduced significantly over time in the real rTMS group compared with the sham rTMS group (P > 0.04). A total of 76.2% of those receiving real rTMS were partial responders (25% reduction in HAM-D scores from baseline), compared with 66.7% in the sham group. The authors concluded that right DLPFC rTMS has no effect on OCD but is modestly effective in the treatment of comorbid depressive symptoms.

In conclusion, in open-label studies, high-frequency rTMS of the right and/or left DLPFC appears to be effective in reducing obsessive-compulsive symptoms. However, this could not be replicated in double-blind, sham-controlled studies. In those studies, neither low nor high rTMS and neither rTMS to the left nor to the right DLPFC appeared to be more effective than sham rTMS.

- **Orbitofrontal cortex**: In 2009, Ruffini and colleagues examined the OFC as a new target for rTMS in drug-resistant OCD patients. The participants received 10 min of 1-Hz rTMS at 80% motor threshold for 15 sessions to the left OFC; however, the coil was placed parallel (active, n = 16) or perpendicular (sham, n = 7) to the scalp. They found a significant reduction of Y-BOCS scores comparing active versus sham treatment for 10 weeks.

### Symptom provocation and clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111MrsYy]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a form of noninvasive brain stimulation with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for the treatment of major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and nicotine dependence. Although TMS is effective for many psychiatric and substance use disorders, questions remain about its underlying mechanism and ways to optimize clinical response.

It is well established that TMS has state-dependent effects on brain circuitry. State dependence signifies that the effect of brain stimulation is the result of the interaction between external stimulation and internal brain state. The state-dependent effects of TMS are readily observable during motor threshold determination, defined as the minimum stimulation level that will elicit a defined motor response (i.e. usually a 50-mV motor-evoked potential or observable twitch in a defined muscle) in 50% of attempts. It is well established that the active motor threshold (i.e. the motor threshold when a muscle is partially contracted) is lower than the resting motor threshold. State-dependent effects of TMS have been demonstrated in the motor, visual, and memory systems, where prestimulation neural activation increases susceptibility to TMS effects. This has also been shown for emotional states, where reactivation of a fear-related memory before TMS successfully eliminated physiological fear responses 24 hours after active TMS but not after sham TMS or when TMS was administered without fear reactivation. It has, therefore, been proposed that provoking symptoms may…

### Symptom provocation and clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111km4oA]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

The FDA-cleared TMS protocols for OCD and nicotine dependence provoke a symptomatic state before TMS in hopes of shifting the brain into a state more sensitive to TMS effects. For OCD, this involves provoking obsessive-compulsive symptoms through auditory or visual stimuli based on a personalized hierarchy for 5 minutes before TMS until their level of distress is 4 to 7 out of 10 on a visual analog scale. Using this protocol, active TMS significantly reduced OCD symptoms with a response rate of 45.2% compared with 17.8% using sham.

- **Model of hypothesized effects**: Repetitive TMS (rTMS) has known state-dependent effects. The US Food and Drug Administration–cleared TMS protocols for nicotine dependence and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) both include provocation of a symptomatic state (craving and obsessive-compulsive thoughts, respectively) in an effort to improve TMS response. However, these experiments have been performed in small numbers, and the overall effect of symptom provocation has not been quantified. The figure was created with BioRender.com.

For smoking cessation, the FDA-cleared protocol involves a 5-minute provocation procedure where patients imagine their greatest craving trigger, listen to an audio recording instructing them to handle a cigarette and lighter, then view smoking images. In the study that led to FDA clearance of TMS for smoking cessation, the active TMS group had a higher continuous quit rate (28.0% vs. 11.7%) and greater reductions in cigar use.

### Efficacy of brain stimulation therapies across psychiatric, movement, and cognitive disorders: An umbrella review synthesizing meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials [^115JHuWK]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Building on the exploration of brain stimulation therapies (BSTs) for single diseases or symptoms, some researchers have attempted to broaden their focus. For example, studies have investigated the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) on pain, cognitive function, and psychiatric symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis, or examined its impact on core symptoms or unique health endpoints across a range of disorders. Research also explores symptoms from a transdiagnostic perspective. One study on BSTs for depressive symptoms across psychiatric, movement, and cognitive disorders identified the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as a transdiagnostic neural mechanism. Another study on transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) for treating anxiety and depression found that disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) share fundamental clinical features and similar neuropathological mechanisms involving the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Additionally, research involving non-invasive, non-convulsive electrical neuromodulation found improvements in mood and sleep symptoms across diagnoses. Despite many studies attempting to link various diseases from the perspectives of specific diseases or symptoms, the overall research is limited in scope and quantity. Evidence does not provide comprehensive guidance for psychiatric, movement, and cognitive disorders.

Umbrella review is a comprehensive analysis of the highest-level evidence, namely systematic reviews and meta-analyses. It helps determine whether different authors reach similar conclusions on related topics.

### An international survey of different transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [^1132jJM6]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Low credibility.

This study aims to evaluate preferences and trends in the delivery of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). A 10-item online questionnaire was developed and conducted online between April and June 2020, surveying providers of TMS for patients with OCD internationally. A total of 27 valid responses were analyzed from 10 countries. The most common target for TMS was the supplementary motor area, and stimulation was commonly given bilaterally, but techniques differed between centers. Exposure tasks were not commonly used during TMS. The study calls for more research clarifying the best mode of TMS delivery for OCD.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorders: Double blind randomized clinical trial [^115VQb1D]. Psychiatry Research (2016). High credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has become widely used as a therapeutic tool in psychiatric research. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of different frequencies of rTMS over right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Forty-five patients with OCD participated in the study and were evaluated using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S). They were randomly classified into three groups: the first group received 1Hz rTMS, the second group received 10Hz rTMS, and the third group received sham stimulation, all at 100% of the resting motor threshold for 10 sessions. They were followed up after the last treatment session and three months later.

There was a significant time×group interaction for 1Hz versus sham but not for 10Hz versus sham. The comparison between 1Hz and 10Hz groups showed a significant interaction for Y-BOCS and HAM-A (P = 0.001 and P = 0.0001, respectively). The 1Hz rTMS showed a greater clinical benefit than 10Hz or sham. There was also a significantly larger percentage change in CGI-S in the 1Hz group versus either 10Hz or sham. We conclude that 1Hz rTMS, targeting the right DLPFC, is a promising tool for the treatment of OCD.

### Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation for treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder: A meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^115LkrHn]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). High credibility.

Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS), an advancement of transcranial magnetic stimulation, was created to reach wider and possibly more profound regions of the brain. At present, there is insufficient high-quality evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of dTMS in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

- **Objective**: This study used a meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of dTMS for treating OCD.

- **Methods**: Four randomized controlled trials were found by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to February 2024. The fixed effects meta-analysis model was used for data merging in Stata17. The risk ratio (RR) value was used as the measure of effect size to compare response rates and dropout rates between active and sham dTMS.

- **Results**: The meta-analysis included four randomized-controlled trials involving 252 patients with treatment-resistant OCD. Active dTMS showed a notably greater rate of response on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) in comparison to sham dTMS after treatment (Y-BOCS: RR = 3.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.06 to 6.69) and at the one-month follow-up (Y-BOCS: RR = 2.60, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.26). Subgroup analysis revealed that active dTMS with H-coils was more effective than sham dTMS (RR = 3.57, 95% CI 1.93 to 6.60). No serious adverse events were documented in the included studies.

- **Conclusion**: The findings suggest that dTMS demonstrates notable efficacy and safety in treating patients with treatment-resistant OCD compared to sham dTMS.

### Symptom provocation and clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113RyjNU]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

- **Forest plot of meta-analysis results**: Shown here are standardized mean difference and 95% CI for all studies included in the meta-analysis (N = 63). The overall estimated effect size indicates a reduction in symptoms, with more negative values indicating more effective treatment, and the pooled estimate is shown with 95% CI. The effect size for each study is a weighted average of the effect sizes within each study, assuming a compound symmetric correlation structure (eMethods in Supplement 1). The size of points indicates their relative weight in the meta-analysis model.

- **Meta-analysis model estimates and multivariate model contrasts**: The overall estimated benefit of symptom provocation compared with no provocation was not statistically significant (model 2 provocation, SMD [SE] = −0.23 [0.21]; 95% CI, −0.68 to 0.21; p = 0.28) (Table). There was not a significant difference in the effect size of TMS vs sham between diagnostic groups OCD and nicotine (model 3 group, SMD [SE] = 0.14 [0.13]; 95% CI, −0.12 to 0.40; p = 0.29) (Table), suggesting that TMS was similarly effective between the two diagnostic groups.

Model 4 included terms for diagnostic group, symptom provocation, and their interaction and did not show a significant interaction (model 4) (Table). Within this model, we compared the treatment (active vs sham) for each combination of diagnostic group and provocation setting. We found a significant treatment difference in nicotine studies with provocation (SMD [SE] = …).

### Feasibility, acceptability and practicality of transcranial stimulation in obsessive compulsive symptoms (FEATSOCS): A randomised controlled crossover trial [^113RFnT5]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive form of neurostimulation with potential for development as a self-administered intervention. It has shown promise as a safe and effective treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in a small number of studies. The two most favorable stimulation targets appear to be the left orbitofrontal cortex (L-OFC) and the supplementary motor area (SMA). We report the first study to test these targets head-to-head within a randomized sham-controlled trial. Our aim was to inform the design of future clinical research studies by focusing on the acceptability and safety of the intervention, feasibility of recruitment, adherence to, and tolerability of tDCS, as well as the size of any treatment effect.

- **Methods**: FEATSOCS was a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover, multicenter study. Twenty adults with DSM-5-defined OCD were randomized to treatment, comprising three courses of clinic-based tDCS (SMA, L-OFC, Sham), randomly allocated and delivered in counterbalanced order. Each course comprised four 20-minute 2 mA stimulations, delivered over two consecutive days, separated by a 'washout' period of at least four weeks. Assessments were carried out by raters who were blind to stimulation type. Clinical outcomes were assessed before, during, and up to four weeks after stimulation. Patient representatives with lived experience of OCD were actively involved at all stages.

- **Results**: Clinicians showed willingness to recruit participants and recruitment to target was achieved. Adherence to treatment and study procedures was satisfactory, indicating the feasibility of such an intervention in clinical settings.

### Defining functional brain networks underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) using treatment-induced neuroimaging changes: a systematic review of the literature [^114JReFK]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Approximately 2%–3% of the population suffers from obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Several brain regions have been implicated in the pathophysiology of OCD, but their various contributions remain unclear. We examined changes in structural and functional neuroimaging before and following a variety of therapeutic interventions to identify the underlying networks involved. We identified 64 studies from 1990 to 2020 comparing pretreatment and post-treatment imaging of patients with OCD, including metabolic and perfusion, neurochemical, structural, functional, and connectivity-based modalities.

- **Treatment class**: Included pharmacotherapy, cognitive–behavioral therapy/exposure and response prevention, stereotactic lesions, deep brain stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation.

Changes in several brain regions are consistent and correspond with treatment response despite the heterogeneity in treatments and neuroimaging modalities. Most notable are decreases in metabolism and perfusion of the caudate, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), ventromedial PFC (VMPFC), and ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC). Modulating activity within regions of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical system may be a common therapeutic mechanism across treatments.

We identify future needs and knowledge gaps that can be mitigated by implementing integrative methods. Future studies should incorporate a systematic, analytical approach to testing objective correlates of treatment response.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): an exploratory meta-analysis of randomized and sham-controlled trials [^115bBZ4J]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

Randomized and sham-controlled trials (RCTs) on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have yielded conflicting results that may be due to limited statistical power among individual studies. We pursued the present systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of rTMS for OCD and to generate hypotheses for more robustly powered RCTs.

- **Method**: We searched the literature for RCTs on rTMS for OCD from 1995 through December 2012 using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and SCOPUS. We then performed an exploratory random-effects meta-analysis with the main outcome measures as pre-post changes in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores, response to treatment, and overall dropout rates at study end.

- **Results**: Data were obtained from 10 RCTs, totaling 282 subjects with OCD. The pooled Hedges' g for pre-post Y-BOCS scores was 0.59 (z = 2.73, p = 0.006), indicating a significant and medium-sized difference in outcome favoring active rTMS. Furthermore, response rates were 35% and 13% for patients receiving active and sham rTMS, respectively (OR = 3.4, p = 0.002). Sub-group analyses indicated that LF-rTMS and rTMS protocols targeting non-DLPFC regions (i.e. orbitofrontal cortex or supplementary motor area) seem to be the most promising for reducing OCD-related symptoms. No differences on baseline depression scores or dropout rates at study end were observed between active and sham rTMS groups, although OCD severity at baseline was higher in the active group.

### Symptom provocation and clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1156Qhwy]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis, investigating the association of symptom provocation with clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), suggest that symptom provocation may improve clinical response to TMS for nicotine use and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Larger, well-powered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that directly compare TMS with and without provocation are critical to establishing the effect of symptom provocation on TMS response.

### Glutamatergic neurotransmission is affected by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the supplemental motor cortex of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^114DsCJq]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). High credibility.

In obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), glutamatergic neurotransmission dysfunction plays a key role in pathophysiology. This research assessed changes in neurometabolites in the bilateral striatum of OCD patients receiving low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) using 1H proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS).

- **Methods**: Fifty-two OCD patients were divided into an rTMS treatment group (29 patients) and a control group (medication only) (22 patients). The levels of neurometabolites in the bilateral striatum of patients with OCD were measured using MRS before and after treatment. All participants were taking medication prior to the treatment and during the process.

- **Results**: Following rTMS treatment, the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) score was significantly decreased in the rTMS group compared with the control group. Glutamate (Glu) and glutamate and glutamine complexes (Glx) in the bilateral striatum of the rTMS treatment response group increased significantly with the improvement of OCD. Glu in the bilateral striatum and Glx in the right striatum were positively correlated with compulsion after the treatment.

- **Conclusions**: The physiopathological mechanism of OCD may be related to glutamatergic dysfunction. The low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the supplementary motor area can improve OCD symptoms by modulating glutamatergic levels in the bilateral striatum of patients with OCD.

### Psychedelic-assisted therapy and psychedelic science: A review and perspective on opportunities in neurosurgery and neuro-oncology [^115Vp1bD]. Neurosurgery (2023). High credibility.

Ruminative disorders, SUD, and PTSD being targeted with neuromodulation

DBS and TMS have both shown variable efficacy or have been considered for treating OCD, anorexia, SUD, depression, and PTSD. DBS, which stereotactically targets focal nuclei, and TMS, which focally targets broader brain regions, contrast with the global approach of ingesting a 5-HT 2A-R agonist to more broadly alter neural networks. As psilocybin-assisted therapy has shown early efficacy for depression and addiction and is in Phase 2 trials for OCD and anorexia, the relative roles of PAT versus DBS and/or TMS warrant investigation. Such studies might show that one approach outperforms another for certain subgroups in efficacy, safety, and cost, or that PAT combined with neuromodulation may prove to be synergistic.

### Clinical efficacy of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) in psychiatric and cognitive disorders: A systematic review [^115XFKdc]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). High credibility.

Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) has gained attention as an enhanced form of traditional TMS, targeting broader and deeper regions of the brain. However, a comprehensive synthesis of dTMS efficacy across psychiatric and cognitive disorders using sham-controlled trials is lacking. We systematically reviewed 28 clinical trials comparing active dTMS to a sham/controlled condition to characterize dTMS efficacy across diverse psychiatric and cognitive disorders.

A comprehensive search of APA PsycINFO, Cochrane, Embase, Medline, and PubMed databases was conducted. Predominant evidence supports dTMS efficacy in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n = 2), substance use disorders (SUDs; n = 8), and in those experiencing depressive episodes with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD; n = 6). However, the clinical efficacy of dTMS in psychiatric disorders characterized by hyperactivity or hyperarousal (e.g. attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia) was heterogeneous. Common side effects included headaches and pain/discomfort, with rare but serious adverse events such as seizures and suicidal ideation/attempts.

Risk of bias ratings indicated a collectively low risk according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations checklist. Literature suggests promise for dTMS as a beneficial alternative or add-on treatment for patients who do not respond well to traditional treatment, particularly for depressive episodes, OCD, and SUDs.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of psychiatric disorders [^117EpUe8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an emerging novel treatment modality for psychiatric disorders, particularly major depression. A device for the delivery of TMS was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. TMS is being studied for a variety of psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. In this article, we describe TMS and its neurobiological basis, as well as the efficacy and safety data of TMS with regard to a range of psychiatric disorders.

### Efficacy of brain stimulation therapies across psychiatric, movement, and cognitive disorders: An umbrella review synthesizing meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials [^116pSQEy]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

Psychiatric disorders encompass a range of symptoms classified as positive, disorganized, or negative, which are evident in primary psychotic disorders and affective psychoses. Movement disorders represent a clinically, pathologically, and genetically diverse group of neurological conditions, all sharing common features such as impaired planning, control, or execution of movement. Cognitive disorders are characterized by a decline from previously attained levels of cognitive functioning. Due to their high prevalence and poor prognosis, these disorders place a significant burden on society.

Brain stimulation therapies (BSTs) are methods that regulate brain activity and function through electrical, magnetic, or other forms of stimulation. Since the introduction of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in 1938, BSTs in psychiatry have evolved significantly and have been widely used to enhance emotional, motor, and cognitive functions in patients. Currently, a large number of studies have explored the effectiveness of BSTs for various conditions, such as depression, eating disorders, insomnia, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease (PD), stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Huntington's disease. Compared to traditional pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatments (such as psychotherapy or physical therapy), these techniques offer broader applicability, fewer side effects, and higher standardization. Some BSTs have been approved for certain treatments. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

### Pre-supplementary motor network connectivity and clinical outcome of magnetic stimulation in obsessive-compulsive disorder [^112wsRd9]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Low credibility.

A large proportion of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) respond unsatisfactorily to pharmacological and psychological treatments. An alternative novel treatment for these patients is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). This study aimed to investigate the underlying neural mechanism of rTMS treatment in OCD patients. A total of 37 patients with OCD were randomized to receive real or sham 1-Hz rTMS (14 days, 30 min/day) over the right pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected before and after rTMS treatment. The individualized target was defined by a personalized functional connectivity map of the subthalamic nucleus.

- **Outcome results**: After treatment, patients in the real group showed a better improvement in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale than the sham group (F 1,35 = 6.0, p = .019).

- **Neural mechanism identification**: To show the neural mechanism involved, we identified an "ideal target connectivity" before treatment. Leave-one-out cross-validation indicated that this connectivity pattern can significantly predict patients' symptom improvements (r = .60, p = .009).

- **Connectivity changes**: After real treatment, the average connectivity strength of the target network significantly decreased in the real but not in the sham group. This network-level change was cross-validated in three independent datasets.

Altogether, these findings suggest that personalized magnetic stimulation on preSMA may alleviate obsessive-compulsive symptoms by decreasing the connectivity strength of the target network.

### Symptom provocation and clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114X17XF]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and is registered in the PROSPERO database.

We focused our search on articles examining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for adults aged 18 years or older with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or nicotine dependence, as these are the only FDA-cleared TMS protocols involving symptom provocation. Articles were included if they were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and incorporated clinical outcome measures. The search strategy utilized descriptors for TMS, OCD, and nicotine dependence (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). A control group was defined for the review if it compared (1) active TMS with sham TMS or an active control TMS target, or (2) the use of provocation with no provocation. Open-label trials of TMS without a control group were excluded.

All clinical outcomes related to OCD symptoms and nicotine dependence were included, such as the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), craving, biological measures of nicotine use, the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), and cigarettes smoked per day.

- **Search strategy**: We searched online databases including PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EBSCOhost (1872-present), and Embase on August 30, 2024, for studies utilizing TMS to treat OCD or nicotine dependence published in English. The search strategy is detailed in eTable 1 in Supplement 1.

- **Study selection**: Titles and abstracts were independently evaluated.

### Efficacy of accelerated deep transcranial magnetic stimulation with double cone coil in obsessive-compulsive disorder: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^113w4mwE]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). High credibility.

High-frequency deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) targeting the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) with an H-coil has received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Nevertheless, there is limited evidence regarding the efficacy of a similar procedure performed using a double-cone coil or in an accelerated regimen. In this study, patients in the active TMS group (n = 14) underwent stimulation of the mPFC and ACC twice daily at a frequency of 20 Hz for three weeks, using a double-cone coil. The same procedure was applied to the control group (n = 15) using a placebo coil. Throughout the study, the patients continued their antidepressant and/or antipsychotic treatments at the same dose. Following treatment, the active TMS group exhibited a more significant reduction in Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale scores (pre-treatment: 25.36 ± 5.4, post-treatment: 18.43 ± 6.86) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores (pre-treatment: 10.6 ± 3.5, post-treatment: 6.7 ± 2.7) compared to the sham TMS group. However, there was no statistically significant reduction in symmetry-related obsessive-compulsive symptoms in the TMS group compared to the sham TMS group.

dTMS applied to the mPFC and ACC, using a double-cone coil at a 20-Hz frequency twice daily for three weeks, was found to be effective as an adjunctive treatment for treatment-resistant OCD.

### Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder is efficacious even in patients who failed multiple medications and CBT [^113FEgcR]. Psychiatry Research (2020). High credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling disease with a lifetime prevalence of 2%-3%. Approximately 40–60% of these patients do not adequately respond to pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment alternative for OCD, recently receiving regulatory approval. However, it remains unclear whether patients who have failed numerous medications and/or CBT can still benefit from dTMS. In this study, we analyzed recent data from a double-blind multicenter dTMS study and found efficacy of this novel treatment even in OCD patient cohorts who had previously failed to respond to multiple medications and CBT.

### An updated meta-analysis: Short-term therapeutic effects of repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder [^115wGJz2]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

This study was conducted to evaluate the short-term therapeutic effects of using repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and to examine potential influencing factors.

- **Method**: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Wanfang, CNKI, and Sinomed databases on September 18, 2016, and reviewed the references of previous meta-analyses. Sham-controlled, randomized clinical trials using rTMS to treat OCD were included. Hedge's g was calculated for the effect size. Subgroup analyses and univariate meta-regressions were conducted.

- **Results**: Twenty studies with 791 patients were included. A large effect size (g = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55–0.87; P < 0.001) was found for the therapeutic effect. Targeting the supplementary motor area (SMA) (g = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.12–1.01; P < 0.001), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (g = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.02–0.93; P = 0.02), bilateral DLPFC (g = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.38–0.92; P < 0.001) and right DLPFC (g = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.70–1.15; P < 0.001), excluding the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (g = 0.56; 95% CI, -0.05–1.18; P = 0.07), showed significant improvements over sham treatments. Both low-frequency (g = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.50–0.96; P < 0.001) and high-frequency (g = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51–0.89; P < 0.001) treatments were significantly better than sham treatments, with no significant differences between the effects of the two frequencies. The subgroup analyses indicated that patients who were non-treatment resistant, lacked comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD), and received threshold-intensity rTMS showed larger therapeutic effects than the.
