## Question

Which of the infections most commonly precedes the development of gutate psoriasis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which infection most commonly precedes the development of guttate psoriasis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity of guttate psoriasis and its typical epidemiology. Then, I should verify the strength and consistency of evidence linking infections to guttate psoriasis. Next, I will examine which specific pathogens are most frequently implicated and whether any are clearly predominant. After that, I need to check mechanistic plausibility and timing of onset relative to infection. Finally, I will consider alternative infectious triggers and synthesize a cautious, evidence-based conclusion with appropriate caveats about causality and treatment implications.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Guttate psoriasis is an acute eruption of numerous small, erythematous, scaly papules and plaques, classically on the trunk and proximal extremities, and it occurs more often in children and young adults, frequently as a first manifestation of psoriasis or as an acute flare of chronic disease, which frames the question of antecedent infections in a biologically plausible window [^116cntph] [^115quNN5].

> Wait, let me verify the infectious trigger signal across studies before jumping to conclusions. Multiple sources consistently note that guttate psoriasis is closely associated with recent infections, particularly upper respiratory infections, and this association is repeatedly emphasized in reviews, cohorts, and guidelines, reinforcing that an antecedent infection is a leading precipitant rather than a mere coincidence [^115quNN5] [^113qPX9Y] [^111AXZB7].

> I need to check which pathogen is most strongly implicated. Hold on, I should verify whether Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes) rises above other microbes in frequency and strength of evidence. The strongest and most consistent association is with GAS pharyngitis/tonsillitis, with classic timing of lesions appearing roughly 1–2 weeks after the throat infection, and this has been repeatedly documented in observational series and historical reports [^1148jj9D] [^115edoMf] [^111AXZB7].

> Let me consider alternative infectious triggers so I don't over-attribute. Viral infections can also trigger guttate psoriasis in some cases, including Epstein-Barr virus and COVID-19, and pediatric cohorts also describe anogenital streptococcal infections (e.g., perianal/vulvovaginal GAS) precipitating guttate flares; however, these appear less prevalent or less consistently documented than GAS pharyngitis as the trigger in most series, suggesting a secondary role rather than the predominant one [^114VYNsq] [^114w4b7C] [^116QMHbf] [^112QMXXQ] [^113PtbpU].

> I should double-check the timing and mechanism to ensure biological plausibility. The onset of guttate lesions about 1–2 weeks after streptococcal pharyngitis aligns with a superantigen-driven immune activation model that generates skin-homing, Vβ-restricted T cells and engages the IL-23/IL-17 axis, which is mechanistically coherent with observed cytokine profiles and rapid, widespread eruption patterns [^115BuDKW] [^113qPX9Y] [^111zayyX].

> But wait, what if other β-hemolytic streptococci (groups C/G) are equally important? A prospective study in chronic plaque psoriasis showed exacerbations with groups A, C, and G streptococci, but when focusing on guttate onset or guttate flares, most robust datasets and reviews continue to implicate S. pyogenes as the principal trigger, whereas non–group A streptococci are less consistently associated with guttate initiation, reinforcing group A as the predominant culprite in guttate pathogenesis [^112ZrwWf] [^1148jj9D] [^115quNN5].

> I will now examine the magnitude of association to avoid overstating. In a large adult-onset series, recent infection was reported in 84% of guttate cases, with acute streptococcal pharyngitis verified in 63%, indicating that GAS is not universal but is the single most commonly identified precipitant across cohorts, consistent with the broader literature [^111AXZB7].

> Let me reconsider the overall balance of evidence and ensure I'm not missing contradictory data. Across decades of clinical observation, molecular studies, and contemporary series, the convergent conclusion is that Group A streptococcal upper respiratory infection is the most common antecedent infection preceding guttate psoriasis, with other bacteria and viruses acting as less frequent or context-specific triggers rather than the primary cause in most patients [^1148jj9D] [^115edoMf] [^115quNN5].

> Conclusion and clinical implication: The infection that most commonly precedes guttate psoriasis is Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis/tonsillitis, typically occurring about 1–2 weeks before the eruption; this association is strong, consistent, and mechanistically coherent, though not exclusive, as other infections can occasionally trigger the phenotype, especially in genetically susceptible hosts [^1148jj9D] [^115edoMf] [^111AXZB7].

---

The infection most commonly associated with guttate psoriasis is **group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis** [^115quNN5] [^1148jj9D], typically occurring 1–3 weeks before the rash [^115quNN5] [^115edoMf]. This association is strongest in children and young adults, with 63–84% of guttate cases linked to recent streptococcal infection [^111AXZB7] [^117Jwm5f]. Other streptococcal sites (perianal, vulvovaginal) and non-GABHS pathogens (viral, staphylococcal) can trigger guttate psoriasis, but GABHS pharyngitis is the predominant trigger [^116QMHbf] [^112QMXXQ] [^114VYNsq] [^114w4b7C] [^117LM4fE].

## Streptococcal infections and guttate psoriasis

- **Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS)**: The strongest association is with GABHS pharyngitis [^1148jj9D]; 63–84% of guttate cases follow recent streptococcal infection [^111AXZB7], with lesions appearing 1–3 weeks later [^115quNN5] [^115edoMf].

- **Other streptococcal sites**: Perianal and vulvovaginal GABHS infections can also trigger guttate psoriasis, though less commonly than pharyngitis [^116QMHbf] [^112QMXXQ].

- **Non-GABHS streptococci**: Groups C and G streptococci have been implicated, but less frequently than GABHS [^112ZrwWf].

---

## Non-streptococcal infections associated with guttate psoriasis

- **Viral infections**: Viral illnesses, including Epstein-Barr virus [^114VYNsq], enteroviruses, and COVID-19 [^114w4b7C], have been reported to trigger guttate psoriasis, though less commonly than streptococcal infections [^111AXZB7].

- **Staphylococcus aureus**: Staphylococcal skin infections can exacerbate or trigger guttate psoriasis in some cases, particularly in pediatric populations [^notfound].

- **Fungal infections**: Candida albicans has been implicated in some cases, particularly in inverse psoriasis, though this association is less well-established [^112aPr4U].

---

## Immunological mechanisms linking infections to guttate psoriasis

- **Superantigenic stimulation**: Streptococcal superantigens (e.g. streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins) drive activation of T cells, particularly cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA)-positive T cells, leading to skin inflammation and psoriatic lesions [^115BuDKW].

- **Molecular mimicry**: Cross-reactivity between streptococcal antigens and keratinocyte proteins may trigger autoimmune responses, perpetuating inflammation [^111zayyX].

- **Cytokine dysregulation**: Infections induce pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-17, IL-23, TNF-α), central to psoriatic inflammation [^114aYppD] [^1166UVbd].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Recognition of triggers**: Identifying and treating antecedent streptococcal infections is important in managing guttate psoriasis, particularly in pediatric patients [^112QMXXQ].

- **Antibiotic therapy**: While antibiotics are used to treat underlying streptococcal infections, evidence for their direct benefit in guttate psoriasis is limited; they are primarily used to prevent post-streptococcal complications [^115rVvLn].

- **Phototherapy and systemic therapies**: Phototherapy and systemic agents, including biologics targeting IL-17/IL-23 pathways, are effective treatments for guttate psoriasis, particularly in refractory cases [^112utXYA] [^114QAzz4] [^1114Wped].

## Infections associated with guttate psoriasis

| **Infection type** | **Examples** | **Frequency of association** |
|-|-|-|
| Streptococcal | - Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) <br/> - Group C and G streptococci | High (63–84%) |
| Viral | - Epstein-Barr virus <br/> - Enteroviruses <br/> - COVID-19 | Moderate |
| Staphylococcal | Staphylococcus aureus | Low to moderate |
| Fungal | Candida albicans | Low |

---

The infection most commonly associated with guttate psoriasis is **group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis**, with lesions typically appearing 1–3 weeks after infection [^1148jj9D] [^115quNN5]. Other infections, including viral, staphylococcal, and fungal, can also trigger guttate psoriasis, but their association is less frequent and less well-established [^114VYNsq] [^114w4b7C].

### Non-antistreptococcal interventions for acute guttate psoriasis or an acute guttate flare of chronic psoriasis [^1123buab]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Guttate psoriasis displays distinctive epidemiological and clinical features, making it a separate entity within the heterogeneous group of cutaneous psoriasis types. It is associated with genetic, immune, and environmental factors (such as stress and infections) and usually arises in younger age groups (including children, teenagers, and young adults). There is currently no cure for psoriasis, but various treatments can help to relieve the symptoms and signs. The objectives of treatment when managing an acute flare of guttate psoriasis are to reduce time to clearance and induction of long-term remission after resolution. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2000; since then, new treatments have expanded the therapeutic spectrum of systemic treatments used for psoriasis.

Objectives

To assess the effects of non-antistreptococcal interventions for acute guttate psoriasis or an acute guttate flare of chronic psoriasis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to June 2018: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. We checked the proceedings of key dermatology conferences from 2004 to 2018, and also searched for trials in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) database for drug registration.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of treatments for acute guttate psoriasis or an acute guttate flare of chronic psoriasis clinically diagnosed in children and adults. This included all topical and systemic drugs, biological therapy, phototherapy (all forms: topical and systemic), and complementary and alternative therapies. We compared these treatments against placebo or against another treatment. We did not include studies on drugs that aim to eradicate streptococcal infection. We did not include studies when separate results for guttate psoriasis participants were not available.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and methodological quality and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were 'percentage of participants clear or almost clear (i.e. obtaining Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 100/90 and/or Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of 0 or 1)' and 'percentage of participants with adverse effects and severe adverse effects'. Our secondary outcomes were 'number of relapses of guttate psoriasis or flares within a period of six months after the treatment has finished', 'percentage of participants achieving a PASI 75 or PGA of 1 or 2', and 'improvement in participant satisfaction measures and quality of life assessment measures'. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This review included only one trial (21 participants), which compared fish oil-derived (n-3) fatty acid-based lipid emulsion (50 mL per infusion (1.05 g eicosapentaenoic and 10.5 g docosahexaenoic acid)) (10 participants) to soya oil-derived (n-6) fatty acid-based lipid emulsion (50 mL per infusion (1.05 g eicosapentaenoic and 10.5 g docosahexaenoic acid)) (11 participants) administered intravenously twice daily for 10 days, with a total follow-up of 40 days. The study was conducted in a single centre in Germany in 18 men and three women, aged between 21 and 65 years, who were in hospital with acute guttate psoriasis and had mean total body surface involvement of 25.7% ± 20.4% (range 10 to 90). The study was funded by a company that produces the oil emulsions. We found no other evidence regarding non-antistreptococcal interventions used in clinical practice for guttate psoriasis, such as topical treatments (corticosteroids, vitamin D₃ analogues), systemic drugs, biological therapy, and phototherapy. The primary outcomes of the review were not measured, and only one of our secondary outcomes was measured: improvement in participant satisfaction measures and quality of life assessment measures. However, the study authors did report that there was rare skin irritation at the site of peripheral intravenous route, but the number of affected participants was not provided. Improvement between baseline and day 10, using a non-validated score assessed by participants themselves daily based on five items (appearance of lesions, impairment of daily life, pruritus, burning, and pain), was greater in the group that received the fish oil-derived (n-3) fatty acid-based lipid emulsion (75%) than in the group receiving the soya oil-derived (n-6) fatty acid-based lipid emulsion (18%) (one trial, 21 participants). However, these results are uncertain as they are based on very low-quality evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence regarding topical and systemic drugs, biotherapy, or phototherapy in guttate psoriasis (we did not consider drugs that aimed to eradicate streptococcal infection because these are assessed in another Cochrane Review). We are uncertain of the effect of intravenously administered lipid emulsion on guttate psoriasis because the quality of the evidence is very low, due to risk of bias (unclear risk of bias for all domains), indirectness (the trial only included adults, and the follow-up from baseline was only 10 days), and imprecision (small number of participants). This review highlights the need for trials assessing the efficacy and safety of phototherapy and topical and systemic drugs for guttate psoriasis. There is also a need for studies that clearly distinguish the specific population with guttate psoriasis from the larger group of people with chronic plaque psoriasis, and children and young adults should be assessed as a distinct group.

### Advances and controversies in our understanding of guttate and plaque psoriasis [^113qPX9Y]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute guttate psoriasis (AGP) is considered an uncommon variant of psoriasis (PsO), characterized as a widespread eruption of erythematous, psoriasiform papules, and plaques on the trunk, extremities, and scalp. Predisposing factors include a family history of PsO, variation in the main PsO susceptibility gene HLA-Cw*0602, and previous infection with viruses or acute β-hemolytic Streptococcus A program focused on controversies and recent advances in understanding AGP was presented at the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) 2022 annual meeting. Topics included an overview of clinical presentation and natural history, predisposing genetic and environmental factors, and the recent molecular profiling that supports classification of AGP as a form of PsO. Early molecular profiling studies using proteomic signatures have suggested similarities between AGP and contact dermatitis, but recent studies using gene expression profiling and gene set enrichment scores demonstrate that AGP is more similar to chronic PsO. The expression of regulatory immune pathways seen with AGP suggests potential for early and sustained remission if the disease is suppressed by targeted treatments. Published case reports documenting clinical improvement of AGP with biologics that antagonize interleukin (IL)-12/23, IL-23, and IL-17 support the role of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in AGP, similar to that in PsO. Data supporting the use of antibiotics and other therapeutic agents for AGP are lacking, and randomized controlled trials are needed. Trial design for AGP is challenged by the low incidence, tendency for spontaneous remission, lack of validated end points, and the need for long-term follow up.

### A systematic review of antistreptococcal interventions for guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis [^112ok899]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Guttate psoriasis is closely associated with preceding or concurrent streptococcal infection. Some authorities have claimed that chronic plaque psoriasis may also be made worse by infection. In view of this many dermatologists have recommended using antibiotics for psoriasis, particularly guttate type. Some dermatologists have also recommended tonsillectomy for psoriasis in patients with recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis.

Objectives

This review aims to assess the evidence for the effectiveness of antistreptococcal interventions, including antibiotics and tonsillectomy in the management of acute guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis.

Methods

Studies were identified by searching the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 1999), Medline (1966-September 1999), Embase (1988-September 1999), the Salford Database of Psoriasis Trials (to November 1999) and the European Dermato-Epidemiology Network (EDEN) Psoriasis Trials Database (to November 1999) for terms (STREPTOCOCC* or ANTIBIOTIC* or TONSIL*) and PSORIASIS using the Cochrane Skin Group search strategy.

Results

Only one trial met the selection criteria. This compared the use of two oral antibiotic schedules in 20 psoriasis patients, predominantly of guttate type, who had evidence of beta-haemolytic streptococcal colonization. Either rifampicin or placebo was added to the end of a standard course of phenoxymethylpenicillin or erythromycin. No patient in either arm of the study improved during the observation period. No randomized trials of tonsillectomy for psoriasis were identified.

Conclusions

Although both antibiotics and tonsillectomy have frequently been advocated both for patients with guttate psoriasis and for selected patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, there is to date no good evidence that either intervention is beneficial.

### Psoriasis phenotype at disease onset: clinical characterization of 400 adult cases [^111AXZB7]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is clinically a heterogeneous disease. Detailed evaluation of phenotype at disease onset is lacking. This study is a baseline characterization of 400 adult individuals with first time incidence of psoriasis on non-hairy skin, describing clinical phenotypes and putative environmental triggers at disease onset. In total, 74 patients with guttate and 326 patients with non-guttate phenotype, the majority with plaque psoriasis, were included. Guttate phenotype was associated with younger age and recent infection in 84%, where acute streptococcal pharyngitis was verified in 63%. The predominating factor associated with onset of plaque psoriasis was a recent life crisis (46%). A positive family history for psoriasis was approximately the same in both groups. Psoriasis arthropathy was diagnosed in 5% of guttate and 15% of non-guttate patients, with enthesopathy being the dominant symptom among guttate patients. This study confirms the strong link between onset of guttate psoriasis phenotype and streptococcal throat infection, whereas onset of plaque psoriasis was highly associated with a preceding distinct stressful life event. Longitudinal follow-up of the patients will provide robust information about disease development and response to treatment.

### Antistreptococcal interventions for guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis [^115rVvLn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease that affects approximately two per cent of the general population. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form: it usually appears as raised, red patches of inflamed skin, covered with silvery white scales. The patches often occur in a symmetrical pattern. Guttate psoriasis is a particular form of psoriasis with widespread, small erythematosquamous lesions. Streptococcal infection is suspected to be a triggering factor for the onset of guttate psoriasis, and flare-up of chronic plaque psoriasis. The previous Cochrane Review on this topic was published in 2000; it required an update because antistreptococcal treatment continues to be used to treat psoriasis, especially for the acute form of guttate psoriasis.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antistreptococcal interventions for guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, Cochrane Register of Studies Online, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and five trials registers (January 2019). We checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies and searched conference proceedings from the American Academy of Dermatology, Society for Investigative Dermatology, and European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing antistreptococcal interventions (tonsillectomy or systemic antibiotic treatment) in people with clinically diagnosed acute guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis compared with placebo, no intervention, or each other.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcome measures were: 1) time-to-resolution; achieving clear or almost clear skin (Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0 or 1 or Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 or 100); 2) proportion of participants with adverse effects and severe adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were: 1) proportion of participants achieving clear or almost clear skin; 2) proportion of participants achieving PASI 75 or PGA 1 to 2; 3) risk of having at least one relapse at long-term follow-up. Short-term assessment was defined as within eight weeks of the start of treatment; long-term was at least one year after the start of treatment.

Main Results

We included five trials (162 randomised participants); three were conducted in a hospital dermatology department. One study declared funding by a pharmaceutical company. Participants' ages ranged from 12 to 77 years; only two participants were younger than 15 years. Mean PASI score at baseline varied from 5.7 (i.e. mild) to 23 (i.e. severe) in four studies. Twenty-three of 162 participants had streptococcus-positive throat swab culture. We did not perform a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity of participants' characteristics and interventions. None of the trials measured our efficacy primary outcome, time-to-resolution, or the secondary outcome, risk of having at least one relapse at long-term follow-up. We rated the quality of the results as very low-quality evidence, due to high risk of bias (absence of blinding of participants and caregivers, and high risk of outcome reporting bias) and imprecision (single study data with a low number of events). Hence, we are very uncertain about the results presented. Guttate psoriasisOne three-armed trial (N = 43) assessed penicillin (50,000 international units (IU)/kg/day in three doses) versus erythromycin (250 mg four times per day) versus no treatment (treatment for 14 days, with six-week follow-up from start of treatment). Adverse events and the proportion of participants achieving clear or almost clear skin were not measured. One trial (N = 20) assessed penicillin (1.6 MU (million units) intramuscularly once a day) versus no treatment (six weeks of treatment, with eight-week follow-up from start of treatment). At six-week (short-term) follow-up, no adverse events were observed in either group, and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of participants with clear or almost clear skin (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 5.85). One trial (N = 20) assessed rifampicin (300 mg twice daily) versus placebo (14-day treatment duration; six-week follow-up from start of treatment); none of the review outcomes were measured. These trials did not measure the proportion of participants achieving PASI 75 or PGA 1 to 2. Chronic plaque psoriasisOne trial (N = 50) assessed long-term azithromycin treatment (500 mg daily dose) versus vitamin C. Adverse events were reported in the azithromycin group (10 out of 30 had nausea and mild abdominal upset), but not in the vitamin C group. The proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin was not measured. In the azithromycin group, 18/30 versus 0/20 participants in the vitamin C group reached PASI 75 at the end of 48 weeks of treatment (RR 25.06, 95% CI 1.60 to 393.59). One trial (N = 29) assessed tonsillectomy versus no treatment, with 24-month follow-up after surgery. One participant in the tonsillectomy group had minor bleeding. At eight-week follow-up, 1/15 in the tonsillectomy group, and 0/14 in the no treatment group achieved PASI 90; and 3/15 participants in the tonsillectomy group, and 0/14 in the no treatment group achieved PASI 75 (RR 6.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 116.7).

Authors' Conclusions

We found only five trials (N = 162), which assessed the effects of five comparisons (systemic antibiotic treatment (penicillin, azithromycin) or tonsillectomy). Two comparisons (erythromycin compared to no treatment, and rifampicin compared to placebo) did not measure any of the outcomes of interest. There was very low-quality evidence for the outcomes that were measured, Therefore, we are uncertain of both the efficacy and safety of antistreptococcal interventions for guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis. The included trials were at unclear or high risk of bias and involved only a small number of unrepresentative participants, with limited measurement of our outcomes of interest. The studies did not allow investigation into the influence of Streptococcal infection, and a key intervention (amoxicillin) was not assessed. Further trials assessing the efficacy and tolerance of penicillin V or amoxicillin are needed in children and young adults with guttate psoriasis.

### Guttate psoriasis following streptococcal vulvovaginitis in a five-year-old girl [^116QMHbf]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Guttate psoriasis is frequently associated with a preceding pharyngeal or perianal streptococcal infection in children. Despite Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) being the most common cause of specific bacterial vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls, there are no reports of streptococcal vulvovaginitis triggering guttate psoriasis.

Case

A five-year-old girl presented with guttate psoriasis following an episode of Streptococcal pyogenes vulvovaginitis. Following antibiotic treatment and bacterial eradication she developed vulvar psoriasis that resolved with high potency topical steroids.

Summary and Conclusion

Identification of an antecedent streptoccocal infection can help predict the long term prognosis in children with guttate psoriasis. The vulvovaginal area should be considered as a source of GABHS infection in young girls with guttate psoriasis, and cultures should be considered if symptoms are present.

### Triggering psoriasis: the role of infections and medications [^117LM4fE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Psoriasis can be provoked or exacerbated by a variety of different environmental factors, particularly infections and drugs. Strong evidence exists for the induction of guttate psoriasis by a preceding tonsillar Streptococcus pyogenes infection, whereas disease exacerbation has been linked with skin and/or gut colonization by Staphylococcus aureus, Malassezia, and Candida albicans. The role, if any, of viruses (papillomaviruses, HIV, and endogenous retroviruses) present in lesional skin is at present unknown. The use of various drugs, such as lithium, beta-blockers, antimalarial agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, has also been associated with induction or worsening of disease in psoriatic patients.

### A case series of early biologic therapy in guttate psoriasis: targeting resident memory T cell activity as a potential novel therapeutic modality [^1143827J]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Guttate psoriasis (GP) is a clinical subtype of psoriasis vulgaris (PV) manifesting in multiple erythematous plaques, predominantly on the trunk and limbs. Dysregulation of the T-helper 17 axis plays a central role in driving these inflammatory lesions through cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 17, IL-22, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor-α.GP can be triggered by various infections, including viral illnesses (enteroviral diseases, COVID-19) streptococcal infection (pharyngitis and perineal streptococcal infection), as well as iatrogenic causes (use of β blockers, antimalarials). In the setting of infectious triggers, lesions most commonly develop 2 to 3 weeks after initial infection. A strong association has been found with HLA-Cw∗0602 allele positivity and recurrent infection, which may lead to recurrent outbreaks of GP.

GP will often spontaneously remit within 12 to 16 weeks upon onset, causing significant psychosocial distress while present. Current treatments for GP include treatment of the underlying infectious trigger (in the case of streptococcal infections), phototherapy, topical corticosteroids, and calcipotriol. Systemic immunosuppressive therapy and biologic therapy have been reported in GP but are less commonly used. Tonsillectomy has been promoted for recurrent GP triggered by streptococcal infection.

Approximately 25% to 39% of patients have been found to progress to chronic plaque psoriasis or PV after developing GP. One study for example, with a mean follow-up duration of 6.3 years, identified that 14 out of 36 patients (38.9%) progressed to PV. The pathogenic mechanism underlying this progression is incompletely understood but thought to involve resident memory T (T RM) cells.

### Post-COVID-19 rash: an atypical manifestation of guttate psoriasis [^114w4b7C]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Many complications are emerging from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), likely secondary to immune dysfunction and autoimmunity. While dermatologic changes have been reported, de novo guttate psoriasis, typically associated with streptococcal and other viral infections, secondary to COVID-19 infection has been minimally described. The authors report a case of a 34-year-old man who developed a diffuse rash 3 weeks following a COVID-19 infection found to have new onset guttate psoriasis who was responsive to topical corticosteroids and a vitamin D analog.

### WITHDRAWN: antistreptococcal interventions for guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis [^113Wmthv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Guttate psoriasis is a distinctive acute form of psoriasis which characteristically occurs in children and young adults. It is closely associated with preceding streptococcal sore throat or tonsillitis. Some authorities have claimed that ordinary (chronic plaque) psoriasis may also be made worse by infection at distant sites. Although many dermatologists have recommended using antibiotics for guttate psoriasis in particular, it is not clear whether they influence the course of either form of psoriasis. Some dermatologists have also recommended tonsillectomy for psoriasis in patients with recurrent streptococcal sore throat.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for effectiveness of antistreptococcal interventions including antibiotics and tonsillectomy in the management of acute guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 1999), Medline (1966- September 1999), Embase (1988-September 1999), the Salford Database of Psoriasis Trials (to November 1999) and the European Dermato-Epidemiology Network (EDEN) Psoriasis Trials Database (to November 1999) for terms [STREPTOCOCC* or ANTIBIOTIC* or TONSIL*] and PSORIASIS using the Cochrane Skin Group search strategy.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of one or more antistreptococcal interventions in patients with guttate or chronic plaque psoriasis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently examined each retrieved trial for eligibility and quality.

Main Results

The one eligible trial we identified compared the use of two oral antibiotic schedules in 20 psoriasis patients, predominantly of guttate type, who had evidence of beta-haemolytic streptococcal colonisation. Either rifampicin or placebo was added to the end of a standard course of antistreptococcal antibiotic (phenoxymethylpenicillin or erythromycin). No patient in either arm of the study improved during the observation period. No randomised trials of tonsillectomy for psoriasis were identified.

Authors' Conclusions

Although it is well known that guttate psoriasis may be precipitated by streptococcal infection, there is no firm evidence to support the use of antibiotics either in the management of established guttate psoriasis or in preventing the development of guttate psoriasis following streptococcal sore throat. Although both antibiotics and tonsillectomy have frequently been advocated for patients with recurrent guttate psoriasis or chronic plaque psoriasis, there is to date no good evidence that either intervention is beneficial.

### To treat or not to treat? Management of guttate psoriasis and pityriasis rosea in patients with evidence of group A streptococcal infection [^115jJoMb]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The association between guttate psoriasis and pityriasis rosea with Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) is well established in the literature; however treatment guidelines and necessity have not been clarified with respect to the infectious etiology. Also, the exact role of Streptococcus in the immunopathogenesis of these entities, and the associated risk of development of scarlet fever and poststreptococcal sequelae, are not centrally reported. No single report or case series definitively establishes the coexistence between guttate psoriasis and post-streptococcal sequelae in the same patient, supporting the theories of autoimmune protection conferred between these entities. Laboratory investigations and treatment of Streptococcus in the setting of guttate psoriasis are not necessary, as anti-streptococcal treatment does not significantly modify the course of cutaneous disease, and there is no theoretical or documented risk of post-streptococcal sequelae. However, due to minimal data, antibiotics may still have a role in pityriasis rosea.

### Guttate psoriasis triggered by perianal streptococcal infection [^112QMXXQ]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

The association of guttate psoriasis (GP) with streptococcal pharyngitis is well accepted. However, less is known about the association with perianal streptococcal infection. We report a case of a 19-month-old boy with GP after a preceding perianal streptococcal dermatitis, with no clinical signs of a streptococcal pharyngitis. Treatment with phenethicillin was given together with mometasone ointment. After 4 weeks, the perianal redness was reduced and the psoriasis had improved significantly. A review of the literature revealed nine previous case reports, comprising a total of 15 patients. In all cases, the perianal dermatitis and the GP improved after treatment with oral antibiotics, sometimes in combination with topical corticosteroids. We conclude that in cases of GP in children, the perianal area must be examined for streptococcal infection.

### Resolution of guttate psoriasis plaques after one-time administration of guselkumab [^112Mubef]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guttate psoriasis is an acute subtype of plaque psoriasis characterized by eruption of small, scaly plaques, and papules, 5 to 10 mm in size over the trunk and proximal extremities.1 It often arises in children and young adults concomitantly with or shortly after a streptococcal throat infection or tonsillitis. Patients with chronic plaque psoriasis can also experience guttate flares following streptococcal throat infections.1,2 Controlling guttate psoriasis with topical corticosteroids is difficult to achieve due to numerous widespread lesions. Other treatment options include phototherapy and short term use of cyclosporine or methotrexate, as guttate variants of psoriasis can remit with these treatments.1,2 Guselkumab, an inhibitor of the p19 cytokine subunit of interleukin-23 and interleukin-39, produces dramatic resolutions of plaque psoriasis with long lasting effects.3 This case report describes a patient with a guttate variant of plaque psoriasis that resolved after a single administration of guselkumab and continues to remain clear more than 6 months after treatment with guselkumab.

### Ustekinumab-induced remission of recalcitrant guttate psoriasis: a case series [^117955ie]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Guttate psoriasis is an acute, eruptive form of psoriasis characterized by small, scaly papules and plaques. The exact immunopathogenesis of guttate psoriasis is unclear. However, this subtype of psoriasis shares several features with plaque psoriasis, including an association with group A streptococcal infections and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -C*06:02 allele. Although most cases of guttate psoriasis are self-limiting, more severe cases require treatment with topical steroids, phototherapy, or immunosuppressive medications. The use of biologic medications for the treatment of recalcitrant guttate psoriasis has not been systematically studied.

The US Food and Drug Administration has approved ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody against the shared p40 subunit of interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and Crohn's disease. Its role in the treatment of guttate psoriasis has not been studied. Here we present a series of 6 patients (Table I) with recalcitrant guttate psoriasis who were treated successfully with ustekinumab, suggesting a potential role for this medication in the treatment of this psoriasis subtype.

### Clinical manifestations of pediatric psoriasis: results of a multicenter study in the United States [^113iDCcv]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical features of pediatric psoriasis warrant further attention. A national study was conducted to determine the prevalence of scalp and nail involvement and a history of guttate psoriasis at onset according to age, sex, and disease severity. One hundred eighty-one children ages 5 to 17 years with plaque psoriasis were enrolled in a multicenter, cross-sectional study. Subjects and guardians were asked about a history of scalp and nail involvement and whether the initial presentation was guttate. Peak psoriasis severity was assessed and defined historically as mild psoriasis (MP) or severe psoriasis (SP) according to the Physician's Global Assessment and body surface area measures. One hundred forty-three (79.0%) subjects reported a history of scalp involvement, and 71 (39.2%) described a history of nail involvement. Boys were less likely than girls to report a history of scalp involvement (odds ratio [OR] = 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.19–0.84) but more likely to have had nail involvement (OR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.62–5.60). Scalp and nail involvement was not related to psoriasis severity. In contrast, subjects with SP (35.9%) more often reported a history of guttate lesions than did those with MP (21.8%) (p = .02). Antecedent streptococcal infection was more common in children with guttate than those with plaque psoriasis at onset (p = .02) but did not correlate with severity. Sex-related differences in scalp and nail involvement suggest koebnerization. Preceding streptococcal infection predicts guttate morphology but not severity, and initial guttate morphology is associated with eventual greater severity of disease. More aggressive monitoring and management should be considered for guttate psoriasis, given its later association with more severe disease.

### Pediatric psoriasis treated with apremilast [^115QvktJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psoriasis is a cutaneous, chronic inflammatory disorder that affects approximately 3.1% of US adults younger than 60 yearsand up to 2.1% of children worldwide. Chronic plaque psoriasis is generally the most common type of childhood psoriasis (accounting for 74% of cases in one study), followed by guttate psoriasis (9.7%-28.9%), which is often triggered by streptococcal infection. Standardized guidelines for treating childhood psoriasis are lacking, and there are only limited evidence-based data and approved treatments. Case reports, therefore, can be an important source of guidance for clinicians. This case report discusses encouraging outcomes obtained with apremilast in an adolescent patient.

### WITHDRAWN: interventions for guttate psoriasis [^111pz6pb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Guttate psoriasis is a distinctive acute form of psoriasis which characteristically occurs in children and young adults. Very little specific evidence-based guidance is available in standard texts to help make rational decisions about treatment options.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of treatments for guttate psoriasis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 1999), Medline (1966- September 1999), Embase (1988-September 1999), Salford Database of Psoriasis Trials (to November 1999) and European Dermato-Epidemiology Network (EDEN) Psoriasis Trials Database (to November 1999) for terms GUTTATE and PSORIASIS. We also searched 100 unselected RCTs of psoriasis therapy and all 112 RCTs of phototherapy for psoriasis in the Salford Database of Psoriasis Trials for separate stratification for guttate psoriasis.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials in which patients with acute guttate psoriasis were randomised to different treatments, except those trials examining antistreptococcal interventions which are addressed in a separate Cochrane review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality.

Main Results

No published report could be found to support or to challenge current commonly used methods of management. Only one trial which met the selection criteria was identified. In this small study of 21 hospitalised patients with guttate psoriasis, intravenous infusion of an n-3 fatty acid rich lipid emulsion was compared with placebo emulsion containing n-6 fatty acids. The n-3 preparation appeared to be of some benefit for patients with guttate psoriasis.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no firm evidence on which to base treatment of acute guttate psoriasis. Studies comparing standard treatment modalities, including phototherapy and topical regimens, are required to enable informed decisions on treatment choices to be made.

### Clinical course of guttate psoriasis: long-term follow-up study [^112FnBgn]. The Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Guttate psoriasis, known to have a better prognosis than other types of psoriasis, shows rapid involution and longer remission, but its clinical course has barely been studied. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical course and to compare the clinical and laboratory features of guttate psoriasis. This is a retrospective study of 26 patients with guttate psoriasis. The patients were divided into two groups; the good one with complete remission and long remission for at least 1 year (group A) and the poor one with incomplete remission and progression into chronic plaque psoriasis (group B). Among 36 patients, 22 patients (61.1%) were group A and 14 patients (38.9%) were group B. In group A, most of the skin lesions disappeared within 8 months. In group B, two patients without proper treatment progressed to plaque psoriasis. The onset age was younger and more frequent upper respiratory infection and high anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titer were found in group A, but family history of psoriasis was more common in group B. Patients had two distingushable clinical courses: rapid involuting course with long-term remission and chronic course without remission. There was a tendency toward younger age of onset with elevated ASO titer in patients with rapid involuting course.

### The impact of antibiotic therapy in psoriasis patients with active streptococcal infection: a prospective study [^1141kNat]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Psoriasis is a chronic‐relapsing, inflammatory, systemic disease with an estimated prevalence of around 2%–3% of the population. The skin is the primarily affected organ, mostly with erythemato‐squamous plaques defining the most common phenotype, named psoriasis vulgaris. Guttate psoriasis is an eruptive form with smaller lesions, appearing preferentially in pediatric patients. Although the pathogenesis is still not fully understood, evidence supports the role of a variety of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections in psoriasis induction or exacerbation. For example, bacterial ribosomal DNA was detected in blood samples of guttate and plaque psoriasis patients. Several lines of research show that among the bacterial triggers, group A β‐hemolytic streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) is the most traditionally associated species to psoriasis. In fact, psoriasis and recurrent or chronic streptococcal tonsillitis share the same risk allele, being both associated with human leukocyte antigen‐C*06:02. In addition, β‐hemolytic streptococcus is more likely cultured from psoriasis patients throat swabs than controls, while in some retrospective and prospective studies the worsening of psoriasis was associated with sore throat or tonsillitis in percentages varying from 33% to 42% of patients. Moreover, 72% of patients with confirmed streptococcal infections reported worsening of the skin disease in a cohort study. The evidence of an association between psoriasis and acute or recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis has been recently extended to the pediatric population. The natural and logical question raised by this amount of evidence is about the effectiveness of antistreptococcal interventions in improving time‐to‐resolution or long‐term control of psoriasis in patients with proven infection. To date, several studies tried to address this concern, but failed to provide solid, combined evidence. Our aim was to contribute to this field of research by assessing the prevalence of bacterial throat infection among a large cohort of psoriasis patients and the influence of antibiotic therapy in a selected subgroup.

### HLA-C and guttate psoriasis [^112GJJgJ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Psoriasis is a heterogeneous disease in its clinical expression. Both genetic and environmental factors are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of the inflammatory and hyperproliferative components of the typical skin lesions. Predisposing genetic influences include associations with human leucocyte antigens (HLA) of which that with HLA-Cw6 is the strongest. Guttate psoriasis is a specific clinical manifestation of psoriasis frequently associated with group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal throat infection.

Objectives

We set out to determine whether further clinical subdivision of psoriasis is associated with tighter correlation with HLA-C alleles.

Patients/Methods

We determined the HLA-C locus genotype of 29 caucasian patients with guttate psoriasis presenting consecutively with guttate psoriasis associated with a history of a sore throat and/or an antistreptolysin O titre > 200 IU mL-1. Polymerase chain reaction typing using sequence-specific primers was used to detect all known HLA-C alleles. These data were compared with a control population of 604 random caucasian cadaver donors.

Results

All patients (100%) with guttate psoriasis carried the Cw*0602 allele compared with 20% of the control population (odds ratio = infinity; 95% confidence limits 25.00-infinity; Pcorrected < 0.0000002).

Conclusions

This result is consistent with HLA-Cw*0602 playing a part directly in the pathogenesis of guttate psoriasis.

### Ustekinumab-induced remission of recalcitrant guttate psoriasis: a case series [^1111YcYD]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The treatment of guttate psoriasis includes topical steroids, oral antibiotics, tonsillectomy, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and phototherapy. Multiple studies including a randomized trial suggested a potential benefit of tonsillectomy for guttate or pharyngitis-associated psoriasis, but this finding remains controversial. Additionally, a systematic review found no clear evidence supporting the role of oral antibiotics in the treatment of guttate psoriasis. A subset of guttate psoriasis patients do not respond to conventional treatment modalities and represent a challenging patient population.

The pathogenesis of guttate psoriasis is poorly understood. Studies looking at differences in the inflammatory markers (eg, IL-1RA, IL-12p40, IL-17A, IL-22, IL-23, interferon-γ, and LL-37/cathelicidin) in psoriasis patients found similarly increased levels in guttate and plaques subtypes compared with those in healthy controls. Other studies reported variable results, including a study that showed slightly higher levels of IL-12 and IL-23 in plaque versus guttate psoriasis. Overall, these results suggest that the psoriasis phenotypes are not exclusively determined by alterations in inflammatory cytokines, although they may reflect the overall inflammatory burden or disease activity.

Similarly, whether gene variations determine the inflammatory and phenotypic features of guttate psoriasis is also unclear. In an Icelandic patient population, homozygosity for HLA-C*06:02 is associated with a 3-fold increased risk of psoriasis, earlier age of onset, and higher likelihood of a positive family history. The high prevalence (83%-100%) of HLA-C*06:02 in patients with streptococcal infection–associated guttate psoriasis compared with plaque subtypes is perhaps one of the most compelling arguments for the gene-environment trigger of this disease. Nevertheless, Gudjonsson et alfound that HLA-C*06:02 homozygosity did not appear to influence the psoriasis phenotype or disease severity. Additionally, not all carriers of the HLA-C*06:02 allele or a streptococcal infection go on to have guttate psoriasis, suggesting the presence of unidentified disease mechanisms.

### Proteome analysis of skin distinguishes acute guttate from chronic plaque psoriasis [^115sNtwT]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a disease with considerable heterogeneity in clinical presentation. This is the first study using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to compare global protein expression patterns in lesional and non-lesional skin from subjects with acute guttate psoriasis associated with streptococcal throat infection and chronic plaque psoriasis. Samples from experimentally induced contact eczema and normal skin from healthy controls were also included. Proteins with statistically significant differences in expression were used in hierarchical cluster analyses resulting in separation of the different samples into groups. Chronic plaque and guttate psoriasis samples were distinctly separated, indicating that they represent discrete phenotypes at the protein expression level. Interestingly, there was a trend in which guttate psoriasis lesions clustered closer to eczema than to chronic plaque psoriasis lesions, indicating that the duration of the inflammatory reaction may affect clustering. Several of the differentially expressed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry.

### Family history of psoriasis, stressful life events, and recent infectious disease are risk factors for a first episode of acute guttate psoriasis: results of a case-control study [^1156RVx9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The association of guttate psoriasis with streptococcal pharyngitis is well accepted. The association of other risk factors is less well defined.

Objective

We attempted to provide an estimate of the risk for guttate psoriasis associated with a recent infectious disease and to explore other potential risk factors, including family history of psoriasis and psychologic stress.

Methods

This was a case-control study. Cases were patients with a first diagnosis ever of acute guttate psoriasis, made by a dermatologist. Controls were patients newly diagnosed as having dermatologic conditions other than psoriasis and seen in the same outpatient services as the cases. Inclusion of cases and controls was restricted to patients older than 16 years. The Holmes and Rahe Social Readjustment Rating Scale was used to assess stressful life events during the 6 months before diagnosis. A total of 73 cases (median age, 26 years) and 430 controls (median age, 28 years) were included in the analysis.

Results

A family history of psoriasis was strongly associated with guttate psoriasis, the multivariate odds ratio being 7.0 (95% confidence interval, 3.7–13.5) for subjects who reported a history of the disease in parents or siblings. Stressful life events were also associated with guttate psoriasis. The multivariate odds ratio was 1.7 (95% confidence interval, 0.8–3.6) for subjects scoring 41 to 100 and 2.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.3–5.2) for those scoring more than 100 on the Holmes and Rahe Scale. The risk increased with the reported history of any infectious disease. The analysis of specific diagnoses documented a high and significant association with acute pharyngitis, the adjusted odds ratio being 7.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.8–32.5).

Conclusion

The study confirmed that recent pharyngeal infection is a risk factor for guttate psoriasis. It also documented the strong association between guttate psoriasis and a family history of psoriasis. Finally, the study added evidence to the belief that stressful life events may represent risk factors for the onset of psoriasis. By relying on the clinical diagnosis we possibly underestimate the association of guttate psoriasis with infection.

### A systematic review of treatments for guttate psoriasis [^1132wpLY]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Many different therapies are available for treating guttate psoriasis; however, there appears to be little objective evidence for their efficacy

Objectives

This review aims to assess the evidence for the effectiveness of treatments for guttate psoriasis. Antistreptococcal interventions for guttate psoriasis are addressed in a separate review.

Methods

Studies were identified by searching the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 1999), Medline (1966-September 1999), Embase (1988-September 1999), Salford Database of Psoriasis Trials (to November 1999) and the European Dermato-Epidemiology Network (EDEN) Psoriasis Trials Database (to November 1999) for terms GUTTATE and PSORIASIS. We also searched 100 unselected randomized controlled trials of psoriasis therapy and all 112 randomized controlled trials of phototherapy for psoriasis in the Salford Database of Psoriasis Trials for separate stratification of guttate psoriasis.

Results

No published report could be found to support or to challenge current commonly used methods of management. Only one trial that met the selection criteria was identified. In this small study of 21 hospitalized patients with guttate psoriasis, intravenous infusion of an n-3 fatty acid rich lipid emulsion was compared with placebo emulsion containing n-6 fatty acids. The n-3 preparation appeared to be of some benefit for patients with guttate psoriasis.

Conclusion

There is currently no firm evidence on which to base treatment of acute guttate psoriasis. Studies comparing standard treatment modalities, including phototherapy and topical regimens, are required to enable informed decisions on treatment choices to be made.

### Streptococcal throat infections and exacerbation of chronic plaque psoriasis: a prospective study [^112ZrwWf]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Guttate psoriasis has a well-known association with streptococcal throat infections but the effects of these infections in patients with chronic psoriasis remains to be evaluated in a prospective study.

Objectives

To determine whether streptococcal throat infections are more common in and can cause exacerbation in patients with chronic psoriasis.

Methods

Two hundred and eight patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and 116 unrelated age-matched household controls were followed for 1 year. At recruitment all patients were examined, their disease severity scored and throat swabs taken. Patients and corresponding controls were then re-examined and tested for streptococcal colonization whenever they reported sore throat or exacerbation of their psoriasis during the study period.

Results

The psoriasis patients reported sore throat significantly more often than controls (61 of 208 vs. three of 116, P < 0.0001), and beta-haemolytic streptococci of Lancefield groups A, C and G (M protein-positive streptococci) were more often cultured from the patients than the controls (19 of 208 vs. one of 116, P = 0.003). A significant exacerbation of psoriasis (P = 0.004) was observed only if streptococci were isolated and the patients were assessed 4 days or later after the onset of sore throat. No difference was observed between groups A, C or G streptococci in this respect.

Conclusions

This study confirms anecdotal and retrospective reports that streptococcal throat infections can cause exacerbation of chronic plaque psoriasis. It is concluded that psoriasis patients should be encouraged to report sore throat to their physician and that early treatment of streptococcal throat infections might be beneficial in psoriasis. A controlled trial for assessing potential benefits of tonsillectomy in patients with severe psoriasis should also be considered.

### Psoriasis vulgaris – a sterile antibacterial skin reaction mediated by cross-reactive T cells? An immunological view of the pathophysiology of psoriasis [^111zayyX]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

The understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriasis vulgaris has advanced significantly since the therapeutic efficacy of immunosuppressive drugs has drawn attention to the role of immune mechanisms in psoriasis manifestation. Today, the results of many experimental studies provide evidence that psoriasis is largely a T-cell mediated disorder. It may result from antigen-specific activation of T cells in the skin of genetically predisposed individuals. These T cells apparently have a particular functional differentiation and promote the psoriatic skin changes by secreting a certain set of cytokines. Based on the fact that streptococcal throat infections are a trigger of guttate psoriasis, the putative psoriatic antigens are assumed to be in keratinocyte proteins that share structural homologies with streptococcal proteins and thus induce cross-reactive responses of antibacterial T cells against skin components. Together with the particular phenotype of psoriatic skin lesions these findings suggest that psoriasis represents a sterile antibacterial tissue reaction, which is mediated by streptococci-specific T cells that cross-react against epidermal autoantigens.

Guttate psoriasis — lesion size, age distribution, and frequency — Guttate psoriasis presents with dew-drop-like, 1- to 10-mm, salmon-pink papules with fine scale, found primarily on the trunk and proximal extremities. This variant is common in individuals younger than 30 years and occurs in less than 2% of patients with psoriasis.

### Concepts in psoriasis: psoriasis and the extracellular matrix [^1135L2vq]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Post-streptococcal guttate psoriasis only sometimes progresses to the persistent plaque psoriasis. We have previously proposed that psoriasis is driven by multiple extradomain A+ fibronectin (EDA+ FN) 'feedback loops'. The psoriasis-specific loop, the 'keratinocyte loop', depends upon expression by keratinocytes of α5β1 integrin. In normal skin, α5β1 expression is minimal or absent in resting epithelial cells, where basal cells are anchored to the laminin component of the basement membrane (via integrins α6β4 and α3β1). However, when the laminin layer is disrupted, due to wounding for instance, α5β1 is then strongly expressed by basal cells as a means for anchoring. At uninvolved skin sites in patients with psoriasis the laminin layer within the basement membrane is disrupted, with a consequential increase in the expression by basal keratinocytes of EDA+ FN and α5β1. We are postulating that in guttate psoriasis streptococcal lytic enzymes, and in particular streptokinase, may - via plasminogen activation - initiate a disruption of the laminin layer in the basement membrane. It is also possible that the expression by proliferating keratinocytes of plasminogen-activating factor might result in additional laminin digestion. The suggestion is that progression of guttate psoriasis to full-blown plaque psoriasis, or to its spontaneous resolution, is governed largely by the triggering of humoral immune responses. Thus, if streptococcal lytic enzymes are neutralized by host antibodies in advance of irreversible and lasting damage to the basement membrane of the dermal papillae, then guttate psoriasis will resolve spontaneously. In contrast, if permanent damage is induced prior to effective neutralization of the relevant bacterial toxins, then keratinocytes will become chronically destabilized. The consequence will be to liberate keratinocytes to proliferate in response to various stimuli, and to continue to elaborate plasminogen activation enzymes; the combined effect being, in concert with immunological priming, to precipitate and sustain plaque psoriasis.

### Diffuse rash with silvery scales and anasarca [^115fJAPa]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answer:

A. EP – Correct. In patients with pre-existing psoriasis who present with widespread erythroderma and scaling > 80% of body surface area, EP should be considered. Histology shows hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, or inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis that may penetrate the stratum corneum (Munro's abscesses). In patients with darker skin, erythroderma may be difficult to identify. Fig 1, Fig 2
B. Chronic plaque psoriasis – Incorrect. Chronic plaque psoriasis presents with erythematous, round, desquamated plaques with sharply defined borders most commonly on the face, scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. While the patient has a history of plaque psoriasis, the widespread nature of this episode along with hair loss and anasarca makes EP the more appropriate diagnosis.
C. Guttate psoriasis – Incorrect. Guttate psoriasis presents as eruptions of small drop-like lesions, mainly on the trunk, and is most common in children/young adults with a family history of psoriasis. Lesions are typically preceded by a streptococcal throat infection and can be similar in appearance to pityriasis rosacea.
D. Sézary syndrome – Incorrect. Sézary syndrome causes erythroderma due to cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Symptoms additionally can show lymphadenopathy with an elevated CD4-CD8 ratio due to malignant proliferation. Skin biopsy shows T cells infiltrating the epidermis (Pautrier's microabscesses).
E. Toxic epidermal necrolysis – Incorrect. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is characterized by "intense" erythema with full epidermal skin separation > 30% of body surface area, typically with involvement of mucosal surfaces or hemorrhagic crusting of the lips. There may be a drug-trigger preceding onset, commonly with initiation of antibiotics. Skin biopsy shows perivascular inflammatory infiltrate, possibly eosinophils, and full epidermal separation.

Psoriasis phenotypes and comorbidities — Photographs depict clinical variants including Thin plaque type psoriasis, Inverse type psoriasis, Pustular type psoriasis, and Guttate type psoriasis. The text reports an increased overall risk of mortality in patients with severe psoriasis and introduces medical comorbidities under Autoimmune diseases, noting that some comorbidities are attributed to shared or closely linked genetic susceptibility traits.

### Genetic association with ERAP1 in psoriasis is confined to disease onset after puberty and not dependent on HLA-C*06 [^115AjHvP]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

A peak of disease onset at puberty has been shown in cases of psoriasis, which is slightly earlier in girls than in boys. The mechanisms underlying this increase are not known today. A possible effect of increased levels of sex hormones at puberty, in particular estrogens, which are known to promote keratinocyte proliferation via receptor-mediated mechanisms and also to influence inflammatory pathways, has been discussed. Other potential triggers may be different infectious panorama in different age groups.

The distribution of phenotypes in the present study reveals a relatively high proportion of the guttate subtype. This may in part be explained by the recruitment strategy, which has been described in detail. In short, patients were recruited in association with onset of first psoriasis episode and the diagnosis verified by a trained dermatologist in a single center. In the majority of patients (77%) an associated streptococcal infection was confirmed. Earlier studies have shown a higher prevalence of HLA-C*06:02 in patients with guttate psoriasis. The distribution between phenotypes (plaque versus guttate) in prepubertal and postpubertal children was similar in our study (Table 1). Thus, differences in HLA-C*06:02 prevalence between prepubertal children and postpubertal children cannot be attributed to a higher percentage of the guttate phenotype in the latter group but was rather contributed by a larger percentage of plaque cases carrying HLA-C*06:02 in the 10–20-year age group.

### The association of psoriasis and bacterial infections in Pediatric patients: a retrospective review [^117KzJJU]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Guttate psoriasis onset and plaque psoriasis flares are associated with streptococcal pharyngitis. Literature regarding the relationship between anogenital bacterial dermatitis and psoriasis in pediatric patients is limited. We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics, microbiology, and treatment course of patients with psoriasis/psoriasiform dermatitis and concomitant pharyngeal and/or anogenital bacterial infections.

Methods

A multicenter retrospective review of patients ≤ 18years of age with psoriasis/psoriasiform dermatitis and bacterial infection, defined by positive culture results, was performed. Demographic characteristics, clinical features, microbiology, treatment recommendations, and outcomes were evaluated. Comparisons were made between pharyngeal and anogenital culture groups.

Results

A total of 166 unique patients with psoriasis/psoriasiform dermatitis and suspected pharyngeal and/or anogenital infection were evaluated between 2011 and 2021. Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. were isolated in anogenital cultures. Inverse psoriasis was associated with a positive anogenital culture (p = 0.0356). Guttate psoriasis was more common in patients with a positive pharyngeal culture (p < 0.0001). Treatment of a positive bacterial culture did not correlate with the treatment response of psoriasis/psoriasiform dermatitis.

Conclusions

Investigations for anogenital and pharyngeal infections should be considered in pediatric patients presenting with new-onset or worsening psoriasis. A high clinical suspicion should be maintained for anogenital infection in patients with inverse psoriasis, specifically.

### Is chronic plaque psoriasis triggered by microbiota in the skin? [^117Jtwv5]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

There is a known association between psoriasis and Crohn disease (CD). Patients with CD are five times more likely to develop psoriasis, and, conversely, patients with psoriasis are more likely to develop CD. Many gastroenterologists now accept that CD results from a breakdown of immune tolerance to the microbiota of the intestine in genetically susceptible individuals. The microbiota of the skin have recently been investigated in psoriasis. Firmicutes was the most common phylum, and Streptococcus the most common genus identified. Beta-haemolytic streptococci have been implicated in both guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis. Furthermore, the innate immune system has been shown to be activated in psoriasis, and many of the genes associated with the disease are concerned with the signalling pathways of the innate immune system, notably interleukin-23 and nuclear factor κB. Patients with psoriasis also have an increased incidence of periodontitis, a disease thought to be due to an abnormal response to normal oral commensals. Based on the similarities between CD and psoriasis, we propose that psoriasis is due to a breakdown of immune tolerance to the microbiota of the skin. In support of this hypothesis we provide evidence for microbiota in the skin, activation of the innate immune system, and genetic abnormalities involving the innate immune system.

### Distinct HLA-C / KIR genotype profile associates with guttate psoriasis [^115z8HQz]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic background. It associates strongly to HLA-Cw*0602. HLA-C interacts with killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) on natural killer (NK) and some natural killer-T (NKT) cells. KIR's function is triggered by specific binding to HLA ligands, which depends on the amino acid 80 of the MHC class I alpha-chain. This permits classifying all HLA-C alleles into two functional groups: asparagine (N80) or lysine (K80) carrying alleles. Psoriasis patients recruited at disease onset were categorized as guttate, vulgaris without arthropathy and vulgaris with arthropathy plus skin lesions. Patients and carefully matched controls were genotyped for position 80 of HLA-C and for KIR. Based on possible HLA/KIR combinations, individuals were classified according to expected NK/NKT cell responses: balanced (B), excess inhibition (EI), excess activation (EA), or undetermined (U). HLA-Cw6 and position 80 genotyping associated strongly to disease, whereas KIR2DS1 associated weakly. Individuals of the U and EI classes were more common among guttate psoriasis patients, which related to HLA-Cw*0602 status. These results suggest that different levels for NK/NKT cell activation thresholds, not only reduction, contribute to immune deregulation in psoriasis. In the guttate phenotype, balanced HLA-C/KIR interactions might be altered by the presence of concomitant streptococcal infections.

### Paradoxical reactions under TNF-α blocking agents and other biological agents given for chronic immune-mediated diseases: an analytical and comprehensive overview [^112zBbWK]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

anti-TNF-α agents

Since an initial report in 2003, numerous cases have been described, and two systematic literature reviews have been performed, the most recent analysing 207 cases. Psoriasis occurring during anti-TNF-α therapy may be induced or exacerbated by biological agents without identified predisposing factors. In particular, co-medication such as methotrexate given for the underlying disease is not a protective factor. Infections are not observed as a triggering event. Paradoxical psoriasis has been observed in men and women, with no apparent age effect. Most of the patients have no previous personal or family history of psoriasis. All the diseases treated by anti-TNF-α agents may develop paradoxical psoriasis, but cases seem to predominate in RA with, in general, good control of the disease by the drug. Paradoxical psoriasis may occur at any time from a few days to several years after drug initiation. The reported cutaneous lesions are plaque, pustular or guttate-type psoriasis. The most frequently affected areas are the scalp and flexures and palmoplantar areas. Pustular psoriasis affecting the palm and soles seems to be frequent and was reported in more than 50% of cases (figure 1). The nails are involved less often, but typical changes (onycholysis, discolouration and pitting) have been described. The rate of new onset/exacerbation of psoriasis in patients receiving anti-TNF-α agents has been calculated from two registries. The incidence rate of psoriasis in an RA population from the UK was estimated at 1.04/1000 person-years (95% CI 0.67 to 1.54), compared to a rate of zero in an RA group without biologics(table 2). Interestingly, patients with adalimumab had a significantly increased risk of psoriasis compared to etanercept (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 4.6 (1.7 to 12.1)) and compared to infliximab (IRR 3.5 (1.3 to 9.3)). Data from the Spanish biological register (BIOBADASER) found similar results, with a global incident rate of 2.31/1000 patient-years, but no highest incidence was observed with a specific anti-TNF-α agent. One may remark that the risk for paradoxical psoriasis in these registries was found to be low and non-significant according to the large CIs. Paradoxical psoriasis has the same pattern of histological abnormalities as conventional psoriasis lesions. In general, the outcome of paradoxical psoriasis is favourable. Most patients were able to continue their treatment with full or partial resolution of the skin lesions. For patients who were switched to another anti-TNF-α agent, half of them experienced a recurrence of their lesions. Only a minority of patients reported a severe course with erythrodermic lesions requiring systemic corticosteroids. The treatments given were usually topical steroids and/or vitamin D analogues and keratolytics.

### The association of psoriasis and bacterial infections in Pediatric patients: a retrospective review [^111BrSiz]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

This study assembled a large multicenter cohort of pediatric patients with psoriasis/psoriasiform dermatitis and suspected bacterial infection, shedding light on the clinical presentation and course in this patient population. Our results support previous literature and the known association between guttate psoriasis and streptococcal pharyngitis. The association between inverse psoriasis and anogenital infection is newer. While pruritus was the most common symptom of anogenital infection, it was only seen in 28% of patients with a positive anogenital culture. Similarly, only 24% of patients with a positive pharyngeal culture were symptomatic. The lack of symptoms with a positive bacterial culture may also indicate a state of bacterial carriage. A high clinical suspicion should be maintained, especially in cases of guttate and inverse psoriasis, and a thorough physical examination of the anogenital region should be performed regardless of associated symptoms. Of note, despite the association of guttate and inverse psoriasis with bacterial infection in our study, plaque psoriasis was still the most common presentation in all groups, likely reflecting its higher relative frequency in the psoriasis population.

The anogenital microbiome may reflect the gut microbiome. Intestinal dysbiosis can trigger signaling molecules involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Superantigen formation in streptococcal pharyngitis resulting in T‐cell activation with subsequent epidermal proliferation resulting in psoriasis is well‐documented. We hypothesize that this is likely the same mechanism relating streptococcal anogenital infection and psoriasis. While previous literature has mainly focused on Streptococcus, our study highlights thatspecies may also play a role in patients with psoriasis and anogenital infection. Of the common skin phyla, Firmicutes, to which the genera Staphylococcus belongs, has been found in greatest quantities in psoriatic skin with active disease, and studies have shown that up to 46% of psoriasis lesions contain. Additionally, a study by Tomi et al. found that a percentage of patients with psoriasis andcontained toxigenic strains. No healthy patients who harbored Staphylococcus had toxigenic strains.

### A case of pruritic hyperkeratotic papules on the back [^113ewrJN]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Answers:

A: Transient acantholytic dermatosis (Grover's disease) - Incorrect. Grover's Disease classically presents as a sudden onset of pruritus on the back, chest, and upper arms in older men. Lesions are scattered erythematous crusted papules with scant overlying scale that may be eroded. Although Grover's Disease may be clinically indistinguishable from EPPP, histological findings (Fig 3) are most consistent with the classic findings of porokeratosis (see Question 2 for further discussion).
B: EPPP - Correct. Porokeratosis is a group of keratinization disorders characterized by keratinocyte expansion.EPPP is a rare subtype of porokeratosis characterized by the sudden onset of sharply demarcated annular plaques with atrophic centers and a thinly elevated keratotic border. Unlike more common subtypes, EPPP's involvement is extensive and develops insidiously. Patients present with intensely itchy annular papules, most commonly on the extremities and trunk.EPPP primarily affects older patients (mean age of onset of 65.8 years old) and is more common in males4. Additionally, EPPP is associated with underlying malignancy in 30% of individuals, most commonly of gastrointestinal and hematological systems. This correlation may warrant further diagnostic investigation in the appropriate clinical context.
C: Prurigo nodularis - Incorrect. Prurigo nodularis presents as multiple, discrete firm dome-topped nodules which are severely pruritic. These lesions are more common on the extensor surfaces and anterior thighs and slowly enlarge over time.
D: Guttate psoriasis - Incorrect. Guttate psoriasis is a variant of psoriasis that presents as an eruption of many well-demarcated, hypopigmented papules with scale. It commonly presents 2–3 weeks after an upper respiratory tract infection and is more common in children and young adults.
E: Acquired perforating dermatosis - Incorrect. Acquired perforating dermatosis commonly affects patients with chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and, rarely, malignancy. Patients present with pruritic umbilicated hyperkeratotic papules on the trunk and extremities.

### The association of psoriasis and bacterial infections in Pediatric patients: a retrospective review [^117B1zPh]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background/Objectives

Guttate psoriasis onset and plaque psoriasis flares are associated with streptococcal pharyngitis. Literature regarding the relationship between anogenital bacterial dermatitis and psoriasis in pediatric patients is limited. We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics, microbiology, and treatment course of patients with psoriasis/psoriasiform dermatitis and concomitant pharyngeal and/or anogenital bacterial infections.

Methods

A multicenter retrospective review of patients ≤ 18 years of age with psoriasis/psoriasiform dermatitis and bacterial infection, defined by positive culture results, was performed. Demographic characteristics, clinical features, microbiology, treatment recommendations, and outcomes were evaluated. Comparisons were made between pharyngeal and anogenital culture groups.

Results

A total of 166 unique patients with psoriasis/psoriasiform dermatitis and suspected pharyngeal and/or anogenital infection were evaluated between 2011 and 2021. Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. were isolated in anogenital cultures. Inverse psoriasis was associated with a positive anogenital culture (p = 0.0356). Guttate psoriasis was more common in patients with a positive pharyngeal culture (p < 0.0001). Treatment of a positive bacterial culture did not correlate with the treatment response of psoriasis/psoriasiform dermatitis.

Conclusions

Investigations for anogenital and pharyngeal infections should be considered in pediatric patients presenting with new‐onset or worsening psoriasis. A high clinical suspicion should be maintained for anogenital infection in patients with inverse psoriasis, specifically.

### Specific IgA and CLAT-cell IL-17 response to Streptococcus pyogenes in psoriasis [^114aYppD]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Streptococcus pyogenes tonsillar infection is well known to trigger and exacerbate psoriasis lesions in both guttate and plaque forms of the disease. Although mucosal and cutaneous tissues are closely involved in psoriasis pathology, the interaction between their specific immune responses has not been deeply explored. This work aims to address and characterize the presence of humoral responses against S. pyogenes in patients with psoriasis and its putative association with cytokine responses detected in vitro in our psoriasis ex vivo model, based on the coculture of cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen ± T cells with autologous epidermal cells. Patients with psoriasis presented increased IgA response to S. pyogenes when compared with control subjects. In patients with plaque psoriasis, despite being negative for anti-streptolysin O antibody titer, IgA plasma levels against S. pyogenes correlated with cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen + T-cell-dependent IL-17F response in vitro. No association is observed for IgG levels in plaque psoriasis. Similar association is observed for IgA anti-S. pyogenes extract and IL-17A in patients with guttate psoriasis. We propose S. pyogenes-specific IgA as a potential new perspective for better understanding the role of S. pyogenes in psoriasis development.

### Juvenile psoriasis in European and Asian children: similarities and differences [^1168f9Cf]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The first manifestations of psoriasis begin in childhood in more than one-third of patients. However, epidemiological data of juvenile psoriasis are lacking.

Objectives

To compare Dutch (NL group) and Singaporean (SG group) children with psoriasis with the aim of studying the characteristics of juvenile psoriasis and to highlight similarities and differences between these different ethnic groups.

Methods

Data were collected from 207 patients younger than 18 years diagnosed with psoriasis from Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands and the National Skin Centre, Singapore.

Results

A striking difference in familial distribution was found, with more Dutch children having an affected family member (73·3% vs. 13·6%). Presence of itch and triggering factors were more common among Dutch children (80% vs. 14·2% and 33·3% vs. 7·4%, respectively). However, both groups shared similar triggering factors like stress and infections. Other similarities included mean age at presentation (NL group 11·3 years; SG group 14·1 years) and gender ratio (NL group, M/F 1: 1·1; SG group, M/F 1: 1·4). Plaque psoriasis was the most common type in both cohorts while guttate and pustular psoriasis were rare. In both groups, the head, followed by the limbs, was the most common site involved. Similar proportions of children in both countries had nail involvement and psoriatic arthritis was rare.

Conclusions

The disparity in familial distribution may point to genetic differences between the two groups. Further studies to evaluate this difference in familial distribution may contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriasis.

### Psoriasis coxsackium [^116bTR1t]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

HFMD is an enterovirus-mediated illness, characteristically causing a papulovesicular exanthem and oral enanthem. Although more common in children, HFMD has recently been reported more frequently in adults. HFMD classically involves the oral mucosa and acral surfaces; yet, our patient had involvement within her psoriasis plaques. This begs the question of what led our patient to develop psoriasis coxsackium.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin, in which the immune system plays an integral role. Raposo et alfound that antiviral genes are upregulated in patients with psoriasis as compared with patients with atopic dermatitis; however, this finding was only present in the skin, not the bloodstream. There is also enhanced production of antimicrobial peptides in psoriasis as compared with atopic dermatitis. However, all antimicrobial peptide classes have antibacterial properties, but only a few classes have antiviral properties. This may explain why HFMD developed in our patient, and subsequently Kaposi varicelliform eruption, after a high-risk household exposure. Additionally, we speculated as to an alternative pathogenesis, including koebnerization of the psoriasis after HFMD. This pathogenesis has been reported in the literature; a patient developed psoriasis papules on the sites of previous HFMD blisters. However, it is unlikely, because our patient presented with psoriasiform change on the extensor surfaces — a common location for psoriasis, not HFMD. No psoriasiform rash was observed on her hands. Additionally, there was epidermal necrosis at the biopsied site, a feature that we would not expect in psoriasis. Another recent article described guttate psoriasis following a HFMD episode in a patient with no previous history of psoriasis; the authors proposed that this may have represented immune system activation following infection in a genetically predisposed individual.

This represents to our knowledge, the first reported case of psoriasis coxsackium. Although this had an indolent course, it remains a rare clinical presentation to consider when managing psoriasis flares.

### The association of psoriasis and bacterial infections in Pediatric patients: a retrospective review [^113so6XF]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Phototherapy was more commonly recommended for psoriasis/psoriasiform dermatitis treatment in patients with a positive pharyngeal culture. The predominance of guttate psoriasis morphology in patients with pharyngeal infections may explain the association between a positive pharyngeal culture and the use of phototherapy, but confounding factors, such as the provider's assessment of the ability of candidates to participate in phototherapy, may exist. Of note, BSA of psoriasis involvement did not differ significantly between infection groups. No other significant differences in treatment recommendations were found between groups. Additionally, neither the presence of a positive culture, the pathogen isolated in the anogenital culture, nor the outcome of treatment of the positive bacterial culture correlated with psoriasis treatment outcome as no significant differences were found between groups. Of note, for the 64% of patients with available follow‐up data, the mean follow‐up length, defined as time from initial presentation when infection was suspected or confirmed to the last documented visit with dermatology, was 1.08 months. The retrospective design of our study prevented long‐term follow‐up and full evaluation of treatment response.

The limitation of this study is its retrospective and descriptive nature and the associated inherent limitations of this methodology. All positive culture results, which included all Streptococcus species, were reported and analyzed given this descriptive nature. In a subset of the population, the organism identified on the culture could have represented chronic colonization rather than infection; however, our study data could not discriminate between these. Additionally, due to design limitations, it could not show a significant difference in psoriasis response to treatment upon treatment of the suspected bacterial infection. These results were not intended to be used to guide clinical decision‐making, only to raise clinical awareness and prompt future investigation.

In conclusion, pharyngeal and anogenital bacterial infections may be identified in pediatric patients with psoriasis, especially those with guttate and inverse psoriasis, respectively. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are commonly identified pathogens in the anogenital areas of pediatric patients with psoriasis. The multicenter design of this study has allowed us to gather and share important knowledge on the largest cohort of patients with an anogenital infection associated with psoriasis to date. Future prospective studies can further clarify the effect of treating a positive anogenital bacterial culture on psoriasis outcomes.

### Perianal streptococcal infection precipitating pustular psoriasis in an adult [^115iTnjG]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Pustular psoriasis is an uncommon initial presentation of psoriasis in adults. Contact dermatitis has been implicated as a precipitant of pustular psoriasis in 2 case reports. Negative patch test results after the patient had been off prednisolone confirmed that contact dermatitis was not the cause of this patient's eruption.

S pyogenes has a well-established association with both acute and chronic psoriasis, particularly guttate psoriasis. The prevailing current theory regarding this relationship is that psoriasis is an autoimmune disease triggered by the bacterial microbiota of the skin, including the presence of Streptococcus. It has been suggested that the streptococcal antigen sensitizes T cells to epitopes in skin keratin. Perianaland vulvarstreptococcal infection has been linked to the development of psoriasis in children.

Antibiotic treatment for Streptococcus has not been shown to be reliably effective in the treatment of established guttate or chronic plaque psoriasisbut may be beneficial in early infection in children with psoriasis. Withdrawal of topical and systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine has been shown to trigger pustular psoriasis in some cases, and avoidance of potentially irritating topical preparations such as tar and dithranol when pustules are present is generally accepted.

This case demonstrates pustular psoriasis as the initial presentation of psoriasis in an adult after perianal S pyogenes infection. A search of PubMed and MEDLINE did not reveal any reports of pustular psoriasis as the initial presentation of psoriasis in an adult secondary to a cutaneous infection. This case highlights the need for the clinician to consider a nonpharyngeal streptococcal infection as a cause of a pustular psoriasiform eruption.

### Ustekinumab-induced remission of recalcitrant guttate psoriasis: a case series [^111nqbor]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Case presentations

Patient 1 is a 38-year-old man who with guttate psoriasis that coincided with recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis. Physical examination found scattered, erythematous papules and plaques with scale involving the head, trunk, and extremities. His total body surface area (BSA) involvement was 20% with an overall Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score of 3. He did not respond to treatment with topical steroids (1 year), oral prednisone (1 week), and cyclosporine (3 mg/kg/d for 2 months). He received a single 90-mg injection of ustekinumab and reported complete clearing of all lesions in less than 4 weeks. He has remained clear for more than 16 months without the need for additional injections.

Patient 2 is a 25-year-old woman with guttate psoriasis that developed after suffering a broken leg. She subsequently experienced recurrent episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis with associated flares of her psoriasis. Skin examination found scattered papules and plaques with scale involving the head and extremities. Her BSA involvement was 5% with an overall PGA score of 2. She did not respond to treatment with multiple courses of oral antibiotics over 2 years, narrowband ultraviolet-B therapy (twice weekly for 2 years), or topical steroids (> 2 years). She was treated with ustekinumab, 90-mg injections, at weeks 0 and 8. She noticed improvement shortly after her first injection and was almost clear at 8 weeks. She was completely clear within 6 months of the first injection and remained clear with 3 additional injections of 45 mg at weeks 23, 35, and 58. She has not required additional injections of ustekinumab and remains clear with only occasional use of topical steroids.

### The many faces of psoriatic arthritis: their genetic determinism [^112xVJqg]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heterogeneity in psoriatic disease

PsA is an inflammatory disease that variably affects synovial joints, tendons, entheses and axial sites. Psoriasis is often a feature and PsA develops in about 30% of patients with established skin and/or nail psoriasis. PsA is remarkably heterogeneous in its presentation, disease course and imaging findings compared with, for example, RA. Furthermore, responses to treatment can be quite disparate and divergent.

Clinical heterogeneity

The clinical presentation of PsA often differs considerably between affected patients. While a polyarticular presentation (> 4 involved joints) is the most common, an oligo- or monoarticular presentation is not at all uncommon. In some patients, the initial site of inflammation may be at entheses such as the achilles tendon insertion, in others there may be a swollen or dactylitic digit and in yet others, the spine may be the dominant site of inflammation. Throughout the course of the disease, most patients will experience joint inflammation, and enthesitis occurs in 60%, dactylitis in 50% and spinal inflammation may be present, depending on how it is assessed, in up to 30%. Skin and/or nail involvement most commonly precedes musculoskeletal (MSK) inflammation by an average of 10 years but in 10–15%, the MSK inflammation may proceed or occur simultaneously with onset of skin psoriasis.

This clinical heterogeneity extends beyond MSK involvement. While plaque psoriasis is most commonly seen, some patients will show other psoriasis patterns including guttate, pustular or inverse forms. Nail changes, too, can be quite varied ranging from the commonly observed pitting and onycholysis to the uncommon but more severe crumbling and complete nail loss. Other organs and tissues are rarely involved including the uveal tract or the gastrointestinal tract. Fifty per cent of patients with established PsA will commonly have three or more features of the metabolic syndrome.

### HLA cw*06 is not essential for streptococcal-induced psoriasis [^113xu6hg]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Streptococcal throat infections and HLA Cw6 (Cw*06) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, particularly in the guttate form.

Objectives

To study 105 Irish patients with psoriasis to investigate the relationship between streptococcal infections and Cw*06.

Methods

The patients were divided into two groups: those with guttate psoriasis or guttate flare (guttate group, GG, n = 64) and those with chronic plaque psoriasis (chronic plaque group, CPG, n = 41).

Results

The incidence of Cw*06 was 86% in the GG and 73% in the CPG, which was not significantly different (P = 0.1725) but the incidence in both groups was significantly higher than in an Irish control group (18%) (P < 0.0001 vs. GG and P < 0.0001 vs. CPG). Evidence for streptococcal infection was higher in the GG (56%) than in the CPG (32%) (P = 0.0231). Of those patients with evidence of streptococcal infection, 30 of 36 GG (83%) and nine of 13 CPG (69%) patients possessed the Cw*06 genotype.

Conclusions

Thus, not all patients with streptococcal-related psoriasis carry Cw*06. The role of Cw*06 in psoriasis, if any, has yet to be determined.

### A case series of early biologic therapy in guttate psoriasis: targeting resident memory T cell activity as a potential novel therapeutic modality [^117Skgch]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although GP is a distinct variant of PV, it shares many pathophysiologic similarities to PV, including initial involvement of epidermal dendritic cellsand high levels of IL-17 isoforms. Langerhans cell migration within the epidermis has been found to be impaired in both GP and PV, when compared with healthy controls. However, migration impairment was less in GP and PV, and patients with resolution of their GP demonstrated normalization of Langerhans cell migration in line with clinical resolution of disease. Therefore, from a pathophysiologic perspective, GP can be thought of as an innate immune stimulation of PV pathways without long-term perpetuation of feed-forward chronic inflammation. IL-23p19 antagonists are widely used in the treatment of PV, with significantly higher levels of clinical efficacy in terms of reaching a psoriasis area and severity index score of 75 and 90 than tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors and some IL-17 inhibitors. Inhibition of IL-23p19 reduces activation and polarization of T-helper 17 cells, thereby reducing cytokines, including IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and interferon-γ, which are linked to keratinocyte hyperproliferation and chronic feed-forward inflammation.

### Efficacy and safety of risankizumab vs. secukinumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (IMMerge): results from a phase III, randomized, open-label, efficacy-assessor-blinded clinical trial [^117A6Ezt]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Patients

This study recruited adult patients with a diagnosis of chronic, moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis with or without psoriatic arthritis for at least 6 months before the baseline visit and who were candidates for systemic therapy including secukinumab. Patients had to demonstrate at least 10% body surface area covered with psoriasis plaques, a static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) score of ≥ 3, and a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 12 at screening and baseline. Patients were not eligible to participate if they had a history of erythrodermic psoriasis, generalized or localized pustular psoriasis, medication‐induced or medication‐exacerbated psoriasis, or new‐onset guttate psoriasis (or any other active skin disease) that might interfere with the study assessments. Other exclusion criteria included a history of inflammatory bowel disease (based on warnings and precautions provided in the secukinumab prescribing information), chronic infections, active systemic infection (except common cold) during the last 2 weeks preceding the baseline visit, and history of malignancy, except for successfully treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix, within the last 5 years. Previous exposure to risankizumab or secukinumab was not permitted.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with awareness and attention to comorbidities [^1162nYVb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Definition — psoriasis severity criteria and scoring — Psoriasis vulgaris is described as a chronic inflammatory skin disease with well-demarcated, red plaques with silvery scale that commonly involve the scalp, elbows, knees, and presacral region, though any area may be affected including the palms, soles, nails, and genitalia; severity by body surface area (BSA) uses thresholds of < 3% BSA for mild, 3%-10% BSA for moderate, and > 10% BSA for severe disease, but psoriasis can be severe irrespective of BSA when it has serious functional consequences or occurs in selected locations (hands, feet, scalp, face, or genital area) or when it causes intractable pruritus; the Psoriasis Area Severity Index quantifies extent and severity by incorporating BSA plus intensity of redness, scaling, and plaque thickness, producing a score from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease severity), is used for monitoring response to treatments in clinical trials and as a research tool to judge severity, and is rarely utilized by dermatologists in clinical practice to guide management; cutaneous forms include vulgaris (plaque), guttate, palmoplantar, inverse, and pustular.

### Diagnosis and classification of psoriasis [^113YdH18]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory multi organ disease with well characterized pathology occurring in the skin and often the joints. Although the disease has many characteristic and even pathognomonic features, no established diagnostic criteria exist for cutaneous psoriasis and there is no unified classification for the clinical spectrum of the disease. Prior approaches that have been taken to classify psoriasis include age of onset, severity of the disease, and morphologic evaluation. The latter has yielded plaque, guttate, pustular, and erythrodermic as subtypes of psoriasis. Unlike other autoimmune diseases, histopathological examination and blood tests are generally not valuable tools in making the diagnosis of psoriasis. However, on occasion, dermatopathologic evaluation may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of psoriasis. Thus, in most cases the diagnosis of psoriasis is dependent primarily on pattern recognition that is morphologic evaluation of skin lesions and joints.

### The association of psoriasis and bacterial infections in Pediatric patients: a retrospective review [^1144wNRF]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Psoriasis represents an immunologic reaction involving antigen‐activated T lymphocytes with subsequent cytokine release in the context of a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Streptococcal pharyngeal infection is one of the environmental triggers that has been linked to the onset of guttate psoriasis and flares of plaque psoriasis. This phenomenon involves superantigens, including M proteins of beta‐hemolytic Streptococci groups A, C, and G, as well as pyogenic toxins, which cause T‐cell activation through molecular mimicry of keratin proteins. The subsequent epidermal stimulation results in hyperplasia and clinically recognizable psoriatic eruptions.

A limited number of studies have also reported an association between psoriasis and anogenital dermatitis. Anogenital dermatitis comprises several distinct conditions, most of which are characterized by erythema, edema, pruritus, and/or pain of the genitalia, perineum, perianal area, intergluteal cleft, and/or inguinal crease, which may be associated with constipation, fissures, and/or rectal bleeding. Mainly group A β‐hemolytic Streptococcus and, in one case, group B Streptococcus have been isolated in cultures of anogenital dermatitis. Limited case reports and series have reported on 7 adult and 17 pediatric patients with psoriasis and associated perianal or vulvovaginal group A β‐hemolytic and group B streptococcal dermatitis. Of note, improvement of psoriasis severity after treatment of the perianal infection has been suggested. Because identifying and treating the infection has been suggested to limit the severity and extent of the associated psoriasis, we studied a cohort of pediatric patients with concomitant psoriasis or psoriasiform dermatitis and a suspected anogenital or pharyngeal bacterial infection to identify key clinical characteristics, analyze management, and evaluate outcomes of both psoriasis and the positive culture results in this population.

3 Results

3.1 Patient Characteristics

A total of 166 patients met study criteria. The average age at initial evaluation was 9.2 ± 4.3 years with a slight female predominance (55%; 92/166). Sixty‐six percent (109/166) of subjects were White. Ten percent (17/166) and 71% (118/166) of patients were Hispanic/Latino and non‐Hispanic/Latino, respectively (Table 1). Plaque psoriasis was seen in 49% (82/166) of patients. Other subtypes of psoriasis seen in this population included guttate (36%; 60/166), inverse (16%; 26/166), pustular (4%; 7/166), nail (4%; 6/166), and erythrodermic (2%; 3/166) psoriasis (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Demographic characteristics.

Cultures were negative in 43% (72/166) of patients initially suspected of having a bacterial infection. 57% (94/166) of patients had at least one positive culture. Thirty‐five patients (21%; 35/166) had a positive pharyngeal culture only, 53 patients (32%; 53/166) had a positive anogenital culture only, and 6 patients (4%; 6/166) had both positive cultures. Patients with a positive anogenital culture only (7.8 ± 4.0 years) were significantly younger than patients with a positive pharyngeal culture only (11.2 ± 3.5 years) (adjusted p = 0.0013). Significantly more female subjects had a positive pharyngeal culture only (74%;26/35) than a positive anogenital culture only (40%; 21/53) (adjusted p = 0.0177) (Table 1).

### The role of tonsillectomy in psoriasis treatment [^112JZZ5X]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic and immune-mediated skin disease with a considerable negative impact on quality of life. The link between psoriasis, especially guttate psoriasis, and streptococcal infections, namely tonsillitis, has been studied for several years. Some authors have also suggested an association with other types of psoriasis, such as plaque psoriasis, which is the most common. The role of tonsillectomy in the treatment of plaque psoriasis is not consensual. This case report aims to discuss this topic. The authors intend to highlight the growing evidence of a relationship between plaque psoriasis and an infectious pathology of the otolaryngology area. A clinical case of severe chronic plaque psoriasis with exacerbations linked to acute tonsillitis is described. The case was recalcitrant to dermatological treatment and tonsillectomy was included in the treatment options. After surgery, the skin disease was evidently controlled and significant improvement on the patient's quality of life was also evident.

### Contrasting patterns of streptococcal superantigen-induced T-cell proliferation in guttate vs. chronic plaque psoriasis [^115BuDKW]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Streptococcal infection is strongly associated with guttate psoriasis (GP) and may also exacerbate chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP), possibly through the release of superantigenic toxins.

Objectives

To investigate superantigen-induced generation of cutaneous lymphocyte associated antigen (CLA) -positive lymphocytes in GP compared with CPP.

Methods

Peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) expression of CLA and T-cell receptor Vbeta chain was assessed in patients with CPP and with active and resolved GP. Expression of superantigen-reactive Vbeta families was compared with in vitro superantigen-induced peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation.

Results

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with active GP showed a twofold increased proliferation after stimulation with streptococcal pyogenic toxins A and streptococcal pyogenic toxins C compared with controls (P < 0.01), whereas the response to the staphylococcal toxins and mitogenic stimulation was the same in all groups. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from patients with active GP showed increased use of the superantigen-reactive families Vbeta2 (P < 0.01) and Vbeta17 (P < 0.05), which was not evident in the other patient groups or controls. This pattern of Vbeta expression was only observed in CLA-positive T cells. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between Vbeta2 expression and enhanced proliferation after stimulation with SPEA (r = 0.82, P < 0.01) and SPEC (r = 0.74, P < 0.05) in active GP.

Conclusions

This study supports the concept that streptococcal infection precipitates acute GP at least in part through superantigen driven generation of Vbeta-restricted CLA-positive skin homing lymphocytes, whereas we could find no evidence for a similar mechanism occurring in the maintenance of stable CPP.

### The association of psoriasis and bacterial infections in Pediatric patients: a retrospective review [^112p17MN]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical features of psoriasis/psoriasiform dermatitis and bacterial infection.

Guttate psoriasis was significantly more common in patients with a positive pharyngeal culture than in patients with a positive anogenital culture (adjusted p < 0.0001) or patients with a negative pharyngeal and/or anogenital culture (adjusted p = 0.0037), while inverse psoriasis was significantly more common in patients with a positive anogenital culture than in those with a positive pharyngeal culture (adjusted p = 0.0356) or a negative pharyngeal and/or anogenital culture (adjusted p = 0.0356) (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Clinical presentation of psoriasis/psoriasiform dermatitis.

Erythema (78%; 46/59) was the most common presenting sign of anogenital infection in those with a positive anogenital culture. In this group, 25% (15/59) experienced pruritus, 8% (5/59) experienced pain, and 2% (1/59) had dysuria (Table 3). Similarly, 24% (10/41) with a positive pharyngeal culture were symptomatic (Table 4).

### Ustekinumab-induced remission of recalcitrant guttate psoriasis: a case series [^116c63TB]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Patient 3 is a 29-year-old man with guttate psoriasis that developed after streptococcal pharyngitis. On examination, the patient had enlarged, erythematous tonsils bilaterally and small erythematous papules coalescing into plaques on his face, trunk, buttocks, and extremities. He did not respond to treatment with topical steroids, oral prednisone, and cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/d for 2 months). He received ustekinumab, 45 mg injections, at weeks 0, 6, 18, and 30. He had complete clearance at the time of his fourth injection and remained clear for more than 20 months until he had another guttate flare after an episode of pharyngitis. He received 2 additional 45-mg injections 4 weeks apart noting significant improvement after a single injection.

Patient 4 is a 26-year-old man on certolizumab pegol for Crohn's disease who had guttate psoriasis after streptococcal pharyngitis. Skin examination found small, erythematous papules and plaques on the trunk, buttocks, and extremities. His BSA involvement was 5% with an overall PGA of 2. He did not respond to treatment with topical steroids, topical pimecrolimus, and cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/d for 4 months). Certolizumab pegol was discontinued, and the patient received ustekinumab, 90-mg injections, at weeks 0 and 6 then every 8 weeks. The patient's BSA decreased from 5% to 1% after the first injection, and his skin was completely clear at the time of his third injection. He has remained clear for more than 2 years and continues receiving ustekinumab injections every 8 weeks for treatment of his Crohn's disease.

### Microbe-dependent induction of IL-9 by CLAT cells in psoriasis and relationship with IL-17A [^1166UVbd]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

IL-9 is present in psoriatic lesions and is produced by lymphocytes. However, it is not known whether this cytokine is induced by relevant pathogenic triggers of psoriasis, such as Streptococcus pyogenes. Here we addressed the production of IL-9 in response to various pathogens in a psoriatic ex vivo model. Extracts of S. pyogenes and Candida albicans triggered the production of IL-9 and also IL-17A and IFN-γ. This induction was dependent on the interaction between CLA + T cells and epidermal cells. Neutralization of IL-9 reduced S. pyogenes-induced IL-17A production by CLA + T cells but had no effect on IFN-γ production. Also, IL-9 increased the survival of circulating psoriatic CLA + T cells. Co-cultures from patients with guttate or plaque psoriasis with S. pyogenes produced similar amounts of IL-9. High cytokine responses in streptococcal-driven guttate patients paralleled peaks in Psoriasis Area Severity Index and anti-streptolysin O levels. Our results confirm that IL-9 promotes inflammation in psoriasis by up-regulating IL-17A production and support the clinical association of the immune response by streptococcal-sensitized CLA + T cells with this cytokine, especially in guttate psoriasis.

### Burning pain on the upper labial mucosa [^113hExnW]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Geographic tongue shares strong similarities with what common dermatologic condition?
A. Psoriasis
B. Erythema multiforme
C. Pityriasis rosea
D. Discoid lupus erythematosus
E. Rosacea

Answers:

A. Psoriasis – Correct. Current literature suggests clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical similarities between geographic tongue and psoriasis. In fact, some authors have argued that geographic tongue may represent oral manifestations of psoriasis, although this remains controversial. Moreover, a systemic review and meta-analysis indicated an association between geographic tongue and psoriasis (odds ratio: 3.53; 95% CI: [2.56–4.86]; p = 0.03). Interestingly, this patient had a streptococcal exposure, new onset headache, and was treated empirically for streptococcal pharyngitis at the time of lip symptoms. There is a well-established association between acute guttate psoriasis and preceding streptococcal infection. If ectopic geographic tongue shares similarities to the immune-mediated pathogenesis of psoriasis, it raises the possibility that the lesions on the patient's upper labial mucosa occurred secondary to streptococcal infection.
B. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. There is no clear relationship between erythema multiforme and geographic tongue.
C. Pityriasis rosea – Incorrect. There is no clear relationship between pityriasis rosea and geographic tongue.
D. Discoid lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. There is no clear relationship between discoid lupus erythematosus and geographic tongue.
E. Rosacea – Incorrect. There is no clear relationship between rosacea and geographic tongue.

### Guttate psoriasis is associated with an intermediate phenotype of impaired Langerhans cell migration [^112HthMi]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

An episode of guttate psoriasis can be an isolated event, can recur as guttate episodes, or develop into chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP). A previous study revealed that early-onset (before age 40 years) CPP is associated with inhibition of epidermal Langerhans cell (LC) migration.

Objectives

To determine whether guttate psoriasis is also associated with abnormal LC mobilization.

Methods

Three groups of patients were recruited: current guttate episode (n = 5); guttate psoriasis progressed to CPP (n = 6); and resolved guttate psoriasis (n = 2). Biopsies were taken from uninvolved skin and LC migration was measured ex vivo using an epidermal explant model.

Results

Patients with a current episode of guttate psoriasis displayed epidermal LC migration, although the extent was significantly lower than in skin from healthy controls (P < 0·05). In contrast, in those patients in whom guttate psoriasis developed into CPP there was no mobilization of LC. Finally, in patients in whom guttate psoriasis had resolved, LC migration was normal.

Conclusions

We have shown that guttate psoriasis is associated with an abnormality of LC mobilization, but a less marked inhibition compared with that seen in CPP. In resolved guttate psoriasis LC function returns to normal. These data provide further evidence that the pathogenesis of psoriasis is characterized by significant changes in epidermal LC function.

### HLA-Cw6-positive and HLA-Cw6-negative patients with psoriasis vulgaris have distinct clinical features [^1169BCfz]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is associated with HLA-Cw6, and Caucasians who carry this allele have about a 10-fold increased risk of developing psoriasis. We have HLA-C typed 369 patients with familial psoriasis and compared the clinical features of the patients carrying HLA-Cw6 against those carrying other HLA-C types. Some striking clinical differences were observed between the two groups. Patients who are Cw6 positive had a lower age at onset (p = 3x10(-7)). Cw6-positive women had an earlier disease onset than Cw6-positive men (p = 0.02), but such a difference was not observed for the Cw6-negative patients. The guttate-type onset of psoriasis was mostly confined to this group (p = 2x10(-4)) and persistent disseminated guttate-like papules were also predominantly observed in the Cw6-positive patients (p < 10(-)4). The Cw6-positive patients also had more extensive plaques on their arms, legs, and trunk (p = 0.001), more severe disease (p = 0.003), higher incidence of the Koebner's phenomenon (p = 0.005), reported more often that their psoriasis got worse during or after throat infections (p = 0.02), and more often a favorable response to sunlight (p = 0.008) In contrast, dystrophic nail changes were more common in the Cw6-negative patients (p = 0.002) and also psoriatic arthritis, although this was not significant (p = 0.135). It is concluded that patients with psoriasis have different clinical features depending on whether they are HLA-Cw6 positive or negative.

### Ustekinumab-induced remission of recalcitrant guttate psoriasis: a case series [^1115uAj9]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Patient 5 is a 42-year-old woman with a 3-year history of mild plaque psoriasis who had a guttate flare after streptococcal pharyngitis. She did not respond to treatment with narrowband ultraviolet B therapy and cyclosporine (4 mg/kg/d for 6 weeks). Skin examination found small erythematous papules and plaques with scale coalescing on her trunk, scalp, and extremities. Her BSA was 40% with an overall PGA of 2. The patient received ustekinumab, 45 mg, at weeks 0 and 4 and was noted to be completely clear at week 12. She maintained clearance for more than 3 months before reverting back to her baseline mild disease.

Patient 6 is a 35-year-old woman on apremilast for chronic plaque psoriasis who had a severe guttate psoriasis flare after streptococcal pharyngitis. Skin examination found well-demarcated erythematous, scaly plaques located on the trunk and extremities. Her BSA was 10% with an overall PGA of 3. She did not respond to treatment with topical steroids (3 months) and cyclosporine (4 mg/kg/d for 3 months). The patient received ustekinumab, 90 mg, at week 0 and 90 mg ustekinumab at week 4. She was noted to be completely clear at 3 months and has remained clear for 7 months without the need for additional injections.

### The impact of antibiotic therapy in psoriasis patients with active streptococcal infection: a prospective study [^114eVWMt]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5 Statistical analysis

At baseline, the differences in demographics (age and gender) in throat swabs (defined as positive or negative) or antibodies (defined as positive titer > 200 IU/mL and negative titer < 200 IU/mL) were evaluated in four subtypes of psoriasis (vulgaris, guttate, palmoplantar, and inverse) using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and the Student's t ‐test for continuous variables. For continuous variables, mean with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are reported in the text. A multivariate analysis by logistic regression was performed when age and/or gender resulted as significantly associated with either throat swabs or titer and the investigated psoriasis subtypes.

Changes in PASI scores at the 1‐, 6‐, 12‐, and 18‐month follow‐ups were compared among groups of subjects based on their ASO titer status (positive or negative) and their throat swab results (positive or negative). Differences in PASI scores between subjects undergoing streptococcal therapy and subjects not receiving therapy were assessed with the Student's t ‐test.

In all analyses, a two‐sided p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA software StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA.

### A case series of early biologic therapy in guttate psoriasis: targeting resident memory T cell activity as a potential novel therapeutic modality [^114QAzz4]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous T RM cells are a unique subset of T cells in skin that express specific cellular markers, including CD69 and CD103. When stimulated by IL-23 via the IL23 receptor, they rapidly produce IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL22. They are linked to the cutaneous immunologic memory in various cutaneous disorders, such as PV, as well as recurrence of PV lesions at the sites of previous disease. Theoretically, T RM cells may be involved in the progression of GP to PV through the development of T-helper 17 immunologic memory, leading to the chronic feed-forward inflammatory cascade characteristic of PV.

We present a case series of 4 patients with clinically diagnosed GP with rapid and sustained clearance with IL-23 antagonism using risankizumab monotherapy. After 3 doses of risankizumab and withdrawal of therapy, no recurrence of disease was documented up to 24 months of follow-up. These cases support the possible role of T RM cell antagonism in preventing the progression from GP to PV and a novel therapeutic approach for inducing rapid remission of GP.

### HLA-Cw6 and psoriasis [^114iUu5i]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic background. HLA-Cw6 is one of the most strongly associated psoriasis susceptibility alleles. It is repeatedly observed to affect disease course, phenotypic features, severity, comorbidities and treatment outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, the roles of HLA-Cw6 in psoriasis have not yet been thoroughly reviewed. The worldwide frequency of the HLA-Cw6 allele varies greatly, with it being generally higher in white people than in Asians. The allele is associated with type I early-onset psoriasis. Stress, obesity and streptococcal pharyngitis are commonly observed in HLA-Cw6-positive patients. Phenotypically, HLA-Cw6 has been found to be associated with guttate psoriasis. In addition, patients carrying the allele are more likely to have arm, leg and trunk involvement, and the Koebner phenomenon. Patients with psoriatic arthritis with HLA-Cw6 more often have early onset and tend to show cutaneous symptoms before musculoskeletal symptoms. HLA-Cw6-positive patients have been shown in several studies to be more responsive to methotrexate and ustekinumab. However, this difference in ustekinumab efficacy was only moderate in a post-hoc analysis of a pivotal phase III study. HLA-Cw6 positivity also tends to be less frequent in high-need patients who fail conventional therapy. Small studies have also investigated the role of HLA-Cw6 in remission of psoriasis during pregnancy, and with the comorbidities of photosensitivity and atherosclerosis. Given the diverse nature of psoriasis pathogenesis, as well as the difference of HLA-Cw6 positivity in different ethnic groups, more studies are needed to confirm the role of HLA-Cw6 in psoriasis.

### The impact of antibiotic therapy in psoriasis patients with active streptococcal infection: a prospective study [^117Jwm5f]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

A total of 155 patients with psoriasis were enrolled. Among them, 86 (55.5%) were males and 69 (45.5%) were females. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) age at the time of enrollment was 42.9 years ± 16.7 years. Concerning the clinical presentation, 95 patients (61.3%) were diagnosed with psoriasis vulgaris (chronic plaque psoriasis), whereas 36 patients (23.2%) presented with guttate psoriasis; five patients (3.2%) presented lesions compatible with the palmo‐plantar variant, while two patients (1.3%) showed the inverse variant. Finally, some patients with a previous diagnosis of psoriasis vulgaris experienced an acute guttate flare and were included in a specific group (N = 17, 11.0%). No significant difference in gender distribution among patients with different types of psoriasis was detected.

Regarding the streptococcal infection, 39 psoriasis patients (25.5%) had a positive throat swab while 80 (51.6%) presented positive ASO titer (> 200 IU/mL).

Patients with psoriasis vulgaris were significantly older than patients with other psoriasis subtypes (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, patients with guttate psoriasis showed a mean age significantly lower than the other groups (p = 0.0001) (Table 1). No statistical results emerged concerning the age of patients with palmo‐plantar or inverse psoriasis, or for those with psoriasis vulgaris and an acute guttate flare.

Some of the patients were lost at follow‐up during the study: 13 cases were lost between T0 and T3, while at the T4 timepoint a total of 26 patients were lost.

A total of 252 subjects were enrolled in the healthy control (HC) group. Among them, 102 (40.0%) were males and 150 (60.0%) were females. The mean age of the HC group was 44.5 ± 15.4 years. Streptococcal throat swab resulted positive in 32 of the 252 patients. The proportion was significantly lower than in the group of psoriatic patients (12.7% vs. 20.4%, p = 0.039).

### Etanercept (Enbrel) [^116vMKPT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.5	Adult Plaque Psoriasis

The safety and efficacy of Enbrel were assessed in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in adults with chronic stable PsO involving ≥ 10% of the body surface area, a minimum Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of 10 and who had received or were candidates for systemic antipsoriatic therapy or phototherapy. Patients with guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular psoriasis and patients with severe infections within 4 weeks of screening were excluded from study. No concomitant major antipsoriatic therapies were allowed during the study.

Study I evaluated 672 subjects who received placebo or Enbrel SC at doses of 25 mg once a week, 25 mg twice a week, or 50 mg twice a week for 3 months. After 3 months, subjects continued on blinded treatments for an additional 3 months during which time subjects originally randomized to placebo began treatment with blinded Enbrel at 25 mg twice weekly (designated as placebo/Enbrel in Table 13); subjects originally randomized to Enbrel continued on the originally randomized dose (designated as Enbrel/Enbrel groups in Table 13).

Study II evaluated 611 subjects who received placebo or Enbrel SC at doses of 25 mg or 50 mg twice a week for 3 months. After 3 months of randomized, blinded treatment, subjects in all three arms began receiving open-label Enbrel at 25 mg twice weekly for 9 additional months.

### Pediatric psoriasis treated with apremilast [^112wpMvN]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Case report

A 14-year-old boy with severe psoriasis affecting the extremities, scalp, face, torso, and genitalia returned to the clinic after a 5-year absence. The patient had guttate psoriasis diagnosed originally at age 8, which quickly progressed to plaque psoriasis involving approximately 30% of the body surface area (BSA). Despite treatment with topical therapies and limited exposure to sunlight, he never obtained a clinically meaningful response. His parents were unwilling to have him undergo treatment with narrowband ultraviolet B therapy because of the inconvenience of the procedure, and they also refused the use of systemic agents such as cyclosporine and methotrexate because of their potential side effects. The patient was unable to tolerate etanercept injections. However, his psoriasis remained in relative remission during his absence, controlled only by sunlight.

At the time of his return to the clinic, the patient was estimated to have 40% BSA involvement, characterized by a widespread guttate pattern coalescing into plaques in various places and severe pruritus. His lesions were so pruritic that he often drew blood when scratching his lower legs. His family had begun homeschooling him several years earlier because he had become withdrawn and less socially confident, which they attributed to his skin disease. He was prescribed an antibiotic to control the streptococcal infection that presumably triggered the flare, along with midpotency triamcinolone 0.1% cream to minimize symptoms. One month later, his condition had worsened (now 50% BSA), and he was prescribed alternative topical corticosteroids at higher potencies, depending on lesion location. Systemic treatment options were again reviewed with his family.

### Cyclosporine for refractory Kawasaki disease with psoriasiform eruption [^115Vbf6z]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A psoriasiform eruption is a well-recognized, albeit rare, manifestation of KD. Psoriasiform eruption most commonly resembles plaque psoriasis, with a predilection for the trunk, extremities, and diaper area. It typically resolves with IVIG, ASA, and topical steroid therapy and does not adversely affect patient outcomes. In recalcitrant cases, tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors, such as infliximab or etanercept, may be considered. Our patient had minimal and transient improvement on several treatment modalities, including topical steroids, IVIG, ASA, and infliximab. As a result of this treatment resistance, cyclosporine was utilized and was successful in treating his cutaneous eruptions and stabilizing his systemic disease. The use of cyclosporine for reducing other common symptoms and inflammation associated with KD has been studied. One study demonstrated that more than 64% of patients became afebrile following the use of cyclosporine for KD. Another study demonstrated that IVIG in combination with cyclosporine resulted in reduced coronary artery symptoms in comparison to the use of IVIG alone. The median duration of psoriasiform eruption in KD in previous studies is over 8 months, suggesting that cyclosporine therapy may have decreased the duration of the psoriasiform eruption in our case as well as improved systemic symptoms

The cause of psoriatic eruption in KD is currently unknown, although there are several proposed mechanisms. Since KD is an autoinflammatory condition, some studies have theorized that the release of cytokines "unmasks" psoriasis in predisposed patients. The release of cytokines may activate T-cells, causing the release of interleukin-1a, which could subsequently lead to psoriasis due to an increase in T-cells in the skin. Another potential mechanism involves bacterial superantigens from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Superantigens can bind Vβ2 receptors on T-cells, causing their activation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which is a process that was previously reported for psoriasis vulgaris and guttate psoriasis. The patient in this case report had a history of upper respiratory infections but no confirmed bacterial infections. Certain genes have also been shown to confer susceptibility to the development of KD. These genes upregulate the calcium-nuclear factor pathway that plays a role in the development and activity of T-cells. Therefore, an increase in inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2, can be seen. Cyclosporine inhibits this pathway, potentially explaining its effectiveness for mitigating the manifestations seen in patients with KD.

### Image-based artificial intelligence in psoriasis assessment: the beginning of a new diagnostic era? [^113iof2h]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science concerned with replicating human cognitive functions and analyzing large amounts of data. As a field with primarily visual diagnoses and a large patient base, dermatology has recently experienced one of the most rapid developments in medical AI applications, particularly in the area of computer-guided image classification. The development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for melanoma detection has provided groundbreaking work, as algorithms have shown great potential to improve human accuracy in the dignity assessment of melanocytic lesions. For example, in a study by Haenssle et al. comparing the diagnostic performance of 58 international dermatologists with a CNN in melanoma detection using dermoscopic images, most dermatologists were outperformed by the algorithm. In a real-world setting, the combination of human and artificial intelligence, or augmented intelligence, has been shown to increase diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in the evaluation of melanocytic lesions by integrating CNN classification into clinical decision making. Naturally, these advancements in the early recognition of skin cancer have spurred research into CNN applications for other dermatoses, such as psoriasis.

Psoriasis is a common chronic immune-mediated inflammatory skin disorder that affects approximately 2–3% of the general population worldwide. Onset can occur at any age and the disease is not yet curable. Clinical presentation is variable and may include palmo-plantar, scalp, intertriginous, and nail involvement. Plaque psoriasis most commonly presents with sharply demarcated, silvery, erythrosquamous plaques on the extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees and the lumbosacral region (Fig. 1 A). Other less common subtypes, such as erythrodermic (Fig. 1 B) or guttate psoriasis (Fig. 1 C), as well as genetically and phenotypically distinct pustular psoriasis (Fig. 1 D), add to the diagnostic complexity. Since psoriasis is typically diagnosed visually and is easily photographed by healthcare providers and patients, the resulting image repositories lend themselves to analysis by AI. In addition to cutaneous manifestations, patients are susceptible to multiple comorbidities, such as psoriatic arthritis and cardiometabolic syndrome, and most patients experience a decrease in quality of life, with an associated higher risk of developing depression.

Since Koebner's first observance of the isomorphic response of psoriasis in a tattoo in 1872, a paucity of written reports has appeared in the literature describing this phenomenon, although it appears to be common knowledge among dermatologists. We report a strep-induced guttate psoriasis isomorphic response in a Winnie the Pooh tattoo in a 19-year-old.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^112aPr4U]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory disease in which dysregulation of the immune system results in overexpression of inflammatory cytokines. Several of these cytokines (e.g. interleukin [IL]-22, IL-23, and IL-17) are also involved in host defense mechanisms against common pathogens, including Candida species (spp.). Some Candida spp. secrete toxins that exacerbate psoriasis, and it has been hypothesized that the presence of C. albicans in the gut can stimulate production of superantigens, causing non-specific T-cell activation and production of cytokines that can trigger the psoriatic process. Thus, candidiasis is a recognized trigger for psoriasis exacerbations and persistence, and patients with psoriasis may be at risk for subclinical Candida colonization and infections of the skin, mouth, and intestinal tract.

Several psoriasis treatments may further increase patients' risk for developing fungal infections. For example, oral candidiasis has been noted in patients using topical corticosteroids for psoriasis, and systemic immunosuppressive agents used to treat psoriasis (e.g. methotrexate and cyclosporine) are associated with increased rates of oral and disseminated candidiasis. Additionally, increased Candida colonization and mild or moderate localized Candida infections have been reported in patients receiving biologic therapy for psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases (e.g. Crohn's disease).

Dermatology practitioners who treat patients with psoriasis need to be aware of the signs and symptoms of candidiasis, as well as the recommended candidiasis treatment guidelines. This article presents an overview of candidiasis epidemiology in patients with psoriasis, followed by a primer for dermatologists on the diagnosis and treatment of superficial oropharyngeal, cutaneous, and genitourinary candidiasis.

### Ustekinumab-induced remission of recalcitrant guttate psoriasis: a case series [^1143xSYU]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

The use of biologic medications, such as ustekinumab, may offer an alternative treatment for patients with chronic or recalcitrant guttate psoriasis. Ustekinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, therefore disrupting IL-12Rβ1 binding and IL-12 and IL-23–mediated cell signaling in T helper (Th) lymphocyte (Th-1 and Th-17) and natural killer cell populations. Despite the elevated levels of IL-12 and IL-23 found in guttate psoriasis patients, ustekinumab's role in this psoriasis subtype has not been formally evaluated. Overall, there is a paucity of randomized controlled clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of interventions commonly used to treat guttate psoriasis.

The use of biologics for guttate psoriasis is not standard of care, as it is commonly self-limited, and biologics are intended for long-term control of chronic plaque psoriasis. However, a phase IIIb trial of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis comparing standard ustekinumab maintenance dosing (45 or 90 mg every 12 weeks) with extended tailored dosing (16, 20, and 24 week intervals) showed that some patients with chronic plaque psoriasis can remain clear/almost clear. It is possible that after induction with ustekinumab, select patients with chronic plaque or chronic guttate psoriasis may obtain disease control with ustekinumab induction or intermittent dosing.

To date, there is only 1 published case report of a chronic guttate psoriasis patient who was successfully treated with ustekinumab. Here we present 6 cases of recalcitrant guttate psoriasis successfully treated with ustekinumab. We acknowledge the limitations of this series, including the small sample size, lack of control group, and variable ustekinumab dosing used. This was not a prospective clinical trial, and we recognize the need for further clinical and laboratory studies to help elucidate the molecular mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of guttate psoriasis. Nevertheless, this limited case series provides strong evidence for the potential benefit of ustekinumab in the treatment of recalcitrant or chronic guttate psoriasis.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 6. guidelines of care for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: case-based presentations and evidence-based conclusions [^111iBw61]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Selected gaps in knowledge for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis — treatments, safety, and biology note that comparative effectiveness of psoriasis treatments for plaque psoriasis is under-studied and few studies that exist are short term, making it difficult to determine which drugs are most safe and effective long term and leading to broad recommendations that list options in alphabetical order. Comparative effectiveness for clinical variants such as guttate, pustular, erythrodermic, inverse, and palmoplantar psoriasis is an area with almost no data. Most safety data for psoriasis therapies come from other diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis, and it is unclear if such data acutely reflect safety of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, methotrexate, and other therapies in the psoriasis population; risks of clinically significant liver toxicity with methotrexate using existing liver biopsy guidelines require further study. Safety and effectiveness of home- or office-based narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) compared with other treatments in the U.S. population requires additional study. Studies indicate that the majority of patients with objectively severe psoriasis are treated only topically or not at all, and more data are necessary to determine patient, physician, treatment, and economic factors that limit long-term control. In genetics and pathomechanisms, studies evaluating correlation between psoriasis genotype and phenotype should be undertaken, and vasculature has been understudied with an animal model showing that overexpression of an angiopoietin receptor in keratinocytes leads to mice bearing numerous criteria of psoriasis.

### HLA-Cw1 and psoriasis [^1149CK9Y]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition with regional and ethnic differences in its prevalence and clinical manifestations. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-Cw6 is the disease allele conferring the greatest risk to psoriasis, but its prevalence is lower in Asian individuals. Recent studies have found associations between HLA-Cw1 and some Asian populations with psoriasis, especially Southern Chinese. HLA-Cw6 was associated with type I early-onset psoriasis, guttate psoriasis, Koebner phenomenon, and better response to methotrexate, interleukin (IL)-12/23, IL-17, and IL-23 targeting drugs. In contrast, HLA-Cw1 positivity has been associated with erythrodermic psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, and the axial type of psoriatic arthritis. Furthermore, HLA-Cw1 was more frequently associated with high-need patients who did not respond to conventional therapies. No known trigger factor nor autoantigen has been identified for HLA-Cw1 positivity. However, HLA-Cw1 has been linked to some viral agents. For example, cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize multiple cytomegalovirus pp65-derived epitopes presented by HLA alleles, including HLA-C*01:02. In addition, cytomegalovirus can lead to severe exacerbation of psoriatic skin disease. The proposed interaction between viral infection, HLA-Cw1, and psoriasis is through the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors of natural killer cells. Given the diverse nature of psoriasis pathogenesis and the difference in HLA-Cw prevalence in different racial groups, more studies are needed to confirm the role of HLA-Cw1 in psoriasis.

### Psoriasis of early and late onset: a clinical and epidemiologic study from Spain [^111TTACu]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The existence of 2 distinct forms of psoriasis related to age at onset has been postulated. However, precise data regarding the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of psoriasis depending on the age at onset are still lacking.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to define the clinical and epidemiologic features of this disease in Spain and to compare patients with psoriasis of early and late onset.

Methods

An observational, analytic, cross-sectional, multicenter study was carried out. From January 1999 to November 1999, 179 participating dermatologists completed a questionnaire detailing the clinical and epidemiologic features of the first 10 consecutive patients with psoriasis seen in their clinical practice. The sample distribution was proportional to the Spanish population. Both statistical and descriptive analyses were performed.

Results

Available data were obtained from 1774 patients. The onset of the disease before 30 years of age was significantly associated with a higher incidence of family history of psoriasis, a more severe and extensive cutaneous involvement, and greater psychosocial impact. Guttate psoriasis, nail involvement, evidence of precipitating factors, and a recurrent clinical course were more frequent in this group of patients. Patients with psoriasis of late onset had a less severe clinical course and a more continuous evolution. Palmoplantar pustulosis was more frequent in this group of patients. No significant relationship was detected between the age at onset and development of joint involvement.

Conclusion

Patients with early and late onset psoriasis often show different clinical and evolutionary features. From the analysis of our data, it seems that 2 different groups of patients with psoriasis related to age at onset can be defined.

### Infections during childhood as predisposing factors to develop psoriasis vulgaris into early adulthood [^114H4n7b]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Various environmental factors contribute to disease development in genetically susceptible individuals. Although infections have been associated with disease initiation and recurrence, the consequences of early exposure to infections, many years before disease manifestation, is unexplored.

Objective

To investigate the effect of exposure to infections during formative years on the incidence of psoriasis through to early adulthood.

Methods

ABIS is a large birth cohort in which parents of participating children have answered comprehensive questionnaires on exposure to infections and medication at different age intervals of the children. Information regarding psoriasis was obtained from the Swedish National Patient Register, while data on medication was obtained from the National Prescribed Drug Register. Statistical analyses were performed with custom-written R scripts.

Results

Logistic regression analysis on one-year follow-up data revealed that influenza was associated with an increased risk of developing psoriasis later in life (OR 2.47, CI 1.32–4.39; P = 0.006). In line with this, at the third-year evaluation, we found that participants who had tonsillitis at least once during the first three years of life had almost three times greater risk of developing psoriasis into early adulthood compared to controls (OR 2.90, CI 1.46–5.56; P = 0.003). In contrast, at the eight-year evaluation, we found that psoriasis was less frequent in children who had experienced gastroenteritis episodes between ages six and eight, compared to controls (OR 0.42, CI 0.20–0.92; P = 0.0028).

Conclusion

We demonstrate for the first time the effect of exposure to infections during the first years of life, and their role in the subsequent development of psoriasis extending into early adulthood. Our study indicates that early exposure to infections may influence the development of the adaptive immune system during formative years. This modulation is evidenced by the higher incidence of psoriasis observed in early adulthood, several years after the initial exposure.

### The role of the palatine tonsils in the pathogenesis and treatment of psoriasis [^117952Hp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disease with strong genetic associations and environmental triggers. Patients with psoriasis develop sore throats much more frequently than nonpsoriatic individuals and it is well documented that streptococcal throat infections can trigger the onset of psoriasis, and such infections cause exacerbation of chronic psoriasis. It is now generally accepted that psoriatic lesions are caused by abnormal reactivity of specific T lymphocytes in the skin. However, it has been shown in recent years that activation of specific immunity is always preceded by activation of nonspecific innate immune mechanisms, and that abnormalities in the innate immune system can cause dysregulation in specific immune responses. Here we explore the possible immune mechanisms that are involved in the link between infection of the tonsils and this inflammatory skin disease. Moreover, we survey the literature and discuss the suitability of tonsillectomy as a treatment for psoriasis.

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis in pediatric patients [^1127j3uV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric psoriasis — definitions and pathophysiology: Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that classically presents with well-demarcated, pink plaques with silvery scale, and although commonly involving the scalp, elbows, knees, and presacral region in adolescents and adults, any area of skin may be involved, including the palms and soles. Children with psoriasis can present with unique distribution patterns, including isolated facial or genital involvement, particularly in infancy. Psoriasis has many cutaneous forms, including plaque (psoriasis vulgaris), guttate, palmoplantar, inverse, and pustular. It is described as an inflammatory, immune-mediated condition stemming from inappropriate activation of cutaneous T cells and dendritic cells with subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 1, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor α, leading to keratinocyte hyperproliferation, the influx of neutrophils, and further propagation of inflammation; this inflammation is also thought to contribute to systemic disease associations, including metabolic syndrome and arthritis.

3.1 Throat swab and ASO titer (Table 2)

TABLE 2
PASI score measured at each timepoint in patients grouped on the basis of positivity of the ASO titer.

No statistical gender difference was found in analysis of the results of throat swabs and ASO titers.

In the psoriasis vulgaris patient group, throat swabs were positive in 16 cases and negative in 114 cases. In the same group, the ASO titer resulted in > 200 IU/mL in 44 cases and < 200 IU/mL in 51 cases.

Among patients with guttate psoriasis, the throat swab tested positive in 15 cases and negative in 21 cases; the ASO titer was positive in 23 cases and negative in 13 subjects.

The five patients of the palmoplantar psoriasis group showed a positive throat swab in two cases, while the other three subjects were negative; ASO titer was > 200 IU/mL in four subjects and negative in one subject. Two patients with inverse psoriasis type showed a negative swab and a negative ASO titer.

Six patients (35.3%) had a positive throat swab among patients affected by psoriasis vulgaris with a guttate flare. In the same group, seven patients (41.2%) had an ASO titer of > 200 IU/mL.

Subjects with a positive throat swab were significantly younger than those with a negative throat swab (34.90 ± 16.41 vs. 45.94 ± 15.96, p = 0.0003). For this reason, age must be considered a confounding factor in the association between the result of throat swab and vulgaris or guttate psoriasis subtypes. In fact, statistical descriptive analysis evidenced an association between a positive throat swab and psoriasis vulgaris which lost its significance when age adjusted. Similarly, subjects with an ASO titer of > 200 IU/mL were of a significantly lower age compared to subjects with a titer < 200 IU/mL (37.5 ± 14.9 vs. 48.8 ± 16.6, p < 0.0001). Age, therefore, considered a confounding factor of the association between the result of ASO titration and vulgaris and guttate psoriasis subtypes. Analogously, no significant associations between ASO titer and psoriasis subtypes were found after age‐adjustment.

### Genetic association with ERAP1 in psoriasis is confined to disease onset after puberty and not dependent on HLA-C*06 [^113cqW4o]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psoriasis is a highly heterogeneous disease with a complex genetic background, and the strategy to stratify into subgroups is likely to be fruitful for fully understanding the spectrum of the disease. The underlying genetics may affect the age at onset, and separating psoriasis into early- and late-onset disease using 40 years as the divider has been useful. Using this definition, early-onset psoriasis has been shown to have a higher degree of heritability and a higher prevalence of HLA-C*06:02. However, onset before the age of 40 years has been reported in ∼75% of patients with psoriasis and thus this definition of early-onset comprises the majority of patients with psoriasis. Nevertheless, most genetic studies use this classification and lack a more detailed stratification.

Other stratification attempts separate patients according to HLA-C status. Presence of the risk allele HLA-C*06:02 is claimed to be associated with earlier disease onset, more severe disease course, and a higher prevalence of the guttate phenotype. Nail and joint manifestations are reported to be more frequent in HLA-C*06:02 -negative patients.

### Beyond the herald patch: exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^113jmgF9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis

Several conditions may mimic PR and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Below is a list of common differentials with brief descriptions of why they need to be ruled out:
Secondary syphilis: Often presents with a generalized rash, including on palms and soles, which can resemble PR but usually lacks a herald patch and has a different distribution, and lymphadenopathy is almost always found in secondary syphilis but usually never in PR. A rapid plasma reagin test is essential to rule out this condition.
Tinea corporis: Fungal infections can present with annular, scaly lesions that may mimic PR. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation can confirm the diagnosis by revealing fungal elements.
Erythema multiforme: This condition can present with targetoid lesions and mucosal involvement, which is not typical of PR. A detailed history and clinical examination help distinguish between the two, as erythema multiforme is often related to herpes simplex infection.
Guttate psoriasis: Characterized by small, rain-drop pattern, scaly papules, guttate psoriasis may resemble PR but often has a history of sore throat and psoriasis, scales are thicker and silvery-white, and it lacks the typical herald patch.
Pityriasis lichenoides chronica: Chronic, scaly, red–brown papules that may resemble PR, but lesions persist longer, the herald patch is lacking, and papules are in different stages of evolution, one or more of them showing a darker center and have a more varied appearance. Histopathology is often needed for differentiation.
Pityriasis alba: Hypopigmented, scaly patches usually seen in children with a history of eczema. The absence of a herald patch and the chronic nature of the condition help differentiate it from PR.
Lichen planus: Pruritic, purple, polygonal papules often involving the wrists, lumbar spinal region, glans penis, and oral mucosa. The chronicity and distribution help differentiate it from PR.
Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus: Erythematous, annular, or polycyclic lesions that may mimic PR but often have photosensitivity and systemic symptoms, and histology shows epidermal atrophy and basal layer degeneration.
Nummular eczema: Coin-shaped, scaly patches that may resemble PR. The chronic, relapsing nature, intense pruritus, and shin and dorsal hand localizations, rarely found in PR, are key differentiators.
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: Early stages may resemble PR, as the initial patch does not respond to topical steroids mimicking PR. However, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma typically has a chronic course and does not respond to standard PR treatments. Multiple serial biopsies are essential for diagnosis.
Kaposi sarcoma: Can present with red, purple, or brown plaques and nodules. Unlike PR, Kaposi sarcoma is associated with immunosuppression and has a more progressive course.

Infections: bacterial, viral, and mycobacterial — tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors carry an increased infection risk, with upper respiratory tract infections most common, and rare opportunistic infections reported more often with infliximab or adalimumab than with etanercept; careful monitoring and early evaluation is critical. In the event of an infection requiring antibiotics, "the TNF inhibitor should be withheld" and for more serious or opportunistic infections "the TNF inhibitor should be discontinued", and "treatment with TNF inhibitors should be avoided if possible in patients with chronic, serious, or recurring infections".

### Acute guttate psoriasis patients have positive Streptococcus hemolyticus throat cultures and elevated antistreptococcal M6 protein titers [^114zi9pc]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

To further study the role of Streptococci hemolyticus infection and streptococcal M6 protein in the pathogenesis of acute guttate psoriasis, streptococcal cultures were taken from the throats of 68 patients with acute guttate psoriasis. PCR technique was applied to detect M6 protein encoding DNA from those cultured streptococci. Pure M6 protein was obtained by Sephacry/S-200HR and Mono-Q chromatography from proliferated Streptococcus hemolyticus. Antistreptococcal M6 protein titers were measured in the serum of patients with acute guttate psoriasis, plaque psoriasis and healthy controls by ELISA. A high incidence of Streptococcus hemolyticus culture was observed in the guttate psoriatic group compared with the plaque psoriasis and control groups. Fourteen strains of Streptococcus hemolyticus were cultured from the throats of 68 acute guttate psoriasis patients. Of these, 5 strains contain DNA encoding the M6 protein gene as confirmed by PCR technique. More than 85% purification of M6 protein was obtained from Streptococcus pyogenes. Applying our pure M6 protein with the ELISA methods, we found that the titer of antistreptococcal M6 protein was significantly higher in the serum of guttate psoriasis patients than in the control or plaque psoriasis groups (P < 0.01). We verified that patients of acute guttate psoriasis have a high incidence of Streptococcus hemolyticus in their throats and raised titers of antistreptococcal M6 protein in their sera.

Question 2: Which of the following is most often associated with Behçet's disease?
A. HSV infection
B. Streptococcal infection
C. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27
D. HLA-B51
E. Anti-nuclear antibodies

Answers:

A. HSV infection – Incorrect. Behçet's disease has been hypothesized to be triggered by a preceding infection. The most commonly implicated infections include HSV-1 and streptococcus, but multiple infections, including EBV, suspected in this case, have been previously associated. Infections are however not a stronger risk factor than HLA-B51.
B. Streptococcal infection – Incorrect. As above, infections are not the strongest risk factor for the development of Behçet's disease.
C. HLA-B27 – Incorrect. HLA-B27 is independently associated with an increased risk of Behçet's disease, however is it not the strongest associated haplotype associated with this condition.HLA-B27 is more strongly associated with increased risk other autoinflammatory conditions, including ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis.
D. HLA-B51 – Correct. HLA-B51 is the most well-established predisposing genetic factor associated with Behçet's disease. It is, however, not necessary, specific, or sensitive for diagnosis, especially in patients that are not of Northern European descent.
E. Anti-nuclear antibodies – Incorrect. These antibodies are not associated with risk of developing Behçet's disease and are implicated in a varie ty of connective tissue diseases such as lupus, scleroderma, and dermatomyositis.

### Uveitis and nail psoriasis in a patient without articular involvement: a case report [^114inseC]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease and affects over 60 million people worldwide. It may manifest itself through several clinical phenotypes, some of which are far more common than others, including psoriasis vulgaris or plaque psoriasis, guttate psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, flexural psoriasis or inverse psoriasis, sebopsoriasis or scalp psoriasis, palmoplantar psoriasis, and nail psoriasis. Skin manifestations usually precede nail psoriasis by up to 10 years, and it also highly correlated with PsA; however, it can be also present at the onset of psoriasis in 5–10% of patients.

The pathophysiological relationship between uveitis and psoriasis has not been fully elucidated; regardless, uveitis has been frequently observed in cases of psoriasis vulgaris and PsA, especially among men, mainly with HLA-B27 positivity. Tanaka et al. reported an unusual distribution of uveitis in Japanese patients, being most common in psoriasis vulgaris (7/13) than in PsA (4/13). They also reported cases of uveitis associated with pustular psoriasis (2/13) and psoriatic erythroderma (1/13). Nonetheless, previous studies have not described the association between isolated nail psoriasis and uveitis.

Uveitis most generally follows the skin manifestations of psoriasis and serves as a possible warning sign of PsA. Still, uveitis can precede skin manifestations of psoriasis in a few cases. Several authors have described the clinical picture of uveitis associated with psoriasis as chronic, bilateral, and severe.

Our patient presented a clinical picture of uveitis similar to that reported by Durrani and Foster in patients with psoriasis without arthritis. However, our patient has not yet developed other signs of psoriasis besides the nail lesions. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case with these characteristics. Previous studies have described that PsA can precede the presentation of uveitis by an average of 9.7 (range 0–29) years. In one study of patients with early-stage PsA, 22 (9%) of 242 presented iridocyclitis at the time of diagnosis and 11.3% during follow-up. This study also found that the presence of iridocyclitis upon diagnosis was significantly associated with dactylitis (p = 0.032), which was absent in our patient. Therefore, although we cannot discard skin or articular involvement in the future, the time between uveitis and PsA presentation would be unusual.

### Development and validation of a multivariable risk prediction model for serious infection in patients with psoriasis receiving systemic therapy [^11662ZMi]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we have developed a preliminary prediction model for the risk of developing a serious infection within 1 year of initiation of systemic therapy in patients with psoriasis. We envisage that such an algorithm could help clinicians and the patient to choose the right starting therapy, discuss lifestyle choices and identify risk‐minimizing modifiable behaviours in shared decision making with their patients. Further development of the model, for example the inclusion of other predictors, and temporal validation using the U.K. and Ireland population of patients in BADBIR, is warranted after further data accrual.

### A case of Kawasaki disease masked by pustular type psoriasiform eruptions [^11385qp1]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

KD is a systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. It is a pleomorphic disease and can have varying clinical findings including atypical cutaneous lesions. Recently, several published case reports reported simultaneous presentation of KD and psoriasis in a pediatric population with no history of psoriasis.,

Since the first case of KD associated with psoriasis was published in 2000 by Han et al, 31 were described. Various forms of psoriasis, including plaque, guttate, and pustular psoriasis are reported to occur during different phases of KD. To date, including this report, 6 cases of KD associated with pustular psoriasis have been published (Table I). Five of the 6 patients had pustular type psoriasis in the acute phase of KD. In contrast to pustular psoriasis, most cases of plaque psoriasis associated with KD are observed in the convalescent phase of KD. In all patients, psoriasis resolved after several months, possibly in accordance with the down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and T-cell response. Given the significant difference in the timeline of the onset of psoriatic eruptions, we postulate that different inflammatory mechanisms are involved in patients presenting with pustular versus plaque-type psoriasis in association with KD. This report presents a novel case of atypical KD initially presenting solely with fever and acute onset pustular psoriasis.

Table I
Summary of reported cases of Kawasaki disease associated with biopsy-confirmed pustular psoriasis

Two models potentially explain the pathophysiologic association of KD and psoriasis. The first hypothesis suggests a common pathogenic role of superantigen-producing bacteria in the activation of KD and psoriasis. The second theory proposes that psoriasis is uncovered in susceptible patients because of the localization of antigen-independent activated T cells to the cutaneous tissue in individuals with KD. However, these hypotheses do not explain the variable time course of presentation of psoriatic eruptions in different individuals. Further research is required to identify the exact pathophysiology that links KD and psoriasis.

Given the increasing prevalence of incomplete KD, the current diagnostic criteria should be viewed as a guideline, and a new diagnostic tool that incorporates both clinical and laboratory values is required to improve the diagnosis of KD. A high index of suspicion is important because all children with untreated KD, regardless of their clinical presentation, are at high risk of cardiac complications. This case report shows that pustular psoriasiform eruptions can be an initial sign of KD. Pustular psoriasis is an uncommon presentation of KD; however, KD should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with pustular psoriasis in the context of prolonged fever.

### Acute guttate psoriasis and streptococcal infection… [^115edoMf]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Acute guttate psoriasis, particularly in children and young adults, is frequently preceded by an acute streptococcal infection occurring about one to two weeks before the onset of the cutaneous eruption. This particular association has been well documented in the Scandinavian literature but not in the American. The consideration of some instances of acute guttate psoriasis as manifestations of the poststreptococcal stage provides a logical approach to the prevention of recurrence. WHYTE HJ, BAUGHMAN RD.

### The role of streptococcal infection in the initiation of guttate psoriasis… [^1148jj9D]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Background and Design. — Although the association between streptococcal infection and guttate psoriasis is well known, to date there has been little information on whether only limited groups and/or serotypes of β-hemolytic streptococci are involved. One hundred eleven patients with a sudden onset or deterioration of psoriasis were investigated for evidence of streptococcal infection. Of these patients, 34 had acute guttate psoriasis, 30 had a guttate flare of chronic psoriasis, 37 had chronic plaque psoriasis, and 10 had other types of psoriasis. Results. — Serologic evidence of recent streptococcal infection was present in 19 of 33 patients with acute guttate psoriasis compared with seven of 27 patients with guttate exacerbations of chronic psoriasis.

Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from 19 of all 111 patients compared with seven of 101 of a control population of patients being seen for treatment of viral warts. Other β-hemolytic streptococci were found with equal frequency in the study and control populations. Thirteen isolates of 10 different streptococcal serotypes were obtained from the 64 patients with guttate psoriasis. These serotypes were similar in distribution and prevalence to those present in the local community. Conclusions. — This study confirms the strong association between prior infection with S pyogenes and guttate psoriasis but suggests that the ability to trigger guttate psoriasis is not serotype specific.

To the Editor. — In response to our letter in the March Archives on guttate psoriasis and renal disease, Belew reported that in her area guttate psoriasis is associated with the locally common and also potentially nephritic group A streptococcus of serotype Ml, Tl. In a recent study we found group A streptococci in nine of 34 patients with acute guttate psoriasis and four of 30 patients with acute guttate flares complicating chronic psoriasis. More than half the patients seen and all of those from whom group A streptococci were isolated had serologic evidence of recent streptococcal infection. The 13 streptococcal isolates were of ten different serotypes, the majority of which were common in the community at the time of the study. The serotype Ml, T1 was found in two patients. Our findings suggest that the ability of the group A streptococcus to trigger guttate psoriasis is not type. Chalmers RJG, Ead RD, Ive FA.
