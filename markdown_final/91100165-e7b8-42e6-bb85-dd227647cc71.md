## Question

Teach me about IPMNs in pancreas

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas and their management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental definition, classification, and malignant potential of IPMNs. Then, I should verify the key risk stratification frameworks and how they differ across societies. Next, I will examine imaging-based diagnostic pathways and thresholds that trigger surgery versus surveillance. After that, I need to review surveillance protocols and the ongoing debate about when to stop. I will then consider surgical indications, techniques, and margin management. I should also appraise adjuvant therapy and special populations, including elderly or high-risk patients. Finally, I will integrate emerging biomarkers, molecular subtypes, and synthesize a practical decision algorithm with explicit uncertainties and controversies.

> Let me first confirm the core definitions and classification because everything downstream depends on getting this right. IPMNs are mucin-producing epithelial neoplasms arising from the pancreatic ductal system and are classified by duct involvement into main-duct, branch-duct, and mixed types, with main-duct disease carrying substantially higher malignant potential than branch-duct disease, and histologic subtypes include gastric, intestinal, pancreatobiliary, and oncocytic, which correlate with risk and behavior, although dysplasia grade remains the strongest prognostic factor [^116na1zK] [^113VPH8N] [^1143EGPU].

> Wait, let me verify the malignant potential by subtype before I anchor decisions. Main-duct IPMN has a malignancy risk around 62–70% in resected series, mixed-type around 38%, and branch-duct around 18%, and importantly, even modest main pancreatic duct (MPD) dilation in the 5–9.9 mm range increases odds of high-grade dysplasia or invasion, which is why MPD diameter is so influential in risk stratification [^114LigrQ] [^114THW7G] [^114aF3eD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about thresholds; I should confirm the risk stratification frameworks. The International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) Fukuoka guidelines categorize features into high-risk stigmata and worrisome features, and the European Study Group on Cystic Tumors (ESG) aligns with absolute and relative indications for surgery, whereas the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) focuses on asymptomatic cysts and suggests stopping surveillance after 5 years if stable, a position that remains controversial and not universally adopted [^114bP9L7] [^1172dZxP] [^113vjWRH].

> I need to check the high-risk stigmata that mandate resection in fit patients. These include obstructive jaundice, an enhancing mural nodule ≥ 5 mm, and MPD diameter ≥ 10 mm; worrisome features include cyst size ≥ 3 cm, enhancing mural nodule < 5 mm, MPD 5–9 mm, abrupt MPD change with distal atrophy, lymphadenopathy, elevated CA 19–9, and significant growth, which should prompt EUS-FNA and consideration of surgery depending on findings and patient factors [^114wBdTL] [^114bP9L7].

> Let me consider the MPD threshold more carefully because this is a frequent point of confusion. The classic Fukuoka cutoff for mandatory resection is MPD ≥ 10 mm, but a large retrospective cohort identified an optimal ROC-derived cutoff of 7.2 mm to predict malignancy with 100% sensitivity and NPV, suggesting that some experts may reasonably favor a lower threshold in select patients, although this remains institution-specific and not yet guideline-standard [^117D64pF].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic pathway and imaging hierarchy. MRI/MRCP is preferred for baseline and surveillance because it avoids radiation and best depicts ductal communication, while EUS with FNA is the problem-solving modality for characterizing mural nodules, sampling cyst fluid for CEA and cytology, and clarifying ductal anatomy when cross-sectional imaging is equivocal; the fish-mouth ampulla with extruding mucin is pathognomonic for IPMN when present [^113fRG8n] [^114wBdTL] [^117FJins].

> I will now examine surveillance protocols for low-risk branch-duct IPMN, but wait, I should double-check the interval nuances. For cysts < 1 cm, MRI every 2 years is reasonable; for 1–2 cm, MRI annually for 3 years then every 2 years if stable; for 2–3 cm, MRI or alternating MRI/EUS every 6–12 months for 3 years then annually if stable; for > 3 cm, multidisciplinary review with MRI alternating with EUS every 3–6 months is prudent, and importantly, European and IAP favor lifelong surveillance as long as the patient remains fit for surgery, whereas AGA allows stopping after 5 years if stable, a strategy increasingly questioned by longitudinal data [^111XqgYy] [^112nU5TV] [^113fRG8n].

> But wait, what if we apply the AGA 5-year stop rule to a 60-year-old with a 2.5 cm branch-duct IPMN; is that safe? Large cohorts show that progression risk persists beyond 5 years, with cumulative risks for worrisome features and surgery rising over time, and a recent JAMA Network analysis suggests that for cysts < 20 mm that remain stable over 5 years, discontinuation may be reasonable only in patients unfit for surgery or with limited life expectancy, reinforcing that indefinite surveillance remains the conservative default for most [^111RBbVg] [^114Cmofq].

> Let me think about surgical indications and timing, and I should confirm that I am not overgeneralizing. Absolute indications include high-risk stigmata such as obstructive jaundice, enhancing mural nodule ≥ 5 mm, or MPD ≥ 10 mm, and positive cytology for high-grade dysplasia; relative indications include cyst ≥ 3 cm, MPD 5–9 mm, or multiple worrisome features, with surgery individualized by age, comorbidity, and patient preference; importantly, a substantial fraction of patients are resected "too late", underscoring the need to avoid prolonged watchful waiting when high-risk features emerge [^113Dhr8H] [^111SAMV6].

> I should confirm operative strategy and margin management because multifocality and ductal spread are common. Standard oncologic resections with lymphadenectomy are recommended, with parenchyma-sparing approaches for focal, low-grade disease when feasible; frozen section can guide margins, and if high-grade dysplasia or invasion is present at the margin, additional resection is warranted, while low-grade dysplasia at the margin is generally acceptable; intraoperative pancreatoscopy can identify additional lesions and alter the surgical plan in a meaningful minority, though it is not yet routine [^113Dhr8H] [^113VPH8N] [^1131y8ZZ].

> Next, I should review adjuvant therapy for invasive IPMN, and I need to ensure I do not conflate this with conventional PDAC. Although some series suggest better outcomes for invasive IPMN versus de novo PDAC, current NCCN-aligned practice treats invasive IPMN like PDAC, and a recent meta-analysis suggests adjuvant chemotherapy may confer survival benefit particularly in node-positive or margin-positive disease, though high-quality randomized data are limited and decisions should be individualized in MDT [^114LigrQ] [^111rFPZ7] [^116HvQop].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and competing risks. In elderly or comorbid patients, disease-specific mortality from IPMN under observation is often low relative to competing causes, supporting a conservative approach when surgical risk is high; conversely, in young, fit patients, the cumulative lifetime risk may justify a lower threshold for resection of borderline lesions; additionally, patients with IPMN have an increased incidence of extrapancreatic neoplasms, warranting age-appropriate cancer screening and clinical vigilance [^116bcVp2] [^112deYsh].

> I need to ensure I incorporate evolving molecular insights and biomarkers. Histologic subtypes and dysplasia grade refine risk, and emerging data suggest that tumor microenvironment shifts toward immunosuppression accompany progression, while cyst fluid molecular panels and radiomics are under active investigation to improve specificity and reduce unnecessary surgery; nonetheless, these tools remain adjunctive and are not yet replacements for morphologic criteria [^1143EGPU] [^111XBWec] [^1168Vjfv].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, but I should double-check that it aligns with major guidelines. If MPD is ≥ 10 mm or there is obstructive jaundice or an enhancing mural nodule ≥ 5 mm, recommend resection in fit patients; if MPD is 5–9 mm or there are multiple worrisome features, obtain EUS-FNA and consider surgery based on cytology, nodule characteristics, and patient factors; if there are no worrisome features, pursue size-based MRI surveillance with intensification after 5 years and continue lifelong if life expectancy exceeds 10 years; throughout, manage in a multidisciplinary setting and tailor to patient preferences and operative risk [^114bP9L7] [^113fRG8n] [^114Cmofq].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and controversies transparently. Variability in surgeon risk thresholds leads to divergent recommendations for similar lesions, the AGA 5-year stop rule remains debated given persistent late progression risk, and current criteria have high sensitivity but low specificity, resulting in overtreatment of low-risk lesions; ongoing work aims to harmonize guidelines, validate lower MPD thresholds, and integrate molecular diagnostics to personalize care [^111P8dp4] [^113vjWRH] [^117D64pF].

IPMNs are **premalignant cystic lesions** of the pancreas with a stepwise progression to invasive cancer [^111AuxN8]. They are classified as main-duct, branch-duct, or mixed-type, with main-duct IPMNs having the highest malignancy risk (~60–70%) [^113VPH8N] and branch-duct IPMNs lower (~15–20%) [^114THW7G]. Diagnosis relies on **MRI/MRCP and EUS** [^114eKZvM], with EUS-FNA for inconclusive cases [^114wBdTL]. Management is guided by the Fukuoka and European guidelines [^113UPjVk] [^114bP9L7]: resection is indicated for high-risk stigmata (e.g. MPD ≥ 10 mm, enhancing mural nodule ≥ 5 mm, obstructive jaundice) [^113Dhr8H], while branch-duct IPMNs without worrisome features are surveilled [^114Cmofq]. Surveillance intervals are tailored to cyst size and features, and lifelong follow-up is recommended due to persistent risk of progression and metachronous lesions [^113fRG8n] [^114bP9L7]. Prognosis is excellent for noninvasive IPMNs, but worsens significantly with invasion [^114THW7G].

---

## Classification and epidemiology

IPMNs are classified into **three subtypes** based on ductal involvement:

- **Main-duct IPMN**: Involves the main pancreatic duct; high malignancy risk (~60–70%) [^113VPH8N].
- **Branch-duct IPMN**: Involves side branches; lower malignancy risk (~15–20%) [^114THW7G].
- **Mixed-type IPMN**: Involves both main and branch ducts; intermediate risk [^114THW7G].

IPMNs are increasingly detected due to improved imaging, with a prevalence of ~2–8% in the general population [^notfound] and rising with age [^113c3Ze7].

---

## Clinical presentation

IPMNs may be **asymptomatic and incidentally detected** or present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, pancreatitis, jaundice, weight loss, or steatorrhea [^117FJins]. Main-duct IPMNs are more often symptomatic and carry a higher malignancy risk [^113VPH8N].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Imaging modalities

- **MRI/MRCP**: Preferred for noninvasive characterization, ductal communication, and surveillance [^114eKZvM] [^113fRG8n].
- **EUS**: High sensitivity for mural nodules and ductal changes; EUS-FNA for cytology and biomarkers (CEA, CA 19–9) [^112i2Fq6] [^117FJins] [^111kQsa8] [^113fRG8n].
- **CT**: Useful for surgical planning and detecting calcifications [^notfound].

---

### Histopathology

Histopathology shows mucin-producing epithelium with papillary architecture and a spectrum of dysplasia (low, intermediate, high grade) [^112FhK9c]; **invasive carcinoma** may be present [^111ejVTs].

---

## Risk stratification and management guidelines

The Fukuoka and European guidelines stratify risk using **high-risk stigmata** and **worrisome features** [^113UPjVk] [^114bP9L7]:

| **Feature** | **High-risk stigmata** | **Worrisome features** |
|-|-|-|
| Main pancreatic duct | ≥ 10 mm | 5–9 mm |
| Mural nodule | ≥ 5 mm (enhancing) | < 5 mm (enhancing) |
| Symptoms | Obstructive jaundice | - Elevated CA 19–9 <br/> - Acute pancreatitis |
| Cyst size | N/A | ≥ 3 cm |

---

### Management recommendations

- **High-risk stigmata**: Surgical resection if fit [^113Dhr8H].
- **Worrisome features**: EUS ± FNA; surgery if high-grade dysplasia or mural nodule ≥ 5 mm [^113Dhr8H].
- **Low-risk branch-duct IPMN**: Surveillance with MRI/MRCP [^113fRG8n].

---

## Surveillance protocols

Surveillance is tailored to cyst size and features, with **lifelong follow-up** due to persistent risk [^113fRG8n] [^115263kq]:

| **Cyst size** | **Interval** | **Modality** |
|-|-|-|
| < 1 cm | Every 2–3 years | MRI/MRCP |
| 1–2 cm | Every 1–2 years | MRI/MRCP |
| 2–3 cm | Every 6–12 months | MRI/MRCP ± EUS |
| > 3 cm or worrisome features | Every 3–6 months | MRI/MRCP ± EUS |

---

## Surgical management

Surgical resection is indicated for high-risk stigmata or high-grade dysplasia [^113Dhr8H]. Options include **Whipple, distal pancreatectomy, or total pancreatectomy**, selected based on lesion location and extent [^116ZXjGc]. Morbidity is 20–40%, mortality 1–3% in experienced centers [^111SAMV6].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is excellent for noninvasive IPMNs (**5-year survival ~90–100%**) [^114THW7G] but declines with invasion to 50–70% [^116yU6y2]. Recurrence risk persists, necessitating lifelong surveillance [^112W9t1C].

---

## Controversies and unresolved issues

- **Surveillance duration**: Lifelong vs. 5-year cessation after stability [^114Cmofq] [^112mnbrN].
- **Surgical thresholds**: Optimal MPD cutoff (5 vs. 10 mm) [^117D64pF] [^114aF3eD].
- **Biomarkers**: Limited role; need for better molecular predictors [^1143EGPU] [^1168Vjfv].

---

IPMNs are premalignant pancreatic cysts with a **stepwise progression to cancer**; management balances resection for high-risk lesions against surveillance for low-risk disease, with lifelong follow-up due to persistent progression risk [^112EdNmY].

With the widespread use and advances in radiographic imaging, Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas are identified with increasing frequency. Although many studies have addressed its biology and treatment, true understanding of its natural history continues to elude us. Its malignant potential places careproviders in a clinical dilemma of balancing the morbidity of pancreatectomy against the risk of malignant transformation while under continuous surveillance. Recently, there have been conflicting data published in the literature, generating more uncertainty in the field. In this article, we critically analyze the contrasting consensus guidelines from the International Association of Pancreatology and the American Gastroenterology Association, and address lingering questions and controversies. We also synthesize newly published data in the context of current standard of care, and provide a comprehensive review and recommendations for the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up strategy in the management of patients with Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas [^112Qi5Cp]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas has been rising in the past 2 decades, driven mainly by the widespread use of cross-sectional imaging. IPMNs are intraductal mucin-producing neoplasms that involve the main pancreatic duct or its side branches and lack the ovarian stroma typically seen in mucinous cystic neoplasms. The International Association of Pancreatology released consensus guidelines in 2006 and 2012 providing clinical algorithms based on IPMN features and risk of malignancy. In this article, we review the different classifications of IPMNs, their natural history, and clinical management and address recent controversies in the literature.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: current understanding and future directions for stratification of malignancy risk [^111YcnWJ]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

The incidence of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) has been increasing over the past decade, mainly owing to increased awareness and the increased use of cross-sectional imaging. The Sendai and Fukuoka consensus guidelines provide us with clinical management guidelines and algorithms; however, the clinical management of IPMNs continues to be challenging. Our incomplete understanding of the natural history of the disease, and the events and pathways that permit progression to adenocarcinoma, result in difficulties predicting which tumors are high risk and will progress to invasive disease. In this review, we summarize the current management guidelines and describe ongoing efforts to more clearly stratify IPMNs by risk of malignancy and identify IPMNs with malignant potential or ongoing malignant transformation.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm: clinical surveillance and management decisions [^112UsbgA]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas is a relatively rare cystic neoplasm. Although most IPMNs appear to be benign and may be managed by surveillance, all IPMNs are considered premalignant lesions with malignant potential. As such, current efforts are focused on identifying those neoplasms that are at high risk for malignancy to optimize treatment strategy and outcome. IPMNs with invasive carcinoma have clinical outcomes that approach those of conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Management guidelines recommend surgical resection for IPMNs with high-risk imaging or cytologic features. The role of adjuvant therapy is unclear, and we review the evidence for chemoradiation here. Some studies suggest adjuvant chemoradiation may have the greatest impact in malignant IPMNs with adverse histologic features, that is, lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis or positive surgical margins. As more IPMNs are recognized and treated, more evidence will accumulate to guide clinicians regarding appropriate use of radiotherapy in the management of IPMN.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^112E5yr5]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas are now a well-recognized category of slowly growing tumors with a remarkably better prognosis, even when malignant, than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Their clinical and pathohistologic features have been increasingly attracting the attention of clinicians since their first description 25 years ago. Despite its burgeoning volume recently, accumulated literature devoted to IPMN still provides a low level of evidence with regard to diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Therefore, we performed a Medline-based systematic review of the literature aimed at clearly defining the clinicopathologic characteristics of pancreatic IPMN and determining the best currently available evidence-based principles of diagnosis and management of patients with this disease.

### Diagnosis and management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia [^112fHYJz]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN) encompasses a spectrum of neoplastic change in the epithelial lining of the pancreatic duct. As such, it is difficult to predict the presence of malignancy, and pancreatic resection is established as the only effective treatment for IPMN. There is controversy about the natural history, evaluation, surgical management and surveillance of IPMN; as IPMN is being increasingly recognized, this controversy is being brought to the forefront of clinical practice. This review presents pooled surgical data, future directions and a proposed algorithm for the management of patients with IPMN.

### Assessment of a revised management strategy for patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms involving the main pancreatic duct [^117D64pF]. JAMA Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

According to the 2012 International Consensus Guidelines, the diagnostic criterion of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) involving the main duct (MD IPMNs) or the main and branch ducts (mixed IPMNs) of the pancreatic system is a main pancreatic duct (MPD) diameter of 5.0 mm or greater on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, surgical resection is recommended for patients with an MPD diameter of 10.0 mm or greater, which is characterized as a high-risk stigma. An MPD diameter of 5.0 to 9.0 mm is not an indication for immediate resection.

Objectives

To determine an appropriate cutoff (ie, one with high sensitivity and negative predictive value) of the MPD diameter on CT or MRI as a prognostic factor for malignant disease and to propose a new management algorithm for patients with MD or mixed IPMNs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study included 103 patients who underwent surgical resection for a preoperative diagnosis of MD or mixed IPMN and in whom IPMN was confirmed by surgical pathologic findings at a single institution from July 1, 1996, to December 31, 2015.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Malignant disease was defined as high-grade dysplasia or invasive adenocarcinoma on results of surgical pathologic evaluation. An appropriate MPD diameter on preoperative CT or MRI to predict malignant disease was determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The prognostic value of the new management algorithm that incorporated the new MPD diameter cutoff was evaluated.

Results

Among the 103 patients undergoing resection for an MD or mixed IPMN (59 men [57.3%]; 44 women [42.7%]; median [range] age, 71 [48–86] years), 64 (62.1%) had malignant disease. Diagnostic accuracy for malignant neoplasms was highest at an MPD diameter cutoff of 7.2 mm (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59–0.81). An MPD diameter of 7.2 mm or greater was also an independent prognostic factor for malignant neoplasms (odds ratio, 12.76; 95% CI, 2.43–66.88; p = 0.003) on logistic regression analysis after controlling for preoperative variables. The new management algorithm, which included an MPD diameter of 7.2 mm or greater as one of the high-risk stigmata, had a higher sensitivity (100%), negative predictive value (100%), and accuracy (66%) for malignant disease than the 2012 version of the International Consensus Guidelines (95%, 57%, and 63%, respectively).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this single-center, retrospective analysis, an MPD diameter of 7.2 mm was identified as an optimal cutoff for a prognostic factor for malignant disease in MD or mixed IPMN. These data support lowering the accepted criteria for MPD diameter when selecting patients for resection vs surveillance so as not to overlook cancer in IPMN.

### The management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^111AuxN8]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) are mucinous cystic tumors of the pancreas, which were first classified into a unified diagnosis by the World Health Organization in 1996. These lesions originate from the cells of the pancreatic ductal system and may grossly or microscopically involve the pancreatic ducts in a diffuse or multifocal fashion. As experience with IPMN increases, it is becoming more evident that this process presents as a spectrum of neoplasia with significant variation regarding the clinical and radiologic presentation, malignant potential, and disease-specific outcome. IPMN encompasses a spectrum of precursor lesions, from adenoma to intraductal carcinoma to invasive cancer, with molecular data supporting the premise that this dysplastic process has the potential to progress from low-grade dysplasia to invasive carcinoma. Controversy over the management of IPMN exists because of the difficulty in obtaining a preoperative histologic diagnosis, the broad spectrum of neoplasia, the lack of understanding as to the frequency and time to malignant progression. This article describes the radiologic and histopathologic classification system of IPMN; the biologic behavior of these lesions, and the diagnostic testing most commonly used, and discusses the current treatment controversies.

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: a single-institution experience [^113DGv8E]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas is a disease with a high prevalence. It is estimated that the prevalence of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) in the general population is approximately 20–30% and that half of these are IPMNs. While it is recognized that IPMNs can progress to cancer, the high prevalence of IPMNs and the low incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) in the general population indicate that only a minority of IPMNs progress to invasive carcinoma. Considering that IPMN of the pancreas was defined by the World Health Organization only as recently as in 1996, there is a lack of information regarding the natural history of these neoplasms and in particular regarding long-term prognosis. Published data show that the risk for cancer differs according to the epithelial type of IPMN and that it is higher in IPMNs affecting the main pancreatic duct, either in isolation or combined with branch duct involvement (main-duct or mixed-type IPMNs, respectively). For this reason, current guidelines recommend surgical resection for all IPMNs with involvement of the main pancreatic duct, provided the patient is fit for surgery. In contrast, the risk for cancer is significantly lower for IPMNs that are limited to branch ducts (branch-duct IPMN); therefore, surgical resection is considered to be an indication in only a minority of patients with branch-duct IPMN. However, because it is currently not possible to predict which of the IPMNs that do not require surgical resection will progress to cancer, a large proportion of patients require life-long follow-up. Data from the literature support the current conservative management of the majority of patients with "small" (< 3–4 cm) branch-duct IPMNs, who do not have IPMN-related symptoms and do not present worrisome radiological features. Invasive carcinoma is reported to develop during follow-up in 1–11% of patients.–The risk for pancreatic cancer developing at a distance from the IPMN also seems to be increased, with a 5-year incidence reported in approximately 7% of patients under surveillance and a standardized incidence ratio of 15.8- to 26-fold. Even though published data support the safety of surveillance for the majority of patients with IPMN, experiences are not uniformly positive. This is most likely explained by the use of different inclusion criteria and different indications for surgery or surveillance as well as by the small size of some of the study cohorts.

### The landmark series: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas-from prevalence to early cancer detection [^1168Vjfv]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

This article is structured as a toolkit of relevant landmark articles essential to current intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) care. Four elements will be highlighted. First, the studies quantifying the prevalence of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) and IPMNs in the general population are addressed. No longer considered a rare disease, providing an accurate estimate of the numbers of patients with IPMN frames the relevance of the topic. Since the definition and classification of IPMN was not formally adopted by the World Health Organization until 1996, modern-era studies have been selected. Second, the main clinical management guidelines are discussed in context. A concise description of the methodology used to develop the recommendations in each guideline is given, followed by direct comparison of management strategies in the different guidelines. Third, the evidence on surveillance discontinuation is discussed. The reason for highlighting this ongoing and timely debate is that non-resected IPMNs are currently considered for lifelong surveillance. Given the high prevalence of IPMNs and length of surveillance, the burden on patients and the health care system worldwide demands a reassessment of surveillance discontinuation for specific subsets of IPMNs. Fourth, due to the limitations and low specificity of current guidelines to identify appropriate patients for pancreatic resection more accurately, the main studies on new cyst biomarker panels to predict IPMNs at high-risk for cancer are discussed. The goal of molecular diagnostics of cyst fluid aims to reduce the number of unnecessary resections that are performed every year, while also providing information on the malignant potential of lesions under surveillance. A final comment on the role of the immune system in IPMN progression is given, as opportunities for early immunotherapeutic intervention could change the course of this disease.

### Current management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^113c3Ze7]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2026). Medium credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas are a common entity with a prevalence in the general population that increases with age. Depending on the involvement of the main pancreatic duct, they can be divided into main-duct (MD), mixed-duct, and branch-duct (BD) variants. Most BD-IPMNs are low-risk and surveilled, while MD-IPMNs are generally resected. When necessary, a standard pancreatic resection with lymphadenectomy is recommended. The use of molecular profiling, intraoperative pancreatoscopy, and surveillance end points are discussed.

### Validation of the American Gastroenterological Association guidelines on management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: more than 5 years of follow-up [^112mnbrN]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Recent guidelines suggest that imaging surveillance be conducted for 5 years for patients with at most one high-risk feature. If there were no significant changes, surveillance is stopped. We sought to validate this follow-up strategy.

Methods

In study 1, data were analysed for 392 patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and at most one high-risk feature who were periodically followed up for more than 1 year with imaging tests. In study 2, data were analysed for 159 IPMN patients without worsening high-risk features after 5 years (stop surveillance group).

Results

In study 1, pancreatic cancer (PC) was identified in 12 patients (27.3%) in the endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) indication group and none in the non-EUS-FNA indication group (P < 0.01). In the EUS-FNA indication group, 11 patients (25%) died, whereas 29 (8.3%) died in the non EUS-FNA indication group (P < 0.01). In study 2 (stop surveillance group), PC was identified in three patients (1.9%) at 84, 103 and 145 months.

Conclusions

PC risk and mortality for IPMNs not showing significant change for 5 years is likely to be low, and the non-EUS-FNA indication can provide reasonable decisions. However, three patients without worsening high-risk features for 5 years developed PC. The stop surveillance strategy should be reconsidered.

Key Points

- The AGA guidelines provide reasonable clinical decisions for the EUS-FNA indication.
- In stop surveillance group, PC was identified in 3 patients (1.9%).
- In stop surveillance group, 2 of 3 PC patients died from PC.
- Risk of pancreatic cancer in "stop surveillance" group is not negligible.

### Controversies in the management of pancreatic IPMN [^1121juPE]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Although considerable progress has been made in our understanding of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas, some issues still remain to be resolved. Uncertainty exists regarding the classification of IPMNs. The necessity of the mixed-type category of IPMN and whether such lesions should be defined radiographically or histologically needs to be determined. The preoperative distinction of branch duct IPMNs from nonmucinous cysts should be further investigated so that potentially malignant lesions can be identified and management strategies guided effectively. The role and safety of cystic fluid analysis remains to be clarified in this context. With regard to the diagnosis of malignancy in branch duct IPMNs, criteria for identifying malignancy need to be re-evaluated. The presence of mural nodules is a very reliable predictor; however, controversy exists over the value of size as a reliable indicator. Criteria with increased specificity are needed, perhaps including histological subtype of lesion, to reduce the false-positive rate of the present criteria. Finally, the best modality and interval for surveillance of branch duct IPMNs requires determination because of its significance in terms of malignant transformation, development of distinct ductal adenocarcinoma and disease recurrence after resection.

### Management strategy for multifocal branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^112QANgz]. Pancreas (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas (BD-IPMNs) often are composed of multifocal lesions. We aimed to clarify the clinicopathologic features of multifocal BD-IPMNs.

Methods

Medical records of 211 patients with BD-IPMNs (169 solitary and 42 multifocal) were retrospectively analyzed. We compared the pathological grade of resected IPMNs and the resulting clinical course between solitary and multifocal BD-IPMNs.

Results

Sixty-nine patients (54 with solitary and 15 with multifocal BD-IPMNs) underwent pancreatectomy, and of these patients, 62 exhibited at least 1 malignant predictor. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of malignancy in the resected BD-IPMNs between the 2 groups. In the remaining 142 patients who exhibited no malignant predictors, both groups demonstrated no differences in morphologic changes of BD-IPMNs. Seventeen distinct ductal carcinomas were identified in both groups, and there was no difference in the prevalence of ductal carcinoma between the 2 groups. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the disease-specific survival rate between the 2 groups.

Conclusions

In patients with multifocal BD-IPMNs, resection is only warranted for lesions that exhibit malignancy predictors; moreover, closer attention to the potential presence or development of distinct ductal carcinoma in patients with multifocal and solitary BD-IPMNs is warranted.

### Multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^114eKZvM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms have gained recognition in recent years as premalignant precursors to pancreatic cancer that enable early detection and often are found incidentally at imaging. Accurate diagnosis and optimal, finely tuned management of these lesions are important and require collaboration across various disciplines, including radiology, endoscopy, surgery, and pathology. Several imaging modalities can visualize these lesions adequately, each with specific advantages and disadvantages. Multidetector computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are generally the first-line imaging modalities; endoscopic imaging such as endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography are beneficial when the former 2 modalities are equivocal. Surgical candidates generally include patients with main duct lesions or branch duct lesions greater than 3 cm or any possessing a solid component. A management algorithm indicating when surgery should be pursued is proposed. For nonsurgical and postsurgical patients, follow-up management is important to monitor growth and recurrence, and risks from repeated radiation exposure should be taken into account. Furthermore, issues of multifocality and increased predisposition of the pancreas to ductal adenocarcinoma must be addressed at follow-up evaluation. A follow-up management algorithm also is proposed in this review.

2017 International Association of Pancreatology (IAP): Revisions of International Consensus Fukuoka Guidelines for the Management of IPMNs of the Pancreas

The original 'Sendai' guidelines on the management of IPMNs and MCNs were created by the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) at the 11th Congress of the IAP in Sendai, Japan, and published in 2006. These were consensus guidelines related to the classification, preoperative evaluation, surgical indications, resection technique, histology, and surveillance of IPMNs and MCNs. Subsequently, these recommendations were updated in 2012 in Fukuoka, Japan, and again in 2017. The latest version of the IAP guidelines distinguished operative criteria for branch duct IPMNs (BD-IPMNs), as it built upon the classifications of 'worrisome features' and 'high-risk features'. Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN) were excluded from this 2017 revision.

In this updated version of the Fukuoka guidelines, as they are called, the framework of recommendations follows that of prior iterations of the IAP guidelines. Namely, the expert consensus provides recommendations on the classification, preoperative evaluation, surgical indications, methods of resection and other treatments, histological aspects, and surveillance of IPMNs.

2018 European Study Group on Cystic Tumors of the Pancreas: European Evidence-Based Guidelines on Pancreatic Cystic Neoplasms

These guidelines were established as a joint initiative of several European scientific societies for the management of PCNs. This rendition of the European guidelines replaced the prior European consensus statement guidelines on PCN published in 2013.

A methodology committee consisting of gastroenterologists, surgeons, radiologists, oncologists, endoscopists, and basic scientists was compiled. Subsequently, systematic reviews were performed by experts in their respective topic areas to encompass all the available evidence regarding predetermined clinical questions. This literature search only included randomized trials, observational cohort studies with more than 20 patients, and systematic reviews on PCN. Following this systematic review of the literature, recommendations were established by expert consensus and supplemented with ratings for the quality of evidence using the GRADE framework. Statements regarding the strength of the recommendation were added. To finalize the guidelines, these recommendations were reviewed at a plenary meeting of the European Study Group on Cystic Tumors of the Pancreas, and at least 75% consensus was required to establish the recommendation.

Guidelines for Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN) Management

2015 American Gastroenterological Association Guideline on the Diagnosis and Management of Asymptomatic Neoplastic Pancreatic Cysts

These guidelines were established by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) for the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic PCNs (Table 1). The AGA guidelines only address asymptomatic cysts and do not evaluate the impact of symptoms on the management of these cysts. The AGA guidelines were established following a systematic evaluation of the relevant evidence on the management of these pancreatic cysts. An expert consensus was acquired on clinically relevant questions regarding diagnosis and management. The conclusions of the systematic reviews are reported in the AGA's technical reviewand were used by the AGA's Clinical Practice Guideline Committee as the basis for the formal guidelines. Specifically, the recommendations use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Notably, the committee graded all the evidence related to the management of pancreatic cysts to be very low in quality because most of the data were collected from case series. Thus, all their statements were considered conditional and dependent on each patient's situation.

Indications for Surgery

The indications for surgery in these guidelines are listed in detail in Table 1. For main duct IPMN (MD-IPMN), the recommendation from the IAP guidelines is surgical resection for all surgical candidates with main pancreatic duct diameter > 10 mm, jaundice, or mural nodules; however, the European guidelines recommend that all patients with MD-IPMN should undergo resection if they are fit for surgery. Both the European and IAP guidelines describe the value of frozen section biopsies to determine the extent of resection. In both guidelines, additional resection is warranted to obtain a negative margin if invasive cancer or high-grade dysplasia is found at the initial resection margin, whereas further resection is not necessary if low-grade dysplasia is discovered at the margin.

From the AGA guidelines, the general indications for surgery for asymptomatic pancreatic cysts include both a solid component and a dilated pancreatic duct and/or concerning features on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and fine-needle aspiration (FNA). The concerning features on EUS/FNA include solid component, dilated duct, or positive cytology. Because the presence of these concerning features increases the risk for malignancy, surgery is recommended for these patients as it would reduce the risk of mortality from carcinoma. In addition, AGA guidelines suggest that surgical candidates be referred to centers that have demonstrated expertise in pancreas surgery in order to decrease immediate postoperative mortality and optimize long-term survival.

For BD-IPMN, a generally conservative management strategy is suggested in the IAP guidelines for patients without features that predict invasive carcinoma or high-grade dysplasia. The IAP guidelines also describe the absolute indications for resection of BD-IPMNs, which are positive cytology for high-grade dysplasia and the presence of mural nodules ≥ 5 mm. Notably, cyst size alone is not considered an appropriate parameter to indicate surgery; however, cysts > 2 cm in patients < 65 years of age are considered as candidates for resection given the lifelong cumulative risk of high-grade dysplasia and invasive carcinoma. The European guidelines share the same absolute indications as the IAP guidelines in addition to the presence of jaundice and solid mass. Relative indications for surgery listed in the European guidelines prompt consideration of surgery, while the equivalent worrisome features in the IAP guidelines require EUS to be performed, and only to consider surgery if specific features are present (Table 1).

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: a single-institution experience [^111RBbVg]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study represents one of the largest, single-institution analysis of the results of a surveillance program for patients with IPMN, who were managed according to current guidelines. Our study was one of the few to report on the outcome of patients whose IPMN required resection but who could not undergo surgery due to general contraindications. The study results support the recommendations of current guidelines by demonstrating that the majority of patients with branch-duct IPMN (78.5% in this study) can be managed safely with a conservative approach. The mortality rate due to the development of IPMN-associated cancer or concomitant pancreatic cancer separate from the IPMN is 1% in the cohort of patients who were under surveillance as recommended by the guidelines. This does not exceed the mortality rate associated with pancreatic surgery, even in the most experienced centers. Interestingly, the cumulative risk for IPMN progression increased over time and was 70% at 5 years and 97.5% at 10 years from the time of detection of the IPMN. Even the cumulative risk for progression to an IPMN that required surgery increased continuously and reached 26% at 5 years and 72.1% at 10 years of follow-up. Interestingly, the percentage of patients with an IPMN that developed features requiring surgery increased significantly also after 5 years of follow-up. The median time from first diagnosis of an IPMN (not requiring resection) to surgery was 48 months. The final histology of IPMNs that progressed and required surgery confirmed that the large majority of these lesions (85.4%) represented a true surgical indication, either with respect to the IPMN type (main-duct or mixed-type) or the grade of dysplasia (high-grade dysplasia to invasive carcinoma). This indicates that the detection of changes in cyst characteristics or in patient symptoms is indeed more predictive than a simple "one shot" evaluation at the time of first diagnosis. The observations in this study demonstrate that progression of IPMNs that do not fulfill criteria for surgery to lesions that require resection can occur even after 5 years or more following diagnosis. These observations validate and support the recommendations of the European and International guidelines regarding the necessity of a life-long follow-up of these patients. Moreover, the findings of the current study do not support the recent statement from the American Gastroenterological Association (ASA), which suggests that surveillance does not need to be continued for cysts without significant change after 5 years of follow-up. Considering that both the risk for progression and the risk for surgery gradually increase over time, our results support also the recommended strategy of a low frequency of control investigations in the initial years of the screening program, followed by an intensified protocol after 5 years. The results of this study further show that radiological prominence of the main pancreatic duct (diameter ≥ 6 mm) is associated with an increased risk for progression. This observation confirms the importance and prognostic significance of even mild pancreatic duct dilatation, as recently reported by Hackert et al. and stated by the European guidelines. Furthermore, the current analysis shows that localization of an IPMN in the pancreatic head also is associated with an increased risk for progression. This finding seems to confirm previous observations by Ammori et al.

### Long-term outcomes and risk of pancreatic cancer in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^111cgBki]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Incidental detection of pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) has increased in recent years primarily due to improved resolution and widespread use of cross-sectional imaging. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are the most frequently identified PCLs. Current international consensus guidelinesfor management of IPMNs recommend image-based surveillance with the aim to detect clinical and imaging features of advanced neoplasia (high-grade dysplasia or pancreatic cancer). Although a minority of IPMNs warrant surgical resection, our existing knowledge about the prevalence, natural history, and risk of malignancy in IPMNs is largely derived from surgical series, or from patients treated at tertiary centers, populations which are not representative of the population burden of the disease. There is a critical need to define the prevalence and natural history of IPMNs in a population-based cohort to inform surveillance guidelines.

A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysisestimated the pooled population prevalence of PCLs at approximately 8%. The reported prevalence varies across studies depending on the imaging modality used, geographical location, and age of the cohort studied, and most studies include all PCLs not specifically IPMNs. Furthermore, to our knowledge, there are no population-based estimates of the burden of pancreatic cancer (PC) in individuals with IPMNs or the proportion of PCs that develop from or adjacent to an IPMN. This study uses a population-based cohort to assess the prevalence and associated long-term outcomes and PC risk in IPMN. In addition, we investigated the proportion of PCs that arose from IPMNs (IPMN-PCs) and compared their outcomes with those of non-IPMN PCs.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous tumors of the pancreas: biology, diagnosis, and treatment [^114s15Gf]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

Pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) rank among the most common cystic tumors of the pancreas. For a long time they were misdiagnosed as mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, ductal adenocarcinoma in situ, or chronic pancreatitis. Only in recent years have IPMNs been fully recognized as clinical and pathological entities, although their origin and molecular pathogenesis remain poorly understood. IPMNs are precursors of invasive carcinomas. When resected in a preinvasive state patient prognosis is excellent, and even when they are already invasive, patient prognosis is more favorable than with ductal adenocarcinomas. Subdivision into macroscopic and microscopic subtypes facilitates further patient risk stratification and directly impacts treatment. There are main duct and branch duct IPMNs, with the main duct type including the intestinal, pancreatobiliary, and oncocytic types and the branch duct type solely harboring the gastric type. Whereas main duct IPMNs have a high risk for malignant progression, demanding their resection, branch duct IPMNs have a much lower risk for harboring malignancy. Patients with small branch duct/gastric-type IPMNs (< 2 cm) without symptoms or mural nodules can be managed by periodic surveillance.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas – a surgical disease [^113VPH8N]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Cystic pancreatic neoplasms are increasingly recognized, with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas (IPMNs) being the most frequently observed type. IPMNs are characterized by mucin production and epithelial growth within the pancreatic ducts, and are generally differentiated according to location: main pancreatic duct, its major side branches, or both (mixed type). IPMNs vary from benign to malignant and are considered precursor lesions of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, the exact time to neoplastic transformation and whether all IPMNs progress to malignant tumors is unclear. Surgical resection is warranted for all main-duct and mixed-type IPMNs (they harbor a high risk of malignancy of ~70%). By contrast, branch-duct IPMNs progress to cancer in only ~30% of cases. Thus, according to current guidelines (Sendai criteria), asymptomatic side-branch IPMNs < 3 cm in size without suspicious radiological features (such as size progression) can be treated conservatively. Lately, even this approach has become controversial, owing to a number of Sendai-negative IPMNs showing malignant transformation. Although most IPMNs should be resected by standard oncological procedures (including lymphadenectomy), small Sendai-negative IPMNs can be treated with limited resections. This Review summarizes current knowledge of the treatment of IPMNs, with a particular focus on surgical approaches to this disease.

### The landmark series: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas-from prevalence to early cancer detection [^116F3GAQ]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Modern series report a prevalence of pancreatic cysts in the general population of up to 50% in prospective studies. Of these, about half will be pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) that have varying degrees of malignant potential. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas are the most common PCNs and are known predecessors of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Critically, they are one of the only radiographically identifiable precursors of pancreatic cancer and thus provide an opportunity for early cancer detection and surgical resection with curative intent. The combination of high prevalence and potential for malignant degeneration underscore the relevance of discussing the best management of IPMNs and improving the existing standard of care. Landmark data on IPMN prevalence, guidelines, surveillance, biomarkers, and immune landscape are highlighted.

### Important radiological and clinicopathological risk factors for the recurrence of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms after surgical resection [^112W9t1C]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The detection frequency of cystic lesions in the pancreas has increased with advancement and the widespread use of cross-sectional imaging, with many lesions thought to be intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Although the majority of IPMNs are benign, some have malignant potential, making it crucial to establish management and surveillance strategies for these lesions. As a result, several studies have addressed this issue, leading to the development and revision of international consensus guidelines (ICGs) for IPMNs. The ICGs define high-risk stigmata and worrisome features to aid in surgical decision-making for IPMN patients. However, determining surveillance strategies for patients after surgical resection remains a challenge.

Currently, it is known that even noninvasive IPMN can lead to the development of clinically significant remnant pancreatic lesions (such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or IPMN which are indications for resection) after partial pancreatectomy, with risks persisting even beyond 5 years post-surgery. Consequently, recent guidelines recommend lifetime surveillance for all patients who have undergone surgery for IPMN, including those diagnosed with IPMN with low-grade dysplasia (LGD), as long as they remain fit for surgical resection. However, these recommendations are not strongly supported by high-level evidence, such as randomized controlled trials. Although rare, some studies suggest a low recurrence rate in noninvasive branch-duct IPMNs, indicating that surveillance might be discontinued for selected patients. Therefore, further research on risk-based surveillance strategies is needed, and understanding the factors that influence recurrence is crucial. Several studies have investigated risk factors for postoperative recurrence of IPMN, suggesting multiple potential factors, including pathologic grade, family history of pancreatic cancer, and other clinicopathologic factors. However, despite the importance of cross-sectional imaging in the diagnosis and management of IPMNs, few studies have thoroughly evaluated preoperative radiologic features alongside clinical and pathological factors as potential risk factors for postoperative recurrence. Even when some radiologic features are included in the analysis, the results vary among studies, highlighting the need for further research on the impact of preoperative imaging features on postoperative recurrence.

Therefore, this study aims to identify risk factors affecting postoperative recurrence-free survival in IPMN patients through a survival analysis that includes preoperative imaging findings, as well as pre- and postoperative clinical and pathological features.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: indication, extent, and results of surgery [^117EbLqE]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

In intraductal and papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas, the aims of surgery differ according to the presence of malignancy. For malignant IPMN and especially for invasive malignancy, radical resection is essential, but entails a substantial operative risk and long-term pancreatic insufficiency. For benign IPMN, in theory, the operative risk and the loss of pancreatic function should be minimal. Thus, surgery for malignant and benign IPMN differs in patient selection, surgical technique, and accepted risk of long-term functional disorders. This article details the indications, surgical techniques, and results of surgery in IPMN.

### Are the current guidelines for the surgical management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas adequate? A multi-institutional study [^115WcWUq]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy persists regarding the management of patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN). International consensus guidelines stratify patients into high-risk, worrisome, and low risk categories.

Study Design

The medical records of 7 institutions were reviewed for patients who underwent surgical management of IPMN between 2000 and 2015.

Results

There were 324 patients included in the analysis; 60.4% of patients had main-duct/mixed type, and 39.7% had branch-duct IPMN. The median cyst size was 2.65 cm, invasive cancer (IC) or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) was present in 42% (n = 136); 68.9% of patients with high-risk, 40.0% of patients with worrisome, and 24.6% of patients with low risk features exhibited HGD/IC. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only 1 of 3 high-risk features and 2 of 7 worrisome features predicted the presence of HGD/IC. Positive predictive values for HGD/ IC in patients with obstructive jaundice and lymphadenopathy were 0.83 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.94) and 0.69 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.91), respectively. In the absence of high-risk features, HGD/IC was still present in 57.4% of patients with 2 or more worrisome features. Regression analysis demonstrated that each additional worrisome factor present was additive in predicting HGD/IC in a linear fashion (odds ratio 1.39; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.80; p < 0.01).

Conclusions

These data demonstrate that the current consensus guidelines for surgical resection of IPMN may not adequately stratify and identify patients at risk for having HGD or invasive cancer. Patients with multiple worrisome features, in the absence of high-risk factors, should be considered for resection.

### Pathologic evaluation and reporting of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas and other tumoral intraepithelial neoplasms of pancreatobiliary tract: recommendations of verona consensus meeting [^111ejVTs]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There are no established guidelines for pathologic diagnosis/reporting of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs).

Design

An international multidisciplinary group, brought together by the Verona Pancreas Group in Italy-2013, was tasked to devise recommendations.

Results

(1) Crucial to rule out invasive carcinoma with extensive (if not complete) sampling. (2) Invasive component is to be documented in a full synoptic report including its size, type, grade, and stage. (3) The term "minimally invasive" should be avoided; instead, invasion size with stage and substaging of T1 (1a, b, c; ≤ 0.5, > 0.5- ≤ 1, > 1 cm) is to be documented. (4) Largest diameter of the invasion, not the distance from the nearest duct, is to be used. (5) A category of "indeterminate/(suspicious) for invasion" is acceptable for rare cases. (6) The term "malignant" IPMN should be avoided. (7) The highest grade of dysplasia in the non-invasive component is to be documented separately. (8) Lesion size is to be correlated with imaging findings in cysts with rupture. (9) The main duct diameter and, if possible, its involvement are to be documented; however, it is not required to provide main versus branch duct classification in the resected tumor. (10) Subtyping as gastric/intestinal/pancreatobiliary/oncocytic/mixed is of value. (11) Frozen section is to be performed highly selectively, with appreciation of its shortcomings. (12) These principles also apply to other similar tumoral intraepithelial neoplasms (mucinous cystic neoplasms, intra-ampullary, and intra-biliary/cholecystic).

Conclusions

These recommendations will ensure proper communication of salient tumor characteristics to the management teams, accurate comparison of data between analyses, and development of more effective management algorithms.

### Proper management and follow-up strategy of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^115RMkrp]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

It has been reported that main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms are more invasive and have a worse prognosis than branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. Therefore, an aggressive surgical approach has mainly been recommended for all MD-IPMNs. However, the surgical management of BD-IPMNs has been controversial and the consensus guidelines are not specific for an indicator of malignancy in BD-IPMNs. The objective of this study was to determine the proper management and follow-up strategy of BD-IPMNs.

Methods

We monitored and analysed patients with presumed BD-IPMNs between March 1995 and March 2010.

Result

The mean value of the initial cyst size in all patients with BD-IPMNs was 2.19 cm. Amongst 194 patients with BD-IPMNs, 34 underwent immediate surgical resection, 152 were followed conservatively. Amongst the 152 conservatively managed patients, 18 (11.8%) underwent surgical resection after a median follow-up of 12.7 months (range, 3–48 months). In 132 patients who were managed conservatively without surgery, the mean incremental rate of cyst size growth was 0.0038 cm/month during a median of 30.7 months of follow-up and there were no IPMN-related deaths.

Conclusion

Amongst patients with BD-IPMNs, about 10% have surgery within approximately 1 year from the time of diagnosis because of the occurrence of new malignant stigmata. Therefore, a conservative approach without surgery and careful follow-up every 3 months or 6 months during the first year after diagnosis can be safely advocated in patients with BD-IPMNs larger than 10mm in size who have no risk factors for malignant IPMNs.

### Management algorithms for pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^111Nrqrj]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Context —

The detection of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) has increased owing to the advancement and widespread use of imaging modalities, resulting in differences between past and current management methods for PCNs, including intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Therefore, clinicians should accurately diagnose and determine appropriate treatment strategies. However, previously published treatment guidelines for IPMNs present different indications for treatment.

Objective —

To review the current status of PCNs, including epidemiologic change, malignancy risk, and factors for treatment, and to provide the optimal management algorithms for PCNs, including IPMNs, from the clinician's point of view.

Data Sources —

Literature review of published studies and the authors' own work.

Conclusions —

The treatment of PCNs relies on the type of cyst that is present or suspected. Serous cystic neoplasms are usually benign, and observation is sufficient. However, surgical treatment is required for mucinous cystic neoplasms, and malignancy risk differs according to lesion size. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms also require surgery. The detection of small IPMNs has been increasing, and most branch duct-type IPMNs are dormant. However, cysts 3 cm or larger or growing branch duct-type IPMNs must be carefully monitored because of the increasing risk of malignancy. Therefore, surveillance strategies should be different according to the size of the lesions. A tailored approach is needed for selecting surgery or surveillance, considering the malignancy potential of the lesion and patient-associated factors such as operative risks and life expectancy. Nomograms are valuable tools for selecting treatment methods as a customized approach for IPMNs.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: reporting clinically relevant features [^113p8zyx]. Histopathology (2017). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas can exhibit a wide spectrum of macroscopic and microscopic appearances. This not only causes occasional difficulties for the reporting pathologist in distinguishing these tumours from other lesions, but is also relevant clinically. As evidence accumulates, it becomes clear that multiple macroscopic and histological features of these neoplasms are relevant to the risk for malignant transformation and, consequently, of prime importance for clinical patient management. The need for detailed reporting is therefore increasing. This review discusses the panoply of gross and microscopic features of IPMN as well as the recommendations from recent consensus meetings regarding the pathology reporting on this tumour entity.

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: a single-institution experience [^111k92mz]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Currently, IPMNs represent the most promising opportunity for the prevention of pancreatic cancer through the establishment of surveillance programs and the treatment of precancerous lesions. However, surveillance of patients with IPMN incurs high healthcare costs and bears the risk for overtreatment or undertreatment of patients affected by the disease. For this reason, analysis of large series is needed to clarify the value and safety of patient surveillance.

The main purpose of this study was to analyze the survival rate and risk for progression in a large series of patients who are under surveillance for IPMN that according to current guidelines does not require surgical resection. The secondary purpose of the study was to analyze the safety of conservative management and the need for long-term follow-up of this patient group.

### Outcomes of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm compared with de novo pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^116HvQop]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

With the increasing resolution of modern imaging devices, incidental diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous cystic neoplasms (IPMN) has become common in clinical practice. Due to the risk of degeneration to invasive adenocarcinoma, surgical resection of high-risk IPMNs is often indicated. Unfortunately, the presentation of IPMNs ranges from main duct IPMNs with 'high-risk stigmata' and a high risk of invasive degeneration, to small secondary duct cysts with no 'worrisome features' and a low risk of progression. This high variability of risk in IPMNs makes the correct indication for surgical resection one of the challenges in the management of these tumors. - The optimal management of patients affected by an invasive IPMN (I-IPMN) is currently debated. I-IPMNs are a specific type of pancreatic adenocarcinoma arising from an IPMN precursor lesion, and there is controversial evidence of a more favorable oncological outcome of these tumors after surgical resection when compared with de novo pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Nonetheless, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, do not acknowledge I-IPMNs as a separate entity from PDAC but limit the mention of IPMNs as precursor lesions for pancreatic cancer. When facing an IPMN with a known invasive component, it is currently recommended that both medical and surgical treatment do not differ from the management of PDACs, but data on the effects of chemotherapy on I-IPMN are scarce.

The aim of this study was to determine the prognosis of resected I-IPMNs compared with de novo PDAC, and to assess the response of I-IPMNs to neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with de novo PDAC.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^115263kq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) — post-resection recurrence risk and surveillance intervals: Retrospective studies have reported a high risk of recurrence, 17–65% in IPMNs with pancreatic cancer, and these patients should be followed per pancreatic cancer guidelines. After resection of an IPMN with high-grade dysplasia, recurrence rates of 13–31% are reported and we recommend surveillance with MRI or EUS on a 6-month basis; the median time to recurrence varies from 19 to 47 months, with a wide range of 4 to 180 months. For surgically resected IPMN with low- or intermediate-grade dysplasia, recurrence is 0–22%; in the absence of pancreatic cysts in the remnant, surveillance with MRI every 24 months appears reasonable. If there is an IPMN in the remnant pancreas, patients should be followed based on the size of the largest IPMN, and the shortest surveillance interval should be followed (i.e., if there is a 1.5 cm cyst then surveillance would be yearly).

Background & Aims

International guidelines for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas recommend surgical resection of those with specific characteristics. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of malignancy associated with each of these features of IPMNs.

Methods

We performed a comprehensive search of MEDLINE from January 1, 1996, to November 11, 2011, for studies that included any of the features mentioned in the consensus guidelines for surgical resection of main duct and branch duct IPMNs. Data were analyzed from 41 studies for the following features: cyst size greater than 3 cm, the presence of mural nodules, dilated main pancreatic duct, symptoms, and main duct vs branch duct IPMNs. Malignant IPMNs were defined as those with carcinoma in situ or more advanced histology. A separate meta-analysis was performed for each risk factor to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs). A random-effects model was used, based on the assumption of variation among study populations.

Results

The risks of malignancy associated with individual cyst features were as follows: cyst size greater than 3 cm (OR, 62.4; 95% confidence interval, 30.8–126.3), presence of a mural nodule (OR, 9.3; 95% CI, 5.3–16.1), dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (OR, 7.27; 95% CI, 3.0–17.4), and main vs branch duct IPMN (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.3–6.9). There was a moderate level of heterogeneity among studies (I² range, 34–67).

Conclusions

Based on a meta-analysis, cyst features proposed by the international guidelines for resection of IPMN were highly associated with malignancy. However, based on our findings, not all cyst features should be weighted equally when considering risk of malignancy; cyst size greater than 3 cm was associated most strongly with malignant IPMN.

### Adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111rFPZ7]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are mucin-producing epithelial neoplasms of the pancreas originating from the main pancreatic duct and/or one or more of its tributaries. The worldwide prevalence of incidentally detected IPMNs is rising secondary to the widespread utilisation of cross-sectional abdominal imaging. Historical concerns regarding the likely overestimated malignant potential of IPMNs meant indiscriminate resection. However, through experience and an improved understanding of the pathophysiology, IPMNs are now understood to be a spectrum of disease whereby low-risk selected patients perform well when a conservative surveillance approach is employed. Indeed, IPMNs are distributed into low-grade dysplasia, intermediate-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and invasive carcinoma. High-risk clinical and radiological stigmata considered as predictors of high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma include obstructive jaundice, enhancing mural nodule ≥ 5 mm, and main pancreatic duct (MPD) ≥ 10 mm, while worrisome features include cyst ≥ 3 cm, enhancing mural nodule < 5 mm, MPD 5–9 mm, abrupt change in MPD diameter with distal pancreas atrophy, lymphadenopathy, elevated CA 19–9, and cyst growth of > 5 mm/2 year.

Patients deemed to be at high risk would undergo pancreatic resection; however, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy is not standardised in patients with invasive IPMNs (IIPMNs) on post-operative histology. While the European Study Group on Pancreatic Cystic Neoplasms recommended adjuvant chemotherapy for IIPMNs with or without lymph node involvement, the revised Fukuoka consensus guidelines made no recommendations on adjuvant chemotherapy. Currently, there remain no quantitative data to guide the use of adjuvant chemotherapy and prior systematic review is limited to narrative synthesis of historic literature. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to review the survival outcome of adjuvant chemotherapy compared to surgery alone for the treatment of patients with IIPMNs who underwent pancreatic resection and to identify pathologic features that may predict survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.

### Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cystic neoplasms: current evidence and guidelines [^112EdNmY]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCN) are a heterogeneous group of pancreatic cysts that include intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, mucinous cystic neoplasms, serous cystic neoplasms and other rare cystic lesions, all with different biological behaviours and variable risk of progression to malignancy. As more pancreatic cysts are incidentally discovered on routine cross-sectional imaging, optimal surveillance for patients with PCN is becoming an increasingly common clinical problem, highlighting the need to balance cancer prevention with the risk of (surgical) overtreatment. This Review summarizes the latest developments in the diagnosis and management of PCN, including the quality of available evidence. Also discussed are the most important differences between the PCN guidelines from the American Gastroenterological Association, the International Association of Pancreatology and the European Study Group on Cystic Tumours of the Pancreas, including diagnostic and follow-up strategies and indications for surgery. Finally, new developments in the management of patients with PCN are addressed.

### The characteristics and outcome of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas: an observational study [^114ftUSy]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are pancreatic cystic lesions with variable risk for malignant transformation. This observational study assessed the long-term natural history of IPMNs, focusing on risk stratification based on imaging and histological features.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 93 patients with IPMN confirmed by MRI and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or both. All patients had a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Demographic, clinical, imaging, procedural, and outcome data were collected. IPMN characteristics including cyst size, duct size, duct involvement, and location were evaluated at baseline. The primary outcome was progression to high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma. Secondary outcomes included the need for surgery, cyst progression, and IPMN-related mortality.

Results

The cohort included 93 patients (65.6% female, mean age 70.9 ± 9.9 years). The majority (92.5%) had branch duct IPMN. The mean cyst size was 1.53 ± 1.57cm, and the duct size was 2.69 ± 1.79mm. High-grade dysplasia was found in 9.7%. Surgical resection was significantly associated with cyst size > 2.6cm (P = 0.031), duct dilation > 5.3mm (P = 0.004), and main/mixed duct involvement (P < 0.001). Additionally, cyst wall thickening (60%) and mural nodule (67%) were significantly associated with surgical resection. One patient progressed to invasive carcinoma. No IPMN-related deaths were reported.

Conclusion

IPMNs evaluated and monitored with MRI/EUS demonstrate indolent behavior over extended follow-up. Surgical resection should be considered based on duct type, cyst size, and presence of dysplasia. Long-term surveillance remains essential for appropriate risk stratification.

### Are clinical guidelines for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms followed? a single-center analysis [^111YNs9b]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to determine how frequently guidelines for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are followed and establish factors associated with failure.

Methods

Four hundred forty-five patients with radiographic diagnosis of IPMN 1 cm or greater between January 1, 2003 and January 1, 2013 were included. We defined failure of guideline adherence if the following occurred: (a) failure of acknowledgment of IPMN, (b) failure to undergo endoscopic ultrasound, (c) failure to undergo resection, or (d) failure to undergo at least 1 surveillance image within 2 years after diagnosis.

Results

Failure of guideline adherence was observed in 58% of patients and evident across all the respective criteria (A: 38%, B: 25%, C: 29%, D: 33%). Age older than 68 years (P < 0.01), American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 3 or higher (P < 0.0001), benign findings on imaging (P < 0.0001), and major comorbid conditions (P < 0.01) were factors associated with higher rate of failure to compliance. On multivariate logistic regression, American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 3 or higher and benign features were associated with 4.0 times (95% confidence interval, 2.02–8.06) and 2.6 times (95% confidence interval, 1.60–4.07) higher odds of failure to compliance with guidelines, respectively.

Conclusions

Compliance with clinical guidelines for the management of IPMN is poor. Socioeconomic factors do not seem to create a disparity to care. However, many patients with IPMN have other medical diagnoses that take priority over IPMN surveillance and treatment.

### Risk of the watch-and-wait concept in surgical treatment of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [^111SAMV6]. JAMA Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The natural history of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) remains uncertain. The inconsistencies among published guidelines preclude accurate decision-making. The outcomes and potential risks of a conservative watch-and-wait approach vs a surgical approach must be compared.

Objective

To provide an overview of the surgical management of IPMNs, focusing on the time of resection.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study was conducted in a single referral center; all patients with pathologically proven IPMN who received a pancreatic resection at the institution between October 2001 and December 2019 were analyzed. Preoperatively obtained images and the medical history were scrutinized for signs of progression and/or malignant features. The timeliness of resection was stratified into too early (adenoma and low-grade dysplasia), timely (intermediate-grade dysplasia and in situ carcinoma), and too late (invasive cancer). The perioperative characteristics and outcomes were compared between these groups.

Exposures

Timeliness of resection according to the final pathological findings.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The risk of malignant transformation at the final pathology.

Results

Of 1439 patients, 438 (30.4%) were assigned to the too early group, 504 (35.1%) to the timely group, and 497 (34.5%) to the too late group. Radiological criteria for malignant conditions were detected in 53 of 382 patients (13.9%), 149 of 432 patients (34.5%), and 341 of 385 patients (88.6%) in the too early, timely, and too late groups, respectively (P < .001). Patients in the too early group underwent more parenchyma-sparing resections (too early group, 123 of 438 [28.1%]; timely group, 40 of 504 [7.9%]; too late group, 5 of 497 [1.0%]; P < .001), while morbidity (too early group, 112 of 438 [25.6%]; timely group, 117 of 504 [23.2%]; too late group, 158 of 497 [31.8%]; p = 0.002) and mortality (too early group, 4 patients [0.9%]; timely, 4 [0.8%]; too late, 13 [2.6%]; p = 0.03) were highest in the too late group. Of the 497 patients in the too late group, 124 (24.9%) had a previous history of watch-and-wait care.

Conclusions and Relevance

Until the biology and progression patterns of IPMN are clarified and accurate guidelines established, a watch-and-wait policy should be applied with caution, especially in IPMN bearing a main-duct component. One-third of IPMNs reach the cancer stage before resection. At specialized referral centers, the risks of surgical morbidity and mortality are justifiable.

### Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: management and unanswered questions [^116cYg6T]. Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Approximately 10% of persons 70 years old or older are now diagnosed with pancreatic cysts, but it is not clear which ones require additional analysis, interventions, or follow-up. Primary care doctors rely on gastroenterologists for direction because no one wants to miss a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, but meanwhile there is pressure to limit use of diagnostic tests and limit costs. We review the different cystic neoplasms of the pancreas and diagnostic strategies based on clinical features and imaging data. We discuss surgical and nonsurgical management of the most common cystic neoplasms, based on the recently revised Sendai guidelines. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (particularly the branch duct variant) is the lesion most frequently identified incidentally. We report what is known about its pathology, its risk of developing into pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the pros and cons of current guidelines for management, and the potential role of endoscopic ultrasound in determining cancer risk. We also review surgical treatment and strategies for surveillance of pancreatic cysts.

### The landmark series: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas-from prevalence to early cancer detection [^116NKD8W]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Due to the widespread availability and increased use of high-resolution cross-sectional imaging, incidental PCNs are increasing in incidence. Certainly, the numbers of patients that are referred to pancreatic surgery clinics have steadily increased over the years as a result. The prevalence of PCNs is more common in the general population than previously considered and increases with age, rising to over 75% in patients over 80 years of age in selected populations. About half of PCNs will be IPMNs, thus radiographic screening is impractical, although once identified, surveillance is necessary. When to stop this surveillance is difficult to determine and may be abbreviated in older individuals, but certainly will need to be more than 5 years in the absence of improved prognostic tools for the general population. Radiographic characteristics remain the main components of current treatment guidelines and there are significant differences between guideline recommendations and clinical practice. Future updates to these guidelines will benefit from an improved body of evidence and should endeavor to provide a single universally accepted version, distinguish MCNs from IPMNs, and incorporate methodologies that improve their positive predictive value. Cyst fluid molecular diagnostics have shown promise in differentiating low-grade dysplastic IPMNs from high-grade and invasive IPMNs, and there is now evidence that dysplasia is associated with distinct changes in the tumor immune microenvironment.

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: a single-institution experience [^111jk4r4]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

A limitation of our study is the relatively small number of patients with a long (more than 5 years) follow-up. As a consequence, the study results do not represent strong evidence on which recommendations for follow-up after 10 years could be based. Nonetheless, the results of this study support long-term follow-up rather than surveillance limited to 5 years. Although comparison of existing guidelines is beyond the scope of this study, it is important to note that a significant number of patients whose IPMN progressed during the study period to the point of requiring surgery would not have been identified if follow-up had been performed according to the ASA guidelines. The related problems of societal costs associated with this strategy require further investigation, especially considering the high prevalence of IPMN in the general population. New biomarkers and/or less expensive surveillance modalities will probably partially overcome this problem in the near future. Finally, our study confirmed previous reports that patients with an IPMN that formally requires surgery but who cannot be operated because of general contraindications, have a relatively high IPMN-specific survival. This observation opens a new field of potential investigation, exploring for example whether these patients would benefit from treatment with ablative techniques or similar modalities for symptomatic palliation.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: clinicopathologic characteristics and long-term follow-up after resection [^116yU6y2]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Resection is recommended for main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas because of the high risk of malignancy, but the indications for resection of branch duct and mixed-type IPMNs remain controversial. Our objective was to determine the appropriate management of IPMNs based on clinicopathologic characteristics and survival data obtained after resection.

Methods

A total of 72 consecutive IPMN patients who underwent resection between January 1984 and June 2006 were reviewed. The lesions were classified as main duct, branch duct, or mixed-type IPMNs and histologically graded as noninvasive (adenoma, borderline neoplasm, carcinoma in situ) or invasive.

Results

Main duct IPMNs (n = 15) were associated with a significantly worse prognosis than other subtypes. For branch duct (n = 49) and mixed-type IPMNs (n = 8), the diameter of the cystic lesions was an independent predictor of malignancy by multivariate analysis. However, four patients with cysts < 30 mm in diameter and no mural nodules had a malignancy. No patient with noninvasive IPMN died of this disease, showing excellent survival, whereas the 5-year survival rate of patients with invasive IPMNs was only 57.6% and was significantly worse than that of patients with noninvasive IPMNs (p = 0.0002).

Conclusions

Resection of all main duct IPMNs seems to be reasonable. Invasive IPMNs were associated with significantly worse survival than noninvasive IPMNs. Although the diameter of cystic lesions was a predictor of malignancy for branch duct and mixed-type IPMNs, precise preoperative identification of malignancy was difficult. Therefore, these lesions should be managed by aggressive resection before invasion occurs to improve survival.

### Meta-analysis of mortality in patients with high-risk intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms under observation [^116bcVp2]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Although consensus guidelines suggest that patients with high-risk intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) should have surgery, a non-operative strategy is often selected in patients who are poor surgical candidates. The aim was to determine the risk of disease-related death from IPMN in patients with worrisome features or high-risk stigmata who were kept under observation.

Methods

A PubMed literature search was undertaken of articles published from August 1992 to June 2016 (updated October 2017). The methodology was developed from PRISMA and MOOSE checklists. Incidence proportions and rates of overall and IPMN-related deaths were calculated, with subgroup analyses for main-duct/mixed-type and branch-duct IPMNs. Quality of the studies, publication bias and heterogeneity were explored.

Results

Six studies reported data on overall mortality and eight described disease-specific mortality for 556 patients during follow-up ranging from 24.9 to 60.0 months. Pooled rates of overall and IPMN-related mortality were 30.9 (95 per cent c.i. 19.6 to 45.1) and 11.6 (6.0 to 21.2) per cent respectively. The pooled incidence rate for overall mortality was substantially higher than that for IPMN-related mortality: 78 (95 per cent c.i. 44 to 111) and 23 (9 to 37) per 1000 patient-years respectively. The pooled incidence rate for disease-specific mortality was considerably lower for branch-duct than for main-duct or mixed-type IPMNs: 5 (0 to 10) and 32 (12 to 52) per 1000 patient-years respectively.

Conclusion

In patients unfit for surgery, IPMN-related mortality among patients with worrisome features and high-risk stigmata is low, and the risk of death from other causes much higher.

### Identification of spatially-resolved markers of malignant transformation in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^1143EGPU]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) are cystic lesions of the pancreas with papillary projections characterized by a mucin-producing epithelium. The number of patients diagnosed with IPMN is increasing, with a prevalence of 0.1% per 100.000 individuals.

IPMN can originate in side branch ducts (BD-IPMN), in the main duct (MD-IPMN), or in both (mixed type IPMN) and are considered pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) precursors. MD-IPMN has a higher risk of degeneration than BD-IPMN, which in most of cases is an indolent entity. In current classification IPMN are also grouped according their morphology in Gastric, Intestinal, and Pancreatobiliary, where Gastric-like cysts are usually regarded less aggressive than the others. An increasing number of studies instead show that these three morphologies may represent different stages of malignant transformation rather than separate entities.

Although the morphological subtype may be indicative of the likelihood of developing a tumor, the severity of dysplasia better predicts risk of malignant transformation.

The goal of IPMN management is to reduce the risk of patient death due to progression to PDAC through primary and secondary prevention (early detection and risk-reducing surgery, respectively). High-risk IPMN (i.e. high-grade, HGD or MD IPMN, accounting for 57–90% of cases) are resected while low-risk IPMN (6–46%) undergo surveillance for the development of malignant featuresbased on morphological criteria. However, the management of IPMN remains a major challenge as high or low-risk IPMN are defined based on imaging and clinical features only, not taking into account the biology underlying similar appearing lesions that ultimately drives clinical behavior. As a result, patient risk stratification is often inaccurate leading to suboptimal treatment. Around 1–11% of patients with low-risk IPMN, who were assigned to clinical follow-up, developed PDAC. It is therefore of paramount importance to improve the understanding of IPMN biology and malignant potential to improve prognostication and personalized treatment decision-making processes. The availability of markers predicting malignant transformation might help to stratify patients who require pancreatic surgery, which is invasive and associated with a high rate of adverse events.

### Evaluation of the guidelines for management of pancreatic branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [^114NK3HM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The 2006 Sendai Consensus Guidelines recommend surgical resection for all suspected branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (BD-IPMN) greater than 3 cm irrespective of symptoms, and those less than 3 cm with worrisome features. We aimed to evaluate the surgical characteristics of these guidelines retrospectively in pathologically confirmed cases of BD-IPMN.

Methods

IPMNs resected at our institution (1995–2006) were classified as main-duct predominant or branch-duct (BD) predominant based on preoperative imaging and postoperative histology. Resected BD-IPMNs were classified histologically: low risk (adenoma, borderline) and high risk (carcinoma in situ or invasive cancer). Clinical data (presence of symptoms, mural nodule, dilated pancreatic duct, and cyst size) were correlated with pathology.

Results

Between 1995 and 2006, there were 204 patients who underwent surgical resection of pancreatic cysts. Sixty-one patients had IPMN including 31 with BD-IPMN. A total of 74.2% (23 of 31) of BD-IPMNs would have been recommended for surgical resection including 69.2% (18 of 26) of low-risk lesions and 100% (5 of 5) of high-risk lesions. All 8 cases of BD-IPMN that would have been recommended for nonsurgical management were low-risk lesions. The positive predictive value of the guidelines is 21.7% (95% confidence interval, 9.7%-41.9%). The negative predictive value is 100% (95% confidence interval, 67.6%-100.0%). Between 2000 and 2007, 351 patients with likely BD-IPMN were evaluated but not resected.

Conclusions

Implementation of the Consensus Guidelines to our single-institution, referral-based, surgical BD-IPMN population would have recommended resection of all histologically high-risk lesions. All lesions recommended for nonsurgical management were histologically low-risk lesions. For presumed BD-IPMNs less than 3 cm, the application of the Consensus Guidelines may reduce the resection rate for low-risk lesions.

### Treatment guidelines for branch duct type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: when can we operate or observe? [^116ZXjGc]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The objectives of this study were to investigate the clinicopathological features of branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and to determine safe criteria for its observation. Most clinicians agree that surgical resection is required to treat main duct-type IPMN because of its high malignancy rate. However, no definite treatment guideline (with respect to surgery or observation) has been issued on the management of branch duct type IPMN.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathological data of 138 patients who underwent operations for IPMN between 1993 and 2006 at five institutes in Korea.

Results

Of 138 patients (mean age, 60.6 years; 87 men, 51 women), 76 underwent pancreatoduodenectomy, 39 distal pancreatectomy, 4 total pancreatectomy, and 20 limited pancreatic resection. There were 112 benign cases: 47 adenoma, 63 borderline cases, and 26 malignant cases, with 9 of these being noninvasive and 17 invasive. By univariate analysis, tumor size and the presence of a mural nodule were identified as meaningful predictors of malignancy. By receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a tumor size of > 2 cm was found to be the most valuable predictor of malignancy. When cases were classified according to tumor size and the presence of a mural nodule, the malignancy rate for a tumor ≤ 2 cm without a mural nodule was 9.2%, for a tumor of ≤ 2 cm plus a mural nodule was 25%, and for other conditions such as tumor > 2 cm, > 25%.

Conclusions

Many branch duct IPMNs are malignant. Surgical treatment is recommended, except in cases that are strongly suspected to be benign or cases that present a high operative risk. Observation is only recommended in patients with a tumor size of ≤ 2 cm without a mural nodule.

### ASO author reflections: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm-derived pancreatic cancer: a need to evaluate for specific staging systems [^114rzER6]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Future

Although some management and staging may overlap with PanIN-derived pancreatic cancer, there is an urgent need for more robust evidence to support these guidelines and evaluate their applicability in IPMN-derived pancreatic cancer. It is already apparent that some deviations exist, and thus specific IPMN-derived pancreatic cancer staging and guidelines are likely warranted.

### Identification of patients with branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and very low risk of cancer: multicentre study [^114CtJmJ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the general population, the prevalence of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas is around 8 per cent. Most lesions are branch-duct (BD) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), which are usually detected incidentally. They have a more indolent behaviour than mixed-type or main-duct IPMNs. In 2006, international consensus guidelinesincorporated non-operative management for low-risk asymptomatic IPMNs less than 30 mm in size, with negative cytology, and without nodules and main pancreatic duct (MPD) dilatation. Updates of the guidelines in 2012and 2017introduced two categories of risk for malignancy, namely worrisome features (WF) and high-risk stigmata (HRS), and surveillance was recommended for BD-IPMNs lacking these features. A similar approach was proposed in the 2018 European guidelines, and has been validated by different studies. Internationaland Europeanguidelines propose a different surveillance schedule for low-risk BD-IPMNs, but they are concordant in supporting lifetime observation unless patients become unfit for surgery. A more liberal approach has been suggested by the American Gastroenterological Association guidelines, which include discontinuation of surveillance after 5 years in the absence of significant changes. Although lifetime surveillance is costly, a general recommendation for discontinuation after 5 years may be inappropriate. Therefore, studying the progression of low-risk BD-IPMN is clinically relevant for a better definition of surveillance timing and possible discontinuation in selected patients. The aim of the present study was to describe the natural history of low-risk BD-IPMNs, to identify risk factors for the development of WF/HRS and pancreatic malignancies, and to eventually define a subgroup of patients at low or no risk of progression over time.

### Pancreatic cysts suspected to be branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm without concerning features have low risk for development of pancreatic cancer [^111Msu52]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic cancer is usually discovered at advanced stage and there are no screening or surveillance strategies proven to reduce risk. Pancreatic cysts have been targeted for intervention since mucin-producing cysts are associated with a risk of progression to adenocarcinoma over time. Though pancreatic cysts are easily identified on cross-sectional imaging, most types pose no risk of malignant degeneration. With trending use and improvements in imaging, incidental pancreatic cysts have been increasingly detected, occurring in 2.4–14.4% of the general population. The minority of these cysts are easily and accurately distinguished using clinical and radiographic features such as main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (MD-IPMN) and high-risk (≥ 3 cm in size) mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN). However, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP) perform poorly in discerning cyst type for the majority of cysts, with accuracy of diagnosis < 50%. Many are presumably neoplastic cysts such as branch duct (BD)-IPMN or small MCN whose natural history and risk for progression to adenocarcinoma are poorly understood. Resection is reserved for symptomatic or probable malignant cysts with features as suggested per Fukuoka criteria and the 2015 AGA guidelines on diagnosis and management of asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts. Surgical resection of pancreatic cysts carries a morbidity of 35% and mortality of 1%. Thus, non-operative management in most cases is reasonable as transformation of pancreatic cysts into adenocarcinoma appears to be a rare event (33.2 events per 100,000). The challenge is discerning BD-IPMN with highest malignant potential that warrant operative management from those that can be safely entered into a surveillance program, thereby minimizing risks to this patient population.

### The role of intraoperative pancreatoscopy in the surgical management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: a systematic scoping review [^1131y8ZZ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The type and the extent of surgery is still debatable for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). Intraoperative pancreatoscopy (IOP) allows the visualization of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) in its entire length and could help determine the extent of MPD involvement and the type and extent of pancreatic resection. However, current guidelines do not advise its routine use as there is a lack of evidence supporting its safety and feasibility. The present study aims to perform a scoping review of published evidence on the safety and feasibility of IOP in IPMN surgical management.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane, Medline and EMbase to identify studies reporting the use of IOP in IPMN surgical management. The research was completed in June 2023. Data extracted included patient selection criteria, demographics, safety of the procedure, intraoperative findings, impact on surgical strategy, histology results and postoperative outcomes.

Results

Four retrospective and one prospective study were included in this scoping review. A total of 142 patients had IOP. The selection criteria for inclusion were heterogenous, with one out of five studies including branch duct (BD), main duct (MD) and mixed type IPMN. Indications for IOP and surgical resection were only reported in two studies. A median of seven outcomes (range 5–8) was described, including the type of surgical resection, additional lesions and change of surgical plan, and complications after IOP. IOP showed additional lesions in 48 patients (34%) and a change of surgical plan in 48(34%). No IOP-related complications were reported.

Conclusions

This scoping review suggests IOP is safe and identifies additional lesions impacting the surgical strategy for IPMN. However, the included studies were small and heterogeneous regarding IPMN definition and indications for surgery and IOP. There is a need for a large multi-centre prospective study to determine the role of IOP and its impact on surgical strategy for IPMN.

### Management of pancreatic cysts: a multidisciplinary approach [^112RVjB9]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

An increasing number of patients are being diagnosed with pancreatic cysts. Pancreatic cysts are best evaluated by a team of healthcare professionals that includes gastroenterologists, surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, oncologists and geneticists.

Recent Findings

The international consensus guidelines for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and mucinous cystic neoplasm were updated in 2012, incorporating research that had been reported over a 5-year span since the publication of the previous guidelines. There are significant changes in the new guidelines, which include redefining main duct IPMN and removing the recommendation for surgical resection based on size alone. In addition, the discovery of molecular markers of cyst type promises to revolutionize the way patients are diagnosed and managed.

Summary

The diagnosis and management of patients with pancreatic cysts have progressed significantly in recent years. Large prospective, multicenter trials are now needed to validate the new international consensus guidelines and to assess the accuracy of new molecular markers.

### The revised kyoto criteria and risk of malignancy among patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^117Cty18]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

The revised Kyoto guidelines have a new catalog of high-risk stigmata and worrisome features for the risk stratification of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). We aimed to validate the stratification system in terms of short- and long-term risks of pancreatic carcinoma.

Methods

We included 3336 patients diagnosed with IPMNs in 2000–2021 and examined short-term (≤ 6 months) and long-term risks of pancreatic carcinoma diagnosis. We used the multivariable competing-risks proportional hazards regression model to calculate subdistribution hazard ratios for long-term incidence of pancreatic carcinoma with adjustment for potential confounders.

Results

In short-term analyses, pancreatic carcinomas were prevalent predominantly in IPMNs with high-risk stigmata (49% vs 1.3% and 0.05% in IPMNs with worrisome features and no risk factors, respectively). In long-term analyses of worrisome features, the main pancreatic duct diameter of 5–9.9 mm, acute pancreatitis, and IPMN growth rate of 2.5 mm/y were associated with a high incidence with multivariable subdistribution hazard ratios of 3.46 (95% confidence interval, 2.04–5.89), 5.65 (95% CI, 1.86–17.2), and 3.83 (95% CI, 2.14–6.86), respectively. An increasing number of worrisome features at baseline was associated with a higher prevalence and incidence of pancreatic carcinoma (P trend < .001). Patients with 1, 2, and 3–4 worrisome features had multivariable subdistribution hazard ratios for pancreatic cancer incidence of 1.43 (95% CI, 0.93–2.19), 2.17 (95% CI, 1.17–4.05), and 10.1 (95% CI, 4.20–24.5), respectively (vs no positive feature).

Conclusions

The revised Kyoto criteria stratify IPMN patients well in terms of the short- and long-term risks of pancreatic carcinoma diagnosis, potentially informing personalized patient management.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas: diagnosis and treatment [^112i2Fq6]. Pancreas (2004). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is characterized by cystic dilatation of the main and/or branch pancreatic duct. Only one-third of all patients are symptomatic, and others are diagnosed by chance. IPMNs are classified into 3 types: main duct, branch duct, and mixed IPMN. Most branch-type IPMNs are benign, while the other 2 types are frequently malignant. The presence of large mural nodules increases the possibility of malignancy in all types. Presence of a large branch-type IPMN and marked dilatation of the main duct indicate, at the very least, the existence of adenoma. Ultrasonography, endosonography, and intraductal ultrasonography clearly demonstrate ductal dilatation and mural nodules, and magnetic resonance pancreatography best visualizes the entire outline of IPMN. Not infrequently, synchronous or metachronous malignancy develops in various organs, including the pancreas. Prognosis is excellent after complete resection of benign and noninvasive malignant IPMNs. Asymptomatic branch-type IPMNs without mural nodules may be followed up without resection. Malignant IPMNs displaying acquired aggressiveness after parenchymal invasion require adequate lymph node dissection. Total pancreatectomy is needed for some IPMNs; its benefits, however, must be balanced against operative and postoperative risks because most IPMNs are slow growing and affect elderly people, and prognosis is favorable for IPMN patients with even malignant neoplasms.

### Molecular pathogenesis of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^111RBUHe]. Pancreas (2010). Low credibility.

Over the last 3 decades, there have been substantial improvements in diagnostic imaging and sampling techniques to evaluate pancreatic diseases. The modern technology has helped us to recognize premalignant conditions of pancreas including mucinous cystic neoplasms and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Differentiation between benign and malignant lesions and early detection of any malignant transformation in premalignant lesion are extremely important for further management decisions. Diagnostic cytology has limited sensitivity to further differentiate between benign, premalignant, and malignant lesions of the pancreas. There is limited information about the epidemiological risk factors and molecular mechanisms leading to development and further progression to malignancy of IPMNs. Several studies have shown that pancreatic juice and pancreatic tissue from the lesion can be tested for molecular markers including K-ras, p53, and p16 to differentiate between cancer and chronic inflammatory process. We review cellular signaling pathways that contribute to pathogenesis of IPMNs of the pancreas to further identify potential biomarkers and molecular targets.

### Acute pancreatitis in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm: a single-center retrospective cohort study with systematic review and meta-analysis [^111VUaYL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Systematic review and Meta-analysis

Search strategy and selection criteria

This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CKNI, and Wanfang databases were searched, up to June 1, 2023. The search terms and the combinations were: ("IPMN" OR "intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm" OR "IPMT" OR "intraductal papillary mucinous tumor" OR "IPMA" OR "intraductal papillary mucinous adenoma" OR "IPMC" OR "intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma") AND ("pancreatitis" OR "acute pancreatitis" OR "AP"). No filters were applied in the search.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The inclusion criteira of this systematic review and meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the PECO criteria (participants, exposure, comparison, and outcomes). P: patients with IPMN confirmed by histopathology or image, E: AP group; C: non-AP group; O: presence of HGD or intestinal epithelial subtype. There was no language restriction for the study eligibility.

Exclusion criteria were: reviews / case reports / meeting abstracts; non-human studies, studies without outcomes of interest; patients not meeting IPMN or AP diagnostic criteria; and patients' AP was due to other causes such as gallstones, alcohol, high triglycerides, autoimmune diseases, metabolic diseases, or pancreas anatomical abnormalities.

Data extraction

Two investigators independently searched the literature, screened and evaluated the included studies, and extracted relevant data. In disagreements, the third author and the two investigators discussed and agreed through consultation. Extraction of the study data included authors, year of publication, study site, study type, sample size, age, sex, presence of pancreatitis (number of episodes, severity, etiology), IPMN characteristics (location, typing, degree of histiocytic heterogeneity, epithelial cell subtype), treatment method, follow-up, and prognosis.

Quality Assessment

The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of the studies included. The NOS scale assigns a maximum of nine points to each study, with four points awarded for acceptable participant selection, two points awarded for participant comparability based on design and analysis, and three points awarded for adequate outcome ascertainment. Studies with five or more points were considered high quality. Two independent reviewers conducted the quality assessment. A third reviewer was consulted if uncertainties existed.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: have IAP consensus guidelines changed our approach? results from a multi-institutional study [^114Kb6Ex]. Annals of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the influence of consensus guidelines on the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and the subsequent changes in pathologic outcomes.

Background

Over time, multiple guidelines have been developed to identify high-risk IPMN. We hypothesized that the development and implementation of guidelines should have increased the percentage of resected IPMN with high-risk disease.

Methods

Memorial Sloan-Kettering (MSK), Johns Hopkins (JH), and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) databases were queried for resected IPMN (2000–2015). Patients were categorized into main-duct (MD-IPMN) versus branch-duct (BD-IPMN). Guideline-specific radiographic/endoscopic features were recorded. High-risk disease was defined as high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma. Fisher's exact test was used to detect differences between institutions. Logistic regression evaluated differences between time-points [preguidelines (pre-GL, before 2006), Sendai (SCG, 2006–2012), Fukuoka (FCG, after 2012)].

Results

The study included 1210 patients. The percentage of BD-IPMN with ≥ 1 high-risk radiographic feature differed between centers (MSK 69%, JH 60%, MGH 45%; P < 0.001). In MD-IPMN cohort, the presence of radiographic features such as solid component and main pancreatic duct diameter ≥ 10mm also differed (solid component: MSK 38%, JH 30%, MGH 18%; P < 0.001; duct ≥ 10mm: MSK 49%, JH 32%, MGH 44%; P < 0.001). The percentage of high-risk disease on pathology, however, was similar between institutions (BD-IPMN: P = 0.36, MD-IPMN: P = 0.48). During the study period, the percentage of BD-IPMN resected with ≥ 1 high-risk feature increased (52% pre-GL vs 67% FCG; P = 0.005), whereas the percentage of high-risk disease decreased (pre-GL vs FCG: 30% vs 20%). For MD-IPMN, there was not a clear trend towards guideline adherence, and the rate of high-risk disease was similar over the time (pre-GL vs FCG: 69% vs 67%; P = 0.63).

Conclusion

Surgical management of IPMN based on radiographic criteria is variable between institutions, with similar percentages of high-risk disease. Over the 15-year study period, the rate of BD-IPMN resected with high-risk radiographic features increased; however, the rate of high-risk disease decreased. Better predictors are needed.

Incidental cystic intrapancreatic lesions are daily findings in abdominal radiology. The discovery of incidental pancreatic lesions is increasingly common with technologic diagnostic advancements. This article provides a perspective and guideline on the clinical management of incidental intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and cystic or premalignant lesions of the pancreas.

### The influence of patient preference on surgeons' treatment recommendations in the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^111P8dp4]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to determine whether surgeon variation in management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) is driven by differences in risk perception and quantify surgeons' risk threshold for changing their recommendations.

Background

Surgeons vary widely in management of IPMN.

Methods

We conducted a survey of members of the Americas HepatoPancreatoBiliary Association, presented participants with 2 detailed clinical vignettes and asked them to choose between surgical resection and surveillance. We also asked them to judge the likelihood that the IPMN harbors cancer and that the patient would have a serious complication if surgery was performed. Finally, we asked surgeons to rate the level of cancer risk at which they would change their treatment recommendation. We examined the association between surgeons' treatment recommendations and their risk perception and risk threshold.

Results

One hundred and fifty surgeons participated in the study. Surgeons varied in their recommendations for surgery [19% for vignette 1 (V1) and 12% for V2] and in their perception of the cancer risk (interquartile range: 2%-10% for V1 and V2) and risk of surgical complications (V1 interquartile range: 10%-20%, V2 20%-30%). After adjusting for surgeon characteristics, surgeons who were above the median in cancer risk perception were 22 percentage points (27% vs. 5%) more likely to recommend resection than those who were below the median (95% CI: 11.34%; P < 0.001). The median risk threshold at which surgeons would change their recommendation was 15% (V1 and V2). Surgeons who recommended surgery had a lower risk threshold for changing their recommendation than those who recommended surveillance (V1: 10.0 vs. 15.0, P = 0.06; V2: 7.0 vs. 15.0, P = 0.05).

Conclusions

The treatment that patients receive for IPMNs depends greatly on how their surgeons perceive the risk of cancer in the lesion. Efforts to improve cancer risk prediction for IPMNs may lead to decreased variations in care.

### Pancreatic incidentalomas: investigation and management [^114fJLst]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The incidence of pancreatic incidentalomas (PIs) detected in otherwise asymptomatic patients is growing with the increasing quality and use of advanced imaging techniques. PI can present as isolated main pancreatic duct dilation or as a solid or cystic lesion. Although historically thought to be relatively rare, PIs are rather common, particularly cystic lesions of the pancreas, which can be detected in up to 49% of the general population. With the poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer, PIs are an opportunity for prevention and early diagnosis, but when managed poorly, they can also lead to overtreatment and unnecessary morbidity. The management of PI should begin with a dedicated pancreas protocol computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to accurately characterize duct size, lesion characteristics and establish an accurate baseline for subsequent follow up. Diagnosis and subsequent management depends on the extent of main duct dilation and solid versus cystic appearance. Solid lesions are highly concerning for malignancy. Cystic lesions can be further categorized as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas (IPMNs) or mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs), both of which harbour malignant potential, or as serous cystic neoplasms (SCNs) that are benign. In this paper, we summarize the major challenges related to PI and present pragmatic suggestions for management.

### Identification of patients with branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and very low risk of cancer: multicentre study [^111mzqEu]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Different surveillance strategies for patients with low-risk branch-duct (BD) intraductal papillary neoplasm (IPMN) have been described. The aim of this study was to describe the natural history of low-risk BD-IPMN, and to identify risk factors for the development of worrisome features (WF)/high-risk stigmata (HRS) and of pancreatic malignancies.

Methods

This was a multicentre retrospective study of patients with BD-IPMN who were under active surveillance between January 2006 and December 2015. Patients were eligible if they had a low-risk lesion and had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Outcomes were development of WF/HRS or cytologically/histologically confirmed malignant IPMN.

Results

Of 837 patients included, 168 (20 per cent) developed WF/HRS. At the end of the observation time, 132 patients (79 per cent) with WF/HRS were still under surveillance without progression to pancreatic cancer. Factors associated with the development of WF or HRS in multivariable analysis included localized nodules (versus diffuse: hazard ratio (HR) 0.43, 95 per cent c.i. 0.26 to 0.68), cyst size 15–19 mm (versus less than 15 mm: HR 1.88, 1.23 to 2.87) or at least 20 mm (versus less than 15 mm: HR 3.25, 2.30 to 4.60), main pancreatic duct size over 3 mm (versus 3 mm or less: HR 2.17, 1.41 to 3.34), and symptoms at diagnosis (versus no symptoms: HR 2.29, 1.52 to 3.45). Surveillance in an endoscopy-oriented centre was also associated with increased detection of WF or HRS (versus radiology-oriented: HR 2.46, 1.74 to 3.47).

Conclusion

Conservative management of patients with low-risk BD-IPMN is safe and feasible.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) — distribution, multiplicity, malignancy risk, and fluid characteristics are outlined, noting multifocality and elevated carcinoembryonic antigen in cyst fluid. IPMNs may involve side branches only, the main duct, or a combination of both termed mixed IPMN, in up to 40% of cases multiple IPMNs occur, main duct IPMN has a high risk of malignancy with 38–68% harboring high-grade dysplasia or pancreatic cancer in resected specimens, and when fluid is obtained the cyst fluid CEA is usually elevated.

### Management of mucin-producing cystic neoplasms of the pancreas [^112F2ThU]. The Oncologist (2009). Low credibility.

During the last decade small lesions of the pancreas have been increasingly recognized in clinical practice. Among these lesions, mucin-producing cystic neoplasms represent a recently described and unique entity among pancreatic tumors. In 1996, the World Health Organization distinguished two different types of mucinous cystic tumors: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas, which are characterized by mucin production, cystic dilation of the pancreatic ducts, and intrapapillary growth, and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs), which are defined by ovarian-like stroma and in most cases do not communicate with pancreatic ducts. Further, IPMNs can be subdivided into main-duct type, mixed-type, and branch-duct type tumors. Older data did not distinguish among different subsets of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas, and consequently many databases were inconsistent. Histopathologically, both IPMNs and MCNs demonstrate a wide spectrum of cellular atypia ranging from mild mucinous hyperplasia to invasive adenocarcinoma. Because mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas show significant differences in clinical behavior from patient to patient, knowledge of the clinicopathologic characteristics and natural history of specific subtypes of IPMNs and MCNs has become crucial for physicians working in the field of gastroenterology. The present work offers an overview of current and generally accepted clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of IPMNs and MCNs.

### The landmark series: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas-from prevalence to early cancer detection [^113vjWRH]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Comment

There are now over 10 guidelines by different societies, specialty groups, and geographies. The three guidelines included in this article are the most widely used among pancreatologists worldwide. AGA guidelines have not been updated since 2015 and have found limited adoption by the surgical oncology community, particularly in regard to repeat use of EUS and surveillance cessation. The Sendai/Fukuoka/International guidelines have been updated three times, now almost exclusively focused on IPMN. As outlined, they rely for the most part on expert opinion and are therefore at the bottom of the classical pyramid for evidence-based medicine. While most clinicians will endeavor to follow at least one of these guidelines, there remains significant differences between guideline recommendations and clinical practice. An added layer of complexity when navigating the guidelines in clinical practice is differences in guideline recommendations and terminology, and these issues hamper their use in the real world. Future updates to these guidelines should endeavor to provide a single universally accepted version, distinguishing MCN from IPMN, and incorporating methodologies, i.e. radiomics and molecular diagnostics, that improve their positive predictive value. The current guidelines are very sensitive and few invasive cancers are being surveilled, however they have low specificity. It is estimated that using these guidelines, approximately 75% of IPMN resections will be for low-risk lesions that could otherwise have been surveilled.

### European evidence-based guidelines on pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^114bP9L7]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines on the management of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCN) are lacking. This guideline is a joint initiative of the European Study Group on Cystic Tumours of the Pancreas, United European Gastroenterology, European Pancreatic Club, European-African Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association, European Digestive Surgery, and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. It replaces the 2013 European consensus statement guidelines on PCN. European and non-European experts performed systematic reviews and used GRADE methodology to answer relevant clinical questions on nine topics (biomarkers, radiology, endoscopy, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), serous cystic neoplasm, rare cysts, (neo)adjuvant treatment, and pathology). Recommendations include conservative management, relative and absolute indications for surgery. A conservative approach is recommended for asymptomatic MCN and IPMN measuring < 40 mm without an enhancing nodule. Relative indications for surgery in IPMN include a main pancreatic duct (MPD) diameter between 5 and 9.9 mm or a cyst diameter ≥ 40 mm. Absolute indications for surgery in IPMN, due to the high-risk of malignant transformation, include jaundice, an enhancing mural nodule > 5 mm, and MPD diameter > 10 mm. Lifelong follow-up of IPMN is recommended in patients who are fit for surgery. The European evidence-based guidelines on PCN aim to improve the diagnosis and management of PCN.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: clinical and pathological features and diagnostic approach [^112FhK9c]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are mucin-producing neoplasms with a frequent papillary architecture that arise within the pancreatic ducts and are increasingly being recognised. Because they exhibit a spectrum of dysplasia ranging from low grade to high grade and may also have associated invasive carcinoma, and because they are clinically detectable, they are now intensively studied. There is marked overlap between IPMNs and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), such that the distinction between these two lesions is nearly impossible in certain cases. In addition, IPMNs sometimes can be confused with other primary cystic lesions of the pancreas. As a result, the correct diagnosis of IPMN can be challenging. This review addresses the clinical and pathological features of IPMNs, emphasising their diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis and biological behaviour. Problematic issues in the pathological evaluation of IPMNs are discussed.

### Pancreatic cysts suspected to be branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm without concerning features have low risk for development of pancreatic cancer [^111tNKDT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The strengths of this study lend to its effective representation of real-life patient care at four separate institutions; thus results are clinically useful and generalizable. Referral bias was minimized since the cohort included patients from a large, integrated healthcare system and a tertiary academic referral center. Cysts types were classified by clinical and EUS information that can be easily attained by most clinicians during diagnostic workup of incidentally discovered pancreatic cystic lesion. The large group of non-operatively managed patients and long-term follow up also allowed for a detailed description of the natural history of presumptive BD-IPMN.

In summary, this study supports the use of the Fukuoka "high-risk stigmata" and "worrisome features" criteria in stratifying the malignant potential of cysts consistent with BD-IPMN. This study supports surveillance of benign appearing cysts that lack Fukuoka criteria, or high-risk features as identified by AGA 2015 guidelines because they pose little to no risk to the patient. Most patients who develop pancreatic cancer in BD-IPMN have at least one Fukuoka criterion and are most often diagnosed with pancreatic cancer within a year of the cyst being detected. However, patients not diagnosed with cancer within the first year, continue to be at risk for developing pancreatic cancer over time, even in those who initially did not have Fukuoka criteria at the time of initial EUS. Thus surveillance should be continued in patients with presumptive BD-IPMN.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Histologically proven branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMN) with Fukuoka "high risk stigmata" have a high risk for pancreatic cancer and should be considered for immediate surgery
Histologically proven BD-IPMN with "worrisome features" and those without Fukuoka criteria are at intermediate and low risk for pancreatic cancer and may be managed non-operatively, however the safety of this strategy is not completely known
Non-invasive methods of establishing cyst diagnosis and malignant potential are imprecise

What the new findings are:

Fukuoka criteria perform well in stratifying risk of malignancy of clinically suspected BD-IPMN based upon clinical, radiographic and endoscopic ultrasound information
Suspected BD-IPMN without Fukuoka have an extremely low risk of either harboring or transforming into pancreatic cancer over at least first 7 years following diagnosis (1.2% cumulative risk) compared to those with at least 1 criterion (28%)

### The landmark series: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas-from prevalence to early cancer detection [^113fRG8n]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Non-operative Surveillance

For non-operative surveillance, all three sets of guidelines state that MRI is the preferred modality over CT because MRI does not expose patients to radiation and is better able to confirm the structural relationship between the cyst and pancreatic duct.

At baseline, the revised Fukuoka guidelines suggest that BD-IPMN patients without high-risk stigmata or worrisome features (> 3 cm, enhancing mural nodularity or cyst wall, main duct dilation, stricture, lymphadenopathy, elevated CA19–9, significant growth rate, jaundice, or symptoms) undergo short interval (3–6 months) pancreatic MRI/MRCP or CT to confirm stability. However, unlike the European and AGA guidelines, the revised Fukuoka guidelines provide recommendations on subsequent surveillance according to cyst size, as summarized in Table 1.

For patients without an indication for immediate resection, the European guidelines recommend a 6-month follow-up the first year, with subsequent annual follow-ups as long as no risk factors are present that would prompt surgery. In addition, in patients with only relative indications for resection, older patients, and those with severe comorbidity, continual 6-month follow-up is suggested.

In cases where there are not indications for resection, the AGA guidelines recommend that patients with cysts < 3 cm without a solid component or dilated pancreatic duct receive MRI surveillance in 1 year, followed by every 2 years, for a total period of 5 years if there are no changes in size or characteristics. The recommendation of the AGA guidelines to stop surveillance after 5 years is different from the European and revised Fukuoka guidelines, which suggest indefinite surveillance of IPMNs as long as the patient is fit for surgery because the risk of IPMN progression increases over time.

### Decisional control preferences in managing intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^114xDWmv]. Pancreas (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate patient preferences for decision-making role in the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas and to identify characteristics associated with those preferences.

Background

Management of IPMNs is rooted in uncertainty with guidelines failing to incorporate patients' preferences.

Materials and Methods

A representative sample of participants evaluated a clinical vignette with the option to undergo surgery or surveillance for their IPMN. Their preferred role in decision-making was evaluated using the Control Preference Scale. The relationship between control preference and demographic/psychosocial variables was analyzed.

Results

Of the 520 participants in the study, most preferred an active role (65%), followed by shared (29%), and passive roles (6%) in the decision-making process. Lower health literacy was significantly associated with more passive control preference (P = 0.003). Non-active preference was significantly associated with Latino race compared to White race (odds ratio = 0.52, P = 0.009). We found no significant association between control preference and education level or cancer anxiety.

Conclusions

Most patients prefer an active role in IPMN treatment decisions. Lower health literacy and Latino race were associated with a preference for non-active decision roles. Clinicians should strive to align patient involvement in IPMN treatment decisions with their patient's preferred role.

### "High-risk stigmata" of the 2012 international consensus guidelines correlate with the malignant grade of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^112oicNU]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The 2012 international consensus guidelines for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas stratified patients into 2 clinical categories, "high-risk stigmata" and "worrisome features", and recommended different therapeutic strategies for these groups. The aim of this study was to elucidate the significance of these categories in terms of predicting malignant IPMNs.

Methods

The medical records of 100 consecutive patients who underwent pancreatectomy for IPMNs were retrospectively reviewed. Seventy patients with branch duct IPMNs (BD-IPMNs) were stratified into 3 groups. The relationships between the number of predictive factors and histopathologic grade were investigated.

Results

The prevalence rates of malignant IPMN, invasive carcinoma, and lymph node metastasis in the high-risk group were 80%, 55%, and 20%, respectively, with these percentages significantly increasing in a stepwise manner according to the number of predictive factors. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between the number of worrisome features and grade of malignancy in patients stratified as having worrisome BD-IPMNs.

Conclusions

The number of high-risk stigmata correlated significantly with the grade of malignancy of BD-IPMNs. The presence of at least 1 high-risk stigma in patients with BD-IPMNs indicates a need for pancreatectomy with lymphadenectomy.

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: a single-institution experience [^114LVFe9]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

While surveillance of the majority of patients with IPMN is considered best practice, consensus regarding the duration of follow-up is lacking. This study assessed the survival rate and risk for progression of IPMN under surveillance.

Methods

All patients diagnosed with and surveyed for IPMN between January 2008 and December 2013 were identified and assigned to two groups: patients without indication for surgery (Group 1), and patients whose IPMN required surgery but were inoperable for general reasons (Group 2). Disease progression and survival data were compared between both groups.

Results

In total 503 patients were identified, of whom 444 (88.3%) were followed up. Group 1 included 395 patients, and Group 2 had 49. In Group 1, IPMN-specific 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 100, 100, and 94.2%, respectively. Four patients died of associated or concomitant pancreatic cancer, and 230 patients (58.2%) experienced disease progression. The 1-, 4-, 10-year cumulative risk for progression and for surgery was 11.2, 70.6, 97.5, and 2.9, 26.2, 72.1%, respectively. In Group 2, the 1-, 5-, 10-year IPMN-specific survival rate was 90.7, 74.8, and 74.8%, respectively.

Conclusions

This study confirmed the safety of surveillance for patients with IPMN who do not require surgery. However, the risk for disease progression and for surgery increases significantly over time. The study results support International and European guidelines not to discontinue IPMN surveillance and validate the European recommendation to intensify follow-up after 5 years. The fairly good prognosis of patients whose IPMN requires surgery but cannot undergo resection suggests a relatively indolent disease biology.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [^116na1zK]. Human Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a grossly visible (≥ 1 cm), mucin-producing neoplasm that arises in the main pancreatic duct and/or its branches. Patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm can present with symptoms caused by obstruction of the pancreatic duct system, or they can be asymptomatic. There are 3 clinical subtypes of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm: main duct, branch duct, and mixed. Five histologic types of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm are recognized: gastric foveolar type, intestinal type, pancreatobiliary type, intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm, and intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm. Noninvasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms are classified into 3 grades based on the degree of cytoarchitectural atypia: low-, intermediate-, and high-grade dysplasia. The most important prognosticator, however, is the presence or absence of an associated invasive carcinoma. Some main duct-intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms progress into invasive carcinoma, mainly tubular adenocarcinoma (conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) and colloid carcinoma. Branch duct-intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms have a low risk for malignant transformation. Preoperative prediction of the malignant potential of an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm is of growing importance because pancreatic surgery has its complications, and many small intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, especially branch duct-intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, have an extremely low risk of progressing to an invasive cancer. Although most clinical decision making relies on imaging, a better understanding of the molecular genetics of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm could help identify molecular markers of high-risk lesions. When surgery is performed, intraoperative frozen section assessment of the pancreatic resection margin can guide the extent of resection. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms are often multifocal, and surgically resected patients should be followed for metachronous disease.

### Characteristic clinicopathological features of the types of intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^1168e49f]. Pancreas (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas encompasses a spectrum of neoplasms with both morphological and immunohistochemical variations of mucin glycoproteins. Recently, a consensus nomenclature and criteria were histologically defined for classifying these variants of IPMNs into gastric, intestinal, pancreatobiliary, and oncocytic types. The purpose of this study was to determine associations between the histological types and clinicopathological features in patients with IPMN.

Methods

Sixty-one patients with IPMN operated upon at Tohoku University Hospital between 1988 and 2006 were retrospectively analyzed.

Results

Our series included 27 gastric-, 29 intestinal-, 4 pancreatobiliary-, and 1 oncocytic-type IPMNs. Statistically, the types of IPMN were significantly associated with the histological diagnoses, macroscopic types, and survival of the patients. Characteristically, the gastric-type IPMNs were likely to be diagnosed as benign, to be confined to branch ducts, and to have fair prognoses. On the other hand, the intestinal-type IPMNs were likely to be diagnosed as malignant, occupy the main duct, and have poor prognoses. Because of the small number of pancreatobiliary-type IPMNs and only 1 case of oncocytic-type IPMN, we were unable to determine any of their clinicopathological characteristics in our series.

Conclusions

Evaluation of the histological types of IPMN may help to predict the clinical course of patients with IPMN and to design improved clinical management for these patients.

### Pancreatoscopy of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas [^117FJins]. VideoGIE (2024). Medium credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are cystic tumors that occur in the pancreas. IPMNs are considered precursor lesions to pancreatic cancer and require careful monitoring and management. They are characterized by their location, either arising from the main duct (MD-IPMN), a branch duct, or a combination of the two. MD-IPMNs have a higher risk of malignant transformation. IPMNs are often asymptomatic and incidentally discovered during imaging studies. Presenting symptoms include abdominal pain, jaundice, weight loss, and pancreatitis. Imaging techniques are used for initial detection and characterization. EUS with FNA is useful for further evaluation and obtaining tissue samples. Endoscopic examination may reveal fish mouth sign, which is characterized by a bulging, prominent ampulla that is extruding mucin. The fish mouth sign has a prevalence of 25% to 50% and is considered pathognomonic and specific (91%) for IPMN of the pancreas when present.

### The importance of tumor microenvironment modulations in the progression of pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^111XBWec]. The Journal of Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas have attracted substantial attention since they represent the most prevalent macroscopic precursor of pancreatic cancer. Most lesions show an epithelium with low‐grade dysplasia and will remain indolent and unknown to the patient. Notably, a subgroup of IPMNs will progress to invasive cancer through a stepwise process characterized by the accumulation of specific genomic alterations and concomitant modifications of the tumor microenvironment (TME). The manuscript of Jamouss et al, recently published in The Journal of Pathology, expands the current knowledge on TME dynamics in IPMNs. The neoplastic progression of IPMNs is paralleled by a shift toward an immunosuppressive TME, with depletion of cytotoxic T cells, elevated expression of immune checkpoint molecules, including PD‐L1 and VISTA, and increased density of macrophages. Overall, TME modifications are crucial in the progression of pancreatic IPMNs, calling for potential therapeutic strategies focused on TME modulations for cancer interception. © 2025 The Author(s).

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^111eTVYL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline: Diagnosis and Management of Pancreatic Cysts — epidemiology and malignant risk are summarized as follows: In asymptomatic populations, pancreatic cyst prevalence is reported from 2.4 to 13.5%, and among patients over the age of 70 undergoing abdominal magnetic resonance imaging the prevalence of incidental cysts was 40%. Using the assumption that all pancreatic cancer arises in patients with pancreatic cysts, the probability that a cyst harbors malignancy at imaging is 0.25%, with an overall conversion rate to invasive cancer of 0.24% per year. In surgically resected series, the pooled proportion with pancreatic cancer was 15% in 27 studies of 2,796 patients, and when only intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are considered, a review of 99 studies of 9,249 patients reported a 42% rate of either high-grade dysplasia or pancreatic cancer. For suspected IPMNs, one review of 3,980 patients found an overall risk of developing pancreatic cancer of 2.8% (95% CI, 1.8–4.0%), consistent with an estimated 0.72% per year (95% CI, 0.48–1.08). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 3,236 patients reported pooled cumulative incidence for low-risk IPMNs of 0.02% at 1 year, 3.12% at 5 years, and 7.77% at 10 years, and for high-risk IPMNs of 1.95% at 1 year, 9.77% at 5 years, and 24.68% at 10 years; the approach of including all pancreatic cysts has been criticized, as many pancreatic cysts have no malignant potential.

### Spectrum and classification of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas [^113uYS4Y]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

As patients are living longer and axial imaging is more widespread, increasing numbers of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are found. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasms are the most common. The revised Sendai guidelines provide a safe algorithm for expectant management of certain cystic neoplasms; however, studies are ongoing to identify further subgroups that can be treated nonoperatively. For those patients with high-risk clinical features or symptoms, surgical resection can be performed safely at high-volume pancreatic centers. Accurate diagnosis is critical for accurate decision making.

### Can long-term follow-up strategies be determined using a nomogram-based prediction model of malignancy among intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas? [^11547X2h]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study investigated whether a risk assessment nomogram can predict the malignant potential of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and provide valuable information for the follow-up and counseling strategies of such patients.

Methods

We studied 126 of 589 patients with IPMN who were followed up for at least 36 months with annual endoscopic ultrasonography. We analyzed scores derived from our nomogram, incorporating the parameters of sex, lesion type, mural nodule height, and pancreatic juice cytology determined at the initial IPMN evaluation.

Results

The rate of malignant IPMNs was 5.5% (7/126). The initial average nomogram score was 19.8 (range, 0–55), and the final follow-up average was 23.8 (range, 0–109). When a cutoff score was set at 35 points, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the nomogram to assess malignancy risk were 87.5%, 96.6%, and 96%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of malignant IPMN prediction during follow-up was 0.865.

Conclusions

The ability of the nomogram to predict malignancy in patients with IPMN was validated. Our findings can suggest that a follow-up for patients at high and low risk for cancer progression could be scheduled every 3 to 6 and 12 months, respectively.

### International intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms registry: long-term results based on the new guidelines [^116sZcHu]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to analyze the outcomes of a long-term intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) registry and evaluate new guidelines.

Methods

A prospectively maintained IPMN registry involving 6 centers in Europe and the United States was used to collect the data. Patients with more than 1-year follow-up and no malignancy diagnosed within the first 3 months of surveillance were included.

Results

From 1999 to 2014, 620 patients were included. The median follow-up time was 3 years. Thirty-seven (6%) patients developed malignancy with a median time from IPMN diagnosis to malignancy of 10.3 months. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year actuarial rates of disease-free survival were 97%, 93%, and 92% respectively. Four hundred thirty-one patients met criteria for low-risk branch duct IPMN consisting of cyst size less than 3 cm, with no solid component or main duct dilation. Eight malignancies were diagnosed in this subgroup, all of them within the first 5 years. From this subcohort, 112 patients had a follow-up time of more than 5 years, and no malignancy was diagnosed.

Conclusions

In IPMN lesions with low-risk features at baseline, the risk of progression to malignancy after the first 5 years of follow-up was minimal. Furthermore, the main cyst characteristics remained unchanged during their surveillance.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts [^1172dZxP]. Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline on asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts focuses on adult patients with cysts detected by radiology and uses the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework phrased in the population, intervention, comparator, outcome (PICO) format. The scope pertains only to asymptomatic pancreatic neoplastic cysts, does not evaluate the impact of symptoms, and excludes solid papillary neoplasms, cystic degeneration of adenocarcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, and main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) without side branch involvement. Incidental identification is common with modern imaging, and subsequent evaluations and interventions can be invasive, expensive, and harmful. Management emphasizes identifying the small minority of cysts with early invasive cancer or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) so that appropriately timed surgical resection can reduce mortality, while acknowledging that surgery is associated with significant morbidity and some mortality. Common diagnostic tools — including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology — have suboptimal sensitivities and specificities for identifying patients at highest risk. For each PICO statement, both the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation are provided, with quality described on a 4-point scale from high to very low.

### Branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: does cyst size change the tip of the scale? A critical analysis of the revised international consensus guidelines in a large single-institutional series [^113Lc8wq]. Annals of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to critically analyze the safety of the revised guidelines, with focus on cyst size and worrisome features in the management of BD-IPMN.

Background

The Sendai guidelines for management of branch duct (BD) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) espouse safety of observation of asymptomatic cysts smaller than 3 cm without nodules (Sendai negative). Revised international consensus guidelines published in 2012 suggest a still more conservative approach, even for lesions of 3 cm or larger. By contrast, 2 recent studies have challenged the safety of both guidelines, describing invasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ in 67% of BD-IPMN smaller than 3 cm and in 25% of "Sendai-negative" BD-IPMN.

Methods and Results

Review of a prospective database identified 563 patients with BD-IPMN. A total of 240 patients underwent surgical resection (152 at the time of diagnosis and 88 after being initially followed); the remaining 323 have been managed by observation with median follow-up of 60 months. No patient developed unresectable BD-IPMN carcinoma during follow-up. Invasive cancer arising in BD-IPMN was found in 23 patients of the entire cohort (4%), and an additional 21 patients (3.7%) had or developed concurrent pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. According to the revised guidelines, 76% of resected BD-IPMN with carcinoma in situ and 95% of resected BD-IPMN with invasive cancer had high-risk stigmata or worrisome features. The risk of high-grade dysplasia in nonworrisome lesions smaller than 3 cm was 6.5%, but when the threshold was raised to greater than 3 cm, it was 8.8%, and 1 case of invasive carcinoma was found.

Conclusions

Expectant management of BD-IPMN following the old guidelines is safe, whereas caution is advised for larger lesions, even in the absence of worrisome features.

### Biliary findings assist in predicting enlargement of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^116GMW3q]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

There is controversy over the optimal management strategy for patients with branch-duct type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas (BD-IPMNs), precursors to pancreatic cancer. We aimed to identify factors associated with the presence of BD-IPMNs and changes in their diameter.

Methods

Two separate analyses were conducted in a cohort of patients who underwent magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in a single year (2006). MRCP findings and clinical outcomes of these patients were followed for a maximum of 6 years. We evaluated initial MRCP findings and demographics associated with the presence of BD-IPMNs at baseline and increase in BD-IPMN diameter over time.

Results

During the follow-up period, 154 patients developed BD-IPMN and 322 patients did not. Older age, diabetes mellitus, gallbladder adenomyomatosis, and absence of gallstones were associated with the presence of BD-IPMNs at baseline. Increases in diameter of BD-IPMNs were associated with 3 baseline factors: BD-IPMN diameter greater than 17 mm, gallbladder adenomyomatosis, and a common bile duct diameter less than 5.5 mm. Patients with BD-IPMNs could be stratified into 4 groups with varying risk for the enlargement of BD-IPMNs over time: those with 3 risk factors (hazard ratio [HR], 11.4; 95% confidence interval, 3.4–37.8), 2 risk factors (HR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.7–12.8), or 1 risk factor (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.2–8.2) compared with those without risk factors.

Conclusions

For patients with BD-IPMNs, careful follow-up evaluation is particularly important for those with BD-IPMN > 17 mm in size, common bile duct diameter < 5.5 mm, or gallbladder adenomyomatosis.

Table 2
Risk of high-grade dysplasia or malignancy according to dilatation of the main pancreatic duct in IPMN

Follow-up of BD-IPMN is required as progression of disease is expected in about 10–15% of patients during 3–5 years of follow-up. Surveillance should also include the entire pancreatic gland because of an increased risk of new-onset cancer. In patients with MD-IPMN and those with mixed-type (MT)-IPMN several factors may predict progression during surveillance (eg, diffuse MPD dilatation, serum CA 19–9, serum alkaline phosphatase, and absence of extrapancreatic cysts).

4.2 What are the clinical implications of the presence of potential risk factors, including morphological features, with regard to determining follow-up investigations, and the decision to proceed with surgical resection

For patients with an IPMN without an indication for operative intervention, routine follow-up is recommended. A 6-month follow-up in the first year, and yearly follow-up thereafter is adequate when no risk factors are present that establish an indication for surgery. Changes in clinical symptoms should trigger investigations (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

For patients with relative indication for surgery (see statement 4.12), the 'elderly', and those affected by severe comorbidity, a 6-month follow-up is recommended. (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

In young individuals, the risk of malignancy and surgery has to be balanced against the burden of lifelong follow-up. However, after partial pancreatectomy for IPMN lifelong follow-up is still indicated. Resection therefore does not eliminate the need for regular follow-up screening.

4.3 Is there a certain size cut-off point for resecting an IPMN regardless of the absence of clinical symptoms or (other) risk factors? Is age of the patient a co-factor that should be analysed to define better management strategy?

Patients with IPMNs > 40 mm have an increased risk of harbouring malignancy (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

Several studies including both surgically resected or observed IPMN have reported an increased risk of malignancy ranging from 12% to 47% in cases of a cyst ≥ 30 mm. In some of these series, the risk of malignancy produced by cyst size was stratified by the presence of other features for malignancy, indicating that cyst size alone is not an appropriate indication for surgery since the risk of malignancy is actual but low. If multiple risk factors are present the sensitivity to detect malignancy increases.

### Low progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms with worrisome features and high-risk stigmata undergoing non-operative management: a mid-term follow-up analysis [^113wMQR9]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate mid-term outcomes and predictors of survival in non-operated patients with pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) with worrisome features or high-risk stigmata as defined by International Consensus Guidelines for IPMN. Reasons for non-surgical options were physicians' recommendation, patient personal choice or comorbidities precluding surgery.

Methods

In this retrospective, multicentre analysis, IPMNs were classified as branch duct (BD) and main duct (MD), the latter including mixed IPMNs. Univariate and multivariate analysis for overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were obtained.

Results

Of 281 patients identified, 159 (57%) had BD-IPMNs and 122 (43%) had MD-IPMNs; 50 (18%) had high-risk stigmata and 231 (82%) had worrisome features. Median follow-up was 51months. The 5-year OS and DSS for the entire cohort were 81% and 89.9%. An invasive pancreatic malignancy developed in 34 patients (12%); 31 had invasive IPMNs (11%) and 3 had IPMN-distinct pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (1%). Independent predictors of poor DSS in the entire cohort were age > 70years, atypical/malignant cyst fluid cytology, jaundice and MD > 15mm. Compared with MD-IPMNs, BD-IPMNs had significantly better 5-year OS (86% vs 74.1%, p = 0.002) and DSS (97% vs 81.2%, p < 0.0001). Patients with worrisome features had better 5-year DSS compared with those with high-risk stigmata (96.2% vs 60.2%, p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

In elderly patients with IPMNs that have worrisome features, the 5-year DSS is 96%, suggesting that conservative management is appropriate. By contrast, presence of high-risk stigmata is associated with a 40% risk of IPMN-related death, reinforcing that surgical resection should be offered to fit patients.

Pancreatic cyst management — patients who should have no further evaluation include those for whom Patients who are not medically fit for surgery should not undergo further evaluation of incidentally found pancreatic cysts, irrespective of cyst size (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence) and asymptomatic cysts diagnosed as pseudocysts on initial imaging and clinical history or as serous cystadenomas do not require treatment or further evaluation (Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Supporting risk data in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) cohorts show that among 725 patients 55% underwent resection and 45% underwent surveillance; after a median follow-up of 5 years, 24% of the patients had died and 78% of the deaths were not related to IPMNs, with the chance of a non-IPMN-related death within 3 years of diagnosis 11-fold higher for patients with a CACI of 7 or more and the median survival time for patients with a CACI score of ≥ 7 43 months. An additional series of 793 patients with IPMN reported that during a median follow-up of 50 months, 15% died, with causes of death pancreatic cancer in 26%, extrapancreatic cancer in 38%, other diseases in 32%, and unknown in 3.4%.

### Factors associated with the risk of progression of low-risk branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^111Lapcw]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are common incidental findingsand considered preneoplastic lesions that could progress to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

When IPMNs harbor morphologic features associated with cancer risk, surgery is indicated, and surveillance is advised for most patients with good life expectancy. Guidelines for IPMN management underline the importance of specific morphologic features associated with increased risk of cancer, including size of the branch-duct (BD) cyst, presence of solid nodules, and main pancreatic duct dilation. Most IPMNs, however, are small BD lesions without such features and carry a low risk of cancer.

There have been efforts to investigate characteristics associated with the subsequent progression risk. The initial size and multifocality of BD-IPMNs have been associated with progression risk during surveillance. These results, however, were based on older guidelines and did not consider IPMNs' growth rate. Also, information on possible patient-related factors associated with progression risk is limited.

In addition to the limited knowledge of cyst and patient features, there are few available data on the role of genetic variants in this context. Because it has been reported that non–type O blood is associated with an increased risk of PDAC, we hypothesized that this variant might also be associated with the risk of progression of BD-IPMN.

The present study aimed to investigate comprehensively cyst-related and patient-related factors associated with worrisome features (WFs) or high-risk stigmata (HRS) development in a cohort of BD-IPMNs under surveillance. To our knowledge, the role of ABO blood group type was also evaluated in a subgroup for the first time in this setting.

### Cystic pancreatic lesions: MR imaging findings and management [^114wBdTL]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

IPMN has heterogeneous malignant potential, and thus, the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP), with Fukuoka consensus in 2012, proposed two-tier criteria to predict malignancy.

First tier is represented by "worrisome features", a group of imaging findings suggesting that the lesion is not malignant yet, but could evolve in malignant, and thus requires further work-up by EUS, to better risk-stratify the lesion, and strict follow-up (Table 3).

Table 3
Fukuoka consensus guidelines, 2012 (intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm — IPMN — and mucinous cystic neoplasm — MCN) and 2017 (intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm — IPMN)

Second tier is represented by "high-risk stigmata", a group of imaging findings suggesting the possibility that the lesion is malignant, thus requiring surgical resection if the patient is fit (Table 3).

2012 Fukuoka consensus guidelines had been widely accepted and had high sensitivity to predict invasive carcinoma and high grade dysplasia, but relative low specificity, leading to a high number of unnecessary pancreatic resections, so in 2017 revised Fukuoka consensus has been proposed (Table 3). However, this new consensus needs future cohort studies to demonstrate whether the revised criteria allow to increase specificity without jeopardizing sensitivity.

To date, management of IPMN is still controversial; to simplify, according to 2017 Fukuoka revised consensus, patients with IPMN with high-risk stigmata have to undergo resection if fit, patients with IPMN with worrisome features need further workup and patients with IPMN without worrisome features and without high-risk stigmata need follow-up at different intervals depending on the size of the largest cyst (Table 4).

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114LigrQ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Premalignant pancreatic tumors — mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are cystic lesions often incidentally discovered; lesions involving the main duct have a higher malignant potential than those in the branches, with the risk of malignancy being around 62%, and the risk of malignancy in MCNs is < 15%. An international group of experts has established guidelines for IPMNs and MCNs; the international group strongly recommends resection in fit patients with main-duct IPMNs ≥ 10 mm, while for branch-duct IPMNs surveillance is considered an appropriate option in patients who are older or ineligible for resection or for cysts lacking high-risk stigmata. Branch-duct IPMNs that have an enhancing mural nodule ≥ 5 mm or are in the head of the pancreas causing obstructive jaundice should be considered for resection in patients who can undergo surgery; patients with resected IPMNs are followed with imaging studies to identify recurrences, and for MCNs the international group recommends resection for all patients who can undergo surgery.

### Distinct indications for adjuvant therapy in resected invasive mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas compared with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^116vGtRg]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Mucinous cystic neoplasms represent uncommon pancreatic tumors characterized by ovarian-type stroma beneath a layer of mucin-secreting cells. These tumors are predominantly observed in females aged between 40 and 60 years old. While most MCNs are benign, these tumors can progress to adenocarcinoma. Similar to intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), both tumors are categorized as mucinous, displaying varying degrees of dysplasia in their epithelium, ranging from low to high grade. Some lesions may advance to include an associated invasive component.

The International Association of Pancreatology recommends surgical removal of all MCNs regardless of size, while the European guidelines endorse a surveillance approach for MCNs < 40 mm if asymptomatic and without high-risk features (i.e. mural nodules). While management guidelines have incorporated the consideration of surgical resection for MCNs, the question of adjuvant treatment has not been comprehensively addressed. There is a paucity of studies assessing the use of adjuvant therapy for invasive MCNs due to the inadequate sample sizes of these lesions in institutional studies. The European guidelines recommended adjuvant treatment for invasive MCN based on an extrapolation from sporadic pancreatic adenocarcinomas. The decision was made due to the cited lack of evidence either supporting or refuting this approach. This absence of centralized adjuvant treatment guidelines for MCNs has left the question of treatment administration up to multidisciplinary teams at referral centers or individual oncologists.

Thus, there remains a need to validate the utility of adjuvant therapy for invasive MCNs and to determine the specific subsets of patients that may benefit from systemic therapy following resection. In this study, a nationally validated outcomes database was used to assess whether adjuvant systemic therapy is associated with survival in patients that underwent resection for invasive mucinous cystic neoplasms.

### Main duct dilatation is the best predictor of high-grade dysplasia or invasion in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^114aF3eD]. Annals of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to determine preoperative factors that are predictive of malignancy in patients undergoing pancreatic resection for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN).

Summary Background Data

IPMN of the pancreas may be precursor lesions to pancreatic cancer (PC) and represent a target for early diagnosis or prevention. While there has been much effort to define preoperative risk factors for malignant pathology, guidelines are ever-changing and controversy remains surrounding which patients would benefit most from resection.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of 901 consecutive patients obtained from two tertiary referral centers who underwent pancreatic resection for histologically proven IPMN between 2004 and 2017. Collected data included patient demographic characteristics, preoperative symptoms, radiological findings, and laboratory data.

Results

Main pancreatic duct (MPD) dilatation was the only variable that was significantly associated with increased probability of malignancy (defined high-dysplasia or invasion) on both univariate and multivariate analysis. Even middle-range MPD dilatation from 5 mm to 9.9mm (n = 286) was associated with increased odds of HG-IPMN (OR = 2.74; 95% CI = 1.80–4.16) and invasion (OR = 4.42; 95% CI = 2.55–7.66). MPD dilatation > 10mm (n = 150) had even greater odds of HG-IPMN (OR = 6.57; 95% CI = 3.94–10.98) and invasion (OR = 15.07; 95% CI = 8.21–27.65). A cutoff of 5 to 7mm MPD diameter was determined to be the best predictor to discriminate between malignant and benign lesions.

Conclusions

In agreement with current IPMN management guidelines, we found MPD dilatation, even low levels from 5mm to 9.9mm, to be the single best predictor of HG-IPMN or invasion, highlighting the critical role that MPD plays in the selection of surgical candidates.

### Surveillance of pancreatic branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm… [^114Cmofq]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

eTable 1. Comparison Between Benign and Malignant Lesions in the Surgery Cohort Data Sharing Statement IPMN indicates intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Question What is the optimal surveillance interval of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas, and who would be a candidate for discontinuation of surveillance. Findings In this cohort study of 3656 patients with branch duct IPMN, optimal surveillance was associated with cyst growth and malignant conversion rates based on cyst size. For patients with cysts smaller than 20 mm and showing no morphologic changes during the initial 5-year surveillance period, surveillance could be discontinued for those unfit for surgery or with a life expectancy of 10 years or less. Objective To determine the optimal surveillance protocol for IPMN and propose which patients may be exempted from surveillance. Design, Setting, and Participants.

Exposure The patients with BD-IPMN were followed up based on International Association of Pancreatology guidelines. Patients with suspicious malignant neoplasms during surveillance underwent surgical resection. Main Outcome and Measures The main outcome of this study was the optimal follow-up interval and duration of BD-IPMN surveillance. The association among cyst size, growth rate, and progression was examined using descriptive statistics. Furthermore, several recommendations for surveillance are based on other benign pancreatic cysts in addition to BD-IPMN, thus underestimating the diagnosis of malignant IPMN. 1, 7–9 The aim of our study was to evaluate the natural history of BD-IPMN and recommend an optimal follow-up interval and duration using a large international surveillance cohort. Branch duct IPMN was diagnosed when typical features, including a pleomorphic shape, clubbed or finger-like appearance, and definite pancreatic ductal communication, were observed on imaging.

10 Most patients underwent CT and MRI during surveillance. Endoscopic ultrasonography was performed to evaluate suspicious mural nodules or cyst wall thickening for patients with WFs. In this cohort study, we found that the clinical significance of IPMN lies in its malignant conversion potential. With increasing prevalence of IPMN, establishing an appropriate management protocol is more important than ever. The malignant conversion rate of BD-IPMN has been reported to be approximately 30%, but this may be an overestimation as it mostly comes from studies of patients who underwent resection. 2–6, 11, 12 If patients who underwent surveillance without resection were to be included, the malignant conversion rate should be lower.

### Experience with 208 resections for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas… [^114THW7G]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

The prevalence of a malignant neoplasm was 64% in patients with main duct IPMN compared with 18% in patients with branch duct IPMN. Re-resection of the initial pancreatic margin was necessary in 21% of patients. Final negative margins were achieved in 89% of patients. Five-year survival with noninvasive IPMN was 94%. Radiographically, patients were classified as having main duct IPMN, branch duct IPMN, or mixed-type IPMN. The prevalence of a malignant neoplasm within the operative specimen in patients with main duct IPMN was 64% compared with 38% in mixed-type IPMN and 18% in branch duct IPMN. In the 15 patients with a malignant neoplasm and branch duct IPMN, the radiographic diameter of the IPMN lesion was between 1. 1 and
8. 0 cm.

All of these patients had IPMN-related symptoms, a solid mass or mural nodule, or main pancreatic duct or common bile duct dilation that prompted operative intervention. When comparing the 63 patients with invasive IPMN with the 541 patients who underwent pancreatectomy for ductal adenocarcinoma during the same observation period, a greater prevalence of stage IA carcinoma was found in the IPMN group. Like others, we found a much greater prevalence of malignancy with IPMN that involved the main duct compared with the branch duct. 2, 7 We also identified the presence of nodules and symptoms of jaundice and weight loss as predictors of malignancy in the overall group, as well as in those with branch duct IPMN. Fine-needle aspiration cytology had limited efficacy in differentiating benign from malignant IPMN.

In conclusion, our approach to patients with IPMN has evolved over time from recommending resection in all fit patients to a more selective approach with observation of low-risk, branch duct IPMN. The recommended operative approach changed from predominant use of total pancreatectomy to a targeted, anatomical pancreatectomy, resecting parts of the pancreas involved radiographically by the disease as guided by intraoperative frozen section histology.

### High incidence of extrapancreatic neoplasms in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms… [^112deYsh]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm is now a well-recognized entity in the pancreas and is being reported with increasing frequency. 1, 2 The tumor covers a broad histological spectrum, which ranges from adenoma to invasive carcinoma, and shows a variety of biological behaviors. 3 Moreover, IPMNs are believed to progress slowly showing a spectrum of neoplastic transformations and are characterized by a more favorable prognosis than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, even in malignant cases. 1–6. Of the 61 patients with IPMN, 24 developed 26 extrapancreatic neoplasms, and 18 had other extrapancreatic malignancies. The stomach, colorectum, and thyroid gland were the organs most frequently involved in IPMN-associated neoplasms, which developed in 9, 6, and 3 patients, respectively.

In recent years, IPMNs have been receiving more attention because of their favorable prognosis and pathogenesis, and because of their relationships with PDAC and its variants. 8, 9 The IPMN is believed to be an important precursor of invasive carcinoma of the pancreas and may progress through a hyperplasia-adenoma-carcinoma sequence. 10–12 However, the slowly progressing features and genetic changes involved in this progression are distinct from those of conventional ductal adenocarcinoma. Genetic or epigenetic changes associated with the progression of IPMNs may play a role in the development of other primary neoplasms, especially of gastrointestinal tract cancers. The carcinogenesis of IPMNs and colorectal adenomatous polyps are thought to be similar in that they follow a pattern of progression from adenoma to dysplasia and eventually to invasive cancer.

Results of the present study concur with those of earlier studies that found that IPMNs are associated with a high incidence of neoplasms in organs other than pancreas. 7 Considerable attention should be paid to patients with IPMN for the possible occurrence of other cancers, especially gastrointestinal tract cancers, which can affect the long-term survival of the patients. Further molecular studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanism of extrapancreatic neoplasm development in patients with IPMN. We believe that IPMN offers an attractive model for investigating the cause of human carcinogenesis.
