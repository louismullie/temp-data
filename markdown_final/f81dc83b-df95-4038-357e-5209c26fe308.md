## Question

Black furry tounge

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about black furry tongue, including what it is, how it presents, what causes it, how to diagnose it, what to treat it with, and what the prognosis looks like. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct terminology and core definition. Then, I should verify the clinical appearance and symptoms. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology and histology. After that, I need to review etiologies and risk factors, including medications and systemic contributors. Then, I should construct a practical diagnostic approach and differential. Finally, I will outline evidence-based treatment, prognosis, and patient counseling, making sure I double-check any claims against high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislabel the entity. "Black furry tongue" is a lay description of black hairy tongue, also called hairy tongue or lingua villosa nigra, which is a benign condition characterized by elongation and hypertrophy of filiform papillae with discoloration and often bacterial or fungal overgrowth on the dorsal tongue surface [^115uMxBn] [^112ULp4W].

> I will now examine the clinical presentation to anchor recognition. Classically, the dorsal tongue shows a dark discoloration — most often black, but brown, yellow, green, or blue hues occur — with hair-like projections that can reach several millimeters in length; patients are frequently asymptomatic aside from cosmetic concern, though some report halitosis, a tickling or gagging sensation, or altered taste, and the condition is often discovered incidentally during oral examination [^115uMxBn] [^112ULp4W].

> Wait, let me verify the histopathology so I don't overgeneralize. Histologically, the filiform papillae are markedly elongated and hyperkeratotic, often with dense accumulations of bacteria and sometimes Candida on the surface; this keratinized, matted appearance explains the "hair-like" macroscopic look and the propensity for pigment trapping or microbial coloration [^115uMxBn] [^112ULp4W].

> Next, I should review etiologies and risk factors, and I need to be careful to separate strong associations from weaker ones. Poor oral hygiene, smoking, and heavy alcohol use are consistently implicated; age and male sex are common demographic correlates, though the condition can occur at any age and in any sex; dietary factors such as low fiber intake and soft diets may contribute; and numerous medications have been reported, notably antibiotics (tetracyclines, penicillins, amoxicillin-clavulanate), bismuth-containing agents, antipsychotics, and others, with FDA labeling explicitly listing black hairy tongue for several of these agents [^113EaGwu] [^112ULp4W] [^112rRJKo] [^117GPZYB] [^112CW8rW] [^112CiFhu] [^115AfFfK] [^111aovha].

> Hold on, I should verify the mechanism for bismuth-related darkening so I don't conflate it with keratin elongation. Bismuth subsalicylate can cause harmless darkening of the tongue via bismuth sulfide formation, which is a surface pigment change rather than papillary hypertrophy; this is distinct from classic hairy tongue pathophysiology but can mimic it visually, and it resolves after discontinuation [^115AfFfK] [^111aovha] [^114pEYKa].

> Let me consider the diagnostic approach, and I should double-check that I'm not missing a masquerader. Diagnosis is clinical, based on the characteristic appearance and history; key elements include onset and duration, tobacco and alcohol exposure, medication review including antibiotics, bismuth, and psychotropics, and assessment of oral hygiene practices; the differential includes exogenous pigment deposition, oral hairy leukoplakia, geographic tongue, candidiasis, and neoplastic or vascular lesions, with features like white, nonremovable lateral tongue plaques favoring hairy leukoplakia and migratory, annular, depapillated patches suggesting geographic tongue; biopsy is rarely needed unless the diagnosis is uncertain or atypical features are present [^114fpUEX] [^113EaGwu] [^112ULp4W].

> I should confirm the treatment strategy and make sure I'm aligning with evidence. First-line management focuses on removing precipitating factors and improving oral hygiene: stop smoking, reduce alcohol, discontinue offending drugs when feasible, and institute daily tongue hygiene with a toothbrush or tongue scraper; for symptomatic patients or when overgrowth is prominent, short courses of topical antifungals or antiseptic rinses may be used, though high-quality randomized data are limited; most cases resolve over weeks to months with conservative measures, and recurrence is common if risk factors persist [^112ULp4W] [^113EaGwu] [^114fpUEX].

> But wait, what if halitosis is prominent and driving distress; I need to check whether adjuncts help. Mechanical debridement of the tongue reduces bacterial load and volatile sulfur compounds, and zinc-containing rinses or dentifrices can neutralize odors; evidence certainty varies, but expert guidelines endorse these measures for physiological halitosis, which fits the scenario of bacterial overgrowth on elongated papillae [^117M49X3] [^111LhgSo].

> I should review prognosis and counseling so expectations are realistic. Black hairy tongue is benign and self-limited with risk-factor modification and tongue hygiene; discoloration typically fades within weeks to a few months, though papillary elongation may take longer to normalize; patients should be reassured about the nonmalignant nature and counseled on maintenance strategies to prevent recurrence, including ongoing tongue care and moderation of tobacco, alcohol, and certain medications when possible [^112ULp4W] [^113EaGwu] [^114fpUEX].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is precise: black hairy tongue reflects elongation and discoloration of filiform papillae with possible microbial overgrowth, is usually asymptomatic beyond appearance or halitosis, is diagnosed clinically with attention to exposures and oral care, and responds to conservative hygiene and removal of precipitants; it is benign, reversible, and warrants reassurance rather than alarm, with biopsy reserved for atypical or uncertain cases [^115uMxBn] [^112ULp4W] [^114fpUEX].

Black hairy tongue is a **benign, self-limited** condition characterized by elongated filiform papillae and black or dark discoloration on the dorsal tongue [^115uMxBn]. It is most often due to poor oral hygiene, smoking, or certain medications (notably antibiotics, bismuth, and antipsychotics) [^112ULp4W] [^112rRJKo] [^115AfFfK] [^112ULp4W]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, based on appearance and history; no biopsy is needed unless the diagnosis is uncertain [^114fpUEX]. Management is straightforward: improve oral hygiene with gentle tongue brushing or scraping, stop smoking, and discontinue offending drugs when possible [^112ULp4W] [^113EaGwu]. Prognosis is excellent, with resolution in weeks to months; complications are rare, though halitosis or taste disturbance may occur [^112ULp4W] [^113EaGwu].

---

## Clinical features

- **Appearance**: Elongated, hair-like filiform papillae (up to 1–2 mm) with black or dark brown discoloration on the dorsal tongue; colors may vary (brown, yellow, green, white) depending on exogenous factors [^115uMxBn].

- **Symptoms**: Usually asymptomatic; some report halitosis, bad taste, gagging, or nausea from the elongated papillae [^115uMxBn] [^116U7rq3].

- **Distribution**: Typically involves the posterior dorsal tongue, sparing the tip and lateral borders [^notfound].

## Etiology and risk factors

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Poor oral hygiene | - Infrequent or inadequate tongue cleaning <br/> - Denture wearers <br/> - Hospitalized or institutionalized patients [^112ULp4W] [^113FukMs] |
| Tobacco use | - Smoking <br/> - Chewing tobacco <br/> - Pipe smoking [^112ULp4W] [^113EaGwu] |
| Medications | - Antibiotics (tetracyclines, penicillins, amoxicillin-clavulanate) <br/> - Bismuth subsalicylate <br/> - Antipsychotics (haloperidol, olanzapine) <br/> - Proton pump inhibitors <br/> - Chemotherapy agents [^112rRJKo] [^112CW8rW] [^115AfFfK] [^114ku1Uj] [^116p2vYz] [^114Wc6dv] |
| Dietary factors | - Soft diets <br/> - Coffee <br/> - Tea <br/> - Alcohol [^113EaGwu] [^112ULp4W] |
| Systemic conditions | - Diabetes <br/> - HIV/AIDS <br/> - Immunocompromised states [^112ULp4W] |

---

## Pathophysiology

Pathophysiology involves **hypertrophy and elongation** of filiform papillae due to reduced desquamation, with keratin accumulation and surface discoloration from exogenous pigments (tobacco, food, medications) and microbial overgrowth (bacteria, Candida) [^115uMxBn] [^112ULp4W].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is **clinical**, based on characteristic appearance and history; no biopsy is needed unless the diagnosis is uncertain or malignancy is suspected [^114fpUEX]. Differential diagnosis includes oral hairy leukoplakia, geographic tongue, candidiasis, and melanocytic lesions [^114fpUEX] [^112ULp4W].

---

## Management

- **Oral hygiene**: Gentle daily tongue brushing or scraping with a soft toothbrush or tongue scraper; avoid harsh mouthwashes (e.g. peroxide, phenol) that may irritate [^112ULp4W] [^113EaGwu].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Smoking cessation, limit coffee/tea/alcohol, maintain hydration [^113EaGwu] [^112ULp4W].

- **Medication review**: Discontinue or substitute offending agents when feasible [^112ULp4W].

- **Adjunctive measures**: Consider diluted baking soda rinses or low-concentration hydrogen peroxide rinses if hygiene alone is insufficient [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **excellent**; most cases resolve within weeks to months with conservative care, though recurrence is common if risk factors persist [^112ULp4W]. Complications are rare; halitosis, taste disturbance, and psychological distress may occur, and superinfection with Candida is possible but uncommon [^116U7rq3] [^112ULp4W].

---

## Prevention

Prevention centers on **regular tongue hygiene**, smoking cessation, moderation of staining foods and drinks, and prudent use of medications with known associations, with patient education on benignity and reversibility to reduce anxiety [^113EaGwu] [^112ULp4W].

---

Black hairy tongue is a **benign, reversible** condition with a characteristic appearance and straightforward management; addressing hygiene and modifiable risks leads to rapid improvement and low recurrence when maintained.

### Black hairy tongue: predisposing factors, diagnosis, and treatment [^112ULp4W]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Black hairy tongue (BHT) is a benign condition commonly found among people who smoke, have poor oral hygiene, are immunocompromised, or have a medical condition limiting their ability to practice good oral hygiene. Though this condition is harmless, patients need to be educated on etiology as many common medications are associated with this condition. Patients being placed on certain antibiotics or antipsychotics should be educated on the importance of good oral hygiene or cessation of habits that promote BHT. Similarly, those with medical conditions increasing the risk for the development of BHT should schedule routine visits with their dentist or dental hygienist. Prognosis is good, and treatment consists of gentle brushing of the tongue, but many anecdotal reports exist demonstrating the use of medications or other products to treat this condition. This review addresses the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, etiology, histology, differential diagnosis, and treatment of BHT and lists all of the medications reported to cause this condition.

### Common tongue conditions in primary care [^114fpUEX]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Tongue conditions occur in 15.5% of the US population. The most common tongue conditions are geographic tongue, fissured tongue, and black hairy tongue; these conditions do not require treatment. Median rhomboid glossitis can be associated with a candidal infection; symptomatic lesions usually improve with use of antifungals. Atrophic glossitis is often linked to a nutritional deficiency and resolves with treatment of the underlying condition. Oral hairy leukoplakia is caused by Epstein-Barr virus and most often presents in patients with severely compromised immunity; it can be treated with oral antivirals. Growths of the tongue usually require biopsy to differentiate benign lesions (eg, traumatic fibromas, squamous cell papillomas) from leukoplakia and squamous cell carcinoma. Referral to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, otolaryngologist, or a dentist experienced in oral pathology may be indicated. Burning mouth syndrome often involves the tongue, and if it does not resolve spontaneously, studies have shown improvement with gabapentin, topical clonazepam, capsaicin, and cognitive behavior therapy. Oral lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect the tongue and is best treated with topical or systemic corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. There is a lack of consensus on the definition and treatment of ankyloglossia (tongue-tie); however, some evidence supports that frenotomy can improve breastfeeding and decrease lactation-associated nipple pain.

### DOXYCYCLINE capsule… [^111YE2MG]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Doxycycline is indicated for the treatment of the following infections: Rocky mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox, and tick fevers caused by Rickettsiae. Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis, doxycycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne, doxycycline may be useful adjunctive therapy.
- CONTRAINDICATIONS WARNINGS. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH. This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported.

TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THIS AGE GROUP, EXCEPT FOR ANTHRAX, INCLUDING INHALATIONAL ANTHRAX, UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function.

Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.

### Burning mouth syndrome [^114q4GRB]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Pain in the tongue or oral tissues described as "burning" has been referred to by many terms including burning mouth syndrome. When a burning sensation in the mouth is caused by local or systemic factors, it is called secondary burning mouth syndrome and when these factors are treated the pain will resolve. When burning mouth syndrome occurs in the absence of identified risk indicators, the term primary burning mouth syndrome is utilized. This article focuses on descriptions, etiologic theories, and management of primary burning mouth syndrome, a condition for which underlying causative agents have been ruled out.

### Melanoderma: uncommon presentation of a common condition [^117UvzKc]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 64-year-old man presented with blackish pigmentation of skin and tongue for more than 2years that did not improve with local remedies. He had no history of comorbid medical or surgical illnesses. General examination showed severe hyperpigmentation of skin and mucosa and also showed anaemia. Systemic examination was unremarkable except for Romberg sign and mild hyperreflexia. Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out by normal cortisol levels and haemogram showed macrocytosis with hypersegmented neutrophils suggestive of severe vitamin B12 deficiency which confirmed by low serum B12 levels. After 3months of parenteral vitamin B12 treatment, the pigmentation and anaemia improved significantly. The mechanism of hyperpigmentation due to B12 deficiency is postulated to be increased melanin deposition in the basal layer of the epidermis. Since vitamin B12 deficiency is not uncommonly encountered in general practice, atypical presentation of this easily diagnosable and treatable condition is emphasised.

### Black tongue secondary to bismuth subsalicylate: case report and review of exogenous causes of macular lingual pigmentation [^111uskzg]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Macular pigmentation of the tongue can be acquired following exposure to exogenous agents. Black lingual hyperpigmentation was observed during the full body skin examination of a man with a history of recurrent metastatic malignant melanoma. His tongue spontaneously returned to its normal pink color later that day. Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) was suspected as the pigment-inducing agent; subsequently, re-challange with the antacid confirmed it to be the cause of his acquired, albeit transient, black tongue. The ingestion of medications, including other antacids, analgesics, antidepressants, antihypertensives and several antimicrobials has been associated with the development of acquired macular lingual pigmentation. In addition, hyperpigmentation of the tongue has been observed following the deposition of amalgam and the injection of local anesthesia or doxorubicin or interferon alpha and ribavirin. Also, inhalation of heroin and methaqualone vapors or tobacco has resulted in lingual hyperpigmentation. All of the patients with acquired macular lingual hyperpigmentation had tongues with a smooth surface without enlargement of the filiform papillae. Many of the individuals with hyperpigmented tongue had either black or dark skin color. The onset of tongue pigmentation varied from less than one day to several years after initial exposure to the associated exogenous agent. The color of the tongue usually returned to normal after the pigment-inducing agent was discontinued.

### Burning red tongue with grooves [^1123cx92]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

A 75-year-old man presented with a 3-week history of a burning red tongue. The patient had no significant medical history and was on no medications. He did not smoke or drink alcohol and followed a normal diet. Examination found an erythematous tongue with deep grooves running along the dorsum of the tongue in a symmetrical pattern associated with a lack of papillae (Fig 1). There were no ulcers or white patches, and there was no angular cheilitis. Laboratory results showed no signs of anemia, normal iron studies, and vitamin B12 and were negative for HIV.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Geographic tongue
B. Strawberry tongue
C. Fissured tongue
D. Geometric glossitis
E. Median rhomboid glossitis

Answers:
A. Geographic tongue – Incorrect. Geographic tongue, or benign migratory glossitis, is characterized by patches of papillary atrophy surrounded by raised white borders. These patches change in shape and size and move across the surface of the tongue over time.
B. Strawberry tongue – Incorrect. Strawberry tongue presents with enlarged lingual papillae, not a lack of papillae. Strawberry tongue has a white coating, whereas red strawberry tongue has a dark red surface.
C. Fissured tongue – Correct. Fissured (also known as scrotal) tongue presents with deep grooves on the dorsum of the tongue that are usually painless, although some patients do report a burning sensation. This patient also has idiopathic atrophic glossitis, which results in the tongue having a smooth and glossy appearance.
D. Geometric glossitis – Incorrect. Also known as herpetic geometric glossitis, the tongue will present with linear fissures on the dorsal tongue, especially with a fissure down the center. However, the lesions are very tender and painful and are associated with immunocompromised patients with HSV-1.
E. Median rhomboid glossitis – Incorrect. Only a rhomboidal portion of the central dorsal tongue is depapillated in median rhomboid glossitis, as opposed to total depapillation. It is commonly associated with oral candidiasis.

Question 2: Which of the following is associated with fissured tongue?
A. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome
B. Reactive arthritis
C. Broad-spectrum antibiotics
D. Smoking/tobacco use
E. Chewing trauma to the tongue

Answers:
A. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome – Correct. Although fissured tongue is most commonly idiopathic, especially in older patients, it is also associated with a number of diseases. Along with Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, other common associations include Down syndrome, Sjogren syndrome, Cowden syndrome, acromegaly, and psoriasis.
B. Reactive arthritis – Incorrect. Geographic tongue, not fissured tongue, can occur in association with reactive arthritis. The exact cause of geographic tongue is unknown, although it does display a familial tendency.
C. Broad-spectrum antibiotics – Incorrect. Antibiotic and topical steroid use is associated with acute atrophic candidiasis, in which there is desquamation, erythematous patches, and a strong burning sensation. Antifungal agents act as appropriate therapy.
D. Smoking/tobacco use – Incorrect. Tobacco use is associated with hairy tongue, in which excess keratin collects on the lingual papillae, thus creating long hair-like strands. Daily gentle scraping will remove the excess keratin.
E. Chewing trauma to the tongue – Incorrect. Chewing trauma is not associated with fissured tongue. This trauma normally occurs on the lateral edges of the tongue and can be associated with linea alba, which is a thin white line of thickened epithelium at the site of the trauma.

### The color of skin: blue diseases of the skin, nails, and mucosa [^116NUG3b]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Diseases of the skin, hair, nails and mucosa can appear as flesh-colored lesions or may present as any of the colors of the visual spectrum. Diseases associated with blue (or shades of blue) discoloration represent a unique group of conditions that occur de novo or as a reaction to either a topical or a systemic agent to which the individual has been exposed. Blue diseases can affect the skin, the nails or the mucosal membranes of the mouth (buccal mucosa, gingiva, lips, palate or tongue) or eyes (sclera). In addition to appearing blue, they can also appear as blue-black, blue-brown, blue-gray, blue-green, blue-purple, blue-red, and blue-silver. The conditions range from those secondary to exogenous agents (systemic or tattoo or topical) to syndromes to systemic diseases to tumors (adnexal, melanocytic, vascular, or miscellaneous). A comprehensive attempt to include all conditions that have been described as blue (or a shade of blue) has been performed by evaluating the following terms using the medical search engine PubMed: blue and either gingiva, lips, lunula, mucosa, nails, oral, palate, sclera, skin, or tongue. Subsequently, the conditions were organized by color (blue and shades of blue) and within each color by location (skin, nails, oral mucosa and sclera). The results are presented in organized tables; in addition, there is discussion of some of the conditions that are unique to one or more specific locations. In conclusion, 'preserve and cherish the pale blue dot' and remember that a big red rock eater with chrysiasis is the answer to the riddle, "What is big and blue and eats rocks?"

### Benign migratory glossitis or geographic tongue: an enigmatic oral lesion [^1152u1cd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Benign migratory glossitis, or geographic tongue, is usually an asymptomatic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that affects the epithelium of the tongue. Local loss of filiform papillae leads to ulcer-like lesions that rapidly change the color and size. Histopathologic findings parallel the clinical appearance, and may have a psoriasiform pattern. The disorder is characterized by exacerbations and remissions. In most cases, patients do not require treatment other than reassurance about the benign nature of the disorder.

Question 3: Which of the following is associated with atrophic glossitis?
A. Use of corticosteroid spray
B. Celiac disease
C. Scarlet fever
D. Epstein-Barr virus
E. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome

Answers:
A. Use of corticosteroid spray – Incorrect. Use of corticosteroid sprays and inhalers are both associated with median rhomboid glossitis. Other associations include smoking, wearing of dentures, HIV infection, and chronic Candida infection.
B. Celiac disease – Correct. Celiac disease, Sjogren syndrome, and sarcoidosis are all associated with atrophic glossitis. Other common underlying conditions associated with atrophic glossitis include nutritional deficiencies (iron, folic acid, vitamin B 12, riboflavin, niacin), alcoholism, iron deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia, xerostomia, and infection (systemic or local).
C. Scarlet fever – Incorrect. Scarlet fever, from a group A streptococcus infection, is associated with strawberry tongue. Over the course of a few days, the tongue progresses from white strawberry tongue to red.
D. Epstein-Barr virus – Incorrect. Epstein-Barr virus is associated with oral hairy leukoplakia. White lesions with a hairy appearance will appear on the lateral margins of the tongue.
E. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome – Incorrect. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a cause of macroglossia, or enlarged tongue. Macroglossia can be congenital or acquired, and a tongue that is out of proportion to jaw size will be seen.

### Melanotic macules of the tongue in a newborn [^111HmZra]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

A newborn had 3 blue-black macules on the left side of the dorsal tongue. Clinical diagnosis was difficult. A biopsy specimen showed focal increase of melanin in the basal cells and subepithelial melanophages. The persistence of the lesions was unchanged at the age of 6 months, and the histologic features led to the diagnosis of oral physiologic melanosis.

### Hairy tongue… [^115uMxBn]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The entity known as hairy tongue was first described more than a century ago. It begins without subjective symptoms and is frequently discovered by accident. It is characterized by an area of dark discoloration — usually the color is black, but shades of brown, yellow, blue, and green have been described — covered with hair-like processes on the dorsal surface of the tongue. Histologically, the filiform papillae are hypertrophied and are the origin of hair-like filaments, which may grow as long as one-half inch. The papillae become densely matted and may be covered by accumulations of bacteria and molds. The filamentous proliferation has been compared to "the hair of a dog dampened by water. "1 In most instances the condition is asymptomatic, patients complaining only of the appearance of the tongue; in other instances, patients have been annoyed by tickling sensations or gagging produced by the elongated papillae. Considerable controversy exists with respect to HAIRY TONGUE. JAMA.

### Oxacillin sodium (oxacillin) [^111han7H]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Body as a Whole

The reported incidence of allergic reactions to penicillin ranges from 0.7 to 10 percent (see WARNINGS). Sensitization is usually the result of treatment but some individuals have had immediate reactions when first treated. In such cases, it is thought that the patients may have had prior exposure to the drug via trace amounts present in milk and vaccines.

Two types of allergic reactions to penicillins are noted clinically, immediate and delayed.

Immediate reactions usually occur within 20 minutes of administration and range in severity from urticaria and pruritus to angioneurotic edema, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, hypotension, vascular collapse and death. Such immediate anaphylactic reactions are very rare (see WARNINGS) and usually occur after parenteral therapy but have occurred in patients receiving oral therapy. Another type of immediate reaction, an accelerated reaction, may occur between 20 minutes and 48 hours after administration and may include urticaria, pruritus, and fever. Although laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, and hypotension occasionally occur, fatality is uncommon.

Delayed allergic reactions to penicillin therapy usually occur after 48 hours and sometimes as late as 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of therapy.

Manifestations of this type of reaction include serum sickness-like symptoms (i.e., fever, malaise, urticaria, myalgia, arthralgia, abdominal pain) and various skin rashes. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, black or hairy tongue, and other symptoms of gastrointestinal irritation may occur, especially during oral penicillin therapy.

### Penicillin V potassium [^112CiFhu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Although the incidence of reactions to oral penicillins has been reported with much less frequency than following parenteral therapy, it should be remembered that all degrees of hypersensitivity, including fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported with oral penicillin.

The most common reactions to oral penicillin are nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, diarrhea, and black hairy tongue. The hypersensitivity reactions reported are skin eruptions (maculopapular to exfoliative dermatitis), urticaria and other serum-sickness like reactions, laryngeal edema, and anaphylaxis.

Fever and eosinophilia may frequently be the only reaction observed. Hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, and nephropathy are infrequent reactions and usually associated with high doses of parenteral penicillin.

### Jet-black eschar [^114x3chW]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

At first glance, the baby appeared healthy. She was pudgy, pink-cheeked, and impeccably clean and rested quietly in the mother's arms — until we disturbed her; then she cried with the weary wail of an infant hurting for days.

"This one came first", said the mother, pointing to a quarter-sized red, swollen nodule to the right of the baby's spine. Embedded in its center was a jet-black eschar the size of a pea. I prodded the edge of the nodule; the baby curled her legs, buried her head in the mother's shirt, and screamed. "There are more", continued the mother, a pretty young woman with an anxious expression, pointing at the other nodules — one on the occiput, one on the labia majora, one on the left upper chest. Two of these also had black eschars.

Our first questions were routine and probably anticipated by the mother: When did the fever start? How high had the fever been? When did the lumps appear? What medicines had the baby received? The mother carefully answered each question, underscoring her responses with layers of detail, struggling to remain composed. As she spoke, each word, each gesture, each facial expression carried an air of earnestness, reinforcing her belief that the answers would help make the baby well again. While the mother gently rocked back and forth in the examining-room chair, the infant clung to her chest as fiercely as a wide-eyed baby lemur clings to his mother's furry belly.

The questions that followed were more circumspect and, to the mother, probably puzzling and far removed from the immediate problem of her feverish baby with the lumps. Still, she answered each one completely, dragging information out of her memory as if it were buried treasure. How much did the baby weigh at birth? What was her medical history? Had anyone at home been ill? Where had she traveled?

### Black tongue discoloration… [^112bqmy1]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

An 80-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of fever and right shoulder pain. His temperature was 37. 9 °C; heart rate, 74/min; and blood pressure, 90/49 mm Hg. He had tenderness to palpation and decreased range of motion of his right shoulder. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 9. 6 × 109/L; C-reactive protein level,
35. 6 mg/dL, and creatine kinase level, 1036 U/L. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an effusion and synovial thickening with enhancement in the right shoulder joint and inflammation in the right subscapularis muscle. Gram stain of the synovial fluid revealed gram-positive cocci in clusters. Intravenous cefazolin therapy was initiated, and he underwent right shoulder joint arthroscopic irrigation, synovectomy, and surgical drainage for subscapularis pyomyositis.

Blood and synovial fluid cultures grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and intravenous cefazolin was continued. One week after hospitalization, the patient developed asymptomatic black discoloration of the dorsal surface of his tongue. He reported no prior lingual discoloration and did not smoke cigarettes, use chewing tobacco or illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. Kano Y. Black Tongue Discoloration. JAMA. 2023; 329: 1875–1876.

The reported incidence of allergic reactions to penicillin ranges from 0.7 to 10 percent (see WARNINGS). Sensitization is usually the result of treatment, but some individuals have had immediate reactions to penicillin when first treated. In such cases, it is thought that the patients may have had prior exposure to the drug via trace amounts present in milk or vaccines. Two types of allergic reactions to penicillins are noted clinically, immediate and delayed.

Immediate reactions usually occur within 20 minutes of administration and range in severity from urticaria and pruritus to angioedema, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, hypotension, vascular collapse, and death. Such immediate anaphylactic reactions are very rare (see WARNINGS) and usually occur after parenteral therapy but have occurred in patients receiving oral therapy. Another type of immediate reaction, an accelerated reaction, may occur between 20 minutes and 48 hours after administration and may include urticaria, pruritus, and fever.

Although laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, and hypotension occasionally occur, fatality is uncommon. Delayed allergic reactions to penicillin therapy usually occur after 48 hours and sometimes as late as 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of therapy. Manifestations of this type of reaction include serum sickness-like symptoms (i.e., fever, malaise, urticaria, myalgia, arthralgia, abdominal pain) and various skin rashes. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, black or hairy tongue, and other symptoms of gastrointestinal irritation may occur, especially during oral penicillin therapy.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of AUGMENTIN products, including AUGMENTIN ES-600. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Gastrointestinal: Drug-induced enterocolitis syndrome (DIES), diarrhe, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, gastritis, stomatitis, glossitis, black "hairy" tongue, mucocutaneous candidiasis, enterocolitis, and hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Systematic review of APGAR scores&cyanosis in black, Asian, and ethnic minority infants [^112juebh]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

This systematic review included 10 observational studies that considered cyanosis or Apgar score assessment and their association with neonatal wellbeing in Black, Asian, or ethnic minority neonates compared to White neonates. Three studies showed Black neonates have lower neonatal mortality rates at low Apgar score than their White counterparts. However, they were also more likely to receive a low Apgar score. Detection of cyanosis was poor for all ethnicities, with the tongue and lips the best places to observe. When using pulse oximetry, occult hypoxia was more likely in Black neonates although this did not reach significance. Only 9.1% of staff in one survey reported receiving adequate training around caring for ethnic minority babies.

### Amoxicillan [^113SECC9]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

As with other penicillins, it may be expected that untoward reactions will be essentially limited to sensitivity phenomena. They are more likely to occur in individuals who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to penicillins and in those with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever, or urticaria. The following adverse reactions have been reported as associated with the use of penicillins:

Infections and Infestations: Mucocutaneous candidiasis.

Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, black hairy tongue, and hemorrhagic/ pseudomembranous colitis.

Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment. (See WARNINGS section.)

Hypersensitivity Reactions: Anaphylaxis (See WARNINGS section)

Serum sickness-like reactions, erythematous maculopapular rashes, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, hypersensitivity vasculitis and urticaria have been reported.

NOTE: These hypersensitivity reactions may be controlled with antihistamines and, if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur, amoxicillin should be discontinued unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to amoxicillin therapy.

### Systematic review of APGAR scores&cyanosis in black, Asian, and ethnic minority infants [^116CsJPN]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Apgar score and cyanosis assessment may disadvantage darker-skinned babies. This review explored cyanosis and Apgar score assessments in Black, Asian, or minority ethnic neonates compared to White neonates.

Material and Methods

Four databases were searched. Studies of any methodology were included. A narrative synthesis was undertaken.

Results

Ten studies were included. Three studies involving over 39 million neonates showed Apgar score ≤ 3 was predictive of neonatal mortality across all ethnicities. Black babies with Apgar score ≤ 3 had lower mortality rates before 28 days, however, variations in scoring practices were also observed. Three further studies (n = 39,290,014) associated low Apgar scores with poorer mental development up to 22 months, especially in mixed ethnicity and Black infants. One study reported inadequate training in assessing ethnic minority neonates. Cyanosis was the focus of three included studies (n = 455) revealing poor visual assessment of cyanosis across ethnicities. With pulse oximetry occult hypoxemia occurred slightly more frequently in Black neonates. Tongue color indicated oxygen requirement at birth, regardless of ethnicity.

Conclusions

Apgar scores correlate well with neonatal mortality in all ethnicities, however scoring variations exist. Cyanosis assessment is challenging, with tongue and lips the best places to observe in the absence of pulse oximetry.

Impact

Assessment of the color component of the Apgar score and of cyanosis visually are not accurate in babies with darker skin. Small racial differences may exist for pulse oximetry in neonates, but it is more reliable than visual assessment.

### Brown patches and erosions with an erythematous base [^1116X4Dp]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Approximately how common is cutaneous-only pemphigus vulgaris?
A. 5% to 20% of pemphigus vulgaris cases
B. 25% to 50% of pemphigus vulgaris cases
C. 60% to 75% of pemphigus vulgaris cases
D. 75% to 85% of pemphigus vulgaris cases
E. 95% to 100% of pemphigus vulgaris cases

Answers:
A. 5% to 20% of pemphigus vulgaris cases – Incorrect. This percentage is too low.
B. 25% to 50% of pemphigus vulgaris cases – Correct. A 2015 study of the International Pemphigus and Pemphigoid Foundation registry demonstrated that at the time of study participation, 24.5% of pemphigus vulgaris patients reported cutaneous-only lesions. Furthermore, cutaneous-only pemphigus vulgaris has been described as a transient phenotype that emerges from, or progresses into, other clinical presentations of pemphigus. This transient presentation was also previously demonstrated by Sielski et al who reported that when evaluating 159 pemphigus vulgaris patients, 84 had cutaneous-only lesions, of whom only 7 reported no history of mucosal lesions. Interestingly, our patient developed a new mucosal erosion on the tip of tongue 6 weeks after the rash first started and following treatment initiation, emphasizing the importance of ongoing surveillance for mucosal involvement in any patient with pemphigus vulgaris presenting with cutaneous-only lesions.
C. 60% to 75% of pemphigus vulgaris cases – Incorrect. This percentage is too high.
D. 75% to 85% of pemphigus vulgaris cases – Incorrect. This percentage is too high.
E. 95% to 100% of pemphigus vulgaris cases – Incorrect. This percentage is too high.

### Halitosis [^116U7rq3]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Halitosis (oral malodor, bad breath) is a condition affecting millions of Americans and is a major concern to the general public. In healthy individuals complaining of bad breath, the mouth is the main source of their oral malodor, more specifically the posterior dorsum of the tongue. Halitosis may also indicate an underlying medical condition that necessitates treatment. In a patient with oral malodor for whom an underlying systemic problem has been ruled out, improved oral hygiene, removal of tongue plaque, and, if necessary, antibacterial mouth rinses are advised.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide [^1143dMXU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions:

Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious.

Head and Neck Angioedema:

Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx has been reported in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril. This may occur at any time during treatment. ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in black than in nonblack patients. Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide should be promptly discontinued and the appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. Even in those instances where swelling of only the tongue is involved, without respiratory distress, patients may require prolonged observation since treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids may not be sufficient. Very rarely, fatalities have been reported due to angioedema associated with laryngeal edema or tongue edema. Patients with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx are likely to experience airway obstruction, especially those with a history of airway surgery. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway, should be promptly provided (See ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy or a neprilysin inhibitor may be at increased risk for angioedema (see PRECAUTIONS).

Intestinal Angioedema:

Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain.

Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE-inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor (see also INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS).

### Common tongue conditions in primary care [^113Ha7D2]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although easily examined, abnormalities of the tongue can present a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma for physicians. Recognition and diagnosis require a thorough history, including onset and duration, antecedent symptoms, and tobacco and alcohol use. Examination of tongue morphology and a careful assessment for lymphadenopathy are also important. Geographic tongue, fissured tongue, and hairy tongue are the most common tongue problems and do not require treatment. Median rhomboid glossitis is usually associated with a candidal infection and responds to topical antifungals. Atrophic glossitis is often linked to an underlying nutritional deficiency of iron, folic acid, vitamin B12, riboflavin, or niacin and resolves with correction of the underlying condition. Oral hairy leukoplakia, which can be a marker for underlying immunodeficiency, is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus and is treated with oral antivirals. Tongue growths usually require biopsy to differentiate benign lesions (e.g., granular cell tumors, fibromas, lymphoepithelial cysts) from premalignant leukoplakia or squamous cell carcinoma. Burning mouth syndrome often involves the tongue and has responded to treatment with alpha-lipoic acid, clonazepam, and cognitive behavior therapy in controlled trials. Several trials have also confirmed the effectiveness of surgical division of tongue-tie (ankyloglossia), in the context of optimizing the success of breastfeeding compared with education alone. Tongue lesions of unclear etiology may require biopsy or referral to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, head and neck surgeon, or a dentist experienced in oral pathology.

### Glossitis and other tongue disorders [^113yoxxm]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Patients frequently present complaining of tongue abnormalities. Knowledge of normal tongue anaomy an d architecture enable the clinician t odifferentiate variations of normal from abnormal conditions. Many tongue conditions are benign and. require reassurance and explanation, with little to no treatment. Others can signify systemic disorders. Examination of the tongue is an integral part of a complete physical examination. Recognizing the disorders of the tongue that are benign and do not require treatment or further evaluation prevents unnecessary testing for the patient. Careful evaluation of the tongue may provide valuable clues to a systemic disorder.

### The color of skin: black diseases of the skin, nails, and mucosa [^1117LDo4]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Gradations in skin color are a consequence of differing amounts of melanin and their varying distribution. Although many darkly pigmented skin lesions are melanocytic and can be attributed to melanin content, the color of a black lesion can also be due to blood, necrotic tissue, or exogenous pigment. The source, pattern, and distribution of the color in black lesions usually offer important insight into its etiology. This contribution reviews conditions that can take on a black color, discussing the cause of the hue and any additional impact sun exposure may have.

### Transient infantile lingual leukoplakia: an underrecognized cause of white tongues in infancy [^113wumzC]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

We have observed a distinct phenomenon of transient oral lingual leukoplakia in infancy and report 22 healthy infants with gray-white plaques on the dorsal tongue with sparing of the tip from four medical centers in three countries. The onset of the eruption ranged from 1week to 7months of life and resolved in 19 patients (86%, with 3 patients lost to follow-up). None of the eight patients examined at 1year of age had residual findings. We believe this is a common entity that can be distinguished from oral candidiasis on clinical and/or laboratory examination and name this entity "transient infantile lingual leukoplakia".

Allergic: Skin rash; urticaria; photosensitization; edema of face and tongue.

Hematologic: Bone marrow depression including agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; purpura; eosinophilia.

Gastrointestinal: Rarely hepatitis (including altered liver function and jaundice); nausea; epigastric distress; vomiting; anorexia; stomatitis; peculiar taste; diarrhea; parotid swelling; black tongue.

Endocrine: Testicular swelling and gynecomastia in the male; breast enlargement and galactorrhea in the female; increased or decreased libido; impotence; elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels.

Other: Alopecia; edema; weight gain or loss; urinary frequency; increased perspiration.

Withdrawal Symptoms: After prolonged administration, abrupt cessation of treatment may produce nausea, headache, and malaise. Gradual dosage reductions have been reported to produce, within two weeks, transient symptoms including irritability, restlessness, and dream and sleep disturbance.

These symptoms are not indicative of addiction. Rare instances have been reported of mania or hypomania occurring within 2 to 7 days following cessation of chronic therapy with tricyclic antidepressants.

Causal Relationship Unknown: Other reactions, reported under circumstances where a causal relationship could not be established, are listed to serve as alerting information to physicians.

Body as a Whole: Lupus-like syndrome (migratory arthritis, positive ANA and rheumatoid factor).

Digestive: Hepatic failure, ageusia.

Postmarketing Adverse Events: A syndrome resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been very rarely reported after starting or increasing the dose of amitriptyline hydrochloride, with and without concomitant medications known to cause NMS. Symptoms have included muscle rigidity, fever, mental status changes, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and tremor.

Very rare cases of serotonin syndrome (SS) have been reported with amitriptyline hydrochloride in combination with other drugs that have a recognized association with SS.

Very rare cases of cardiomyopathy have been reported with amitriptyline.

### Pigmented fungiform papillae of the tongue [^1174BfXt]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Pigmented fungiform papillae of the tongue is a benign condition characterized by localized hyperpigmentation confined to fungiform papillae. Although the condition is not rare and might be easily diagnosed in dark-skinned adults and children, it is seldom mentioned in the medical literature. Here, we describe an 11-year-old boy presenting typical features of pigmented fungiform papillae of the tongue.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^114pEYKa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) prophylaxis — efficacy, dosing, duration, and cautions: BSS has been shown to reduce the frequency of TD when used during a period of risk for 3 weeks, and provides at least 60% protection at a dose of 2.1 g per day. The recommended regimen is two tablets four daily doses at mealtimes and at bedtime; when 2.1 and 1.05 g were given two times a day, protection fell to 41% and 35%, respectively. BSS has been shown to reduce TD if taken in proper daily dose for up to 3 weeks, but most authorities recommend chemoprophylaxis for trips up to 2 weeks and it should not be used for longer trips. Travelers should be warned that stools and tongues will turn black from a harmless bismuth sulfide salt, and persons with underlying inflammatory bowel disease or HIV infection should not receive BSS because of concern for excessive absorption leading to bismuth encephalopathy.

### Bilateral yellow plaques on the upper eyelids [^1172N54D]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is incorrect regarding this disorder?
A. Cutaneous findings found in approximately 40 percent of patients
B. Most common plasma cell dyscrasia associated with this disease is multiple myeloma
C. A large tongue (ie, macroglossia) is characteristic of this disorder
D. Periorbital purpura (raccoon eyes) is present in most patients
E. It may be directly associated with a bleeding diathesis

Answers:
A. Cutaneous findings found in approximately 40 percent of patients – Incorrect. Approximately 40 percent of patients with AL amyloidosis have cutaneous findings which may present before systemic disease providing early clues to diagnosis.
B. Most common plasma cell dyscrasia associated with this disease is multiple myeloma – Incorrect. Multiple myeloma is the most common plasma cell dyscrasia, followed by Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.
C. A large tongue is characteristic of this disorder – Incorrect. Macroglossia and lateral scalloping of the tongue from impingement on the teeth is characteristic of AL amyloidosis. Amyloid infiltration in skeletal muscle causes visible enlargement of the tongue.
D. Periorbital purpura (raccoon eyes) is present in most patients – Correct. Purpura, characteristically elicited in a periorbital distribution (raccoon eyes) by a Valsalva maneuver or minor trauma, is seen only in a minority of patients but is highly characteristic of AL amyloidosis.
E. It may be directly associated with a bleeding diathesis – Incorrect. Proposed mechanisms include factor X deficiency due to binding to amyloid fibrils primarily in the liver and spleen.

Halitosis

Terminology

Patients with genuine halitosis (i.e. objective evidence of malodour) can be subclassified into those with physiological halitosis (i.e. no evidence of underlying condition) and pathological halitosis (i.e. evidence of underlying condition).

Aetiology

Physiological halitosis is the most common type: the cause of physiological halitosis is the bacterial putrefaction of food debris, epithelial cells, blood cells and saliva within the oral cavity (and particularly on the posterior part of the dorsum of the tongue) and poor/limited oral hygiene. The cause of pathological halitosis may be an infection, inflammation or malignancy. In ~ 90% such cases, the source of the malodour is the oral cavity, but other potential sources include the upper respiratory tract (nose, sinuses), the lower respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract or a systemic metabolic problem.

Management

Management depends on the type of halitosis: in patients with physiological halitosis, it primarily involves oral hygiene measures, whilst in patients with pathological halitosis, it primarily involves treatment of the underlying cause (if possible), e.g. antibiotics for infections (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V).

The management of physiological halitosis includes (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V) (a) generic oral hygiene measures (see above); (b) avoidance of odorous foodstuffs (e.g. garlic, onions); (c) alcohol cessation; (d) smoking cessation; (e) measures to reduce bacterial numbers (e.g. tongue cleaning, chlorhexidine — mouthwash); (f) measures to reduce bacterial substrate (e.g. tongue cleaning, "professional" dental/periodontal cleaning) and (g) measures to convert offensive volatile sulphur compounds to inoffensive non-volatile compounds (e.g. zinc salts — toothpaste, mouthwash; sodium bicarbonate/baking soda – toothpaste). Many oral care products are available to manage halitosis, and those with specific properties (see above) should be prescribed in preference to those with simply "masking"/cosmetic properties (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). It should be noted that the evidence on managing halitosis in general is of limited quality.

### Perindopril erbumine (Aceon) [^113m3Ubt]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

5.1 Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions

Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including ACEON) may be subject to a variety of adverse events, some of them serious. Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to nonblacks.

Head and Neck Angioedema: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including ACEON (0.1% of patients treated with ACEON in U.S. clinical trials). Angioedema associated with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx may be fatal. In such cases, discontinue ACEON treatment immediately and observe until the swelling disappears. When involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx appears likely to cause airway obstruction, administer appropriate therapy, such as subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 to 0.5 mL), promptly.

Intestinal Angioedema: Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain.

### Quinapril hydrochloride (quinapril) [^116hSvFz]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions

Presumably because ACE inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including quinapril hydrochloride) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious.

Head and Neck Angioedema

Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors and has been seen in 0.1% of patients receiving quinapril hydrochloride.

In two similarly sized U.S. postmarketing trials that, combined, enrolled over 3,000 black patients and over 19,000 non-blacks, angioedema was reported in 0.3% and 0.55% of blacks (in study 1 and 2 respectively) and 0.39% and 0.17% of non-blacks.

Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, tongue, or glottis occurs, treatment with quinapril hydrochloride should be discontinued immediately, the patient treated in accordance with accepted medical care, and carefully observed until the swelling disappears. In instances where swelling is confined to the face and lips, the condition generally resolves without treatment; antihistamines may be useful in relieving symptoms. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx likely to cause airway obstruction, emergency therapy including, but not limited to, subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 to 0.5 mL) should be promptly administered (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### Interventions for managing halitosis [^111LhgSo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Halitosis or bad breath is a symptom in which a noticeably unpleasant breath odour is present due to an underlying oral or systemic disease. 50% to 60% of the world population has experienced this problem which can lead to social stigma and loss of self-confidence. Multiple interventions have been tried to control halitosis ranging from mouthwashes and toothpastes to lasers. This new Cochrane Review incorporates Cochrane Reviews previously published on tongue scraping and mouthrinses for halitosis.

Objectives

The objectives of this review were to assess the effects of various interventions used to control halitosis due to oral diseases only. We excluded studies including patients with halitosis secondary to systemic disease and halitosis-masking interventions.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 8 April 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 3) in the Cochrane Library (searched 8 April 2019), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 8 April 2019), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 8 April 2019). We also searched LILACS BIREME (1982 to 19 April 2019), the National Database of Indian Medical Journals (1985 to 19 April 2019), OpenGrey (1992 to 19 April 2019), and CINAHL EBSCO (1937 to 19 April 2019). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (8 April 2019), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (8 April 2019), the ISRCTN Registry (19 April 2019), the Clinical Trials Registry - India (19 April 2019), were searched for ongoing trials. We also searched the cross-references of included studies and systematic reviews published on the topic. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which involved adults over the age of 16, and any intervention for managing halitosis compared to another or placebo, or no intervention. The active interventions or controls were administered over a minimum of one week and with no upper time limit. We excluded quasi-randomised trials, trials comparing the results for less than one week follow-up, and studies including advanced periodontitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two pairs of review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We estimated mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 44 trials in the review with 1809 participants comparing an intervention with a placebo or a control. The age of participants ranged from 17 to 77 years. Most of the trials reported on short-term follow-up (ranging from one week to four weeks). Only one trial reported long-term follow-up (three months). Three studies were at low overall risk of bias, 16 at high overall risk of bias, and the remaining 25 at unclear overall risk of bias. We compared different types of interventions which were categorised as mechanical debridement, chewing gums, systemic deodorising agents, topical agents, toothpastes, mouthrinse/mouthwash, tablets, and combination methods. Mechanical debridement: for mechanical tongue cleaning versus no tongue cleaning, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported organoleptic test (OLT) scores (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.07; 2 trials, 46 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Chewing gums: for 0.6% eucalyptus chewing gum versus placebo chewing gum, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.11; 1 trial, 65 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Systemic deodorising agents: for 1000 mg champignon versus placebo, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome patient-reported visual analogue scale (VAS) scores (MD -1.07, 95% CI -14.51 to 12.37; 1 trial, 40 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for dentist-reported OLT score or adverse events. Topical agents: for hinokitiol gel versus placebo gel, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.27, 95% CI -1.26 to 0.72; 1 trial, 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Toothpastes: for 0.3% triclosan toothpaste versus control toothpaste, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -3.48, 95% CI -3.77 to -3.19; 1 trial, 81 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Mouthrinse/mouthwash: for mouthwash containing chlorhexidine and zinc acetate versus placebo mouthwash, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.18; 1 trial, 44 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Tablets: no data were reported on key outcomes for this comparison. Combination methods: for brushing plus cetylpyridium mouthwash versus brushing, the evidence was uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.48, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.24; 1 trial, 70 participants; low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low- to very low-certainty evidence to support the effectiveness of interventions for managing halitosis compared to placebo or control for the OLT and patient-reported outcomes tested. We were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the superiority of any intervention or concentration. Well-planned RCTs need to be conducted by standardising the interventions and concentrations.

### Systematic review of APGAR scores&cyanosis in black, Asian, and ethnic minority infants [^1138LYWp]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The second small study of 68 neonates explored whether supplemental oxygen requirement in the first 10 min after birth could be determined by tongue color. A pink tongue generally indicated that supplemental oxygen was not required as neonatal oxygen saturation was above 70%, which was the level at which the country specific guidelines advised administration of oxygengiven healthy term neonates typically take between 5 and 10 min to achieve oxygen saturations of 90%. The area under the Receiver Operator Characteristics Curve was not affected by ethnicity. Area under the curve was 0.89 (95% CI 0.84–0.95) and 0.94 (95% CI 0.87–1.00) respectively for White and "non-White" neonates. While the exact sample size of 'non-White' neonates was not provided, the study demonstrated that evaluating tongue color in "non-White" neonates was not less effective at detecting hypoxemia than in White neonates.

The final study examined the impact of ethnicity on pulse oximetry among 294 neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care. Overestimation of arterial saturation from pulse oximetry was 2.4-fold greater in Black than White neonates (mean bias 1.73% compared to 0.72%, p < 0.01). Black neonates consistently had higher pulse oximetry saturation readings at each arterial oxygen saturation level that White neonates. While the exact difference varied by pulse oximetry saturation (SpO 2), the degree of error widened between Black and White neonates for SpO 2 ≤ 95%. Occult hypoxemia (defined as SpO 2 ≥ 90% with arterial oxygen saturation < 85%) occurred in 9.2% of Black neonates (188/2044) compared to 7.7% of White neonates (181/2343), although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). The sensitivity of the pulse oximeter to detect true hypoxia (SpO 2 < 90% when SaO 2 < 85%) was similar for Black and White neonates (39% and 38% respectively) with specificity also similar (81% vs 78% respectively).

### Perindopril erbumine [^117GfeTx]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions

Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including perindopril erbumine) may be subject to a variety of adverse events, some of them serious. Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to nonblacks. Head and Neck Angioedema: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including perindopril erbumine (0.1% of patients treated with perindopril erbumine in U.S. clinical trials). Angioedema associated with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx may be fatal. In such cases, discontinue perindopril erbumine treatment immediately and observe until the swelling disappears. When involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx appears likely to cause airway obstruction, administer appropriate therapy, such as subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 to 0.5 mL), promptly.

Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus) therapy or a neprilysin inhibitor may be at increased risk for angioedema [see Drug Interactions (7.9; 7.10)].

Intestinal Angioedema: Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain.

### Bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets / metronidazole tablets / tetracycline hydrochloride capsules (bismuth subsalicylate / metronidazole / tetracycline hydrochloride) [^115AfFfK]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

a. Bismuth subsalicylate may cause a temporary and harmless darkening of the tongue and/or black stool. This should not be confused with melena (blood in the stool).

b. Metallic taste in the mouth

c. Temporary darkening of the urine (rare)

d. Sore mouth

e. Yeast infections in women

f. Tooth enamel discoloration and hypoplasia (spots on teeth). Use of tetracycline during tooth development (second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth.

g. Superinfections. Use of antibiotics may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi.

h. Central Nervous Effects. All of the components of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules have been associated with central nervous effects such as seizures, peripheral neuropathy, neurotoxicity and intracranial hypertension.

As with most medications, rare but serious side effects have been reported with the use of the components contained in Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules. (See Package Insert.) Patients should be instructed to report any unusual symptoms to their pharmacist or prescriber. Patients may also report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

### A diagnostic clue: new onset alopecia sparing white hairs [^117JYT75]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case description

A 55-year-old man presented to dermatology clinic with a smooth alopecic patch on the right temporal scalp of 4 months' duration. He additionally reported a history of hair loss on the frontal scalp that started 6 months after a left partial hemi-glossectomy for squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue in 2011. Physical exam revealed a 5.5-centimeter circular alopecic patch on the right temporal scalp with white hairs preserved throughout the patch and rare exclamation point hairs around the periphery. Follicular ostia were preserved. Treatment was initiated with 0.6 mL of intralesional triamcinolone acetonide injected intradermally at a concentration of 10 mg/mL on 2 occasions 6 weeks apart. A photo taken 6 weeks after the initial treatment demonstrated regrowth of pigmented hair in small tufts throughout the alopecic patch (Fig 1).

### Burning pain on the upper labial mucosa [^117NwjPn]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case description

A 36-year-old pregnant woman presented with 1 week of burning pain on the upper labial mucosa and new onset headache. Six days prior, the patient's 3-year-old child tested positive for streptococcal pharyngitis after exposure at daycare and was treated with antibiotics. Physical examination was remarkable for pink thin plaques with white, polycyclic borders on the upper labial mucosa (Fig 1) that could not be wiped away. The patient was empirically treated for streptococcal pharyngitis with penicillin V owing to her symptoms and pregnancy status. Lip pain and rash began to improve within 3 days and resolved completely within 4 weeks.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Lichen planus
B. Candidiasis
C. Aphthous stomatitis
D. Geographic lip
E. Herpetic gingivostomatitis

Answers:
A. Lichen planus – Incorrect. Oral lichen planus may involve labial mucosa and can be associated with sensitivity to acidic or spicy food similar to geographic tongue. However, this condition presents more commonly with bilateral white reticulations, which are frequently associated with erythema and erosions and yellow fibrinous exudate.
B. Candidiasis – Incorrect. Although oral candidiasis may present with burning pain and can involve any mucosal surface, this condition classically presents as curd-like white papules and plaques that can be wiped off.
C. Aphthous stomatitis – Incorrect. This common condition affects approximately 20% to 50% of the population and favors labial mucosa but presents more commonly with ovoid ulcers with a white-to-yellow base and an erythematous rim.
D. Geographic lip – Correct. Geographic tongue is a benign, inflammatory disorder of unclear etiology that predominantly involves the dorsal and lateral tongue. Ectopic geographic tongue (in this case, geographic lip specifically) may involve any oral mucosa and classically presents as flattened or atrophic lesions varying from a few millimeters to several centimeters with a serpiginous white border.
E. Herpetic gingivostomatitis – Incorrect. Herpetic gingivostomatitis may involve the labial mucosa but frequently presents with vesicles at the vermillion border that break to form erosions and ulcers that subsequently crust.

### Chemotherapy-associated tongue hyperpigmentation and blue lunula [^114Wc6dv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Combination chemotherapy is associated with cutaneous and mucosal side effects. Antineoplastic agents have been associated with mucosal and nail pigmentation. We describe a 16-year-old Saudi Arabian girl with combination chemotherapy-associated black tongue hyperpigmentation and blue lunula. The diagnosis of drug-associated pigmentary changes is based on correlating the onset of the clinical observations with the temporal initiation of the patient's chemotherapy agents. Spontaneous fading of antineoplastic therapy-induced tongue or nail dyschromia may subsequently occur following discontinuation of the causative drug.

### Bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets / metronidazole tablets / tetracycline hydrochloride capsules (bismuth subsalicylate / metronidazole / tetracycline hydrochloride) [^111aovha]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Darkening of the Tongue and/or Stool

Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules may cause temporary and harmless darkening of the tongue and/or black stool and is generally reversible within several days after treatment is stopped. Stool darkening should not be confused with melena (blood in the stool) (see PRECAUTIONS).

Dosing and Administration Information

Each dose includes 4 pills: 2 pink round chewable tablets (bismuth subsalicylate), 1 white round tablet (metronidazole), and 1 black and yellow capsule (tetracycline hydrochloride). Each dose (all 4 pills) should be taken 4 times a day, at mealtimes and bedtime. Patients should be instructed to chew and swallow the pink round tablets (bismuth subsalicylate tablets) and to swallow the white round tablet (metronidazole tablet) and the black and yellow capsule (tetracycline hydrochloride capsule) whole with a full glass of water (8 ounces). Concomitantly prescribed H2 antagonist therapy should be taken as directed.

### The twisting tale of woolly hair: a trait with many causes [^1167rfA2]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Woolly hair is an uncommon condition among non-black people, which may be an isolated finding or associated with additional clinical symptoms. When woolly hair is accompanied by palmoplantar keratoderma, it may herald a deadly cardiomyopathy, and therefore this condition should alert the physician for a heart disorder. Until recently, the underlying causes for this rare phenotype were obscure, and only three genes were associated with this condition. However, in recent years, many more genes were found to underlie this disorder, uncovering new molecular pathways. Better knowledge of the different mechanisms that control the curliness of hair may offer new treatment options for this condition, and may also make it possible to affect hair texture in general.

The upper and middle left panels (a, b) show the relevant section of a superposition of the structures of Pfr (Agp2-PAiRFP2, PDB entry 6G1Z, black), Meta-F (Agp2-PAiRFP2, PDB entry 6G20 (Mol A), orange, PHY tongue in red) and Pr (Agp1-PCM SER13, PDB entry 5HSQ, blue) for comparison. Amino acid residues Tyr165, Gln190, Phe192 and Trp440 (Agp2-PAiRFP2 numbering) are shown as sticks, BV is depicted as balls and sticks. Following (1) E→Z photoisomerization of BV (Pfr→Lumi-F) and the subsequent chromophore relaxation, the rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network and the rotated ring D induces (2) the reorientation of the side chains of Phe192 and Tyr165 such that their aromatic rings form a hydrophobic pocket with ring D. Thus (3) the water molecule Wat758 (red sphere) at ring D is displaced, accompanied by (4) a positional shift of Gln190 in the Meta-F intermediate, which has a direct impact on the PHY tongue. In the Pfr state, the highly conserved Trp440 of the PHY tongue overlaps with the position of this shifted Gln190 (Meta-F state). Therefore, steric hindrance by Gln190 (5) would cause Trp440 to move and eventually affect the PHY tongue (Agp2-PAiRFP2) in Meta-F to induce refolding upon transition to the Pr state. c In Agp2-PAiRFP2 (left panel), Trp440 is part of the tongue segment that is disordered in Agp2-PAiRFP2 Meta-F (middle panel). For comparison, Agp1-PCM SER13 shows an ordered segment and a β-sheet in this region (right panel)

### Lincoln's sign: where should we expect on 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy? [^1137DGBU]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Classical appearance of "Lincoln's sign" on 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy has been described in literature in case of monostotic Paget disease of mandible showing increased radiotracer uptake in the body of mandible. This pattern has also been described as "black beard" sign. The monostotic presentation of Paget disease is rare, and involving the mandible, however, is very unusual. We present a case of carcinoma of the tongue with contiguous spread to the mandible presented in the similar fashion as the earlier reported Lincoln's sign or black beard sign on 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy. This appearance was confirmed with SPECT/CT, and the lytic sclerotic lesion of the mandible was confirmed.

### Ocean's largest chlorophyll-rich tongue is extending westward (2002–2022) [^1148dKxn]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Results

Westward extension of the chlorophyll-rich tongue in the equatorial Pacific

Here, we define the boundary of the CRT as the Chl isoline of 0.1 mg/m 3, with the climatology boundary delineated in Fig. 1a (see the black curve). Clearly, within the boundary of the CRT are the poleward equatorial surface water divergence and the westward SEC (Fig. 1b).

Fig. 1
Illustration of the chlorophyll-rich tongue (CRT) and spatial distributions of ocean current fields in the equatorial Pacific.

Climatological mean (a) surface chlorophyll concentration (Chl, mg/m 3) and (b) current fields (m/s) between August 2002 and July 2022. The CRT climatology boundary is delineated with the black curve, representing the Chl isoline of 0.1 mg/m 3. The major surface currents are shown in solid black arrows in (b), including North Equatorial Current (NEC), North Equatorial Counter-Current (NECC) and South Equatorial Current (SEC). The area enclosed by the red dashed lines in (b) denotes the central positions of SEC (5° S-5° N, 170° E-100° W).

The monthly variations of the area of CRT from 2002 to 2022 were first obtained from Chl measurements by MODIS-Aqua (Fig. 2a). A linear trend fitting was first applied to this time series of CRT area, which suggests no statistically significant trend (P = 0.58, see the red line in Fig. 2a). The EMD, which is powerful in detecting trend, was then carried out to decompose the CRT area time series into seasonal and interannual components, as well as a residual trend component, as the focus of this analysis is on distinguishing between these variabilities and the residual trend (see "Methods" and Supplementary Fig. 1). Following the approach of Serio et al. we obtained an estimate of the weight of the amplitude of the trend, which contributes 9% to the variability of the total signal, while the interannual and seasonal components explain 59% and 32%, respectively.

### Hemorrhagic bullous dermatosis caused by warfarin therapy [^112rTKHf]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Case report

An 82-year-old woman with a medical history of congestive heart failure, myelodysplastic syndrome, thrombocytopenia, and discoid lupus erythematosus was started on warfarin therapy for new-onset atrial flutter. Ten days after initiation of treatment, she presented with a sudden outbreak of painless, nonpruritic, black papules on her extremities (Figs 1 and 2). Given the concern for warfarin-related skin necrosis, she was started on vitamin K and switched to a daily subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin as an alternative anticoagulation treatment. Subsequently, she had epistaxis, which required nasal packing. She was admitted to the hospital 7 days after starting enoxaparin, because of her worsening skin condition, which now involved her mucous membranes.

Physical examination found several 2- to 3-mm discrete black, purpuric papules, some with overlaying hemorrhagic crust, distributed on her face, arms, dorsal and palmar hands, and feet. Similar lesions were noted on her tongue. Blood counts showed a chronic anemia related to her myelodysplastic syndrome (hemoglobin, 9.1 g/dL). She had acute on chronic thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 33 K/mm 3. Results of a heparin-platelet factor 4 test were negative. Results of comprehensive metabolic panel, anti–double-stranded DNA, and C3 and C4 tests were all within normal limits. Coagulation studies were notable for mildly elevated international normalized ratio and partial thromboplastin time of 1.29 and 54.7 seconds, respectively. A 4-mm biopsy from the left big toe found focal parakeratosis overlying a hyperplastic epidermis, within which were dilated vessels, surrounded by a collarette of epithelium and epithelial necrosis with fibrin deposition, without evidence of vasculitis, capillary thrombosis, or significant inflammatory infiltrate (Fig 3). Discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy resulted in spontaneous regression of her lesions.

ADVERSE REACTIONS:

Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 1%) reported in clinical trials when all three components of this therapy were given concomitantly are listed in Table 1 below. The majority of the adverse reactions were related to the gastrointestinal tract, were reversible, and infrequently led to discontinuation of therapy.

* darkening of the tongue

### Adolescent and young adult tattooing, piercing, and scarification [^113Ds4TR]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Oral piercing — complications and precautions include that a serious consequence of oral piercing is airway compromise from trauma, tongue swelling, or obstruction by jewelry, and securing an adequate airway or endotracheal intubation can be challenging when a patient has a tongue barbell; removal of oral and nasal jewelry also is recommended before nonemergency surgical procedures, and chipping or fracturing of teeth is the most common dental problem related to tongue barbells. Although there is a risk of infection because of the vast amounts of bacteria in the mouth, the infection rate is low, and oral rinses or the application of nonprescription cleansers may be recommended prophylactically after an oral piercing. Ludwig angina is a rapidly spreading oral cellulitis reported as a complication of tongue piercing, and treatment involves maintaining an adequate airway, the administration of systemic antibiotic agents, and surgical drainage of abscesses. Infection severity ranges from local infections (impetigo and cellulitis) to more severe infections, including osteomyelitis, toxic shock syndrome, and bacteremia, with life-threatening infections including septic arthritis, endocarditis, and hepatitis B; with any body piercing, there is the danger of infection, including hepatitis B or C virus and tetanus, and body piercing as a possible vector for HIV transmission has been suggested, although no cases have been reported. Importantly, adolescents and young adults with increased vulnerability to infection and those taking anticoagulant medications may be at greater risk of complications from body piercing.

It has been observed as a solitary or multiple well-circumscribed, brown lesion on the dorsal surface of the tongue at birth that grows proportionately to the tongue. The cause of congenital lingual melanotic macule is unclear. It is possible that the congenital lesions may represent a hematoma of melanocytes with localized functional change in melanin production. There are sporadic reports of acquired oral melanotic macules appearing after trauma, irradiation, or medication. Various hypotheses for localized increased melanin production in these cases have included physiologic genetic variations or viral and immunologic factors, but none has been conclusive.

### Diseases of the tongue [^116avr2g]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

The tongue is a complex organ involved in speech and expression as well as in gustation, mastication, and deglutition. The oral cavity, along with the tongue, are sites of neoplasms, reactive processes, and infections, and may be a harbinger of systemic diseases. This review includes both common and rare diseases that occur on the tongue, including: vascular and lymphatic lesions (infantile hemangiomas and oral varices), reactive and inflammatory processes (hairy tongue, pigmented fungiform papillae of the tongue, benign migratory glossitis, and fissured tongue), infections (oral hairy leukoplakia, herpes simplex and varicella-zoster virus infections, human papillomavirus, and candidiasis), premalignant lesions (leukoplakia and erythroplakia), malignant lesions (squamous cell carcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and lymphoproliferative diseases), and signs of systemic disease (nutritional deficiency and systemic amyloidosis).

### Isolated lingual mucormycosis in an infant with down syndrome [^111sNrSQ]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Mucormycosis is characterized by severe infection with rapid progression and a high mortality rate. In immunocompromised hosts, the most common type is the rhinocerebral form of mucormycosis. Invasive mucormycosis affecting only the tongue is extremely rare. We report one such case that occurred in an immunocompromised 4-month-old girl with Down syndrome who had been hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. The infant had metabolic acidosis secondary to diarrhea. It was suspected that the infection had been contracted through the use of a wooden tongue depressor during oral examination. We present this case report in the hope that it will discourage clinicians from using wooden tongue depressors in vulnerable infants. We also wish to emphasize that mucormycosis should be considered in all patients — regardless of age — who present with localized bluish-black discolored mucosa of the oral mucosa and/or tongue.

### Structural snapshot of a bacterial phytochrome in its functional intermediate state [^113ANRfq]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Structural changes in the tongue region are also reflected by the infrared (IR) difference spectrum of Agp2-PAiPFR2 in solution (Fig. 8, red trace), generated by subtracting the spectrum of Pfr (negative signals) from that of the final photoproduct (positive signals). In the amide I band region, no negative band at ca. 1657 cm −1 is observed that in the Pr/Pfr difference spectrum of the full-length wild-type Agp2-FL (grey trace) demonstrates the restructuring of the α-helical part of the tongue segment of Pfr. Instead, the negative signal at 1627 cm −1 in the Agp2-PAiRFP2 difference spectrum (red trace) indicates the degradation of the coiled loop structure of the tongue segment, whereas the positive signal at 1642 cm −1 points to the formation of a simpler β-hairpin segment. However, a more complex β-sheet formation can be ruled out due to the lack of a positive signal at ca. 1625 cm −1. In the region > 1680 cm −1, the Agp2-PAiRFP2 difference spectrum agrees very well with that of the Meta-F/Pfr difference spectrum of wild-type Agp2-PCM (black trace), including the upshifts of the C = O stretching of the propionate side chain of ring C (from 1749 to 1761 cm −1 for Agp2-PAiRFP2) and the C = O stretching of the ring D carbonyl from 1697 to 1709 cm −1. In contrast, no notable signals are detected in the amide I band region of wild-type Agp2-PCM (black trace). Altogether, the IR spectra indicate the high structural similarity of the chromophore in the Meta-F states of Agp2-PAiRFP2 and wild-type Agp2-PCM, in line with the RR spectroscopic analysis.

### Effect of bradykinin receptor antagonism on ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema [^115JrtcN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The B 2 receptor antagonist icatibant is approved for treatment of attacks of hereditary angioedema. Icatibant has been reported to decrease time-to-resolution of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated angioedema in 1 study of European patients.

Objective

We sought to test the hypothesis that a bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist would shorten time-to-resolution from ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema.

Methods

Patients with ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema (defined as swelling of lips, tongue, pharynx, or face during ACE inhibitor use and no swelling in the absence of ACE inhibitor use) were enrolled at Vanderbilt University Medical Center from October 2007 through September 2015 and at Massachusetts General Hospital in 2012. C1 inhibitor deficiency and patients with bowel edema only were excluded. Patients were randomized within 6 hours of presentation to subcutaneous icatibant 30 mg or placebo at 0 and 6 hours later. Patients assessed severity of swelling using a visual analog scale serially following study drug administration or until discharge.

Results

Thirty-three patients were randomized and 31 received treatment, with 13 receiving icatibant and 18 receiving placebo. One patient randomized to icatibant did not complete the visual analog scale and was excluded from analyses. Two-thirds of patients were black and two-thirds were women. Time-to-resolution of symptoms was similar in placebo and icatibant treatment groups (P = 0.19 for the primary symptom and P > .16 for individual symptoms of face, lip, tongue, or eyelid swelling). Frequency of administration of H1 and H2 blockers, corticosteroids, and epinephrine was similar in the 2 treatment groups. Time-to-resolution of symptoms was similar in black and white patients.

Conclusions

This study does not support clinical efficacy of a bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist in ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema.

### Laser tongue debridement for oral malodor – A novel approach to halitosis [^115a2Dvg]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Malodor is a multifactorial condition with oral pathology representing the main culprit and the tongue being the first to second contributor to the malodor. Bacterial load can represent a quantifiable measure regardless of the original pathology. We hypothesize that reduction in malodor can be represented by tongue changes both in appearance, bacterial and biofilm load reduction (measured by CFU and volatile gases measurement), organoleptic measurement and subjective improvement.

Methods

A randomized controlled prospective study under IRB approval. Diagnostic criteria for enrollment and follow up were organoleptic test by 2 judges, Halimeter reading, tongue colors changes HALT questionnaire and direct aerobic and anaerobic tongue cultures measured by CFU. Patients were treated with laser tongue debridement (LTD) with an Er, Cr:YSGG solid state laser has been shown to be effective in biofilm reduction.

Results

54 patients recruited with 35 available for follow up. Improvement was observed on all objective and QOL subjective parameters. Treatment was tolerated well with minimal discomfort.

Conclusions

The tongue is proven to be a major contributor to oral malodor and must be addressed in treatment protocol. LTD significantly reduces malodor by subjective and objective criteria. While impossible to determine whether the tongue serves as a bacterial reservoir or is the origin for oral bacteria it is clear that LTD improves oral hygiene and reduces malodor. LTD is safe and easy to perform. We encourage LTD to be a crucial part of any oral malodor treatment protocol.

### Common oral lesions [^113EaGwu]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Familiarity with common oral conditions allows clinicians to observe and treat patients in the primary care setting or refer to a dentist, oral surgeon, otolaryngologist, or other specialist. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (canker sores) is the most common ulcerative condition of the oral cavity. Recurrent herpes simplex labialis and stomatitis also commonly cause oral ulcers. Corticosteroids, immunocompromise, antibiotics, and dentures can predispose patients to oral candidiasis. Benign migratory glossitis (geographic tongue) occurs in up to 3% of the population but generally lacks symptoms, although some people experience food sensitivity or a burning sensation. Hairy tongue is associated with a low fiber diet, tobacco and alcohol use, and poor oral hygiene in older male patients. Generally, hairy tongue is asymptomatic except for an unattractive appearance or halitosis. Tobacco and alcohol use can cause mucosal changes resulting in leukoplakia and erythroplakia. These can represent precancerous changes and increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma. Mandibular and maxillary tori are common bony cortical outgrowths that require no treatment in the absence of repeat trauma from chewing or interference with dentures. Oral lichen planus occurs in up to 2% of individuals and can present as lacy reticulations or oral erosions and ulcerations. Traumatic buccal mucosal fibromas and labial mucoceles from biting can be excised.

### A 66-year-old woman with fever, cough, and a tongue lesion [^112ejWRf]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old woman presented with acute onset of fever, chills, and productive cough associated with right-sided chest pain. During a recent hospitalization for dyspnea, she had been diagnosed with Coombs-positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia and had been taking a tapering dose of prednisone starting approximately 6 weeks prior to admission. In the interim, her dyspnea had resolved on treatment with steroids. At the time of presentation, her prednisone dose was 40 mg. Additional medical history included VTE, for which the patient was receiving anticoagulation therapy, and steroid-induced diabetes mellitus. Many years earlier, she had been treated for TB in her home country. The patient had immigrated to Queens, New York, from a Nepalese village 8 years prior. While still in Nepal, she had worked on a farm and had been in close proximity to cows. In Queens, she lived with her family in a house with a small garden but had no pets. Recent travel included a visit to Nepal 9 months ago and a trip to Syracuse, New York, one month prior to presentation. She was a never smoker and did not consume alcohol.

### The relationship between oral malodor and volatile sulfur compound-producing bacteria [^117MG9d3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Halitosis can be a crippling social problem, and standard dental treatments and mouthwashes often provide only temporary relief. The mouth is home to hundreds of bacterial species that produce several fetid substances as a result of protein degradation. Volatile sulfur compound (VSC)-producing bacteria colonizing the lingual dorsum have recently been implicated in the generation of halitosis. Detection of VSCs, such as methylmercaptan and hydrogen sulfite, via organoleptic and objective methods, can aid in the identification of their source. Following comprehensive evaluation for possible causes, most halitosis in patients seen in an ENT practice can be localized to the tongue. We review methods of diagnosis and treatment of oral malodor from the overgrowth of proteolytic, anaerobic, gram-negative bacteria on the crevices of the lingual dorsum. Bacteriologic analysis of biofilm and scraped specimens obtained from the lingual dorsum and other oral sites, primarily gingival pockets and tonsillar crypts, can identify VSC-producing bacteria. Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Actinobacillus, and Fusobacterium species are the most common organisms identified. Halitosis is an oral phenomenon, with almost no cases originating distal to the tonsils. Halitosis arising from the lingual dorsum secondary to overpopulated VSC-producing bacteria can be successfully managed with a combination of mechanical cleansing using tongue brushes or scrapes and chemical solutions containing essential oils, zinc chloride, and cetylpyridinium chloride.

### MASCC / ISOO expert opinion on the management of oral problems in patients with advanced cancer [^117M49X3]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Halitosis — management — management depends on the type of halitosis: in patients with physiological halitosis, it primarily involves oral hygiene measures, whilst in patients with pathological halitosis, it primarily involves treatment of the underlying cause (if possible), e.g. antibiotics for infections (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). For physiological halitosis, measures include generic oral hygiene, avoidance of odorous foodstuffs, alcohol cessation, smoking cessation, measures to reduce bacterial numbers (e.g. tongue cleaning, chlorhexidine — mouthwash), measures to reduce bacterial substrate (e.g. tongue cleaning, "professional" dental/periodontal cleaning) and measures to convert offensive volatile sulphur compounds to inoffensive non-volatile compounds (e.g. zinc salts — toothpaste, mouthwash; sodium bicarbonate/baking soda — toothpaste) (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). Many oral care products are available to manage halitosis, and those with specific properties should be prescribed in preference to those with simply "masking"/"cosmetic" properties (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). It should be noted that the evidence on managing halitosis in general is limited and of low quality.

Question 3: Which of the following statements is FALSE?
A. Migratory stomatitis is another, appropriate name for geographic lip.
B. Ectopic geographic tongue was first described in 1955.
C. Spicy or acidic foods may exacerbate symptoms of geographic tongue, both lingual and ectopic.
D. Although the diagnosis of ectopic geographic tongue is clinical only, biopsies may demonstrate elongation of rete edges, parakeratosis, Munro abscesses, and suprapapillary thinning.
E. Geographic tongue affects approximately 1 in 5 individuals.

Answers:
A. Migratory stomatitis is another, appropriate name for geographic lip – Incorrect. This is true. There are many names that have been used for ectopic geographic tongue, such as migratory stomatitis, stomatitis areata migrans, erythema circinata migrans, annulus migrans, and geographic stomatitis.
B. Ectopic geographic tongue was first described in 1955 – Incorrect. This is true. This phenomena was first described in a 30-year-old Maltese man in 1955.
C. Spicy or acidic foods may exacerbate symptoms of geographic tongue, both lingual and ectopic – Incorrect. This is true. Although some patients may be asymptomatic, burning pain is often related to eating spicy or acidic foods.
D. Although the diagnosis of ectopic geographic tongue is clinical only, biopsies may demonstrate elongation of rete edges, parakeratosis, Munro abscesses, and suprapapillary thinning – Incorrect. This is true. Similar to psoriasis, biopsies of these lesions may demonstrate elongation of rete edges, parakeratosis, Munro abscesses, and suprapapillary thinning.
E. Geographic tongue affects approximately 1 in 5 individuals – Correct. This statement is false. The prevalence of geographic tongue is 1% to 4.8%, and ectopic geographic tongue is rarely described.

### Methodological procedures for ultrasonographic assessment of the tongue during sucking in full-term infants: a scoping review [^112n7b9n]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

On US, the hard palate appears as an echogenic line visualized in white. Although the articles have not described it, the contour of the hard palate on US is visible when the tongue presses against it, as in swallowing/sucking milk, and is no longer visible when the tongue moves away from it. Because it is a rigid structure, the hard palate can be used as a reference point to eliminate noise induced by non-breastfeeding movements. The HSPJ location on the polar coordinates was identified where the band becomes wider than 5 pixels. The soft palate appears as a gray structure (3–4 mm) with an echogenic border and was identified where the band widens. The nipple appears as a gray, soft tissue structure, and the ducts within the nipple appear as hypoechoic (black), shaped like tubular structures. Milk flow was visualized as a hypoechoic fluid containing echogenic spots. Echogenic spots are described as fat and globules in milk.

Other landmarks were used as measurement markers, such as distance (mm) between the tip of the nipple and the beginning of the HSPJ was measured from a transverse mark on the tip of the nipple to the transverse mark on the distal end of the hard palate adjacent to the soft palate in the sagittal plane; distance (mm) the nipple traveled in the entire gray structure presented cylindrically in the image; the sucking cycle, from when the middle of the tongue was attached to the palate (tongue up), followed by a downward tongue excursion, the middle tongue reaching its lowest point (tongue down), until the tongue attached to the palate again. Some authors measured with a caliper on the device's screen, whereas others used the device's measurements (which can bias the analysis of the results).

### Lingual Raynaud's phenomenon: a rare presentation [^116AoUC6]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A woman in her mid-60s presented to transient ischaemic attack (TIA) clinic with a 3-year history of intermittent sensory changes and white discolouration affecting the left side of her tongue. Following extensive investigation, a provisional diagnosis of posterior circulation TIA was made, and the patient was commenced on clopidogrel therapy. Despite anti-platelet treatment, she continued to have identical episodic symptoms. She was referred to the rheumatology team for assessment of possible underlying autoimmune pathology. On rheumatology assessment, the patient reported colour changes on the tongue, associated with numbness, followed by paraesthesia of the affected area. A comprehensive assessment excluded secondary causes and a diagnosis of primary Raynaud's phenomenon of the tongue was made. The diagnosis of TIA was revoked. This case illustrates a rare presentation of a common condition and highlights the sensory symptoms which are associated with Raynaud's phenomenon.

### Xeroderma pigmentosum: a retrospective case series in Zimbabwe [^115SMpWK]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present our experience with the clinical features and management of black African patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP).

Patients and Methods

Twelve patients with XP were seen over a 25-year period, and were retrospectively reviewed for age, gender, clinical features, treatment, and follow-up.

Results

There were 8 females and 4 males with an age range of 3 to 18 years. One patient, the longest survivor, was followed until death at 18 years. Nine patients had the severe form of XP and 3 had the mild form. All patients had early ocular involvement with photophobia and early blindness. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was present on the skin, lip, and tongue in most patients. One patient had ocular surface SCC. There was marked skin photosensitivity. No history of consanguinity was noted in the parents of the patients. Surgery was the treatment modality of choice. Follow-up was poor.

Conclusion

XP is uncommon in our black population, and presents in the severe form with SCC as the malignant skin, lip, and tongue lesion. It is common in early childhood with severe photosensitivity, photophobia, and eventual blindness. Follow-up is difficult in our environment.

### Common oral lesions: part I. superficial mucosal lesions [^116hPJMb]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Common superficial oral lesions include candidiasis, recurrent herpes labialis, recurrent aphthous stomatitis, erythema migrans, hairy tongue, and lichen planus. Recognition and diagnosis require taking a thorough history and performing a complete oral examination. Knowledge of clinical characteristics such as size, location, surface morphology, color, pain, and duration is helpful in establishing a diagnosis. Oral candidiasis may present as pseudomembranous candidiasis, glossitis, or perlèche (angular cheilitis). Oral candidiasis is common in infants, but in adults it may signify immune deficiency or other illness. Herpes labialis typically is a mild, self-limited condition. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis most often is a mild condition; however, severe cases may be caused by nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Erythema migrans is a waxing and waning disorder of unknown etiology. Hairy tongue represents elongation and hypertrophy of the filiform papillae and most often occurs in persons who smoke heavily. Oral lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory condition that may be reticular or erosive. Certain risk factors have been associated with each of these lesions, such as poor oral hygiene, age, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption, and some systemic conditions may have oral manifestations. Many recommended therapies for oral lesions are unsupported by randomized controlled trials.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of methemoglobinemia [^1143tRDM]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Some co‐axial pulse oximeters are able to detect MetHb levels, and these may occasionally detect increased MetHb levels incidentally, although these are not used in routine practice.
Severe neurodevelopmental disorder, typically presenting in the first year of life

Typically these children have clinically apparent methemoglobinemia, combined with severe neurological deficits, including profound cognitive impairment, growth retardation, microcephaly and dystonia (methemoglobinemia, type II) (Table 2).

(Recommendations) It is particularly important to pay attention to clinical findings and family history to help distinguish acquired from inherited forms (whenever these latter are transmitted).

The experts panel reached 100% (22/22) of consensus on this recommendation (Figure 1).

Q2. What are the key symptoms of methemoglobinemia?
Methemoglobinemia, type I

MetHb levels are typically 20%‐30%. This is a generally rare disorder with frequencies of up to 1:1000 in some isolated populations with founder mutations. The most striking feature is the blue discoloration, which typically may be very intense and give a lavender or slate‐gray appearance. The blue discoloration is apparent all over the body, particularly the lips, nose, cheeks, and buccal mucosa and does not improve with supplemental oxygen. This is present from birth and is persistent without much variation unless it has been treated. Most often, there are no other clinical features and no impairment of cardiorespiratory function. There are some reports of patients with headaches, tachycardia and mild dyspnea, attributed to reduced blood oxygenation, and possibly associated mild polycythemia. Anecdotally, it is reported that fatigue and breathlessness may become more common with increasing age, possibly related to exacerbation of deteriorating cardiovascular function.

### Rethinking "posterior" tongue-tie [^111sqATa]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Currently, many clinicians who help with breastfeeding problems are diagnosing "posterior" tongue-tie in infants and performing or referring for frenotomy. In this "Speaking Out" article, I argue that the diagnosis of "posterior" tongue-tie has successfully raised awareness of the importance of impaired tongue function in breastfeeding difficulty. However, the diagnosis of "posterior" tongue-tie also applies a reductionist, medicalized theoretical frame to the complex problem of impaired tongue function, risking unintended outcomes. Impaired tongue function arises out of multiple interacting and co-evolving factors, including the interplay between social behaviors concerning breastfeeding and mother-infant biology. Consideration of theoretical frames is vital if we are to build an evidence base through efficient use of the scarce resources available for clinical breastfeeding research and minimize unintended outcomes.

### Distinct epidemiologic characteristics of oral tongue cancer patients [^116CuC3r]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Oral tongue cancer may have a distinct epidemiological profile from other mucosal neoplasms of the oral cavity. We sought to further define the demographic characteristics associated with oral tongue cancer to determine if unique characteristics exist compared with other oral cavity cancers.

Study Design

Cross-sectional analysis using cross-tabulations and multivariate regression modeling.

Setting

The Maryland Health Service Cost Review Commission database.

Subjects and Methods

Discharge data from a state database were queried to perform a cross-sectional analysis of oral cancer cases treated surgically from 1990 to 2009.

Results

A total of 1688 oral cancer cases comprised the study population, with 719 (42.6%) of cases involving the oral tongue. Tongue cancer comprised 31.6% of oral cancers in black patients and 44.1% of oral cancer in white patients (P = 0.011). Racial disparities in oral tongue cancer were identified for age at diagnosis, with significantly fewer black patients younger than 40 years (3.8%) compared with whites (11.3%; P = 0.006). After controlling for all other variables, oral tongue cancer patients were significantly less likely to be older than 40 years (odds ratio [OR], 0.40; P < .001), black (OR, 0.53; P = 0.001), have Medicare payor status (OR, 0.55; P = 0.002), and advanced comorbidity (OR, 0.22; P < .001), in contrast to other oral cancer subsites.

Conclusion

The racial and socioeconomic qualities of oral tongue cancer patients differ significantly from other oral cancers. This younger, healthier subgroup of oral cancer patients demonstrates a distinct population at risk for cancer of the oral tongue.

### Toxic side effects of targeted therapies and immunotherapies affecting the skin, oral mucosa, hair, and nails [^111sLuYG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Multikinase Angiogenesis and HER Inhibitor-Associated Stomatitis

About 25% and 15% of patients treated with multikinase angiogenesis inhibitors (sorafenib, sunitinib, cabozantinib, pazopanib, etc.) and EGFRIs (erlotinib, gefitinib) develop stomatitis, respectively. However, the all-grade incidence appears to be significantly higher with the newly developed pan-HER inhibitors (dacomitinib, afatinib).

Similar well-demarcated ulcerations on non-keratinized mucosa may also occur, which are roughly similar to aphthous-like lesions induced by mTOR inhibitors. However, they are most often limited and of low grade, and patients generally report non-specific stomatitis with diffuse mucosal hypersensitivity/dysesthesia and dysgeusia, sometimes associated with erythema or painful burning mouth (mucosa inflammation). Rapid development after treatment initiation and gradual disappearance is noted.

Other Oral Toxicities with Targeted Therapies

Geographic tongue has been described in association with bevacizumab or multikinase angiogenesis inhibitors. Although geographic tongue does not require any treatment, it is essential to reassure the patient, and clinicians should avoid prescribing ineffective antifungal agents.

As described in Sect. 2.2.3, reactional hyperkeratotic lesions are also observed in both keratinized and non-keratinized areas, as well as occasional SCC occurring in patients treated with BRAFIs as monotherapy. Vemurafenib or dabrafenib in monotherapy results in oral mucosal hyperkeratosis within the first weeks of treatment, which noticeably regresses upon addition of MEKIs (cobimetinib, trametinib), as shown for skin toxicities.

Oral lichenoid reactions are frequently observed in patients treated with the first-generation BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib and are characterized by a combination of reticular striae with symptomatic ulcerative, erosive, or atrophic lesions. Often underestimated, these lesions can be isolated or associated with nail or skin reactions and regular follow-up is recommended. Of note, these lesions have not been described with the new-generation BCR-ABL TKIs nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib. Finally, blue–gray–black asymptomatic hyperpigmentation of the hard palate has sometimes been reported in response to imatinib, similar to that induced by antimalarial agents.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^115mUmpB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) initial evaluation and lesion characterization — The initial patient evaluation should be focused to determine (through history and physical examination) whether the lesions that patients describe are consistent with CU (D). Lesions are typically edematous pink or red wheals with surrounding erythema, are generally pruritic, and individual lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours; painful or burning dysesthesia suggests cutaneous vasculitis, and angioedema is nonpruritic, brawny, nonpitting edema without erythema affecting the lips, tongue, eyelids, and genitalia. The clinician should obtain objective assessments of body surface area covered in hives, itch severity, and quality of life at the initial and each subsequent visit, and photographic documentation might assist in determining consistency with urticaria or angioedema. The medical work-up should be done while keeping in mind that CU is of undetermined cause in the majority of cases (C).

### Cranial nerve palsy secondary to botulism after black tar heroin use [^116wdsZK]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Wound botulism (WB) is an uncommon but severe neuromuscular illness caused by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum in an infected wound. There has been a dramatic increase in WB associated with black tar heroin injection in California.

Case Description

A 50-year-old male with heroin abuse presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of dysphagia and dysarthria. Physical examination revealed slurred speech, inability to manipulate tongue, and slowed eye movements. The patient was also noted to have progressive weakness during hospitalization. Laboratory findings were unremarkable, and further workup, including a computerized tomography scan of the head and soft neck tissue, showed no abnormal findings. Given the history of heroin abuse in Southern California and findings on physical examination, a diagnosis of WB needed to be considered as the differential. The Department of Health was contacted, and treatment was initiated with botulism antitoxin and metronidazole. Despite the treatment, the patient's condition did not improve, and the patient died. The resulting diagnosis was confirmed by C. botulism toxin A found in his serum a few days after the patient died.

Discussion

Progressive cranial nerve palsy with symmetric descending paralysis with heroin abuse should raise the suspicion of WB and require prompt diagnosis and treatment. This case highlights raising awareness of the disease could help lead to early diagnosis and treatment.

### Bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets / metronidazole tablets / tetracycline hydrochloride capsules (bismuth subsalicylate / metronidazole / tetracycline hydrochloride) [^113uSct9]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Development of Superinfections

Known or previously unrecognized candidiasis may present more prominent symptoms during therapy with metronidazole and requires treatment with an antifungal agent.

As with other antibiotics, use of tetracycline hydrochloride may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs discontinue Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules and institute appropriate therapy.

Photosensitivity

Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs. Instruct patients taking Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules to avoid exposure to the sun or sun lamps. Treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.

Darkening of the Tongue and/or Black Stool

Bismuth subsalicylate may cause a temporary and harmless darkening of the tongue and/or black stool, generally reversible within several days after treatment is stopped (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Stool darkening should not be confused with melena.

Use in Patients with Blood Dyscrasias

BMetronidazole is a nitroimidazole and should be used with caution in patients with evidence of, or history of, blood dyscrasia. A mild leukopenia has been observed during its administration; however, no persistent hematologic abnormalities attributable to metronidazole have been observed in clinical studies. Total and differential leukocyte counts are recommended before and after therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Increased Plasma Concentrations in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Patients with hepatic impairment metabolize metronidazole slowly, with resultant accumulation of metronidazole in the plasma. Use Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules may not be appropriate for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
