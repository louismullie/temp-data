## Question

How to treat atrial fibrillation with rvr

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate hemodynamic assessment and when to cardiovert. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacologic rate control choices and dosing. Next, I will consider special populations such as heart failure, preexcitation, and pregnancy. After that, I need to check what to do if first-line agents fail, including second-line drugs and magnesium. Finally, I should confirm anticoagulation decisions, disposition, and follow-up planning, and I will double-check any conflicting data points along the way.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and a 12-lead ECG to verify AF with RVR, while I simultaneously assess hemodynamic stability, ischemia, and heart failure, because unstable patients require immediate synchronized cardioversion rather than drugs, and I should not delay that decision while I sort out medications [^4c050e27] [^78614778].

> Wait, let me verify the cardioversion thresholds: instability includes hypotension, shock, acute pulmonary edema, ongoing ischemia, or altered mental status, and in those cases immediate synchronized cardioversion at 200 J biphasic is recommended, with escalation if needed. I should also remember that if AF is longer than 48 hours and the patient is not anticoagulated, I need to weigh thromboembolic risk and consider TEE-guided cardioversion or delayed cardioversion with anticoagulation, but I must not let instability persist while I sort that out [^78614778] [^4c050e27].

> For hemodynamically stable patients, I need to ensure I choose between beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers correctly. Both are first-line for acute rate control in stable AF with RVR without preexcitation, and I should tailor to comorbidities and prior therapy, keeping in mind that diltiazem may achieve rate control faster while metoprolol may have fewer adverse events in some analyses, so I should individualize rather than assume one is universally superior [^114aa20a] [^bddae922] [^3178884d].

> I will now examine dosing specifics for diltiazem: a weight-based IV push of 0.25 mg/kg is favored over fixed low doses because it improves 30-minute rate control and reduces rescue therapy, and if the heart rate remains above 100 bpm after 15 minutes, a second dose of 0.35 mg/kg is reasonable. I should double-check that I am not exceeding 0.35 mg/kg on redosing and that I monitor for hypotension and bradycardia after each dose [^ecefca4b].

> For metoprolol, let me think about practical dosing: 2.5 to 5 mg IV every 5 minutes to a total of 15 mg is standard, and I should titrate to effect while watching blood pressure closely. Hold on, I should verify that in patients already on chronic beta-blockers, response may be blunted, so if I do not see a meaningful drop by 10–15 mg, I should consider switching classes rather than escalating further into diminishing returns [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with heart failure. Initially, I was going to say nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are absolutely contraindicated in HFrEF, but wait, let me verify the nuance: guidelines advise avoiding IV diltiazem or verapamil in moderate to severe LV systolic dysfunction or decompensated HF because of negative inotropy, yet some retrospective ED data suggest short-term IV diltiazem may be comparable to metoprolol in select HFrEF patients without overt decompensation, so I should avoid CCBs in decompensated or severe LV dysfunction and prefer beta-blockers or amiodarone when appropriate, while acknowledging the limited-quality counterevidence [^8960babd] [^1cc67200] [^c940f894] [^2efb3dd0].

> In decompensated HF or critically ill patients where beta-blockers and CCBs are ineffective or contraindicated, I should confirm that IV amiodarone is a reasonable option for acute rate control, recognizing its delayed onset, potential proarrhythmia, and the need to consider thromboembolic risk if cardioversion occurs. Guidelines support amiodarone in this setting, but I need to ensure close monitoring and a plan for transition once stabilized [^1cc67200] [^d171daab] [^931181f2].

> For preexcitation or Wolff-Parkinson-White with AF, I need to ensure I do not administer agents that slow the AV node but not the accessory pathway, namely avoid diltiazem, verapamil, beta-blockers, digoxin, and amiodarone, and instead use procainamide or ibutilide for rhythm control or proceed to synchronized cardioversion if unstable. I should double-check that this is a strict contraindication to avoid accelerating conduction over the bypass tract [^9680a844] [^0eef61c6].

> In pregnancy, I should confirm that intravenous beta-blockers are first-line for stable AF with RVR, with diltiazem as a second-line option, and avoid amiodarone unless absolutely necessary. If unstable, synchronized cardioversion is considered safe with appropriate fetal monitoring, and I need to ensure anticoagulation decisions follow the same stroke-risk principles with careful maternal-fetal risk assessment [^806a9c18] [^8b58a509].

> If first-line agents fail or are contraindicated, I need to check second-line options: digoxin is reasonable, albeit slow-onset and less effective for exertional rate control, and IV magnesium can be added to standard therapy to improve rate control success. I should confirm that magnesium is adjunctive rather than monotherapy and monitor for toxicity in renal impairment [^a5ea5582] [^d3210a0b] [^f035e3db].

> Let me consider combination AV nodal blockade when a single agent is insufficient: adding a second class after a partial response can achieve additional rate control in roughly half of patients, but I should monitor closely for excessive bradycardia and hypotension, and I need to ensure I do not combine agents in patients with preexcitation or decompensated HF where harm is possible [^5aa85df9] [^9680a844].

> I should confirm anticoagulation decisions using CHA2DS2-VASc, recognizing that acute AF management does not change immediate anticoagulation needs. If AF duration is 48 hours or unknown and cardioversion is planned, I need to ensure appropriate anticoagulation strategy, and if the patient is already on DOACs or warfarin, I should verify therapeutic levels before proceeding [^8a305e2a] [^4c050e27].

> For disposition, I need to ensure that patients with unstable presentations, high-risk features, or failed rate control are admitted, whereas stable patients with reliable follow-up, good response, and low risk may be discharged with oral rate control and anticoagulation as indicated. I should double-check that reliable follow-up for INR management or DOAC adherence is in place before discharge [^8a305e2a].

> Finally, I should review long-term considerations: if AF with RVR persists despite optimized medical therapy and causes symptoms or cardiomyopathy, AV nodal ablation with pacing can be considered, with initial pacemaker lower rate programming at 80–90 bpm to mitigate sudden death risk, and in select cases conduction system pacing may be reasonable. I need to ensure shared decision-making around irreversible strategies and set expectations for pacing dependence [^0cae4e94] [^2eca7864] [^f4171389].

Treat atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) by **first assessing hemodynamic stability** [^4c050e27]. If unstable, perform **immediate synchronized cardioversion** [^78614778]. For stable patients, use **IV beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers** (diltiazem/verapamil) for rapid rate control [^114aa20a]; avoid CCBs in HFrEF or decompensated HF [^8960babd]. Add IV magnesium if needed [^d3210a0b] [^f035e3db], and consider amiodarone or digoxin if first-line agents are ineffective or contraindicated [^a5ea5582] [^1cc67200]. Address anticoagulation with **CHA₂DS₂-VASc** [^8a305e2a], and monitor for hypotension, bradycardia, and drug interactions [^3178884d].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

- **Hemodynamic stability**: Assess for hypotension, shock, acute pulmonary edema, or ongoing ischemia [^4c050e27].

- **Unstable patients**: Immediate synchronized cardioversion is indicated [^78614778].

- **Stable patients**: Proceed with pharmacologic rate control [^114aa20a].

---

## Pharmacologic rate control

### First-line agents

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Dose** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Metoprolol | Stable patients without contraindications | 2.5–5 mg IV every 5 min; max 15 mg | Avoid in decompensated HF, bradycardia, or reactive airway disease [^notfound] |
| Diltiazem | Stable patients without HFrEF | 0.25 mg/kg IV; repeat 0.35 mg/kg if needed | Avoid in HFrEF or decompensated HF [^8960babd] |
| Verapamil | Stable patients without HFrEF | 2.5–5 mg IV over 2 min; repeat once if needed | Avoid in HFrEF or decompensated HF [^8960babd] |

---

### Second-line agents

- **Amiodarone**: 150 mg IV over 10 min; repeat if needed; for refractory cases or when first-line agents are contraindicated [^1cc67200].

- **Digoxin**: 0.25 mg IV every 2 h; max 1.5 mg; slower onset, useful in HFrEF or sedentary patients [^40961365].

- **Magnesium sulfate**: 2 g IV over 10 min; adjunct to improve rate control [^d3210a0b] [^f035e3db].

---

## Special considerations

- **Heart failure**: Avoid CCBs in HFrEF; use beta-blockers cautiously, consider amiodarone or digoxin [^8960babd] [^1cc67200].

- **Pre-excitation (WPW)**: Avoid AV nodal blockers; use procainamide or ibutilide, or cardiovert if unstable [^0eef61c6].

- **Pregnancy**: Beta-blockers first-line; avoid amiodarone unless absolutely necessary [^806a9c18].

---

## Monitoring and safety

Continuously monitor **heart rate, blood pressure, and rhythm** [^notfound], and watch for hypotension, bradycardia, and drug interactions. Adjust therapy based on response and adverse effects [^notfound].

---

## Anticoagulation

Use **CHA₂DS₂-VASc** to guide anticoagulation decisions [^8a305e2a]. Start anticoagulation if indicated, balancing bleeding risk [^8a305e2a].

---

## Long-term management

Address underlying causes and comorbidities, and titrate rate-control agents to a resting heart rate of **< 100–110 bpm** [^65462c60]. Consider rhythm control or **AV nodal ablation** if symptoms persist despite optimal rate control [^f4171389].

---

AF with RVR management centers on **rapid rate control** with beta-blockers or CCBs, avoidance of harmful agents in HFrEF, and escalation to amiodarone or digoxin when needed, with ongoing anticoagulation and monitoring for adverse effects.

### What is the best agent for rate control of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response? [^ec29167e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common dysrhythmia associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although many patients have stable AF, some patients can present with a rapid ventricular response (RVR). In these patients, it is important to lower their heart rate. However, there are several options available for rate control in the emergency department setting.

Clinical Question

What is the most effective agent for rate control for the patient with AF in RVR?

Evidence Review

Studies retrieved included two prospective, randomized, double-blind studies and six retrospective cohort studies. These studies provide estimates of the efficacy and safety of calcium channel blockers and β-blockers for rate control in those with AF with RVR.

Conclusion

Based upon the available literature, diltiazem likely achieves rate control faster than metoprolol, though both agents seem safe and effective. Clinicians must consider the individual patient, clinical situation, and comorbidities when selecting a medication for rate control.

### Emergency medicine updates: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^8a305e2a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) may lead to stroke, heart failure, and death. When AF occurs in the context of a rapid ventricular rate/response (RVR), this can lead to complications, including hypoperfusion and cardiac ischemia. Emergency physicians play a key role in the diagnosis and management of this dysrhythmia.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning AF with RVR for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Differentiating primary and secondary AF with RVR and evaluating hemodynamic stability are vital components of ED assessment and management. Troponin can assist in determining the risk of adverse outcomes, but universal troponin testing is not required in patients at low risk of acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery disease - especially patients with recurrent episodes of paroxysmal AF that are similar to their prior events. Emergent cardioversion is indicated in hemodynamically unstable patients. Rate or rhythm control should be pursued in hemodynamically stable patients. Elective cardioversion is a safe option for select patients and may reduce AF symptoms and risk of AF recurrence. Rate control using beta blockers or calcium channel blockers should be pursued in those with AF with RVR who do not undergo cardioversion. Anticoagulation is an important component of management, and several tools (e.g. CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc) are available to assist with this decision. Direct oral anticoagulants are the first-line medication class for anticoagulation. Disposition can be challenging, and several risk assessment tools (e.g. RED-AF, AFFORD, and the AFTER (complex, modified, and pragmatic) scores) are available to assist with disposition decisions.

Conclusion

An understanding of the recent updates in the literature concerning AF with RVR can assist emergency clinicians in the care of these patients.

### Management of atrial fibrillation: guidelines from the American… [^366f4807]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS FOR PRACTICE
- Percutaneous occlusion of the left atrial appendage reduces stroke risk and mortality with similar effectiveness as warfarin.
- Surgical exclusion of the left atrial appendage during cardiac surgery reduces stroke risk with continued anticoagulation.
- Electrical cardioversion is more effective for acute rhythm control than medications.
- Catheter ablation reduces symptoms of AF, but it recurs in up to 40% of patients. From the AFP Editors Atrial fibrillation is expected to impact 12 million people by 2030 and increase mortality risk by at least 1. 5 times. It is a chaotic, irregular atrial rhythm caused by ectopic sources in the pulmonary veins of the left atrium or in response to reentrant cardiac conduction activity from interstitial fibrosis. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association released guidelines for managing patients with AF.

EVALUATION Clinical evaluation of newly diagnosed AF should include transthoracic echocardiography. Testing for cardiac ischemia and pulmonary embolism is recommended only if suggested by clinical presentation. SubscribeFrom $180

### Metoprolol vs diltiazem for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: systematic review and meta-analysis of adverse events [^3178884d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous (IV) diltiazem and metoprolol are commonly used to achieve rate control for atrial fibrillation with RVR (Afib with RVR), and are both recommended as first-line by current guidelines. While prior studies investigated the efficacy of these medications, there is little evidence available regarding the risk of adverse events (AEs) with their use.

Methods

We identified randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies reporting rates of AEs following administration of IV diltiazem and metoprolol for Afib with RVR by searching PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Our primary outcome was the incidence of AEs and specifically hypotension and bradycardia, which were examined individually as secondary outcomes. We performed random-effects meta-analysis to identify rates of each AE. We used moderator analysis and meta-regressions to evaluate risk factors. We used the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess study quality.

Results

We reviewed 13 studies and included 1660 patients, 888 (53%) treated with metoprolol and 772 (47%) with diltiazem. Metoprolol was associated with a 26% lower risk of AE (total incidence 10%) compared to diltiazem (total incidence 19%), (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56–0.98, p = 0.034) with a prediction interval of 0.50–1.10. Patients with higher initial heart rates faced higher rates of AEs (Correlation Coefficient 0.11, 95% CI 0.03–0.19, p = 0.006). There was no difference with respect to rates of bradycardia (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.15–1.30, p = 0.14) or hypotension (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61–1.04, p = 0.10).

Conclusion

Afib with RVR treated with metoprolol had lower rates of AE (bradycardia and/or hypotension) compared to those treated with diltiazem. We found no difference in rates of hypotension or bradycardia when individually assessed. Existing data are limited by small sample sizes, variability in dosing, and limited representation of important patient subgroups.

### Intravenous diltiazem versus metoprolol for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: a meta-analysis [^bddae922]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous diltiazem and metoprolol are both commonly used to treat atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) in the emergency department (ED), but the advantages and disadvantages of these drugs cannot be verified. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous diltiazem versus metoprolol for AF with RVR.

Method

We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane library, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, China Biology Medicine disc (CBM) and the WeiPu (VIP). Meta-analysis was performed using weighted mean difference (WMD), relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4.1.

Results

Seventeen studies involving 1214 patients in nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and eight cohort studies were included in meta-analysis, including 643 patients in the intravenous diltiazem group and 571 patients group in the intravenous metoprolol. The results of the meta-analysis showed that compared with intravenous metoprolol, intravenous diltiazem was found higher efficacy (RR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.16, p < 0.00001), shorter average onset time (RR = -1.13; 95% CI = -1.97 to -0.28, p = 0.009), lower ventricular rate (RR = -9.48; 95% CI = -12.13 to -6.82, p < 0.00001), less impact on systolic blood pressure (WMD = 3.76; 95% CI: 0.20 to 7.33, P = 0.04), and no significant difference in adverse events (RR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.55 to 1.14, P = 0.22) and diastolic blood pressure (WMD = -1.20; 95% CI: -3.43 to 1.04, P = 0.29) was found between intravenous diltiazem and metoprolol.

Conclusion

Intravenous diltiazem has higher efficacy, shorter average onset time, lower ventricular rate, less impact on blood pressure, and with no increase in adverse events compared to intravenous metoprolol.

### Intravenous metoprolol versus diltiazem for atrial fibrillation with concomitant heart failure [^2efb3dd0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Atrial fibrillation (Afib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) is acutely treated with intravenous push (IVP) metoprolol (MET) or diltiazem (DIL). In heart failure (HF) patients, diltiazem is not recommended due to negative inotropic effects. Studies comparing the treatment of atrial fibrillation often exclude HF. Hirschy et al. evaluated HF patients with concomitant Afib with RVR who received IVP metoprolol or diltiazem to determine their effectiveness and safety. They found similar safety and effectiveness outcomes between the two groups.

Methods

This retrospective, IRB-approved study evaluated patients presenting to the emergency center (EC) with Afib with RVR and HF from January 1, 2018 to July 31, 2021. Included patients were 18 years of age or older, received IVP metoprolol or diltiazem in the EC, and had a recorded baseline ejection fraction (EF). The primary effectiveness outcome was successful heart rate (HR) control 30 min after treatment with either IVP metoprolol or diltiazem, which was defined as HR < 100 beats per minute (bpm). Secondary effectiveness outcomes included HR control 60 min post-IVP and at EC discharge or transfer and HR reduction > 20% at 30 min after IVP, 60 min after IVP, and at time of discharge or transfer. Other secondary outcomes included the time to adequate HR control, the total dose of IVP metoprolol or diltiazem given, any additional rate-controlling agents given, and crossover between metoprolol and diltiazem. Safety outcomes included bradycardia, hypotension, shortness of breath, increased oxygen requirements, change in EF, acute kidney injury or renal replacement therapy.

Results

Of 2580 evaluated, 193 patients were included (134 DIL vs. 59 MET) with age 73.3 ± 12.2 years, 63% female. The average EF was 48.2 ± 14.2% and 30% of patients had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) while 64% had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Effective heart rate control 30 min post-IVP was not different between the two groups (55% DIL vs. 41% MET, p = 0.063). DIL effectively controlled HR quicker than MET (13 [9, 125] DIL vs. 27 [5, 50] MET, min, p = 0.009). DIL resulted in greater HR reductions at 30 min (33.2 ± 25.4 DIL vs. 19.7 ± 19.7 MET, bpm, p < 0.001) and at 60 min (31 ± 23.5 DIL vs. 19.6 ± 19.1 MET, bpm, p = 0.002). DIL also more frequently resulted in a HR reduction of 20% or greater at 30 min (63% DIL vs. 27% MET, p < 0.001), 60 min post-IVP (59% DIL vs. 41% MET, p = 0.019), and at time of patient discharge or transfer from the EC (70% DIL vs. 49% MET, p = 0.005). No differences in safety outcomes were identified.

Conclusion

Acute management of patients with Afib with RVR and HF is challenging. While successful rate control at 30 min was not significantly different between diltiazem and metoprolol, IVP diltiazem reduced HR more quickly and reduced HR by 20% or greater more frequently than IVP metoprolol with no safety outcome differences. Further studies are needed to evaluate diltiazem's safety in patients with Afib and HF.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation in congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in the emergency department [^c940f894]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute heart rate control for atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the emergency department (ED) is often achieved utilizing intravenous (IV) non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) or beta blockers (BB). For patients with concomitant heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the American Heart Association and other clinical groups note that CCB should be avoided due to their potential negative inotropic effects. However, minimal evidence exists to guide this current recommendation. The primary objective of this study was to compare the incidence of adverse effects in the HFrEF patient population whose AF with RVR was treated with IV diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED.

Methods

This single center, retrospective review included patients ≥ 18 years old with HFrEF who presented in AF with RVR and received IV diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED. The primary outcome was adverse effects of therapy defined as: 1) hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg requiring fluid bolus or vasopressors) or bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beats/min) within 60 min of medication administration 2) worsening heart failure symptoms defined as increased oxygen requirements within four hours or inotropic support within 48 h. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of rate control failure, patient disposition, ED length of stay, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality.

Results

One hundred and twenty-five patients met inclusion criteria, with 57 receiving diltiazem and 68 receiving metoprolol. Overall adverse effects for diltiazem and metoprolol were similar (32% vs. 21%, P = 0.217). However, there was a significantly higher incidence of worsening heart failure symptoms within the diltiazem group (33% vs 15%, P = 0.019). Rate control failure at 60 min did not differ significantly between diltiazem and metoprolol (51% vs 62%, P = 0.277).

Conclusions

In HFrEF patients with AF, there was no difference in total adverse events in patients treated with IV diltiazem compared to metoprolol. However, the diltiazem group had a higher incidence of worsening CHF symptoms defined as increased oxygen requirement within four hours or initiation of inotropic support within 48 h.

### Multicenter, phase 2, randomized controlled study of the efficacy and safety of etripamil nasal spray for the acute reduction of rapid ventricular rate in patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (ReVeRA-201) [^5ebf9dc3]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Etripamil's action to reduce VR in patients with AF-RVR occurred with a rapid timing, aligned with drug's pharmacokinetics, a critical attribute given the burdensome symptoms of AF-RVR, the limitations of current options for prompt treatment, and the need to achieve rate control of AF before instituting longer term or rhythm-control strategies. Patients treated with etripamil in ReVeRA showed VR reduction as early as 2 minutes, with a median time to maximal reduction of 13 minutes, and with the majority of etripamil-treated patients achieving a defined responder level (eg, VR < 100 bpm) within 10 minutes.

Regarding duration of effect, findings of reduction in VR, from either baseline or relative to placebo treatment, persisted for up to 150 minutes in patients with AF-RVR treated with etripamil. For patients achieving a VR < 100 bpm over the first 60 minutes post drug, the median duration of maintaining a VR < 100 bpm was 45.5 minutes in the etripamil arm. The duration of pharmacodynamic effects of etripamil exceed the duration of peak plasma levels of drug. This persistence of pharmacodynamic effect, or the drug having atrioventricular-nodal electrophysiological impact longer than predicted solely by pharmacokinetics, may allow for the ≈150-minute duration of VR reduction relative to placebo observed in ReVeRA. As well, early VR reduction and symptom relief may attenuate the perpetuation of AF-RVR. The observed duration of drug effect could be an important attribute to allow for rate control before orally administered therapies becoming effective.

### Comparison of sustained rate control in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: metoprolol vs. diltiazem [^f97d3bb0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare sustained rate control with intravenous (IV) diltiazem vs. IV metoprolol in acute treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This retrospective chart review at a large, academic medical center identified patients with AF with RVR diagnosis who received IV diltiazem or IV metoprolol in the ED. The primary outcome was sustained rate control defined as heart rate (HR) < 100 beats per minute without need for rescue IV medication for 3 h following initial rate control attainment. Secondary outcomes included time to initial rate control, HR at initial control and 3 h, time to oral dose, admission rates, and safety outcomes.

Results

Between January 1, 2016 and November 1, 2018, 51 patients met inclusion criteria (diltiazem n = 32, metoprolol n = 19). No difference in sustained rate control was found (diltiazem 87.5% vs. metoprolol 78.9%, p = 0.45). Time to rate control was significantly shorter with diltiazem compared to metoprolol (15 min vs. 30 min, respectively, p = 0.04). Neither hypotension nor bradycardia were significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Choice of rate control agent for acute management of AF with RVR did not significantly influence sustained rate control success. Safety outcomes did not differ between treatment groups.

### Impact and treatment success of new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate development in the surgical intensive care unit [^3f847c14]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR; heart rate > 100) in noncardiac postoperative surgical patients is associated with poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the practice patterns of AF management in a surgical intensive care unit to determine practices associated with rate and rhythm control and additional outcomes.

Materials and Methods

Adult patients (≥ 18 y) admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) from June 2014 to June 2015 were retrospectively screened for the development of new-onset AF with RVR. Demographics, hospital course, evaluation and treatment of AF with RVR, and outcome were evaluated and analyzed.

Results

Thousand seventy patients were admitted to the SICU during the study period; 33 met inclusion criteria (3.1%). Twenty-six patients (79%) had rate and rhythm control within 48 h of AF with RVR onset. β-Blockers were the most commonly used initial medication (67%) but were successful at rate and rhythm control in only 27% of patients (6/22). Amiodarone had the highest rate of success if used initially (5/6, 83%) and secondarily (11/13, 85%). Failure to control rate and rhythm was associated with a greater likelihood of comorbidities (100% versus 57%; P = 0.06).

Conclusions

New-onset AF with RVR in the noncardiac postoperative patient is associated with a high mortality (21%). Amiodarone is the most effective treatment for rate and rhythm control. Failure to establish rate and rhythm control was associated with cardiac comorbidities. These results will help to form future algorithms for the treatment of AF with RVR in the SICU.

### Multicenter, phase 2, randomized controlled study of the efficacy and safety of etripamil nasal spray for the acute reduction of rapid ventricular rate in patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (ReVeRA-201) [^4df86285]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The majority of common AEs in ReVeRA were localized to the drug's administration site and mild-moderate, as has been observed with etripamil administration in patients with PSVT, and serious treatment emergent AEs were rare (occurring in 1 and 2 patients in the etripamil and placebo arms, respectively). These safety findings, taken together with the extensive data set from the etripamil program in PSVT, including intranasal administration to > 1600 PSVT patients, indicate that the drug is well tolerated.

AF is associated with multiple morbiditiesand leads to > 785 000 emergency department visits and hospitalizations and 158 000 deaths in the United States annually. Regardless of type of AF, exacerbations of the arrhythmia often require acute care for RVR and may necessitate IV medication to reduce RVR to improve cardiac output. AF-RVR, left untreated, increases risk of complications (eg, heart failure, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy). In a recent case-crossover analysis, AF-RVR that persisted for > 6 hours weekly was associated with increased odds of death. Promptly treating the rapid VR in patients with AF-RVR is customary practice, is recommended before rhythm control strategies, and, importantly, would rapidly address AF-RVR symptoms that many patients experience.

Chronic, oral medication strategies include rate control with CCBs or β-blockers and rhythm control with class IC or class III antiarrhythmic drugs. These treatments can have limited effectiveness and AEs and when administered acutely, are associated with a delayed response. Moreover, before AF treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug (pill in the pocket) or a nonurgent cardioversion, control of RVR is critical. Thus, a drug administered to patients with AF-RVR to quickly control rapid rates would have utility to precede other treatments. Etripamil has not been associated with drug-drug interactions through the drug's development; furthermore, concomitant treatment with cardiac medications was allowed in both the PSVT program and in the ReVeRA study. Data on etripamil NS, reported here, imply the potential for this drug, rapidly deployed, to have role in conjunction with or before other treatments, and should be an area of further investigation.

### Multicenter, phase 2, randomized controlled study of the efficacy and safety of etripamil nasal spray for the acute reduction of rapid ventricular rate in patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (ReVeRA-201) [^8ec8ca11]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia that affects over 6 million patients in the United Statesand over 37 million worldwide. More than 12 million in the United States may be affected by 2030.

Patients with AF frequently experience episodes of rapid ventricular rate (RVR) associated with burdensome symptoms, including palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, and anxiety, which often require medical intervention. Patients with AF-RVR currently have few options available for immediate treatment and frequently present to an emergency department where treatment consists of intravenous β-blocker, IV calcium channel blocker (CCB), or electrical cardioversion. There is a need for a self-administered medication that can rapidly reduce symptomatically elevated heart rates, both to quickly alleviate problematic symptoms and to precede longer–term treatment options.

Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society and the European Society of Cardiology recommend, for the acute management of AF, reducing the heart rate using IV medications, thereby emphasizing the importance of rapid treatment. Chronic therapy for prevention can be associated with ineffective rate control with breakthrough RVRs. When acutely administered for episodes of RVR, oral therapies (ie, pill-in-pocket β-blocker or L-type CCB) do not provide immediate rate control due to a delayed onset of action and have associated adverse events (AEs). –

Etripamil nasal spray (NS) is a fast-acting, self-administered CCB and new chemical entity that prolongs refractoriness and conduction velocity through the atrioventricular node. The drug is rapidly absorbed by the nasal mucosa, with a maximum concentration reached within 7 minutes after 70 mg dose. The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the self-administered drug, have been studied in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), demonstrating significant and rapid termination of PSVT with preceding slowing of the tachycardia rate and reduced emergency department care. – Preclinical and clinical data show that etripamil results in slower rates of tachycardias conducted utilizing the atrioventricular node soon after intranasal administration, illustrating the drug's action. Furthermore, self-administered etripamil has been observed to slow the ventricular rate (VR) in a small cohort of patients with symptomatic AF-RVR. Clinical data show general tolerability and limited AEs in > 1600 patients with PSVT, supporting the likely safety of investigating etripamil in patients with AF-RVR. –

### Heart rate outcomes with concomitant parenteral calcium channel blockers and beta blockers in rapid atrial fibrillation or flutter [^5aa85df9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients who present with atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hemodynamic stability may be managed with either an intravenous (IV) nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a beta-blocker (BB). Patients without improved heart rates may need to switch to, or add, a second AV nodal blocker.

Objective

To evaluate the incidence of rate control achievement and bradycardia in patients in AF or atrial flutter with RVR who receive both an intravenous CCB and a BB.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of patients who received concomitant intravenous CCB or BB for the treatment of rapid AF or atrial flutter from April 2016 through July 2018 in the emergency department. Patients were excluded if the second agent was ordered but not administered, or if they received IV amiodarone or digoxin.

Results

A total of 136 patients were included in the analysis, and of those, 46% (n = 62) of patients achieved a heart rate < 110 bpm without bradycardia, and 3.7% (n = 5) developed bradycardia. Age, initial heart rate, time between CCB and BB administration, addition of an oral CCB or BB administration, or administration of IV magnesium did not impact target heart rate achievement.

Conclusion

Adding a second nodal blocker in patients who did not achieve rate control with the first agent resulted in heart rate control 46% of the time. The development of symptomatic bradycardia was uncommon.

### Achieving ventricular rate control in patients taking chronic β-blocker therapy [^6f48e8d1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The objective of this study is to evaluate the difference in response to ventricular rate control with intravenous (IV) metoprolol compared to IV diltiazem in patients taking chronic beta-blocker therapy who present to the emergency department (ED) in atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR).

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective study of adult patients taking chronic oral metoprolol. Chronic metoprolol therapy was defined as patients prescribed and taking oral metoprolol within 5days of study inclusion. Rate control was defined as either a decrease in ventricular rate < 100bpm or < 120bpm if the decrease was at least 20% from the presenting heart rate.

Results

A total of 332 patients were included, with 16 patients in the IV diltiazem group and 316 patients in the IV metoprolol group. In the diltiazem arm, 68.8% of patients achieved successful rate control compared to 42.4% of patients in the metoprolol group (p = 0.067). Treatment with IV metoprolol resulted in more hospital admissions (58% vs. 6.25% with diltiazem, p < 0.001). Treatment with diltiazem was associated with a greater incidence of bradycardia compared to IV metoprolol (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.002).

Conclusions

The use of IV diltiazem was associated with a higher rate of successful response to rate control compared to IV metoprolol in patients in AF with RVR on chronic beta-blocker therapy, however the difference between groups was not statistically significant.

### Hemodynamic comparison of intravenous push diltiazem versus metoprolol for atrial fibrillation rate control [^b8ebcbf0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Intravenous push (IVP) diltiazem and metoprolol are commonly used for management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) in the emergency department (ED). This study's objective was to determine if there was a significant difference in blood pressure reduction between agents.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective study of adult patients initially treated with IVP diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED from 2008 to 2018. Primary endpoint was mean reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to nadir during the study period. Study period was defined as time from first dose of IVP intervention to 30 min after last dose of IVP intervention or first dose of maintenance therapy, whichever came first.

Results

A total of 63 diltiazem patients and 45 metoprolol patients met eligibility criteria. Baseline characteristics were similar except for initial ventricular rate (VR) and home beta-blocker use. Median dose of initial intervention was 10 [10–20] mg and 5 [5–5] mg for diltiazem and metoprolol respectively. Mean SBP reduction was 18 ± 22 mmHg for diltiazem compared to 14 ± 15 mmHg for metoprolol (p = .33). Clinically relevant hypotension was similar between groups 14% vs. 16% (p = .86). Rate control was achieved in 35 (56%) of the diltiazem group and 16 (36%) of the metoprolol group (p = .04).

Conclusion

IVP diltiazem and metoprolol caused similar SBP reduction and hypotension when used for initial management of AF with RVR in the ED. However, rate control was achieved more often with diltiazem.

### Metoprolol vs. diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^f64ecc55]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of metoprolol versus diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

This retrospective cohort study of patients with HFrEF in AF with RVR receiving either intravenous push (IVP) doses of metoprolol or diltiazem was conducted between January 2012 and September 2016. The primary outcome was successful rate control within 30 min of medication administration, defined as a heart rate (HR) < 100 beats per minute or a HR reduction ≥ 20%. Secondary outcomes included rate control at 60 min, maximum median change in HR, and incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion to normal sinus rhythm within 30 min. Signs of worsening heart failure were also evaluated.

Results

Of the 48 patients included, 14 received metoprolol and 34 received diltiazem. The primary outcome, successful rate control within 30 min, occurred in 62% of the metoprolol group and 50% of the diltiazem group (p = 0.49). There was no difference in HR control at predefined time points or incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion. Although baseline HR varied between groups, maximum median change in HR did not differ. Signs of worsening heart failure were similar between groups.

Conclusions

For the acute management of AF with RVR in patients with HFrEF, IVP diltiazem achieved similar rate control with no increase in adverse events when compared to IVP metoprolol.

Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Patients

A total of 87 patients were screened, 69 were randomized, and 56 received study drug. No patients were lost to follow-up. Thirteen randomized patients were not included in the mITT population as they were no longer eligible to receive study drug (per protocol) because baseline heart rate was < 110 bpm (n = 5); conversion to sinus rhythm (n = 3); hemodynamic instability based on specified definition (n = 1); technical issues with the ECG cardiac monitoring device (n = 3); and other (site misinterpretation of the protocol, n = 1; Figure 2). The reasons to exclude these patients from the mITT population were independent of the treatment assigned, which was blinded at the time of the decision. Of the 56 patients comprising the mITT population, 27 received etripamil and 29 received placebo. The efficacy (n = 49), mITT (n = 56), and safety (n = 56) populations are shown in Figure 2. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the treatment groups. The median age was 64 years (range, 45–88) in the etripamil and 66 years (range, 35–83) in the placebo arms 39% of participants were female patients and 75%, 18%, and 7% of participants had a history of paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent AF, respectively. There was minimal imbalance in the preenrollment use of oral β-blockers and antiarrhythmic drugs between etripamil and placebo arms (Table 1).

### Acute rate control with metoprolol versus diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^049bcfa9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Compare heart rate control between parenteral metoprolol and diltiazem and identify safety outcomes in the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

This retrospective, single-center, cohort study included adult patients with HFrEF who received intravenous (IV) metoprolol or diltiazem for AFib RVR in the emergency department (ED). The primary outcome was rate control defined as HR < 100 bpm or a HR reduction ≥ 20% within 30 min of first dose administration. The secondary outcomes included rate control within 60 min and 120 min from first dose, need for repeat dosing, and disposition. Safety outcomes included hypotensive and bradycardic events.

Results

Out of 552 patients, 45 patients met the inclusion criteria with 15 in the metoprolol group and 30 in the diltiazem group. Using bootstrapping method, patients treated with metoprolol were equally able to reach the primary outcome as those treated with diltiazem (BCa 95% CI: 0.14, 4.31). Hypotensive and bradycardia events remained zero in both groups.

Conclusion

Our study provides further evidence that short term use of diltiazem is likely as safe and effective as metoprolol in the acute management of HFrEF patients with AFib RVR and provides support for the use of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non-DHP CCBs) in this patient population.

### The effect of serum calcium level on the success of diltiazem treatment: a retrospective cohort study [^4218066e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diltiazem is an antiarrhythmic drug widely used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). It reveals its effect by blocking L-type calcium channels. Thus, it inhibits the extracellular calcium influx into the cytosol. The relationship between serum calcium level and the efficacy of intravenous (IV) diltiazem used in the treatment of AFib with RVR has not been investigated in vivo. The aim of this study is to investigate the mentioned relationship.

Methods

This study was planned as a single-center retrospective study. The data of 349 patients who presented to the emergency department with AFib with RVR and treated with diltiazem were retrospectively analyzed. A patient was considered to have responded to diltiazem treatment if the existing heart rhythm returned to sinus rhythm, or the heart rate decreased below 100 beats/min, or the heart rate decreased > 20% provided that it was below 120 beats/min. The ionized calcium levels were recorded. The relationship between serum calcium level and the success of diltiazem treatment was examined.

Results

Fifty five percent of the patients were female. The median age was 75 years. The rate of response to diltiazem treatment was 67.3%. The median of ionized calcium levels in the group which responded to diltiazem treatment (n = 235) was 1.14 mmol/L (IQR: 0.12), and the group which did not respond to diltiazem treatment (n = 114) was 1.11 mmol/L (IQR: 0.12) (p = 0.322). The patients were divided into three groups as low, normal, and high calcium levels according to the calcium reference levels determined by the hospital laboratory. The rate of response to diltiazem treatment was 61.4% in patients with low ionized calcium levels, 76.1% in patients with normal ionized calcium levels, and 40.0% in patients with high ionized calcium levels. The rate of response to diltiazem treatment was higher in patients with normal ionized calcium levels compared to patients with low or high ionized calcium levels (p = 0.004, p = 0.003).

Conclusion

The success rate of diltiazem used in the treatment of AFib with RVR was highest in physiological calcium levels. The current study may provide the clinician with awareness about the consideration of serum ionized calcium levels when choosing drugs in patients with AFib with RVR.

### Impact of intravenous calcium with diltiazem for atrial fibrillation / flutter in the emergency department [^dabd5095]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of early intravenous (IV) calcium on systolic blood pressure (SBP) when administered with IV diltiazem in subjects with atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter (AFL) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the Emergency Department (ED).

Methods

This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study that evaluated adults admitted to the ED with documented AF or AFL, heart rate (HR) > 120 bpm, SBP 90 to 140 mmHg, and received treatment with IV diltiazem for rate control. The primary outcome was the change in SBP 60 min (± 30 min) after initial IV diltiazem administration. Secondary outcomes included time to initial rate control (HR < 100 bpm), time to sustained rate control (HR < 100 bpm for 3 h), change in HR, rates of hypotension, bradycardia, hypercalcemia, and line extravasation within 24 h of initial diltiazem administration.

Results

There were 198 subjects in the diltiazem monotherapy group and 56 subjects in the diltiazem with calcium group meeting the inclusion criteria. The primary outcome, median change in SBP 60 min after initial IV diltiazem administration, was similar between groups (-2 mmHg vs -1.5 mmHg; p = 0.642), but this difference was not statistically significant. All secondary outcomes were found to be similar between groups. Although not statistically significant, hypotension occurred more often in the diltiazem with calcium group (20.2% vs 32.1%; p = 0.060) while bradycardia occurred more often in the diltiazem monotherapy group (4.5% vs 0%; p = 0.213). In terms of achieving rate control, the administration of calcium with diltiazem did not significantly change the time to initial rate control (1.4 h vs 1.8 h; p = 0.141) or time to sustained rate control (7.9 h vs 7.7 h; p = 0.570) compared to diltiazem alone.

Conclusions

In the setting of AF/AFL with RVR, administration of IV calcium with IV diltiazem did not show a significant impact on clinical or safety outcomes compared to IV diltiazem monotherapy.

### Intravenous metoprolol versus diltiazem for rate control in atrial fibrillation [^6fe6de7a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Currently, it remains unclear whether β-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are preferred for the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of patients who presented to the emergency department between 2015 and 2019 with AF with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) and received IV metoprolol or diltiazem. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who achieved rate control (defined as heart rate < 100 beats per minute). Secondary outcomes included time to rate control, percentage of patients requiring additional agents for rate control, and incidence of cardioversion, bradycardia, and hypotension.

Results

A total of 200 patients were included in this study. Rate control was achieved in 35% and 41% of the metoprolol and diltiazem groups, respectively (P = 0.38). Mean time to rate control was not significantly different between the metoprolol and diltiazem groups (35 vs 21 minutes, P = 0.23). One patient developed hypotension, no patient developed bradycardia, and 4 patients required electric cardioversion. No adverse events were observed in patients with ejection fraction ≤ 40%.

Conclusion and Relevance

There was no difference in the achievement of rate control between IV metoprolol and diltiazem. This is the largest study to date comparing the two classes of agents for acute rate control in AF. No patient-specific factors were identified that would influence the preferential use of one medication over the other.

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in pregnancy — rate control: In hemodynamically stable pregnant patients with AF or AFL with rapid ventricular rates (RVR), intravenous beta-blockers are recommended as the first-line option and diltiazem or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, alone or in combination, are recommended as second-line options for initial rate control in the absence of preexcitation (Class 1, C-LD). In pregnant patients with AF or AFL with RVR, beta-blockers, digoxin, or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers alone or in combination, are reasonable for rate control with the choice of drug dependent on the underlying maternal cardiac substrate (Class 2a, C-LD).

### Comparison between β-blockers and calcium channel blockers in patients with atrial fibrillation according to renal function [^eef82090]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Rate control is the most commonly employed first-line management strategy for atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Principal agents used to control heart rate (HR) include beta-blockers (BB) and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (ND-CCB). However, there is a paucity of published studies of the differences between those drugs in CKD patients.

Hypothesis

The present study aimed to investigate the differences, in terms of hospitalizations due to a poor HR control, in patients with AF under a rate-control strategy according to glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

Methods

The study cohort included 2804 AF patients under rate-control regime (BB or ND-CCB) between January 2014 and April 2020. The end point, determined by competing risk regression, was hospitalizations for AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR), slow ventricular response (SVR), and need for pacemaker.

Results

On multivariate analysis, there were no statistical differences between ND-CCB and BB for subjects with GFR > 60mL/min/1.73m 2 (subdistribution heart rate [sHR] 0.850, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61–1.19; p = .442) and GFR 30-59mL/min/1.73m 2 (sHR 1.242, 95% CI: 0.80–1.63; p = .333), while in patients with GFR < 30mL/min/1.73m 2, ND-CCB therapy was associated with increased hospitalizations due to poor HR control (sHR 4.53, 95% CI: 1.19–17.18; p = .026).

Conclusion

In patients with GFR ≥ 30mL/min/1.73m 2, the choice of ND-CCB or BB had no impact on hospitalizations due to poor HR control, while in GFR < 30mL/min/1.73m 2, a possible association was detected. The effects of these drugs on GFR < 30mL/min/1.73m 2 would require further investigation.

Atrial fibrillation or flutter with rapid ventricular response — synopsis: Treating AF/flutter with rapid ventricular rates depends on hemodynamic stability, and unstable patients and those with rate-related ischemia often need urgent electrical cardioversion. Stable patients can be treated pharmacologically to achieve rate or rhythm control. Conversion of AF/flutter greater than 48 hours in nonanticoagulated patients risks thromboembolic events. For acute AF/flutter assessed as less than 48 hours, decision making is more nuanced, requiring expert consultation unless emergent cardioversion is needed. Pre-excited AF/flutter (Wolff–Parkinson–White) is covered under Wide-Complex Tachycardias.

### Comparison between β-blockers and calcium channel blockers in patients with atrial fibrillation according to renal function [^1468ab64]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Rate control is the most commonly employed first‐line management strategy for atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Principal agents used to control heart rate (HR) include beta‐blockers (BB) and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (ND‐CCB). However, there is a paucity of published studies of the differences between those drugs in CKD patients.

Hypothesis

The present study aimed to investigate the differences, in terms of hospitalizations due to a poor HR control, in patients with AF under a rate‐control strategy according to glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

Methods

The study cohort included 2804 AF patients under rate‐control regime (BB or ND‐CCB) between January 2014 and April 2020. The end point, determined by competing risk regression, was hospitalizations for AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR), slow ventricular response (SVR), and need for pacemaker.

Results

On multivariate analysis, there were no statistical differences between ND‐CCB and BB for subjects with GFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (subdistribution heart rate [sHR] 0.850, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61–1.19; p = .442) and GFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (sHR 1.242, 95% CI: 0.80–1.63; p = .333), while in patients with GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, ND‐CCB therapy was associated with increased hospitalizations due to poor HR control (sHR 4.53, 95% CI: 1.19–17.18; p = .026).

Conclusion

In patients with GFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, the choice of ND‐CCB or BB had no impact on hospitalizations due to poor HR control, while in GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, a possible association was detected. The effects of these drugs on GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 would require further investigation.

Minimizing unnecessary ventricular pacing — clinical impact and pacing strategies — highlights increasing recognition of deleterious effects of right ventricular apical (RVA) pacing and a correlation of percent ventricular pacing with heart failure hospitalization and new-onset AF; in MOST, ventricular pacing frequency was 90% with DDDR versus 58% with VVIR. In a randomized Danish sinus node dysfunction study of AAIR, DDDR with long atrioventricular (AV) delay (300 milliseconds), and DDDR with short AV delay (less than or equal to 150 milliseconds), ventricular pacing prevalence was 17% with DDDR–long–AV–delay versus 90% with DDDR–short–AV–delay, AF incidence at 2.9 years was 7.4% with AAIR, 17.5% with DDDR–long–AV–delay, and 23.3% with DDDR–short–AV–delay, and left atrial and left ventricular (LV) dimensions increased in both DDDR groups but not AAIR. Conclusions about deleterious effects of RV pacing should be limited to RVA pacing, and progression to symptomatic AV block including syncope with atrial versus dual-chamber pacing was 1.9%.

### Update on medical management of atrial fibrillation in the modern era [^d608efb9]. Heart Rhythm (2009). Low credibility.

The management of atrial fibrillation involves control of the ventricular response rate, anticoagulation to reduce the risk of stroke and attempts to maintain sinus rhythm. The approach to patients with atrial fibrillation has become increasingly complex as therapeutic options have expanded. The ultimate reasons to treat atrial fibrillation include improvement in symptoms, reduction in adverse outcomes and improvement in survival. Despite increasing interest in non pharmacological approaches to treat and potentially cure atrial fibrillation, drugs remain the primary method to treat most patients. This review updates the present state-of-the-art regarding medical management of atrial fibrillation based on present and emerging evidence.

Background

Inappropriate shocks in patients with implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICD) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and generate great discomfort and stress. The leading cause is fast-conducting atrial fibrillation misinterpreted as ventricular tachycardia. We present the case of a patient with multiple inappropriate shocks due to fast-conducting atrial fibrillation (AF) who was effectively treated with atrioventricular node (AVN) ablation and left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) using the existing single-chamber ICD.

### Cardiac events in patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated with venetoclax combined with hypomethylating agents [^21ac32d8]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Forty-eight cardiac events were documented in 34 (20%) patients, 11 of whom (32%) had > 1 event; in these 11 patients, 23 of 25 events were concurrent rather than recurrent (Table 1; supplemental Table 1). Eighteen of 48 (38%) cardiac events occurred in the setting of concurrent infection. Cardiac event rates were similar despite treatment setting or HMA used: 23/109 (21%) in patients treated upfront vs 11/61 (18%) in the relapsed setting (P = 0.46) and 16/34 (47%) treated with azacitidine vs 18/34 (53%) treated with decitabine (P = 0.62). The most frequent events included a symptomatic decrease in LVEF on echocardiography (21%, n = 10) with median LVEF decrease of 14%, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) (17%, n = 8), followed by troponin elevation without electrocardiogram changes (15%, n = 7). Among the 7 patients with troponin elevation, 4 experienced events in the setting of another inciting factor such as severe anemia, whereas the remainder represented a troponin elevation without another explanation (Table 1). Other cardiac events included worsening heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF) (n = 4), non–atrial fibrillation arrhythmia (n = 4), and pericardial effusion or pericarditis (n = 3). Notably, 2 patients experienced a fatal cardiopulmonary arrest (Table 1). Per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 grading criteria, 37% (n = 18/48) of events were grades 1 to 2, with 44% (n = 21/48) being grades 3 to 4 and 19% (n = 9/48) being grade 5.

### Efficacy of intravenous magnesium for the management of non-post operative atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f035e3db]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous magnesium (IV Mg), a commonly utilized therapeutic agent in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response, is thought to exert its influence via its effect on cellular automaticity and prolongation of atrial and atrioventricular nodal refractoriness thus reducing ventricular rate. We sought to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of IV Mg versus placebo in addition to standard pharmacotherapy in the rate and rhythm control of AF in the nonpostoperative patient cohort given that randomized control trials (RCTs) have shown conflicting results.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing IV Mg versus placebo in addition to standard of care were identified via electronic database searches. Nine RCTs were returned with a total of 1048 patients. Primary efficacy endpoints were study-defined rate control and rhythm control/reversion to sinus rhythm. The secondary endpoint was patient experienced side effects.

Results

Our analysis found IV Mg in addition to standard care was successful in achieving rate control (odd ratio [OR] 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13–3.11, p = .02) and rhythm control (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.04–2.03, p = .03). Although not well reported among studies, there was no significant difference between groups regarding the likelihood of experiencing side effects.

Conclusions

IV Mg, in addition to standard-of-care pharmacotherapy, increases the rates of successful rate and rhythm control in nonpostoperative patients with AF with rapid ventricular response and is well tolerated.

Arrhythmias during pregnancy — cardioversion and acute rate control: Cardioversion is generally safe during pregnancy; elective cardioversion is part of a rhythm-control strategy and can be done as a standalone procedure or in combination with antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and when restoring sinus rhythm, stroke prevention strategies, such as anticoagulation and transesophageal echocardiogram, should be performed as in the nonpregnant state. Retrospective database evaluations and case reports show relative safety and tolerance for the acute use of intravenous beta-blockers, digoxin, and/or calcium channel blockers for rate control in AF/AFL with RVR during pregnancy.

Atrial fibrillation or flutter with rapid ventricular response — electrical therapies: In adult patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular rates, immediate electrical cardioversion should be performed to restore sinus rhythm (1 C-LD). Urgent direct-current cardioversion of new onset atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular rates in the setting of acute coronary syndrome is recommended for adult patients with hemodynamic compromise, ongoing ischemia, or inadequate rate control (1 C-LD). For synchronized cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in adults using any currently US-approved biphasic wave form defibrillator, an initial energy setting of at least 200 J is reasonable and increment in the event of shock failure, depending on the biphasic defibrillator used (2a B-R). The usefulness of double synchronized cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in adults as an initial treatment strategy is uncertain (2b B-R). For synchronized cardioversion of atrial flutter in adults, an initial energy setting of 200 J may be reasonable and increment in the event of shock failure, depending on the biphasic defibrillator used (2b C-LD). The usefulness of double synchronized cardioversion as a rescue treatment for shock-refractory atrial fibrillation in adults is uncertain (2b C-LD).

Atrial fibrillation and flutter with rapid ventricular response — medical therapies include the following recommendations: Intravenous (IV) administration of a β-adrenergic blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist is recommended to slow the ventricular rate in the acute setting in adult patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response without preexcitation (COR 1, LOE B-NR). IV amiodarone can be useful for rate control in critically ill adult patients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response without preexcitation (COR 2a, LOE B-NR). In adult patients with preexcitation atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, digoxin, nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists, β-adrenergic blockers, and IV amiodarone should not be administered (COR 3: Harm, LOE C-LD). Nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists and IV β-adrenergic blockers should not be used in adult patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and decompensated heart failure because these may lead to further hemodynamic compromise (COR 3: Harm, LOE C-EO).

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — definition and electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics — is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterized by uncoordinated atrial activation with consequent deterioration of atrial mechanical function. On the ECG, AF is characterized by the replacement of consistent P waves by rapid oscillations or fibrillatory waves that vary in amplitude, shape, and timing, associated with an irregular, frequently rapid ventricular response when atrioventricular (AV) conduction is intact, and regular cardiac cycles (R-R intervals) are possible in the presence of AV block or ventricular or AV junctional tachycardia. The ventricular response to AF depends on electrophysiologically (EP) properties of the AV node and other conducting tissues, the level of vagal and sympathetic tone, the presence or absence of accessory conduction pathways, and the action of drugs, and in patients with implanted pacemakers, diagnosis of AF may require temporary inhibition of the pacemaker to expose atrial fibrillatory activity. A rapid, irregular, sustained, wide-QRS-complex tachycardia strongly suggests AF with conduction over an accessory pathway or AF with underlying bundle-branch block, and extremely rapid rates (over 200 beats per minute) suggest the presence of an accessory pathway or ventricular tachycardia.

### Randomized controlled trial of fixed rate versus rate responsive pacing after radiofrequency atrioventricular junction ablation: quality of life, ventricular refractoriness, and paced QT dispersion [^e727097f]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2003). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ablation of the AV junction is a widely accepted treatment of drug-refractory atrial fibrillation. Long-term pacing of the right ventricular (RV) apex following AV junction ablation can result in adverse cardiac remodeling. However, anecdotal studies report that pacing too slowly following AV junction ablation was associated with propensity to sudden cardiac death. The aim of this study was to provide information about the balance between measures of quality of life versus measures of electrical remodeling achieved by pacing with different rate modalities in a randomized pilot clinical trial.

Methods and Results

Patients with permanent atrial fibrillation were randomized to VVI (80 beats/min) versus VVIR (minimum rate 80 beats/min), whereas patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were randomized to DDI versus DDDR pacing at discharge from hospital. Serially, measurements of exercise capacity, quality of life, cycle length dependence of QT dispersion (QTdisp), RV refractoriness, and the incidence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia were made in 28 patients over a 6-month follow-up period. Time-dependent increases in QTdisp were observed in patients randomized to the rate responsive mode (RR-ON) but only when paced at 40 beats/min. This was paralleled by time-dependent increases in RV refractoriness (270 ± 11 ms at baseline to 302 ± 5 ms at 6 months) in patients with RR-ON. RR-ON also was associated with trends to an increasing incidence of episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and worsening of some measures of quality of life. Exercise capacity was not substantially different in the randomized groups.

Conclusion

Rate responsive pacing results in electrical remodeling of the ventricle following AV junction ablation, but exercise capacity was similar in groups with RR-ON or RR-OFF.

Clinical evaluation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) — minimum evaluation includes history and physical examination to define presence and nature of symptoms associated with AF; clinical type of AF (first episode, paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent); onset of the first symptomatic attack or date of discovery of AF; frequency, duration, precipitating factors, and modes of termination of AF; response to any pharmacological agents that have been administered; and presence of any underlying heart disease or other reversible conditions (e.g., hyperthyroidism or alcohol consumption). Electrocardiogram is used to identify rhythm (verify AF), LV hypertrophy, P-wave duration and morphology or fibrillatory waves, preexcitation, bundle-branch block, prior MI, and other atrial arrhythmias, and to measure and follow the R-R, QRS, and QT intervals in conjunction with antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Transthoracic echocardiogram is used to identify valvular heart disease; LA and RA size; LV size and function; peak RV pressure (pulmonary hypertension); LV hypertrophy; LA thrombus (low sensitivity); and pericardial disease. Blood tests of thyroid, renal, and hepatic function are specified for a first episode of AF, when the ventricular rate is difficult to control.

### Atrial fibrillation: is rhythm control required, and If so, how, and what is the internist's role? [^34e70567]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation-no primary care physician can escape it! Atrial fibrillation is the most common tachyarrhythmia encountered in clinical practice-whether family practice, internal medicine, cardiology, pulmonology medicine, etc. Moreover, with growth of the older segment of our population and better survival of patients with cardiovascular disorders, the incidence and prevalence of atrial fibrillation are both increasing progressively. Currently, a review of major guidelines shows that the treatment approach to atrial fibrillation involves 4 "pillars"-treatment of contributory comorbidities ("upstream therapy"), control of the ventricular response to the rapid atrial rates during atrial fibrillation, prevention of thromboembolism with oral anticoagulation or left atrial appendage occlusion (except in the minority of patients at too low a thromboembolic risk), and rhythm control in those patients who require it. The latter is the most complex of the 4, and many, if not most, primary care physicians currently prefer to leave this "pillar" to the care of a cardiologist or electrophysiologist. Nonetheless, it is important for the primary care physician to be familiar with the rhythm treatment components and choices (both overall and, specifically, the ones in which they must participate) as they will impact many interactions with their patients in multiple ways. This review details for the primary care physician the components of care regarding rhythm control of atrial fibrillation and the areas in which the primary care physician/internist must be knowledgeable and proactively involved.

In these 2025 Advanced Life Support Guidelines, the American Heart Association provides comprehensive recommendations for the resuscitation and management of adults experiencing cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, and life-threatening cardiovascular emergencies. Based on structured evidence reviews and the latest clinical research, these guidelines offer evidence-based strategies to optimize survival and patient outcomes. The 2025 guidelines provide guidance for the treatment of cardiac arrest, including ventricular fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, asystole, and pulseless electrical activity, as well as peri-arrest conditions such as atrial fibrillation and flutter with rapid ventricular response. Recommendations are made for defibrillation, electrical cardioversion, advanced airway management, drug therapies, and intravenous access. Additionally, guidelines are provided for the use of double sequential defibrillation, head-up cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and point-of-care ultrasound in the advanced life support setting. Termination of resuscitation rules have been refined to guide decision-making based on the emergency medical services professional's scope of practice. Finally, these guidelines also underscore the importance of identifying causative versus secondary arrhythmias to inform the appropriate timing of therapeutic strategies.

### DOsing strategy effectiveness of diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^ecefca4b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate the dose-dependent comparative safety and effectiveness between weight-based and alternative dosing strategies for diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response who received treatment with intravenous diltiazem. Groups were retrospectively categorized according to the initial dose: low (< 0.1875 mg/kg), weight-based (0.1875 to 0.3125 mg/kg), and high (> 0.3125 mg/kg). The primary outcome was rate control (heart rate < 100 beats/min) within 30 minutes of treatment.

Results

Of 345 records, 252 were included. Because of scarcity (N = 6), outcomes for the high-dose group were not analyzed. By 30 minutes, the weight-based dosing group had more often achieved rate control (weight-based 55%; low 27%; difference 29% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17% to 40%]). Regression analysis identified the weight-based dosing group (odds ratio 3.63, 95% CI 2.06 to 6.39) and initial heart rate of less than 145 beats/min (odds ratio 2.56, 95% CI 1.46 to 4.51) as variables associated with the primary outcome. The weight-based dosing group less often required rescue therapy (weight-based 6%; low 17%; difference -12% [95% CI -20% to -4%]) relative to the low-dose group. Mortality was higher in the low-dose group than in the weight-based dosing group (low 7%; weight-based 1%; difference 6% [95% CI 1% to 11%]).

Conclusion

This study shows dose-dependent hemodynamic effects with diltiazem in patients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Weight-based diltiazem (0.25 mg/kg) was associated with greater rate control with no evidence of increased adverse effects. There was no perceived advantage in using lower, alternative doses.

Right ventricular apical pacing and atrial fibrillation — risk and comparative pacing outcomes are summarized as follows: "RV apical pacing can increase the risk of new onset and progression of AF." In a large prospective study of patients with sinus node dysfunction indicated for pacemaker implantation, conventional dual‑chamber rate‑modulated pacing with an AV delay of 120–180 ms resulted in 99% RVP and a 12.7% incidence of progression from no/paroxysmal AF to persistent AF; use of an RVP prevention algorithm lowered RVP (9.1%) and persistent AF progression (7.9%) (P = 0.004). Observational comparisons of HBP versus RVP in patients with either no prior AF or paroxysmal AF found significantly lower new‑onset AF with HBP in one study (20.8% HBP and 40.8% RVP) without reduction in AF progression, and another showed a significantly lower rate of new‑onset AF (7.3% vs 18.8%, 20.4% of patients with RV septal/RV apical pacing) with no significant reduction in AF progression. Compared to RVP, LBBAP was associated with lower new‑onset AF risk with a relative risk reduction of 59% for AF episodes ≥ 6 minutes (P = 0.035) in a retrospective cohort of 410 patients and in a prospective cohort of 527 patients, especially when ventricular pacing was > 20% (relative risk reduction 72%; P < .001).

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Supraventricular arrhythmias in chronic heart failure — The course of patients with HF is frequently complicated by supraventricular tachyarrhythmias; the most common treatable atrial arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation, which affects 10% to 30% of patients with chronic HF and is associated with reduced exercise capacity and worse long-term prognosis. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias may exert adverse effects by 4 different mechanisms, including loss of atrial enhancement of ventricular filling with compromised output, rapid heart rate increasing demand and decreasing coronary perfusion, diminished contraction and relaxation with rapid ventricular response, and stasis in fibrillating atria predisposing to emboli. In most patients with an ischemic or nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, the rapidity of ventricular response is more important than the loss of atrial support, because restoration of sinus rhythm does not result in predictable clinical benefits, and rapid supraventricular arrhythmias may actually cause or exacerbate a cardiomyopathy.

Managing episodes of bradycardia associated with postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) — AF occurs commonly after cardiac surgery in adults, with a peak incidence 2 to 4 days postoperatively and an overall incidence ranging from 10% to 65%; postoperative AF occurs more frequently in patients undergoing valve surgery than in those undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft; bradycardia may take several forms in these patients, including slow ventricular response during AF and prolonged sinus pauses after sinus rhythm is restored; a slow and regular ventricular response during AF usually indicates complete heart block, and pacing may be required if resolution does not occur; in general, bradyarrhythmias in the setting of postoperative AF should be treated similarly to those occurring in the nonoperative setting, and a period of watchful waiting rather than early PPM implantation is generally used; in occasional patients with refractory AF with rapid ventricular responses associated with significant SND limiting rate control drugs, a PPM may be required for adequate AF management.

Direct-current cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and flutter — recommendations: When a rapid ventricular response does not respond promptly to pharmacological measures in AF with ongoing myocardial ischemia, symptomatic hypotension, angina, or HF, immediate R-wave synchronized direct-current cardioversion is recommended (Level of Evidence: C). Immediate direct-current cardioversion is recommended for AF with preexcitation when very rapid tachycardia or hemodynamic instability occurs (Level of Evidence: B). Cardioversion is recommended in patients without hemodynamic instability when AF symptoms are unacceptable, and in case of early relapse after cardioversion, repeated direct-current attempts may be made following administration of antiarrhythmic medication (Level of Evidence: C). As Class IIa, direct-current cardioversion can be useful to restore sinus rhythm as part of a long-term management strategy in AF (Level of Evidence: B), and patient preference is a reasonable consideration for infrequently repeated cardioversions in symptomatic or recurrent AF (Level of Evidence: C). As Class III, frequent repetition of direct-current cardioversion is not recommended when periods of sinus rhythm are relatively short after multiple procedures despite prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug therapy (Level of Evidence: C), and electrical cardioversion is contraindicated in patients with digitalis toxicity or hypokalemia (Level of Evidence: C).

### Can we improve outcomes in AF patients by early therapy? [^f5e024a8]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Commentary

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and affects at least 1% of the population, amounting to 5.5 to 7 million patients with AF in Europe. AF is characterized by very rapid, irregular electrical activation of the atria (350 to 400 bpm), resulting in 1) loss of coordinated contraction and transport function in the atria and 2) irregular ventricular rate and loss of ventricular rate adaptation to increased demands (arrhythmia absoluta). In an ageing population, the prevalence and incidence of AF will increase dramatically in the next decades. Unlike most other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, atrial fibrillation can usually not be cured. Rather, most patients progress from paroxysmal AF, that is, AF that alternates with periods of sinus rhythm, to sustained forms (Figure 1), even when currently available therapeutic options are applied. This sobering finding is aggravated by the dramatic consequences that AF implies in affected individuals and for society (Table 1).

Table 1
Consequences of AF in affected individuals.

Other relevant outcomes in AF are indicated in.

Figure 1
Natural time course of atrial fibrillation. Shown is a typical chaotic pattern of time in atrial fibrillation (black) and time in sinus rhythm (grey) over time (x-axis). Atrial fibrillation progresses from undiagnosed to first diagnosed, paroxysmal, persistent, to permanent. Flashes indicate cardioversions as examples for therapeutic interventions that influence the natural time course of the arrhythmia. Reproduced with permission from.

One of the reasons why AF is so difficult to cure is probably the complex etiology of the arrhythmia as recently outlined in two consensus conferences on AF: AF can be caused by atrial structural damage conferred by cardiac or extracardiac disease and rapid irregular ventricular rate, a sign of natural ageing of the heart, and an electrical accident due to abnormal electrical function of the heart. Furthermore, AF perpetuates itself by altering electrical function of the atria (Figure 2). Unfortunately, all of these mechanisms form vicious circles and are severely aggravated once AF has manifested. Usually, several of these factors have to concur before the arrhythmia develops.

Suppression of atrial fibrillation through pacing — several studies have examined atrial pacing, either in the right atrium (RA) alone or at more than one atrial location, to prevent recurrent paroxysmal AF; in symptomatic bradycardia, the risk of AF is lower with atrial than with ventricular pacing; in sinus node dysfunction with normal atrioventricular conduction, randomized trial data support atrial or dual-chamber rather than ventricular pacing for prevention of AF.

Rate control targets and agents in CHD with IART or atrial fibrillation indicate it is generally assumed that uncontrolled IART or atrial fibrillation is undesirable and that sudden cardiac death has been reported from rapidly conducting atrial tachyarrhythmias in systemic right ventricles and univentricular hearts. Clinical trial targets have included a maximum heart rate of 80 bpm at rest and < 110 bpm on exertion, while more lenient objectives in patients without CHD, including a mean resting heart rate ≥ 80 bpm, have been associated with similar outcomes; some management guidelines have revised the recommended resting ventricular rate target to < 100 bpm. Beta-blocking drugs and nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) can be used to achieve ventricular rate control with insufficient evidence to recommend one agent over another; digoxin is not recommended as sole therapy to control the ventricular rate response, particularly in patients with paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmias. Beta-blockers are associated with a decreased incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with transposition of the great arteries and atrial switch surgery, such that it may be reasonable to liberalize use of beta-blockers in this patient population if well tolerated, and nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists and digoxin are generally avoided in the presence of preexcitation because they may paradoxically accelerate the ventricular response rate.

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in pregnancy — pharmacological rhythm control: In pregnant patients with AF or AFL with persistent symptoms or RVR refractory or with contraindications to beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, pharmacological cardioversion with ibutilide, or flecainide in the absence of SHD, is reasonable, with the choice of drug dependent on the underlying maternal cardiac substrate (Class 2a, C-LD). In pregnant patients with AF or AFL with continued symptoms or RVR despite rate control therapy, flecainide in the absence of SHD or sotalol in the absence of severe LV dysfunction are reasonable for rhythm control, with the choice of drug dependent on the underlying maternal cardiac substrate (Class 2a, C-LD). In pregnant patients with AF or AFL with continued severe symptoms or RVR, amiodarone may be considered when alternative pharmacological therapy and/or catheter ablation are ineffective or contraindicated (Class 2b, C-LD).

Management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure (HF) — key guideline recommendations state that in patients with a new diagnosis of HFrEF and AF, arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy should be suspected, and an early and aggressive approach to AF rhythm control is recommended; in appropriate patients with AF and HFrEF on guideline-directed medical therapy and with reasonable expectation of benefit, catheter ablation is beneficial to improve symptoms, quality of life (QOL), ventricular function, and cardiovascular outcomes; in symptomatic AF with HFpEF and reasonable expectation of benefit, catheter ablation can be useful to improve symptoms and QOL; for AF with HF, digoxin is reasonable for rate control, either with other rate-controlling agents or as monotherapy if others are not tolerated; when AF with HF presents with rapid ventricular rates and beta blockers or calcium channel blockers are contraindicated or ineffective, intravenous amiodarone is reasonable for acute rate control; in AF, HF, HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 50%) with refractory rapid ventricular response and not candidates for or failing rhythm control, atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) with biventricular pacing can be useful to improve symptoms, QOL, and LVEF; in AF and HF with implanted biventricular pacing where effective pacing percentage cannot be achieved pharmacologically, AVNA can be beneficial to improve functional class, reduce ICD shock risk, and improve survival; after recovery of LV function from AF‑induced cardiomyopathy, long-term surveillance can be beneficial to detect recurrent AF; for suspected AF‑induced cardiomyopathy or refractory HF symptoms on pharmacological rate control, a stricter rate-control strategy (target heart rate ≤ 80 bpm at rest and < 110 bpm during moderate exercise) may be reasonable; in AF and HFrEF undergoing AVNA, His bundle or left bundle branch area pacing may be reasonable as an alternative to biventricular pacing to improve symptoms, QOL, and LVEF; and in AF with known LVEF < 40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel–blocking drugs should not be administered because of the potential to exacerbate HF.

Atrioventricular nodal ablation (AVNA) in atrial fibrillation (AF) — recommendations: In patients with AF and a persistently rapid ventricular response who undergo AVNA, initial pacemaker lower rate programming should be 80 to 90 bpm to reduce the risk of sudden death. In patients with AF and uncontrolled rapid ventricular response refractory to rate-control medications (who are not candidates for or in whom rhythm control has been unsuccessful), AVNA can be useful to improve symptoms and quality of life. In patients with AF who are planned to undergo AVNA, implantation of a pacemaker before the ablation (ie, before or same day of ablation) is recommended to ensure adequate back-up pacing leads before performing ablation. In patients with AF with normal ejection fraction undergoing AVNA, conduction system pacing of the His bundle or left bundle area may be reasonable.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — perioperative and postdischarge recommendations for noncardiac surgery state that in patients with rapid AF identified during noncardiac surgery (NCS), it is reasonable to treat potential underlying triggers contributing to AF and rapid ventricular response (Class of Recommendation [COR] 2a; Level of Evidence [LOE] C-LD). In patients with new-onset AF identified in the setting of NCS, initiation of postoperative anticoagulation therapy can be beneficial after considering the competing risks associated with thromboembolism and perioperative bleeding (COR 2a; LOE C-LD). For patients with new-onset AF identified in the setting of NCS, outpatient follow-up for thromboembolic risk stratification and AF surveillance are recommended given a high risk of AF recurrence (COR 1; LOE C-LD).

Adult advanced life support — scope of the 2025 American Heart Association guidelines provides comprehensive recommendations for resuscitation and management of adults experiencing cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, and life-threatening cardiovascular emergencies and offers evidence-based strategies to optimize survival and patient outcomes. The 2025 guidelines provide guidance for treatment of cardiac arrest including ventricular fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, asystole, and pulseless electrical activity, as well as peri-arrest conditions such as atrial fibrillation and flutter with rapid ventricular response, with recommendations for defibrillation, electrical cardioversion, advanced airway management, drug therapies, and intravenous access. Additionally, guidelines are provided for the use of double sequential defibrillation, head-up cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and point-of-care ultrasound in the advanced life support setting; termination of resuscitation rules have been refined to guide decision-making based on the emergency medical services professional's scope of practice; and the guidelines underscore the importance of identifying cause versus secondary arrhythmias to inform the appropriate timing of therapeutic strategies.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF)–associated bradycardia in adults after cardiac surgery commonly occurs, with a peak incidence 2 to 4 days postoperatively and an overall incidence ranging from 10% to 65%. Bradycardia may present as slow ventricular response during AF or as prolonged sinus pauses after sinus rhythm is restored; a slow and regular ventricular response during AF usually indicates complete heart block, and pacing may be required if resolution does not occur. In general, bradyarrhythmias in the setting of postoperative AF should be treated similarly to those occurring in the nonoperative setting, and a period of watchful waiting rather than early PPM implantation is generally used; in occasional patients with refractory AF with rapid ventricular responses associated with significant SND limiting rate control drugs, a PPM may be required for adequate AF management.

Each of the criteria proposed in the table deserves thought and deliberation, particularly with respect to the use of beta‐blockers. Since not all beta‐blockers reduce mortality, the only members of the drug class that warrant inclusion in stratum I are those that have been specifically shown to reduce mortality in large‐scale trials. Furthermore, analyses of these trials have raised important questions about the ability of beta‐blockers to prolong survival in patients with atrial fibrillation, 48 potentially because the target doses used in the pivotal trials may have caused excessive slowing of the ventricular response, which predisposed to fatal bradyarrhythmic events. 49 Consequently, patients with atrial fibrillation who are treated with a beta‐blocker are assigned to stratum I with no designated target heart rate, since heart rates of 80–90 bpm may be appropriate targets for the use of beta‐blockers if patients have atrial fibrillation. 50

Device therapy and management of advanced heart failure

Cardiac resynchronization therapy decreases mortality and prevents hospitalizations in patients with symptomatic HF, LVEF ≤ 35%, and QRS duration ≥ 120 ms. Between 25 and 50% of patients eligible for CRT have AF, although patients with AF are not well represented in randomized trials of CRT. At present, CRT is a class IIa recommended therapy in patients with HF and concomitant AF. Loss of AV synchrony and rapid ventricular rates in AF may impair benefit from CRT and small studies have suggested that the beneficial effect is rather due to AV node ablation. A meta-analysis of 23 observational studies including 7495 recipients suggests that patients with AF have a higher rate of non-response to CRT (35 vs. 28%, P = 0.001). Recent data from 8951 patients with AF and HF in the US NCDR registry demonstrated that CRT-D therapy was associated with lower mortality, all-cause, and HF readmissions compared with ICD therapy alone. Thus while response rates are lower in patients with AF, CRT should still be pursued in appropriate patients and every attempt should be made to ensure aggressive rate control. This is important to ensure biventricular pacing is as close to 100% as possible, and avoid inappropriate shocks. AV node ablation should be considered in cases of tachycardia refractory to medical therapy.

Patients with HFrEF and AF often present unique challenges when implanted pump-support is required. Increased hospitalization and mortality have been observed in patients with the HeartMate II left ventricular assist device (adjusted HR for persistent AF 3.54; 95% CI 1.52–8.25; P < 0.01), with more frequent thromboembolic events in AF despite higher INR.

5.4 Combined Effects of AF and Rapid Ventricular Rates

Guichard et al. attempted to parse the contributions of AF‐induced atrial tachyarrhythmia versus rapid ventricular rates to atrial remodeling. In their experimental studies in dogs, rapid atrial pacing shortens atrial refractoriness and action potential duration and slows atrial conduction. Rapid ventricular pacing also slows atrial conduction but does not shorten atrial refractoriness or action potential duration (Figure 5). Each component produced discrete features: AF‐induced atrial arrhythmia caused accelerated repolarization and abbreviated refractoriness, strongly increased vulnerability to AF induction by premature ectopic beats, conduction slowing, and moderate atrial fibrosis, whereas ventricular tachyarrhythmia, that is, mimicked by rapid ventricular pacing, slightly increased vulnerability, slowed conduction, and induced moderate fibrosis without affecting repolarization/refractoriness. Combined atrial and ventricular arrhythmia abbreviated refractoriness, strongly increased vulnerability and fibrosis, and greatly increased AF stability/duration. This study suggests that in the absence of ventricular rate control, the rapid ventricular response itself can cause AF‐promoting atrial remodeling without overt HF.

Atrial fibrillation — digoxin provides limited rate control with delayed onset, is not first-line for rapid management, and has important adverse effects and interactions. Although intravenous digoxin may slow the ventricular response to AF at rest, there is a delay of at least 60 min before onset and the peak effect does not develop for up to 6 h; digoxin is no more effective than placebo in converting AF to sinus rhythm, in a review of 139 episodes of paroxysmal AF there was no difference between those taking digoxin and those not, and digoxin is no longer considered first-line therapy for rapid management of AF except in patients with HF or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or in very sedentary patients. According to a systematic review, digoxin alone slows resting heart rate by an average of 4 to 21 beats per minute but does not slow heart rate during exercise in AF; the most frequent adverse effects are ventricular arrhythmias, atrioventricular (AV) block, and sinus pauses, and serum digoxin concentration may rise with verapamil or antiarrhythmic agents such as propafenone or amiodarone.

Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF)–associated bradycardia after cardiac surgery — AF occurs commonly after cardiac surgery in adults, with a peak incidence 2 to 4 days postoperatively and an overall incidence ranging from 10% to 65%. Postoperative AF occurs more frequently in patients undergoing valve surgery than in those undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft. Bradycardia may take several forms in these patients, including slow ventricular response during AF and prolonged sinus pauses after sinus rhythm is restored. A slow and regular ventricular response during AF usually indicates complete heart block, and pacing may be required if resolution does not occur. The assessment of bradyarrhythmias in this setting is often complicated by the coexistence of atrial tachyarrhythmia; transient and time-dependent postoperative effects of sinus and atrioventricular node function, and the potential presence of antiarrhythmic drugs. In general, bradyarrhythmias in the setting of postoperative AF should be treated similarly to those occurring in the nonoperative setting, and a period of watchful waiting rather than early PPM implantation is generally used. In occasional patients with refractory AF with rapid ventricular responses associated with significant SND limiting rate control drugs, a PPM may be required for adequate AF management.

Atrial fibrillation acute rate control — comparative trials report that "Intravenous diltiazem was more effective than intravenous digoxin in 2 small RCTs.6,7" In one emergency department trial, investigators "randomized 150 patients with AF without major comorbidities and a ventricular rate > 120 bpm in a 1:1:1 ratio to intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, and amiodarone.6" with "time to reduce the heart rate < 90 bpm" shorter with diltiazem. Another RCT of "30 patients" found diltiazem "significantly decreased heart rate within 5 minutes versus 3 hours with intravenous digoxin.7" Diltiazem also reduced rate "more rapidly than intravenous digoxin in a double-blinded RCT in 40 patients with rapid AF after CABG, with similar control at 12 to 24 hours." Additional evidence shows "In another RCT of 84 patients in rapid AF who presented to the emergency department, intravenous amiodarone resulted in faster control of the ventricular response compared with intravenous digoxin.8" and "Finally, 52 patients with rapid AF were randomized to receive either an intravenous combination of diltiazem and digoxin or intravenous diltiazem alone, with a more rapid and durable response to the combination.9"

Clinical Perspective

Atrial fibrillation (AF) has gained increasing attention owing to its rising incidence in recent years. Exacerbation of AF symptoms has become a significant concern alongside the deterioration of clinical outcomes such as stroke, systemic embolism, and heart failure. These symptoms manifest in various forms including palpitations, exertional dyspnea, chest discomfort, fatigue, and weakness in patients with AF and constitute common manifestations.

AF can be categorized as paroxysmal AF (PAF), persistent AF (PeAF), or permanent AF based on the burden of AF. Contrary to intuitive expectations, previous studies have indicated that patients with PAF may report more severe symptoms than those with PeAF. These symptoms are mainly related to rapid ventricular responses to AF, and medications aimed at controlling tachyarrhythmias have been found to alleviate these AF‐related symptoms. Conversely, for patients with PeAF, a relatively weak correlation was observed between AF symptoms and heart rate (HR). A greater reduction in HR may be necessary to meaningfully alleviate symptoms in this patient group. However, the precise mechanism behind this phenomenon is yet to be clearly understood.

Dyspnea associated with AF or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is attributed to pulmonary edema resulting from increased left ventricular filling pressure; this is often assessed in terms of left ventricular end‐diastolic pressure. Within this framework, the H 2 FPEF score estimating the probability of HFpEF was developed based on the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, while closely approximating left atrial pressure (LAP). Tachycardia significantly influences LAP levels and their fluctuations, thereby exacerbating dyspnea in patients with AF. Therefore, understanding the relationship between LAP changes and tachycardia is critical for elucidating the mechanism underlying varying dyspnea in patients with AF according to AF type, particularly during episodes of rapid ventricular response or under physiological conditions, such as adrenergic stimulation and exercise.

This prospective study focused on a cohort undergoing AF catheter ablation (AFCA) and aimed to directly measure and compare LAP across different types of AF, a range of H 2 FPEF scores, and in response to LAP changes triggered by various tachycardia mechanisms, including right atrial pacing and isoproterenol infusion. This study was conducted by indirectly inferring the potential existence of HFpEF and dyspnea symptoms using LAP and H 2 FPEF scores.

### Rhythm control versus rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: insights from get with the guidelines-heart failure [^7d74af7c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for one half of all heart failure (HF) visits and hospital admissions in the United States. Patients with HFpEF have similar risks of morbidity and all‐cause mortality as patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). 1, 2 Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in patients with HF, occurring in approximately one third of patients. 3, 4, 5, 6 In patients with HFpEF, the prevalence of AF ranges from 15% to 41% in registries and clinical trials. 6

Patients with HF and AF have worse outcomes than patients with HF without AF. 7 The HF guidelines focus their recommendations on prevention of thromboembolism and symptom control with the goal to correct underlying causes of AF and HF and optimize HF management. The guidelines then differentiate patients who develop HF as a result of AF and patients who have HF and go on to develop AF. 8 Patients with newly diagnosed HF in the presence of AF with rapid ventricular response are recommended to undergo rhythm control, as a rate‐related cardiomyopathy is a reversible cause of HF. There is no other specific recommendation for rate versus rhythm control in the HF guidelines. 8 The AF guidelines recommend rhythm control only in patients who remain symptomatic despite rate control treatment. 9 A recent meta‐analysis revealed that all‐cause mortality is significantly higher in patients with AF and HFrEF compared with patients with AF and HFpEF, yet stroke risk and HF hospitalization rates were similar among both groups. 10 Similar comparisons in the GWTG‐HF (Get With The Guidelines — Heart Failure) registry extends these prior findings, demonstrating that AF is common in patients with HF and associated with higher mortality, readmissions, and HF readmissions. 11

HFpEF and AF have shared risk factors, confer increased risks for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and frequently occur together. 6, 12 Despite accumulating epidemiologic data detailing worse outcomes in patients with HFpEF complicated by AF, there are no medical therapies that have been definitively shown to improve outcomes for patients with HFpEF. As a result, the guideline writing committees limit their scope to treatment of associated comorbidities. 8, 13, 14, 15, 16 To describe current treatment patterns and subsequent outcomes in patients with HFpEF complicated by AF, we analyzed the GWTG‐HF registry linked to Medicare claims data.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rate control, acute control, choice of agents, EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate rate control therapy in patients with AF as initial therapy in the acute setting, as an adjunct to rhythm control therapies, or as a sole treatment strategy to control HR and reduce symptoms.

### Ventricular rate control as an endpoint for treatment of atrial fibrillation [^43cbf92a]. Heart Rhythm (2004). Low credibility.

Interest in the use of rate control as an endpoint for managing atrial fibrillation likely will increase given the results of recent randomized clinical trials. As an endpoint, rate control has favorable attributes of ease of measurement and clear numerical definitions. Pharmacologic rate control is achieved in approximately 80% of patients in large clinical trials. Ablation and pacing may achieve rate control in all patients. Rate control has been shown to improve quality of life over pretreatment status. However, several issues regarding the use of rate control as an endpoint are unsettled. Technical issues concerning when and how to measure heart rate remain. The current definitions of rate control are lacking in scientific foundation and demonstration of clinical relevance. Heart rate control during exercise may be difficult to achieve in many patients despite control at rest. Finally, the relationship of rate control to some important clinical outcomes has not been established.

Atrial fibrillation long-term rate control — synopsis highlights effective classes and selection considerations. Both nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem) and beta blockers are effective for long-term rate control, and these agents are useful in ventricular rate control in the absence of preexcitation. Digoxin may be useful in patients with limited tolerability to other agents, or as adjunct therapy in patients with a difficult to control ventricular rate. Limited data exist comparing various rate control agents, especially in the setting of chronic rate control, and selection of specific agents should consider patient-specific characteristics (ie, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF], reactive airway disease) and response.

### Achieving ventricular rate control using metoprolol in β-blocker-naive patients vs patients on chronic β-blocker therapy [^432531b3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The objective of the study is to evaluate the difference in ventricular rate control using an intravenous (IV) metoprolol regimen commonly used in clinical practice in patients receiving chronic β-blocker therapy compared to patients considered β-blocker naive admitted to the emergency department (ED) for atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate.

Methods

A single-center retrospective cohort study of adult ED patients who were admitted with a rapid ventricular rate of 120 beats per minute (bpm) or greater and treated with IV metoprolol was performed. Rate control was defined as either a decrease in ventricular rate to less than 100 bpm or a 20% decrease in heart rate to less than 120 bpm after metoprolol administration. Patient demographics, differences in length of stay, and adverse events were recorded.

Results

A total of 398 patients were included in the study, with 79.4% (n = 316) receiving chronic β-blocker therapy. Patients considered to be β-blocker naive were more likely to achieve successful rate control with IV metoprolol compared to patients on chronic β-blocker therapy (56.1% vs 42.4%; P = 0.03). β-Blocker-naive status was associated with a shorter length of stay in comparison to patients receiving chronic β-blocker therapy (1.79 vs 2.64 days; P < .01).

Conclusion

Intravenous metoprolol for the treatment of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate was associated with a higher treatment response in patients considered β-blocker naive compared to patients receiving chronic β-blocker therapy.

### Prognostic significance of ventricular rate at discharge in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation and HF [^5474a69b]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia and is associated with an increased risk of heart failure (HF), systemic thromboembolism, and mortality. It is seen in 10% to 45% of patients with congestive HF at initial presentation. Its presence in HF patients is associated with worse prognosis in terms of morbidity and mortality. Frequently, cause-effect relationship cannot be established at the time of presentation, as persistent atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate can lead to HF, and on the contrary, severe HF can be complicated by atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate.

In atrial fibrillation, the relationship between ventricular rate and congestive HF is complex. Optimal management of HF, through neuro-hormonal influences, decreases sympathetic activity and thus slows ventricular rate. Slowing ventricular rate by atrioventricular blockade leads to improved ventricular filling and cardiac output. In individual patients, it is very difficult to establish which of the above is more critical; however, controlling ventricular rate is intuitive and is associated with improvement in HF. The optimal ventricular rate that is associated with the best long-term outcome remains a matter of debate.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with HF (rate control), ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering IV amiodarone for acute rate control in patients with AF and HF with rapid ventricular rates if β-blockers or CCBs are contraindicated or ineffective.

Supraventricular tachycardia mechanisms on the 12-lead ECG — classification by regularity and atrioventricular relationships: For a patient presenting in SVT, the 12-lead ECG can potentially identify the arrhythmia mechanism and the tachycardia should first be classified as having a regular or irregular ventricular rate; an irregular ventricular rate suggests atrial fibrillation (AF), multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), or atrial flutter with variable AV conduction, and with a rapid ventricular response AF can be misdiagnosed as a regular SVT. If the atrial rate exceeds the ventricular rate, atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia (AT) is usually present, though rare cases of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) with 2:1 conduction have been described. If the SVT is regular, this may represent AVNRT with 1:1 conduction or an SVT that involves the AV node; junctional tachycardias can be regular or irregular with variable atrial conduction, in typical AVNRT the terminal P wave lies at the end of the QRS (pseudo S in inferior leads and pseudo R' in V1), and in orthodromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT) the P wave is usually seen in the early ST‑T segment. Typical AVNRT and AVRT have a "short RP" with a 1:1 P‑QRS relationship, whereas unusual AVNRT (such as "fast‑slow") and the permanent form of junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT) have a long RP; a long RP interval is typical of AT.

### Innovative approaches to anti-arrhythmic drug therapy [^8fb8de6f]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2006). Medium credibility.

Normal cardiac function requires an appropriate and regular beating rate (cardiac rhythm). When the heart rhythm is too fast or too slow, cardiac function can be impaired, with derangements that vary from mild symptoms to life-threatening complications. Irregularities, particularly those involving excessively fast or slow rates, constitute cardiac 'arrhythmias'. In the past, drug treatment of cardiac arrhythmias has proven difficult, both because of inadequate effectiveness and a risk of serious complications. However, a variety of recent advances have opened up exciting possibilities for the development of novel and superior approaches to arrhythmia therapy. This article will review recent progress and future prospects for treating two particularly important cardiac arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation.

### Rate-responsive pacing and atrial high rate episodes in cardiac resynchronization therapy patients: is low heart rate the key? [^b2477bb1]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cardiac resynchronization (CRT) is a well‐established therapy for symptomatic heart failure (HF) patients with systolic dysfunction and prolonged QRS. 1, 2 Although implantable CRT devices provide a complete set of pacing options beyond atrio‐biventricular synchronization including rate‐responsiveness (RR), landmark CRT trials were conducted with 30 to 40 bpm lower rate programming to ensure persistent atrial sensing and actual atrial‐tracking (VDD) working mode, as per the EHRA/HRS experts statement. 3 Bernheim et al highlighted that in CRT patients atrial pacing should be avoided to ensure optimal interatrial and atrio‐ventricular synchrony, therefore the role of atrial pacing and RR function in CRT patients is unclear. 4 This impacts on optimization of device programming, and on medical therapy titration, since an important target of medical therapy in HF is to lower the heart rate, although chronotropic response may be depressed. Indeed, β‐blockers up‐titration and ivabradine addition to lower the heart rate below 60 bpm at rest is mandatory to reach optimized medical therapy, on top of which CRT is recommended. 5, 6 The prevalence of sinus node disease, that prevents β‐blockers use, in HF patients is extremely low, as to be unreported in CRT landmark trials and in current guidelines. 1, 2, 6 One single randomized trial comparing RR atrio‐biventricular pacing to atrial‐tracking modes in unselected CRT recipients yielded neutral results in terms of mortality and HF events, 7 yet, RR function may benefit specific HF patients' subgroups with very limited heart rate variability and poor rate increase in daily‐life activity, 8 meaning that this point deserves further investigation. Atrial pacing can prevent atrial fibrillation in sinus node disease patients, whereas no effect on atrial fibrillation has been demonstrated in other settings, as HF. Atrial fibrillation may be a major complication in HF patients, being a well‐known negative prognostic factor associated to increased mortality and HF progression. 9 Modern technologies of remote monitoring (RM) of implantable devices offer an extremely powerful tool to monitor atrial fibrillation and easily provide a detailed documentation of arrhythmia duration and clinical complications. In fact, RM is recommended for early detection and quantification of atrial fibrillation, 10 especially in CRT patients because it causes loss of therapy. In our analysis, we used RM in CRT recipients to investigate the association between atrial RR and the incidence of device‐detected atrial arrhythmias, namely, atrial high rate episodes (AHREs). An effort was made to assess whether any observed effect of RR function should be ascribed to atrial pacing itself or to the increased heart rate related to RR.

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) preexcitation syndromes with atrial fibrillation — treatment recommendations are: Catheter ablation of the accessory pathway is recommended in symptomatic patients with AF who have WPW syndrome, particularly those with syncope due to rapid heart rate or those with a short bypass tract refractory period (Level of Evidence: B). Immediate direct-current cardioversion is recommended to prevent ventricular fibrillation in patients with a short anterograde bypass tract refractory period in whom AF occurs with a rapid ventricular response associated with hemodynamic instability (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous procainamide or ibutilide is recommended to restore sinus rhythm in patients with WPW in whom AF occurs without hemodynamic instability in association with a wide QRS complex on the ECG (greater than or equal to 120-ms duration) or with a rapid preexcited ventricular response (Level of Evidence: C). Intravenous flecainide or direct-current cardioversion is reasonable when very rapid ventricular rates occur in patients with AF involving conduction over an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). It may be reasonable to administer intravenous quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, ibutilide, or amiodarone to hemodynamically stable patients with AF involving conduction over an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous administration of digitalis glycosides or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists is not recommended in patients with WPW syndrome who have preexcited ventricular activation during AF (Level of Evidence: B).

Cardiac arrhythmias

There is fairly uniform practice with respect to managing cardiac arrhythmias with serious arrhythmias being uncommon. Sinus tachycardia is to be expected and a new baseline acceptable heart rate of less than 100 beats per minute is generally recorded in the standing orders along with a directive against the use of beta blockers. The rate typically increases after each IL-2 dose, peaks at 2–4 hours and returns to baseline prior to the next dose. It is a compensatory response to hypotension, but is also a consequence of secondary cytokine and stress related epinephrine release and fever. It is important to distinguish the cause in order to avoid unnecessary fluid boluses. The tachycardia seems to become more pronounced and prolonged with an increased number of doses. It usually resolves over time between doses and is back to baseline before the next dose. Some centers extend the time between doses to allow recovery and others hold a dose until the next scheduled administration time.

Isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are not a contraindication to continued IL-2 dosing, but if the frequency increases (above 10/min), or patterns such as quadrigeminy or couplets or greater arise, holding IL-2 doses until recovery may be necessary. Less common cardiac arrhythmias requiring immediate intervention include supraventricular tachycardia with rapid response, atrial fibrillation with rapid response, and ventricular tachycardia. Patients may continue IL-2, if SVT or atrial fibrillation are converted/controlled, sinus rhythm is maintained or heart rate is controlled and there are no signs of cardiac damage. Ventricular tachycardia requires evaluation for cardiac damage and is an absolute contraindication to more IL-2. Rarely, evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis is noted clinically or on an EKG. This may reflect lymphocytic infiltration. If concerns exist regarding myocarditis or ischemia, then cardiac enzymes or troponin should be monitored at least daily and IL-2 discontinued if confirmed.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation in heart failure

Disorganized atrial activity during atrial fibrillation (AF) has many deleterious haemodynamic effects contributing to cardiac remodelling and induction of fibrosis. Early studies proved that irregularity and loss of atrial contribution to left ventricular (LV) filling decreased cardiac output (CO). Further exploration revealed that independent of rate, irregular ventricular rhythm disables cardiac contractility to adapt during beat‐to‐beat changes in ventricular filling. In addition, AF leads to insufficient coronary flow, molecular LV remodelling, and disrupted Ca 2+ homeostasis, which eventually may induce contractile dysfunction. In brief, deleterious haemodynamic effects of AF on cardiac function can be attributed to loss of atrial contraction, reduced CO, and irregular and often rapid heart rate. Considering these facts, removing irregularity and fast ventricular response alone can increase CO and prevent long‐term deleterious effects of AF culminating in arrhythmia‐induced cardiomyopathy.

Treatment strategies

Catheter ablation enables restoration of sinus rhythm and several studies have recently demonstrated its prognostic benefit. Therefore, current guidelines recommend CA as a first‐line treatment when arrhythmia‐induced cardiomyopathy is highly probable (class I, level of evidence B, European and US guidelines). However, these benefits might be less distinct in patients with long‐standing, persistent AF in whom lower interventional success rates might be expected. Additionally, most trials do not specify ablation outcomes in persistent AF or elderly patients with more comorbidities in whom recurrences may be particularly problematic. Therefore, even though the guidelines recommend CA as a treatment of choice, alternative therapeutic strategies may be considered. Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) with permanent pacemaker implantation (pace and ablate strategy) is a feasible rate control option that offers more robust control of ventricular rate over medical therapy alone, as well as definitive rhythm regularization. A recent meta‐analysis compared the efficacy and safety endpoints among five major approaches for AF. Although CA performed best in reducing AF recurrence, the pace and ablate strategy showed superiority in reducing mortality and rehospitalization. Current 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend AVNA in patients unresponsive or intolerant to intensive rate and rhythm control therapy, and not eligible for rhythm control by CA (class IIa, level of evidence B). The choice of pacing modality depends on patient characteristics and the presence of heart failure (HF).

Left Atrial Pressure Dynamics in Response to Pacing and Isoproterenol Infusion

The LAP‐peak serves as an indicator of left ventricular end‐diastolic pressure and represents the physiological left ventricular filling pressure. This pressure is affected by various factors, including volume status, systolic and diastolic function, chamber thickness, and elasticity. Consequently, the LAP‐peak might be influenced by both the dynamic pressure exerted during left ventricular filling and chronic left atrial stiffness or fibrosis.

In our study, we observed an increase in LAP‐peak with an elevated pacing HR from 90 to 120 bpm, whereas a decrease was noted with isoproterenol infusion across the same HR range. These findings align with those reported in a prior small cohort study. The underlying mechanism involves the modulation of LAP via right atrial pacing, which alters LV diastolic filling time without changing LV distensibility, and the effects of isoproterenol, a β‐agonist that enhances LV diastolic distensibility. The LAP response to isoproterenol infusion mirrors the effects of β‐agonist, thus resembling physiological tachycardia, whereas the response to right atrial pacing reflects changes induced by tachycardia or tachyarrhythmia. However, it is important to note that rapid right atrial pacing may not accurately reflect the hemodynamic conditions present during AF with rapid ventricular responses due to differences in AV synchrony, as the loss of AV synchrony in AF with rapid ventricular responses can lead to a more pronounced increase in LAP compared with rapid right atrial pacing at the same ventricular rate. Future studies should consider methods to standardize LAP measurements across different HRs and rhythms to allow for direct comparisons between AF with rapid ventricular responses and rapid right atrial pacing.

### Atrial fibrillation in pregnancy [^14a4ed00]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Physiologic changes of pregnancy can predispose women to cardiac arrhythmias. Atrial fibrillation is rare in pregnancy and usually occurs in women with underlying cardiac anomalies.

Case

A young woman at 22 weeks of gestation presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Thorough evaluation revealed atrial fibrillation with no underlying cause and ultimately required treatment with electrical cardioversion.

Conclusion

Lone atrial fibrillation in pregnancy requires exclusion of all possible etiologies before diagnosis. Cardioversion is the treatment of choice. Women with persistent atrial fibrillation require anticoagulation and rate control, as well as fetal growth surveillance and antenatal testing.
