## Question

What are the guidelines for diabetes medication?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about current diabetes medication guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principles that guide medication selection. Then, I should verify first-line therapy and when to start combination therapy. Next, I will examine how comorbidities reshape initial choices, especially ASCVD, CKD, and heart failure. After that, I need to check risk stratification for SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists. Then, I will review insulin initiation and titration. I should also consider special populations such as older adults, those with cost barriers, and perioperative patients. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight key controversies and evidence gaps, ensuring I continuously verify claims against high-credibility sources as I go [^115Kx4cT] [^116przRK].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principles that shape medication choices across guidelines, because if I misstate these, downstream decisions will be off. Person-centered, shared decision-making is central, integrating individualized glycemic and weight goals, comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, cost and access, and patient preferences, with explicit avoidance of therapeutic inertia and routine reassessment at least every 3–6 months, which the ADA 2025 Standards repeatedly emphasize [^111gnj4N] [^113pBd7W] [^112UhBgF]. I should also confirm that lifestyle and DSMES remain foundational and are embedded in pharmacologic planning, which ADA 2025 and CDC guidance reinforce [^111BMTFs] [^113HvNGo].

> Now, I will examine first-line pharmacotherapy, and I need to ensure I am not overgeneralizing beyond the evidence. Metformin remains the preferred initial agent for most adults with type 2 diabetes due to durable A1c lowering, weight neutrality, low hypoglycemia risk, favorable safety profile, and low cost; Canadian 2024 and AAFP 2024 align with ADA on this point, and ADA 2025 continues to endorse metformin as foundational unless contraindicated or not tolerated [^111qNBNG] [^114yCGpj] [^112gSxmS]. Wait, let me verify the practical dosing advice: start low and titrate to minimize GI intolerance, typically 500 mg with meals and increase to 2000–2550 mg/day as tolerated, which the Canadian guidance details and is consistent with ADA practice patterns [^117MTcKd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about monotherapy for everyone; I should confirm when to start combination therapy. In the presence of marked hyperglycemia, such as A1c above 1.5% over target or A1c greater than 10%, initiating combination therapy is reasonable to accelerate glycemic control, with the choice of the second agent tailored to comorbidities and patient priorities, which is explicitly recommended in Canadian 2024 and supported by ADA's emphasis on timely intensification [^112Vy4C8] [^112UhBgF]. I need to ensure I also note that in symptomatic hyperglycemia or metabolic decompensation, insulin may be indicated initially, which I will address shortly [^11698p33].

> Next, I should review how comorbidities fundamentally alter the initial medication choice, and I must be precise about strength of recommendations. For established ASCVD or high ASCVD risk, ADA 2025 recommends including a GLP-1 receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit and/or an SGLT-2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit irrespective of baseline A1c, reflecting a shift toward outcomes-focused therapy beyond glycemia alone [^114CAaUz] [^116przRK]. For CKD with eGFR 20–60 mL/min/1.73 m² and/or albuminuria, an SGLT-2 inhibitor with kidney benefit is recommended, with glycemic efficacy attenuating as eGFR falls below 45; if eGFR is below 30, GLP-1 receptor agonists are preferred for glycemic control and cardiovascular risk reduction given their safety and efficacy in advanced CKD [^111CwBAi] [^114Qx47f]. For heart failure, particularly HFrEF, SGLT-2 inhibitors with proven HF benefit are prioritized, and I should double-check that this is consistent across cardiometabolic guidance, which it is in ESC 2023 and ADA 2025 [^115bxTv3] [^111gnj4N].

> I will now examine risk stratification for SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients without established ASCVD or CKD, and I need to be careful to distinguish strong from weak recommendations. The BMJ 2021 guideline provides risk-stratified recommendations: for those with more than three cardiovascular risk factors without established disease, there is a weak recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors and a weak recommendation against GLP-1 receptor agonists; for established CVD or CKD, there is a weak recommendation for both classes, with a stronger signal for SGLT-2 inhibitors when both CVD and CKD coexist; for those committed to further reducing CVD/CKD risk, SGLT-2 inhibitors are favored over GLP-1 receptor agonists [^112VEpub] [^113yfLWv]. Wait, I should verify alignment with the 2025 living BMJ guidance; it continues risk-stratified recommendations and adds finerenone and tirzepatide where appropriate, reinforcing the same principle of tailoring to baseline risk and patient goals [^1127AHR7].

> Let me consider insulin therapy indications and initiation, and I should confirm thresholds and regimen choice. ADA 2025 recommends considering insulin initiation in adults with T2DM who have symptoms of hyperglycemia or very high A1c above 10% or fasting glucose at or above 300 mg/dL, regardless of background therapy, to promptly control glucotoxicity [^111sf3fo]. I should double-check the initial regimen: basal insulin once daily with titration to fasting glucose target is preferred, and when insulin is used, combining with a GLP-1 receptor agonist can improve glycemic control, reduce weight, and lower hypoglycemia risk; reassess insulin dosing when adding or escalating GLP-1 therapy [^115WAW3q] [^111vBSgY]. But wait, what if there is metabolic decompensation or severe symptomatic hyperglycemia? In that case, insulin with or without metformin is indicated initially, with consideration of tapering insulin once stability is achieved, which Canadian guidance clarifies [^11698p33].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with older adults, and I need to ensure I capture hypoglycemia risk and functional status. For older or frail adults, most guidelines recommend relaxing A1c targets and prioritizing medications with low hypoglycemia risk, with explicit deintensification of sulfonylureas, meglitinides, or insulin when risk outweighs benefit, which ADA 2025 and geriatric-focused guidance emphasize [^11173599] [^115D4r6u]. I should confirm that this extends to fall and fracture risk mitigation, where glycemic regimens with low hypoglycemia risk are preferred to reduce falls, which ADA also notes [^113MNHez].

> I need to check guidance for patients facing cost-related barriers, because access constraints can derail evidence-based care. ADA 2025 advises considering lower-cost options such as metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and human insulin when cost limits access, while balancing hypoglycemia, weight, and cardiorenal risks, and it urges routine assessment of financial obstacles with team-based solutions to improve access [^115Kx4cT] [^115JRcg9]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with broader equity themes in contemporary algorithms; AACE 2023 similarly highlights access and cost as health equity factors in decision-making, reinforcing the need to tailor to real-world constraints [^116nzvSq].

> For perioperative care, I should confirm practical medication management steps, even though this is an area with limited procedure-specific trials. General principles include holding metformin and SGLT-2 inhibitors around the time of surgery due to lactic acidosis and euglycemic ketoacidosis risk, respectively, and coordinating insulin regimens to maintain safe glycemic ranges intra- and postoperatively, with many centers favoring basal insulin during NPO periods and rapid adjustment based on point-of-care glucose, which is summarized in anesthesia and orthopedic perioperative reviews [^112K77AP] [^11655Gr1]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should note that exact timing and agent-specific nuances vary by surgery type and local protocol, so individualized perioperative plans are essential [^112K77AP].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I should double-check that it reflects the hierarchy of evidence and guideline convergence. For most drug-naïve adults with T2DM, start metformin plus lifestyle and DSMES, titrating to tolerance and glycemic response; if A1c is markedly elevated, initiate combination therapy aligned with comorbidities and patient goals, and if symptomatic or severely hyperglycemic, begin insulin promptly with a plan to de-escalate once stable [^111qNBNG] [^112Vy4C8] [^111sf3fo]. In the presence of ASCVD or high risk, add a GLP-1 receptor agonist and/or SGLT-2 inhibitor with proven benefit irrespective of A1c; in CKD, prioritize SGLT-2 inhibitors when eGFR is adequate and pivot to GLP-1 receptor agonists in advanced CKD; in HF, prioritize SGLT-2 inhibitors with proven HF benefit; reassess every 3–6 months and avoid therapeutic inertia [^114CAaUz] [^111CwBAi] [^114Qx47f] [^112UhBgF]. I should confirm that this framework aligns with ADA 2025 and the risk-stratified BMJ recommendations, which it does, including the emphasis on shared decision-making and individualized trade-offs [^111gnj4N] [^112VEpub].

> Finally, I should review key controversies and evidence gaps, and I need to be transparent about uncertainty. Some have questioned whether metformin should remain universal first-line in an era of cardiorenal outcome trials, but most guidelines still position metformin as foundational while allowing early addition of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in high-risk patients, reflecting an outcomes-focused evolution rather than a rejection of metformin's value [^1166XBdv] [^117BKQM2]. Cost and access remain major barriers to implementing risk-stratified therapy, and real-world uptake of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists remains low despite broad eligibility, underscoring the need for policy and payer solutions [^1122m9GD]. I should also note that DPP-4 inhibitors have a limited role; avoid saxagliptin in HF risk, do not combine with GLP-1 receptor agonists, and the ACP advises against adding a DPP-4 inhibitor to metformin for mortality benefit, which I should keep in mind when selecting second agents [^111VoMQa] [^111FGoLM] [^116EFrYW].

Current diabetes medication guidelines emphasize **metformin as first-line therapy** [^111qNBNG] for type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated, with therapy individualized to comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences [^111gnj4N]. For patients with established or high risk of ASCVD, CKD, or heart failure, **prioritize SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists** [^114CAaUz] for their cardiovascular and renal benefits, regardless of A1C [^114CAaUz]. In type 1 diabetes, insulin is mandatory, and continuous glucose monitoring is recommended [^114p1JTF]. Regular monitoring, shared decision-making, and avoidance of therapeutic inertia are essential [^113pBd7W] [^112UhBgF].

---

## General principles of diabetes medication management

- **Individualized care**: Tailor therapy to comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, weight goals, and patient preferences [^111gnj4N] [^116przRK].

- **Shared decision-making**: Engage patients in treatment choices to improve adherence and outcomes [^notfound].

- **Regular monitoring**: Reassess therapy every 3–6 months, adjusting to maintain individualized A1C targets [^notfound].

- **Avoid therapeutic inertia**: Promptly intensify or deintensify therapy based on response and patient status [^112UhBgF] [^116heVy6].

---

## Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) medication guidelines

### First-line therapy

Metformin is the **preferred initial pharmacologic therapy** [^111qNBNG] due to its efficacy, safety, low hypoglycemia risk, and affordability [^114yCGpj] [^112gSxmS]. Start at 500 mg twice daily with meals and titrate to 2,000 mg/day as tolerated [^117MTcKd].

---

### Second-line therapy

Selection is based on **comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, weight goals, and patient preferences** [^111gnj4N]:

| **Medication class** | **Indications** | **Benefits** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| SGLT-2 inhibitors | ASCVD, CKD, heart failure | Cardiovascular and renal benefits | Genital infections, euglycemic ketoacidosis |
| GLP-1 receptor agonists | ASCVD, obesity | Cardiovascular benefit, weight loss | Gastrointestinal side effects, injection |
| DPP-4 inhibitors | Moderate hyperglycemia | Low hypoglycemia risk | Limited efficacy, joint pain |
| Sulfonylureas | Cost-constrained settings | Effective, inexpensive | Hypoglycemia, weight gain |
| Thiazolidinediones | Long-standing diabetes | Durable efficacy | Weight gain, edema, fractures |
| Insulin | Advanced diabetes, pregnancy | Potent glycemic control | Hypoglycemia, weight gain, injections |

---

For established ASCVD or high risk, **prioritize SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists** [^114CAaUz] for cardiovascular risk reduction, regardless of A1C [^114CAaUz]. In CKD, **SGLT-2 inhibitors** reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events [^111CwBAi]; GLP-1 receptor agonists are preferred when eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^114Qx47f]. For heart failure, **SGLT-2 inhibitors** are recommended for their cardiovascular benefits [^111gnj4N].

---

### Combination therapy

Combination therapy can be initiated at diagnosis in patients with **markedly elevated A1C** [^112Vy4C8] or when monotherapy fails to achieve targets [^1168trzw]. Common combinations include metformin with SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, or insulin [^112JRWZ1].

---

### Insulin therapy

Initiate insulin when A1C is > 10% or fasting glucose is ≥ 300 mg/dL [^111sf3fo], or in **metabolic decompensation** [^11698p33]. Begin with basal insulin and titrate to fasting glucose targets [^115WAW3q]; consider adding GLP-1 receptor agonists for enhanced glycemic control and weight benefits [^111vBSgY].

---

## Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) medication guidelines

Insulin is **mandatory** for all patients with T1DM [^114iTwS1], and regimens may include basal, bolus, or continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSII) [^notfound]. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is recommended to improve glycemic control and reduce hypoglycemia [^notfound].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Older adults**: Use lower A1C targets and avoid medications with high hypoglycemia risk [^115D4r6u] [^11173599].

- **Pregnancy**: Insulin is preferred; metformin may be considered if insulin is not feasible [^notfound].

- **CKD**: Adjust medication selection and dosing based on eGFR; prefer SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists [^111CwBAi] [^1152816u].

- **Cost-constrained settings**: Consider lower-cost options such as metformin, sulfonylureas, and human insulin [^115Kx4cT].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Regularly monitor A1C, fasting glucose, blood pressure, lipids, renal function, and weight [^117RzfkP]. Educate patients on **medication adherence, hypoglycemia recognition, and lifestyle modifications** [^113HvNGo]. Adjust therapy based on response, side effects, and patient preferences [^111gnj4N].

---

Current diabetes medication guidelines emphasize **individualized, comorbidity-driven care**, with metformin as first-line for T2DM and prioritized use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for cardiovascular and renal benefits. Insulin is essential for T1DM, and regular monitoring with shared decision-making is critical to optimize outcomes [^116przRK].

Choosing specific diabetes interventions and their roles in treating type 2 diabetes

Numerous reviews have focused on the characteristics of the specific diabetes interventions listed below. In addition, meta-analyses and reviews have summarized and compared the glucose-lowering effectiveness and other characteristics of the medications. The aim here is to provide enough information to justify the choices of medications, the order in which they are recommended, and the use of combinations of therapies. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of high-quality studies that provide head-to-head comparisons of the ability of the medications to achieve the currently recommended glycemic levels. The authors highly recommend that such studies be conducted. However, even in the absence of rigorous, comprehensive studies that directly compare the efficacy of all available glucose-lowering treatments and their combinations, we feel that there are enough data regarding the characteristics of the individual interventions to provide the guidelines below.

An important intervention that is likely to improve the probability that a patient will have better long-term control of diabetes is to make the diagnosis early, when the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes are usually less severe. Lower levels of glycemia at the time of initial therapy are associated with lower A1C levels over time and decreased long-term complications.

### Systematic review of guideline recommendations for older and frail adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115D4r6u]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Diabetes clinical practice guidelines are increasingly integrating recommendations specific for older adults.
Most diabetes clinical practice guidelines recommend a strict HbA1c target for healthier older adults and a more relaxed target older adults who are frail, medically complex or functionally impaired.
Most clinical practice guidelines place hypoglycaemic risk as central consideration in medication selection in all older adults.
Relatively few clinical practice guidelines provide pharmacotherapeutic recommendations for management of diabetes in individuals who are frail.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical practice guideline [^112VEpub]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^1166XBdv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care guidelines

In 2008, the first ADA and European Association of the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus guidelines on management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes stated that metformin, along with lifestyle interventions, should be used as first-line therapy. While the guidelines of pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes in the United States have largely remained the same, recent updates in 2019 and 2020 have added additional components in light of compelling data from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials. According to the ADA 2020 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, metformin remains the preferred first-line pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated by the patient. Other glucose-lowering agents may be added to metformin considering patient preferences, hypoglycemic risk, and comorbidities.

While the ADA still recommends metformin as first-line therapy, the updated Standards of Care have become more outcomes-focused rather than solely concentrating on glycemic control. For this reason, in patients with certain comorbidities such as high-risk for or established ASCVD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease, it is recommended to consider GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c or individualized HbA1c target. In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology, in collaboration with the EASD, went one step further in altering their treatment guidelines. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are now recommended as first-line therapy for patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk in Europe. Metformin should be considered as the first line in patients without CVD and at moderate cardiovascular risk.

Conclusion

Since metformin was approved by the FDA in 1994 it has quickly risen to front-line therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin has been associated with improvement in glycemic control, weight neutrality, and low cost as well as low risk for hypoglycemia. However, recent GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2 inhibitor outcomes trials have impacted the guidelines for diabetes management.

Appropriately, diabetes management has recently become more outcomes-focused, shifting from concentrating exclusively on glycemic control to considering the impact these medications have on complications from diabetes. Results from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials are already influencing current guidelines. The ADA Standards of Care still recommends metformin as first-line therapy while considering GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c in high-risk patients. Alternatively, the EASD recently recommended considering GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors as the first line for patients who have certain comorbidities, such as cardiovascular and renal disease. The difference in the optimal diabetes treatment in high-risk, drug-naïve patients will not resolve until we have more data from a head-to-head trial comparing metformin with newer glycemic-lowering medications or conclusive evidence from previous cardiovascular outcomes trials suggesting that metformin mitigates the beneficial effects of GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors.

While they might seem different, the two guidelines are actually similar in recommending diabetes medications with beneficial cardiovascular effects for certain high-risk patients as early as possible. Despite the current recommendations, there is still only a small portion of eligible patients who are receiving these cardio-protective medications, probably due to cost and clinical inertia. Our focus should be on expanding the use of optimal medication with cardiovascular benefits.

In summary, there are no data to suggest that metformin should not be initiated soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Furthermore, the initiation of newer glycemic-lowering medications with cardiovascular benefits should be considered in high-risk patients regardless of glycemic control or target HbA1c, yet cost remains a major factor in determining appropriate treatment.

### Developing services to support the delivery of care to people with early-onset type 2 diabetes [^117RzfkP]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

3 ARE SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR EARLY‐ONSET TYPE 2 DIABETES NEEDED?

Despite such an adverse risk profile for early‐onset type 2 diabetes, current guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes in adults, make no age‐related treatment recommendations. There are guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes in paediatric populations but these are broadly consensus‐based and currently limited in drug choice by licensing of available medications. With the exception of a few small studies that have specifically investigated treatment response in paediatric populations, there is a paucity of data providing sufficient granularity regarding the most effective medications at this age or indeed, if existing treatments show differences in efficacy based on age‐at‐onset, although this may change as further studies of glucose‐lowering therapies in children report outcomes. For adults, deriving signals from existing drug trials is also problematic as, in most large randomised controlled cardiovascular outcome trials, the median age of recruitment is in the 5th or 6th decade. The aspiration to provide age‐specific medication guidelines is, therefore, not currently achievable.

Data from the National Diabetes Audit for England and Wales (NDA) does, however, highlight areas for improvement. Each year, eight care processes on every individual coded with diabetes in GP records are submitted for audit; HbA 1c, blood pressure, cholesterol, creatinine, urine albumin to creatinine ratio, BMI, smoking and a foot check (the ninth important care process, retinal screening, was only recently included, due to prior problems of data flow in England). Greater achievement of care processes has further been associated with a reduction in mortality in people with type 2 diabetes. An analysis of the 2019–2020 dataset demonstrates that 33% of people with type 2 diabetes currently aged < 40 years receiving all 8 care processes, in contrast to 47% of those aged 40–59 years and 59% of those aged 60–79 years. In the absence of evidence supporting broader medication choices for younger people, more targeted approaches, that address lifestyle choices, psychological well‐being and engagement with healthcare providers are likely to be beneficial given the over‐representation of those from socioeconomically deprived and from minority ethnic groups, to support greater completion of these care processes.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^11173599]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to glycemic targets, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to deintensify hypoglycemia-causing medications (insulin, sulfonylureas, or meglitinides) or switch to a medication class with lower hypoglycemia risk in patients at high risk for hypoglycemia, within individualized glycemic goals. Deintensify diabetes medications if the harms and/or burdens of treatment may be greater than the benefits, within individualized glycemic goals.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^116qZT8W]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Glycemic management in type 2 diabetes mellitus has become increasingly complex and, to some extent, controversial, with a widening array of pharmacological agents now available, mounting concerns about their potential adverse effects and new uncertainties regarding the benefits of intensive glycemic control on macrovascular complications. Many clinicians are therefore perplexed as to the optimal strategies for their patients. As a consequence, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a joint task force to examine the evidence and develop recommendations for antihyperglycemic therapy in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. Several guideline documents have been developed by members of these two organizations and by other societies and federations (,–). However, an update was deemed necessary because of contemporary information on the benefits/risks of glycemic control, recent evidence concerning efficacy and safety of several new drug classes, the withdrawal/restriction of others, and increasing calls for a move toward more patient-centered care.

This statement has been written incorporating the best available evidence and, where solid support does not exist, using the experience and insight of the writing group, incorporating an extensive review by additional experts (acknowledged below). The document refers to glycemic control; yet this clearly needs to be pursued within a multifactorial risk reduction framework. This stems from the fact that patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; the aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure and lipid therapy, antiplatelet treatment, and smoking cessation) is likely to have even greater benefits.

These recommendations should be considered within the context of the needs, preferences, and tolerances of each patient; individualization of treatment is the cornerstone of success. Our recommendations are less prescriptive than and not as algorithmic as prior guidelines. This follows from the general lack of comparative-effectiveness research in this area. Our intent is therefore to encourage an appreciation of the variable and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, the specific role of each drug, the patient and disease factors that drive clinical decision making, and the constraints imposed by age and comorbidity. The implementation of these guidelines will require thoughtful clinicians to integrate current evidence with other constraints and imperatives in the context of patient-specific factors.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to glycemic targets, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to deintensify hypoglycemia-causing medications (insulin, sulfonylureas, or meglitinides) or switch to a medication class with lower hypoglycemia risk in patients at high risk for hypoglycemia, within individualized glycemic goals.

### Current antihyperglycemic treatment guidelines and algorithms for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113tKjX8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. While lifestyle interventions such as medical nutrition therapy and appropriately prescribed physical activity remain cornerstones of disease prevention and treatment, most patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually require pharmacotherapy for glycemic control. Fortunately, many of these patients are able to achieve desired glycemic targets with the use of currently available antihyperglycemic agents. Both not-for-profit disease-specific organizations and healthcare specialty societies have provided guidance about the appropriate selection of these therapies. Type 2 diabetes treatment guidelines and algorithms have been developed, taking into account a combination of evidence-based information and expert opinions, with various groups offering diverse glucose goals and approaches to hyperglycemia management. Virtually all recognize that type 2 diabetes is a multifaceted disease, necessitating an integrated yet individualized approach to patient care.

Conclusions

Type 2 diabetes is epidemic. Its long-term consequences translate into enormous human suffering and economic costs; however, much of the morbidity associated with long-term microvascular and neuropathic complications can be substantially reduced by interventions that achieve glucose levels close to the nondiabetic range. Although new classes of medications and numerous combinations have been demonstrated to lower glycemia, current-day management has failed to achieve and maintain the glycemic levels most likely to provide optimal healthcare status for people with diabetes.

Medications

The characteristics of currently available glucose-lowering interventions, when used as monotherapy, are summarized in Table 1. The glucose-lowering effectiveness of individual therapies and combinations demonstrated in clinical trials is predicated not only on the intrinsic characteristics of the intervention but also on the duration of diabetes, baseline glycemia, previous therapy, and other factors. A major factor in selecting a class of drugs, or a specific medication within a class, to initiate therapy or when changing therapy, is the ambient level of glycemic control. When levels of glycemia are high (e.g. A1C > 8.5%), classes with greater and more rapid glucose-lowering effectiveness, or potentially earlier initiation of combination therapy, are recommended; however, patients with recent-onset diabetes often respond adequately to less intensive interventions than those with longer-term disease. When glycemic levels are closer to the target levels (e.g. A1C < 7.5%), medications with lesser potential to lower glycemia and/or a slower onset of action may be considered.

Obviously, the choice of glycemic goals and the medications used to achieve them must be individualized for each patient, balancing the potential for lowering A1C and anticipated long-term benefit with specific safety issues, as well as other characteristics of regimens, including side effects, tolerability, ease of use, long-term adherence, expense, and the nonglycemic effects of the medications. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease characterized by worsening glycemia; higher doses and additional medications are required over time if treatment goals are to be met.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, 2018. A consensus report by the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^114rkHe5]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes convened a panel to update the prior position statements, published in 2012 and 2015, on the management of type 2 diabetes in adults. A systematic evaluation of the literature since 2014 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on lifestyle management and diabetes self-management education and support. For those with obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, medication, and surgical interventions, are recommended. With regards to medication management, for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended. For patients with chronic kidney disease or clinical heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally recommended as the first injectable medication.

### Evaluation of guideline recommendations on oral medications for type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review [^116jKxjX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines have an important role in guiding choices among the numerous medications available to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, but little is known about their quality.

Purpose

To assess whether guidelines on oral medications for type 2 diabetes are consistent with a systematic review of the current evidence and whether the consistency of the guidelines depends on the quality of guideline development.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, CINAHL, and guideline-specific databases were searched between July 2007 and August 2011, after the 2007 publication of a peer-reviewed systematic review on oral diabetes medications.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently screened citations to identify English-language guidelines on oral medications to treat type 2 diabetes that were applied in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada.

Data Extraction

Reviewers assessed whether the guidelines addressed and agreed with 7 evidence-based conclusions from the 2007 systematic review. Two reviewers independently rated guideline quality by using 2 domains from the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation instrument.

Data Synthesis

Of the 1000 screened citations, 11 guidelines met the inclusion criteria. Seven guidelines agreed with the conclusion that metformin is favored as the first-line agent. Ten guidelines agreed that thiazolidinediones are associated with higher rates of edema and congestive heart failure compared with other oral medications to treat type 2 diabetes. One guideline addressed no evidence-based conclusions, and 5 guidelines agreed with all 7 conclusions. The summary scores of the rigor of development (median, 28.6% [range, 16.7% to 100.0%]) and editorial independence (median, 75.0% [range, 8.3% to 100.0%]) domains varied greatly across guidelines. Guidelines that received higher quality scores contained more recommendations that were consistent with the evidence-based conclusions.

Limitation

Only English-language guidelines targeting users in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada that contained recommendations on oral medications were included.

Conclusion

Not all practice guidelines on oral treatment of type 2 diabetes were consistent with available evidence from a systematic review. Guidelines judged to be of higher quality contained more recommendations consistent with evidence-based conclusions. The quality of guideline development processes varied substantially.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment of type 2 diabetes: synopsis of the 2020 American diabetes association's standards of medical care in diabetes clinical guideline [^113UpWzV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Description

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) updates the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes annually to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and other interested parties with evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of diabetes.

Methods

To develop the 2020 Standards, the ADA Professional Practice Committee, comprising physicians, adult and pediatric endocrinologists, diabetes educators, registered dietitians, epidemiologists, pharmacists, and public health experts, continuously searched MEDLINE (English language only) from 15 October 2018 through August-September 2019 for pertinent studies, including high-quality trials that addressed pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes. The committee selected and reviewed the studies, developed the recommendations, and solicited feedback from the larger clinical community.

Recommendations

This synopsis focuses on guidance relating to the pharmacologic treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Recommendations address oral and noninsulin injectable therapies, insulin treatment, and combination injectable therapies. Results of recent large trials with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are emphasized.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^113jySzk]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Process

The guidelines and algorithm that follow are derived from two sources. One source is the clinical trials that address the effectiveness and safety of the different modalities of therapy. Here, the writing group reviewed a wide variety of studies related to the use of drugs as monotherapy or in combination to lower glycemia. Unfortunately, the paucity of high-quality evidence in the form of well-controlled clinical trials that directly compare different diabetes treatment regimens remains a major impediment to recommending one class of drugs, or a particular combination of therapies, over another.

The second source of material that informed our recommendations was clinical judgement, that is, our collective knowledge and clinical experience, which takes into account benefits, risks, and costs in the treatment of diabetes. As in all clinical decision making, an evidence-based review of the literature must also be supplemented by value judgements, where the benefits of treatment are weighed against risks and costs in a subjective fashion. While we realize that others may have different judgements, we believe that the recommendations made in this new iteration of our treatment algorithm will guide therapy and result in improved glycemic control and health status over time.

### New perspectives in management of cardiovascular risk among people with diabetes [^115bxTv3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Following the publication of results from multiple landmark cardiovascular outcome trials of antihyperglycemic medications over the past 8years, there has been a major shift in the focus of care for people with type 2 diabetes, from control of hyperglycemia to managing cardiovascular risk. Multiple international cardiology and diabetes society guidelines and recommendations now endorse sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like protein-1 receptor agonists as first-line therapies to mitigate cardiovascular risk. The most recent publication is the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guideline on the management of cardiovascular disease in those with type 2 diabetes that, for the first time, recommends use of both classes of medications for the mitigation of cardiovascular risk for those with or at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Here, we review the evidence behind contemporary society guidelines and recommendations for the management of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk.

The authors continue to endorse the principles used to develop the algorithm and its major features. We are sensitive to the risks of changing the algorithm cavalierly or too frequently, without compelling new information. An update to the consensus algorithm published in January 2008 specifically addressed safety issues surrounding the thiazolidinediones. In this revision, we focus on the new classes of medications that now have more clinical data and experience.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of medications for adults with type 2 diabetes at varied risks of cardiovascular and kidney related complications?

Context

Emerging clinical trials of novel medications have demonstrated benefits on cardiovascular, kidney, and weight related outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes. Dynamically updated practice guidelines adhering to standards of trustworthiness are necessary in response to a rapidly evolving evidence base and the availability of multiple medication alternatives. This living practice guideline incorporates the latest available medications and evidence and provides recommendations stratified by risks of cardiovascular and kidney complications to inform diabetes management.

Recommendations

The panel issued risk-stratified recommendations regarding four prioritised medications for adults with type 2 diabetes (SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, finerenone and tirzepatide):• Lower risk (three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD)): weak recommendation against SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Moderate risk (more than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD; or established CVD and/or CKD at lower risk of complications): weak recommendation in favour of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists; and a weak recommendation against finerenone in adults with CKD.• Higher risk (established CVD and/or CKD at higher risk of complications, or established heart failure): strong recommendation in favour of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists; and a weak recommendation in favour of finerenone in adults with CKD.• Across risk strata: weak recommendation in favour of tirzepatide in adults with obesity.

About This Guideline and How It Was Created

An international panel including two patient partners, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations. The panel followed standards for trustworthy guidelines and used the GRADE approach, explicitly considering the balance of benefits, harms and burdens of treatment from an individual patient perspective. Recommendations were informed by a linked living systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluating relative benefits and harms updated to 31 July 2024; and by linked systematic reviews addressing risk prediction models and values and preferences of adults with type 2 diabetes. Candidate therapeutics are prioritised based on availability of sufficient randomised trial data, relevance to a global audience and likelihood of changing practice. This is the first version of the living guideline. The guideline is part of the BMJ Rapid Recommendations series. MAGICapp displays the most recent version of the guideline and full content including evidence summaries and decision aids; major updates will be published in The BMJ. We encourage re-use, adaptation and translation of these living guidelines, and recognise that the lack of availability or high costs of some medications may be prohibitive and will impact on how these recommendations are implemented across different health care systems.

### Statement by an American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology consensus panel on type 2 diabetes mellitus: an algorithm for glycemic control [^116Vz6kN]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

This report presents an algorithm to assist primary care physicians, endocrinologists, and others in the management of adult, nonpregnant patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In order to minimize the risk of diabetes-related complications, the goal of therapy is to achieve a hemoglobin A1c (A1C) of 6.5% or less, with recognition of the need for individualization to minimize the risks of hypoglycemia. We provide therapeutic pathways stratified on the basis of current levels of A1C, whether the patient is receiving treatment or is drug naïve. We consider monotherapy, dual therapy, and triple therapy, including 8 major classes of medications (biguanides, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, incretin mimetics, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and bile acid sequestrants) and insulin therapy (basal, premixed, and multiple daily injections), with or without orally administered medications. We prioritize choices of medications according to safety, risk of hypoglycemia, efficacy, simplicity, anticipated degree of patient adherence, and cost of medications. We recommend only combinations of medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that provide complementary mechanisms of action. It is essential to monitor therapy with A1C and self-monitoring of blood glucose and to adjust or advance therapy frequently (every 2 to 3 months) if the appropriate goal for each patient has not been achieved. We provide a flow-chart and table summarizing the major considerations. This algorithm represents a consensus of 14 highly experienced clinicians, clinical researchers, practitioners, and academicians and is based on the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology Diabetes Guidelines and the recent medical literature.

### Perioperative management of diabetic medications in patients undergoing elective total joint arthroplasty: a review of current guidelines and recommendations [^11655Gr1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of diabetes in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is steadily increasing. Diabetes predisposes patients to major complications such as prosthetic joint infection (PJI), which poses major challenges to the patient and surgeon. Therefore, careful perioperative glucose management in these patients is critical. Medications have been the mainstay in the management of diabetes; however, these medications are each associated with their unique risk profile in the perioperative period.

Methods

This review evaluated the available literature regarding the 10 main diabetic medication classes, their mechanism of action, adverse effects, and current perioperative management recommendations.

Results

Available literature addressing perioperative diabetic medication management in TJA is still lacking; however, there are still many guidelines that have been synthesized for these medications in both an elective surgery setting and within TJA.

Conclusion

Based on this literature review, we provided a summation of the perioperative guidelines for the ten main diabetic drug classes and what the current available perioperative guidelines are. Many of these medication classes have not been studied yet in the setting of TJA. However, we hope this summation offers orthopaedic providers a practical clinical guideline and insight into managing and treating their diabetic patients preoperatively.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^111ZXfet]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Metformin is a biguanide that is used as first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is effective as monotherapy and in combination with other glucose-lowering medications. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects and is affordable. Although the safety and efficacy of metformin have been well-established, there is discussion regarding whether metformin should continue to be the first choice for therapy as other anti-hyperglycemic medications exhibit additional advantages in certain populations. Despite a long-standing history of metformin use, there are limited cardiovascular outcomes data for metformin. Furthermore, the available studies fail to provide strong evidence due to either small sample size or short duration. Recent data from glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials demonstrated additional protection from diabetes complications for some high-risk patients, which has impacted the guidelines for diabetes management. Post-hoc analyses comparing hazard ratios for participants taking metformin at baseline versus not taking metformin are inconclusive for these two groups. There are no data to suggest that metformin should not be initiated soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Furthermore, the initiation of newer glycemic-lowering medications with cardiovascular benefits should be considered in high-risk patients regardless of glycemic control or target HbA1c. However, cost remains a major factor in determining appropriate treatment.

Grading of scientific evidence.

There has been considerable evolution in the evaluation of scientific evidence and in the development of evidence-based guidelines since the ADA first began publishing practice guidelines. Accordingly, we developed a classification system to grade the quality of scientific evidence supporting ADA recommendations for all new and revised ADA position statements.

Recommendations are assigned ratings of A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence (Table 1). Expert opinion (E) is a separate category for recommendations in which there is as yet no evidence from clinical trials, in which clinical trials may be impractical, or in which there is conflicting evidence. Recommendations with an "A" rating are based on large well-designed clinical trials or well-done meta-analyses. Generally, these recommendations have the best chance of improving outcomes when applied to the population to which they are appropriate. Recommendations with lower levels of evidence may be equally important but are not as well supported. The level of evidence supporting a given recommendation is noted either as a heading for a group of recommendations or in parentheses after a given recommendation.

Of course, evidence is only one component of clinical decision-making. Clinicians care for patients, not populations; guidelines must always be interpreted with the needs of the individual patient in mind. Individual circumstances, such as comorbid and coexisting diseases, age, education, disability, and, above all, patients' values and preferences, must also be considered and may lead to different treatment targets and strategies. Also, conventional evidence hierarchies, such as the one adapted by the ADA, may miss some nuances that are important in diabetes care. For example, while there is excellent evidence from clinical trials supporting the importance of achieving glycemic control, the optimal way to achieve this result is less clear. It is difficult to assess each component of such a complex intervention.

ADA will continue to improve and update the Clinical Practice Recommendations to ensure that clinicians, health plans, and policymakers can continue to rely on them as the most authoritative and current guidelines for diabetes care. Our Clinical Practice Recommendations are also available on the Association's website at.

### Does a ketogenic diet have a place within diabetes clinical practice? Review of current evidence and controversies [^116fjmUP]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

It is evident from the scientific literature that the ketogenic diet can be an effective short-term treatment for diabetes management; however, the diet is as such and should be promoted as a long-term lifestyle with care due to the unknown surrounding long-term health outcomes. Unfortunately, no long-term evidence exists for the current guideline-driven approaches either so all long-term dietary strategies for diabetes management remain an 'evidence-free zone'. This might be compounded by those who generate guidelines including SACN and NICE only accepting data from randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses as evidence, which omits the data from well-conducted case-series which may not meet the threshold for evidence of efficacy but may be useful in indicating safety and tolerability. Additionally, until a recognised definition of a ketogenic diet/VLCD is established, prescription and advocacy at a public health level will be challenging.

From the available data ketogenic diets appear to not be superior but are also not inferior in terms of metabolic advantages for diabetes management, but it is generally agreed that the advantage of a ketogenic is due to a longer duration of a caloric deficit diet. In short, the optimal diet for diabetes management is the one that an individual can adhere to induce significant weight loss and involves lifelong change. Like other nutritional interventions, a personalised nutrition approach for diabetes management is required, with support of a dietician, to fine-tune the optimal dietary pattern to improve long-term adherence and minimise side effects whilst also considering individuals' lifestyle.

Finally, it is crucial that individuals with T2D taking medication should first seek medical guidance for a personalised assessment before implementing any significant carbohydrate restrictive diet to ensure appropriate safety and ensure that any pharmacotherapies are appropriately managed. However carbohydrate restriction in those taking the most commonly prescribed medication, metformin, does seem to be safe.

### Metformin – the gold standard in type 2 diabetes: what does the evidence tell us? [^117H2PAq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is a cornerstone of oral antidiabetic treatment. Recent joint American and European guidelines recommend instituting metformin therapy along with lifestyle modification at the time type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is diagnosed. Metformin acts to reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve glucose uptake, and it may exert protective effects on pancreatic islet cells. Although metformin therapy produces substantial reductions in HbA1c, it does not produce body weight gain, is not associated with substantial risk for hypoglycaemia and has neutral to positive effects on lipids and blood pressure. The major adverse events associated with metformin are gastrointestinal. T2DM progresses even with initially effective monotherapy, and most patients will therefore receive combination therapy. When selecting agents to coadminister with metformin, a physician must consider efficacy in glycaemic control, safety, tolerability and any effects that may compromise overall efficacy (e.g. effects on body weight, lipids or blood pressure). In this regard, incretin-based therapies have characteristics that make them particularly suitable for add-on therapy with metformin.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^112JRWZ1]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

The recent American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes guideline mentioned glycaemia management in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); however, it did not cover the treatment approaches for patients with T2DM having a high risk of CVD, and treatment and screening approaches for CVDs in patients with concomitant T2DM. This consensus guideline undertakes the data obtained from all the cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) to propose approaches for the T2DM management in presence of CV comorbidities. For patients at high risk of CVD, metformin is the drug of choice to manage the T2DM to achieve a patient specific HbA1c target. In case of established CVD, a combination of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist with proven CV benefits is recommended along with metformin, while for chronic kidney disease or heart failure, a sodium-glucose transporter proteins-2 inhibitor with proven benefit is advised. This document also summarises various screening and investigational approaches for the major CV events with their accuracy and specificity along with the treatment guidance to assist the healthcare professionals in selecting the best management strategies for every individual. Since lifestyle modification and management plays an important role in maintaining the effectiveness of the pharmacological therapies, authors of this consensus recommendation have also briefed on the patient-centric non-pharmacological management of T2DM and CVD.

Grading of scientific evidence.

There has been considerable evolution in the evaluation of scientific evidence and in the development of evidence-based guidelines since the ADA first began publishing practice guidelines. Accordingly, we developed a classification system to grade the quality of scientific evidence supporting ADA recommendations for all new and revised ADA position statements.

Recommendations are assigned ratings of A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence (Table 1). Expert opinion (E) is a separate category for recommendations in which there is as yet no evidence from clinical trials, in which clinical trials may be impractical, or in which there is conflicting evidence. Recommendations with an "A" rating are based on large well-designed clinical trials or well-done meta-analyses. Generally, these recommendations have the best chance of improving outcomes when applied to the population to which they are appropriate. Recommendations with lower levels of evidence may be equally important but are not as well supported. The level of evidence supporting a given recommendation is noted either as a heading for a group of recommendations or in parentheses after a given recommendation.

### Guideline recommendations and the positioning of newer drugs in type 2 diabetes care [^113ayVRd]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Cardiovascular outcome trials in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk have led to remarkable advances in our understanding of the effectiveness of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce cardiorenal events. In 2019, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published updated recommendations for the management of such patients. We are concerned that ongoing discussions focusing on the differences between the endocrinologists' consensus report from the ADA and EASD and cardiologists' guidelines from the ESC are contributing to clinical inertia, thereby effectively denying evidence-based treatments advocated by both groups to patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiorenal disease. A subset of members from the writing groups of the ADA-EASD consensus report and the ESC guidelines was convened to emphasise where commonalities exist and to propose an integrated framework that encompasses the views incorporated in management approaches proposed by the ESC and the ADA and EASD. Coordinated action is required to ensure that people with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease are treated appropriately with an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist. In our opinion, this course should be initiated independent of background therapy, current glycaemic control, or individualised treatment goals.

### American diabetes association-European Association for the Study of Diabetes position statement: due diligence was conducted [^112Kat4i]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

In regard to the message delivered from previously published guidelines, there are providers who strongly feel that given the overall scope of the diabetes burden worldwide and the fact that data continue to state inadequate glycemic control today, an algorithm-based approach should not only be emphasized but also justified. Additional justification for this approach is that it provides a consistent management plan and serves an important purpose to guide providers who may not be as versed in diabetes management. Given the fact that most diabetic patients are not seen in specialized centers, the argument is made that an algorithm-based approach may provide the most feasible management plan that can be applied to the greatest number of subjects. A more defined prescriptive approach is also supported by those who feel that we should reserve the newer therapies only after the traditional agents have failed. In support of this position, the available cost-effectiveness data are cited (although, admittedly, we have very little to date). In addition, the cost of the medication and expense involved in monitoring may be provided as compelling reasons for choosing the specific management approach. On the opposite end of this argument, there is the camp of providers who feel strongly that so much data has accumulated on the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes that a specific pharmaceutical approach is warranted in that direction. In reality, however, the majority of providers seem to fall squarely between the two management approaches described above. Basing their decision on a number of important factors, they would suggest the use of all agents. This latter approach essentially selects a particular therapy after carefully considering all relevant factors (e.g. comorbidities, disease duration, resources, etc.) that contribute to the ultimate success or failure of the therapy. The approach to consider all factors and individualize therapy is the approach taken in the ADA-EASD position statement. In this regard, the position statement definitely achieves its objectives.

Targets can determine therapy

The glucose-lowering effectiveness of agents varies, so the degree of HbA1c reduction sought will impact the decision as to which agent to use. Insulin aside, the efficacy is high for metformin, sulfonylureas (SUs), thiazolidinediones (glitazones) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists (expected HbA1c reduction approximately 1.0 to 1.5%) and, generally, lower for meglitinides, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, acarbose, colesevelam and bromocriptine (approximately 0.5 to 1.0%) (Table 1). Historically, older drugs have typically been tested in clinical trial participants with higher baseline HbA1c, so, without direct comparisons, it is difficult to be certain that SUs, for example, really are more or less effective that DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists; but these latter are consistently found not to be inferior to SUs, with the added benefit of no weight gain, even weight loss, without hypoglycemia. Agents with more modest effects, but little or no side-effects, could be considered when treating individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, to limit progression to frank diabetes, for example, acarbose, though it is prone to cause flatulence.

### Current type 2 diabetes guidelines: individualized treatment and how to make the most of metformin [^115Eo33y]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines provide the premise for the delivery of quality care to preserve health and prevent disabilities and premature death. The systematic gathering of observational, mechanistic and experimental data contributes to the hierarchy of evidence used to guide clinical practice. In the field of diabetes, metformin was discovered more than 100years ago, and with 60years of clinical use, it has stood the test of time regarding its value in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Although some guidelines have challenged the role of metformin as the first-line glucose-lowering drug, it is important to point out that the cardiovascular-renal protective effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists were gathered from patients with type 2 diabetes, the majority of whom were treated with metformin. Most national, regional and international guidelines recommend metformin as a foundation therapy with emphasis on avoidance of therapeutic inertia and early attainment of multiple treatment goals. Moreover, real-world evidence has confirmed the glucose-lowering and cardiovascular-renal benefits of metformin accompanied by an extremely low risk of lactic acidosis. In patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15–30mL/min/1.73m 2), metformin discontinuation was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular-renal events compared with metformin persistence. Meanwhile, it is understood that microbiota, nutrients and metformin can interact through the gut-brain-kidney axis to modulate homeostasis of bioactive molecules, systemic inflammation and energy metabolism. While these biological changes contribute to the multisystem effects of metformin, they may also explain the gastrointestinal side effects and vitamin B12 deficiency associated with metformin intolerance. By understanding the interactions between metformin, foods and microbiota, healthcare professionals are in a better position to optimize the use of metformin and mitigate potential side effects. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study and the Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Program commenced 40years ago provided the first evidence that type 2 diabetes is preventable and treatable. To drive real-world impact from this evidence, payors, practitioners and planners need to co-design and implement an integrated, data-driven, metformin-based programme to detect people with undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes (intermediate hyperglycaemia), notably impaired glucose tolerance, for early intervention. The systematic data collection will create real-world evidence to bring out the best of metformin and make healthcare sustainable, affordable and accessible.

### Prototype of an evidence-based tool to aid individualized treatment for type 2 diabetes [^117Sqmpf]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Current standards of medical care for type 2 diabetes (T2D) promote individualized treatment according to co‐morbidities, individual preferences and treatment goals. 1, 2, 3 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Care guidelines offer examples of important considerations for selecting a T2D therapy for any particular individual, including: the estimated reduction in HbA1c; adverse‐event profile; risk of hypoglycaemia; impact on body weight; ease and frequency of administration; cost and availability; adherence to and persistence with therapy; and prevalent complications and co‐morbidities. 1 The updated (2020) consensus report by the ADA and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes further emphasizes co‐morbidities such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) as key priorities for individualized care. 3 All these resources promote shared decision‐making between patient and physician. 1, 2, 3 Clinical practice guidelines clarify how treatment selection can be directed by high‐risk co‐morbidities, such as established ASCVD, CKD or HF, 1, 2, 3 but are less clear on how patient characteristics, treatment goals and preferences should direct treatment selection, and how this may vary among individuals. Another challenge is the lack of data to help predict potential outcomes in a specific individual. Current guidelines offer summaries of the efficacy, risk of hypoglycaemia, effect on body weight, and cardiovascular (CV) and renal events of the major classes of glucose‐lowering treatment, but these are based on pooled outcomes from intention‐to‐treat analyses, so do not represent expected outcomes for a specific individual. 4 An expert perspective on precision medicine in T2D emphasized that for most people without high‐risk co‐morbidities, there is often no clear choice to suggest the 'best' antihyperglycaemic medication. 4

Clinical tools for individualized care have been developed and implemented for other diseases. For example, the Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score allows for the input of a range of patient‐specific characteristics, and provides a risk score for developing heart disease over the next 10 years, with associated indications for different preventative strategies. 5 Drawing inspiration from tools such as this, we have developed a prototype tool to estimate patient‐specific outcomes via a user‐friendly web interface.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^111gjVNW]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Algorithm

The algorithm (Fig. 2) takes into account the characteristics of the individual interventions, their synergies, and expense. The goal is to achieve and maintain A1C levels of < 7% and to change interventions at as rapid a pace as titration of medications allows when target glycemic goals are not being achieved. Mounting evidence suggests that aggressive lowering of glycemia, especially with insulin therapy, in newly diagnosed diabetes can result in sustained remissions, i.e. normoglycemia without need for glucose-lowering medications. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, and patients should be informed that they are likely to require the addition of glucose-lowering medications over time.

The amylin agonists, α-glucosidase inhibitors, glinides, and DPP-4 inhibitors are not included in the two tiers of preferred agents in this algorithm, owing to their lower or equivalent overall glucose-lowering effectiveness compared with the first- and second-tier agents and/or to their limited clinical data or relative expense (Table 1). However, they may be appropriate choices in selected patients.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^116nzvSq]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This consensus statement provides (1) visual guidance in concise graphic algorithms to assist with clinical decision-making of health care professionals in the management of persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve patient care and (2) a summary of details to support the visual guidance found in each algorithm.

Methods

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) selected a task force of medical experts who updated the 2020 AACE Comprehensive Type 2 Diabetes Management Algorithm based on the 2022 AACE Clinical Practice Guideline: Developing a Diabetes Mellitus Comprehensive Care Plan and consensus of task force authors.

Results

This algorithm for management of persons with type 2 diabetes includes 11 distinct sections: (1) Principles for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes; (2) Complications-Centric Model for the Care of Persons with Overweight/Obesity; (3) Prediabetes Algorithm; (4) Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Algorithm: Dyslipidemia; (5) Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Algorithm: Hypertension; (6) Complications-Centric Algorithm for Glycemic Control; (7) Glucose-Centric Algorithm for Glycemic Control; (8) Algorithm for Adding/Intensifying Insulin; (9) Profiles of Antihyperglycemic Medications; (10) Profiles of Weight-Loss Medications (new); and (11) Vaccine Recommendations for Persons with Diabetes Mellitus (new), which summarizes recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Conclusions

Aligning with the 2022 AACE diabetes guideline update, this 2023 diabetes algorithm update emphasizes lifestyle modification and treatment of overweight/obesity as key pillars in the management of prediabetes and diabetes mellitus and highlights the importance of appropriate management of atherosclerotic risk factors of dyslipidemia and hypertension. One notable new theme is an emphasis on a complication-centric approach, beyond glucose levels, to frame decisions regarding first-line pharmacologic choices for the treatment of persons with diabetes. The algorithm also includes access/cost of medications as factors related to health equity to consider in clinical decision-making.

Identifiable clinical groups of patients

Both A1C target and antihyperglycemic drugs used to achieve the target might need specific considerations for identifiable clinical groups of patients, i.e. patients with comorbidities or patients with short life expectancy. In this counterpoint article, however, we focus on patients with long-term good prognosis.

### Clinical guidance for diabetes… [^113HvNGo]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Health care providers play a crucial role in helping patients prevent or delay type 2 diabetes and manage all types of diabetes.
- They are often the first line in screening and referring patients to a type 2 diabetes prevention program or diabetes self-management education and support services. Refer your patients with prediabetes to the CDC-led National Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle change program. Research shows that the program can cut the risk of type 2 diabetes by more than half. This yearlong program, delivered by a trained Lifestyle Coach, will teach your patients how to eat healthy, increase physical activity, manage stress, and stay motivated. They can also lower their risk of a heart attack or stroke and improve their overall health. Already delivering the lifestyle change program.

Managing diabetes Stay up to date on the latest Diabetes Standards of Care to ensure your patients are receiving timely, equitable, and high-quality care. These guidelines include screenings and management for diabetes and related complications, such as cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Your patients manage their diabetes care with regular guidance and support from their health care team. At every health care visit, you and other care team members can encourage them to take the steps needed to manage their diabetes effectively:

- Promoting Ear Health for People With Diabetes
- Promoting Eye Health for People With Diabetes
- Promoting Foot Health for People With Diabetes
- Promoting Medication Management for People With Diabetes
- Promoting Oral Health for People With Diabetes As a health care provider, you know firsthand that these actions are key to preventing complications and enhancing quality of life for people with diabetes.

Living successfully with diabetes means developing the skills to self-manage outside the clinical setting. Diabetes self-management education and support helps people learn practical skills and personalized strategies to manage diabetes in their everyday life. DSMES provides structured support so people with diabetes can make sustainable lifestyle changes with the help of a diabetes care and education specialist. People who participate in DSMES are more likely to have better health outcomes, including lower A1C levels and fewer complications. Diabetes education helps you and your patients.

### Use of new diabetes medicines… [^1122m9GD]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Recent guidelines from the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend newer types of diabetes medications.
- CDC researchers found that most Americans living with type 2 diabetes are eligible under these new guidelines. What did this study examine. In 2022, the ADA and EASD jointly released new medication recommendations for adults with type 2 diabetes. They recommended newer types of diabetes medications as first-line treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes who also have:

- A heart disease called atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
- Heart failure.
- Kidney disease.
- High risk for ASCVD. This study examined how many US adults with type 2 diabetes would meet the recommended criteria to use these medications. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, or SGLT-2s are a type of medicine for people with diabetes.

Similar to GLP-1s, they lower blood sugar levels, can help with weight loss, and protect the heart and kidneys. Because GLP-1s and SGLT-2s work in different ways, they can be taken together. Study results CDC researchers studied 1, 330 nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes between 2017 and 2020. Researchers estimate that with new ADA and EASD guidelines, 82% of US adults with type 2 diabetes may be eligible to take a GLP-1, or SGLT-2, or both. They also estimate that almost all Medicare beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes may be eligible to take these medicines. Very few US adults were taking GLP-1s or SGLT-2s during the study timeframe. This is because they were not yet approved for first-line treatment. Only 9% were already taking either a GLP-1 or an SGLT-2 medication. What's important about this study. This study showed that over 8 in 10 US adults with type 2 diabetes are eligible for new, effective diabetes medicines.

These medicines are not just beneficial for blood sugar management. They also help reduce risk for diabetes complications by protecting the heart and kidneys, and help people lose weight if needed.

### Diabetes… [^113mRLTW]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

The updated guideline, Oral Pharmacologic Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, was developed by the American College of Physicians and was endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians. These recommendations are provided only as assistance for physicians making clinical decisions regarding the care of their patients. As such, they cannot substitute for the individual judgment brought to each clinical situation by the patient's family physician. As with all clinical reference resources, they reflect the best understanding of the science of medicine at the time of publication, but they should be used with the clear understanding that continued research may result in new knowledge and recommendations. These recommendations are only one element in the complex process of improving the health of America. To be effective, the recommendations must be implemented.
