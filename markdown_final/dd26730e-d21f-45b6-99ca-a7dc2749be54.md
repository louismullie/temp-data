## Question

How long can an ascitic drain be in

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long an ascitic drain can remain in place and what the evidence-based limits and trade-offs are for duration across different contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenarios in which drains are used and why duration matters. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about indwelling drains versus repeated paracentesis. Next, I will examine observational data on infection and other complications by duration. After that, I need to consider device-specific factors such as tunneled versus non-tunneled catheters. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and monitoring needs, including when to remove or avoid prolonged drainage, and I will double-check for any conflicting evidence before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts where duration becomes relevant. Indwelling abdominal drains are used in three main settings: palliative long-term abdominal drains (LTAD) for refractory ascites due to cirrhosis, palliative semi-permanent or tunneled catheters for malignant ascites, and transient postoperative or inpatient drains for large-volume ascites; duration thresholds differ because infection risk and goals of care vary across these scenarios, so I need to keep those distinctions in mind as I weigh the evidence [^114KCJq7] [^1147qojt] [^1162ygy4].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance before jumping to conclusions. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — do major societies endorse routine long-term indwelling drains in cirrhosis? The AASLD 2022 palliative guidance states that abdominal drains may be considered as an alternative to serial large-volume paracentesis in transplant- and TIPS-ineligible patients with comfort-focused goals, but emphasizes that more comparative effectiveness research is needed before recommending this approach broadly, which signals caution rather than endorsement of prolonged indwelling use as standard of care [^1147qojt]. Similarly, the 2022 Frontline Gastroenterology consensus concludes that long-term abdominal drains cannot be regarded as standard of care in advanced cirrhosis and should be considered case-by-case pending definitive evidence, reinforcing a conservative stance on duration and routine use [^114KCJq7].

> I will now examine infection risk by duration, because that is the pivotal safety signal. Wait, let me verify the quantitative relationship. A prospective cohort of 224 transient ascitic drains showed a mean drain duration of 8.57 days and a striking increase in peritonitis when drainage exceeded 7 days: 1.92% with ≤ 7 days versus 17.28% with > 7 days, with a significant association between longer duration and peritonitis; this strongly suggests minimizing duration whenever feasible and reassessing the need if a drain remains beyond a week [^1162ygy4]. Let me consider whether this applies to tunneled devices too; while tunneled catheters are designed for longer dwell times, contemporary cohorts still report infection rates ranging from about 2% to 13% and note time-dependent risk, with calculated overall complication risks approximating 3.7% per week and 43% per year, which underscores that even tunneled systems accrue risk with time and require vigilant surveillance and early intervention if complications arise [^1151sycy].

> Now, I should review device-specific factors. Tunneled peritoneal catheters such as PleurX are intended for repeated home drainage over weeks to months and can reduce hospital visits, but they are not risk-free; infection, leakage, blockage, and dislodgement occur, and risk appears higher when catheters are placed after prior removal or dislocation and when operators are less experienced, so I need to ensure meticulous technique, secure fixation, and structured home-care protocols if duration is extended [^1151sycy] [^114fHPvU]. Non-tunneled semi-permanent bedside catheters have been described in palliative cohorts with acceptable feasibility, but they lack the subcutaneous tunnel and therefore may carry higher infection risk with prolonged use; thus, I should be cautious about leaving them in place for long periods without a compelling indication and close follow-up [^1164cSvF] [^117D5PH3].

> Let me synthesize practical duration guidance by scenario, and I will double-check each claim against the data. For transient inpatient drains used for large-volume ascites, the safest course is to remove as soon as drainage is no longer needed, ideally within 7 days, given the steep rise in peritonitis beyond that window; if clinical needs persist, I should reassess for conversion to a tunneled system or alternative strategy rather than indefinitely prolonging a temporary drain [^1162ygy4]. For tunneled peritoneal catheters in malignant ascites, many patients require weeks to months of palliative drainage; although there is no absolute maximum duration, I should plan for ongoing use with scheduled home drainage and proactive surveillance for infection, leakage, and blockage, recognizing that cumulative risk rises over time and that early discussion of goals of care is essential [^1151sycy] [^114uHXJc]. For cirrhotic refractory ascites, given the lack of definitive superiority data and meaningful infection risk, I should avoid routine long-term indwelling drains; if considered for comfort in transplant- or TIPS-ineligible patients, use should be exceptional, time-limited, and accompanied by strict aseptic technique and close monitoring, with periodic reassessment of benefit versus burden [^1147qojt] [^114KCJq7].

> I need to ensure supportive care elements are addressed because duration interacts with complications. Albumin replacement after large-volume drainage helps mitigate post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction; while this applies to LVP, the pathophysiology of intravascular depletion is relevant when drains are left in place and large volumes are intermittently removed, so I should consider isotonic or albumin support in selected patients with low albumin or hyponatremia, tailored to goals of care and lab trends [^117FK1Nv] [^112TSw1H]. For malignant ascites, iterative drainage can worsen salt and water losses; careful attention to sodium balance, avoidance of hypotonic fluids, and judicious isotonic or albumin repletion can mitigate hyponatremia and volume depletion during prolonged drainage, which becomes more important the longer a drain remains in place [^112MjDyM].

> But wait, what if the patient is postoperative or in the ICU — does the same duration principle hold? Surgical and critical care guidance consistently advises that if intra-abdominal drains are used, they should be removed as soon as feasible once the indication resolves, because prolonged drainage increases infectious and wound complications; this aligns with the general principle to minimize duration across contexts, even though the populations and indications differ from cirrhotic or malignant ascites [^115sy8tD] [^1139GvKN].

> I should confirm monitoring and triggers for action if a drain remains in place. Regular assessment for fever, abdominal pain, erythema or discharge at the site, and changes in drain output character should prompt evaluation for infection; if peritonitis is suspected, obtain ascitic cell count and culture with bedside inoculation and treat promptly, and consider catheter removal if infection persists or sepsis develops, balancing procedural risks and patient goals [^116hzk29] [^111QMCdv]. If a tunneled catheter becomes blocked or dislodged, early intervention or replacement may be needed; if complications cluster or the patient's clinical trajectory shifts toward comfort-only care, I should reconsider the appropriateness of continued drainage and discuss de-escalation or catheter removal with the patient and family [^1151sycy].

> In summary, I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with the evidence. There is no universal maximum duration for ascitic drains. Duration should be as short as clinically possible, with a strong safety signal to avoid transient drains beyond about 7 days due to infection risk, and with tunneled catheters reserved for selected palliative contexts where benefits outweigh risks and where structured home care and surveillance are feasible. Throughout, I need to reassess frequently, manage complications proactively, and align use with patient-centered goals and evolving clinical status [^1162ygy4] [^1147qojt] [^114KCJq7] [^1151sycy].

An ascitic drain is generally left in place for **3–7 days** for temporary drains and **weeks to months** for tunneled indwelling catheters, depending on clinical need and risk of complications. Temporary drains should be removed as soon as feasible to minimize infection risk, with **peritonitis risk rising significantly after 7 days** [^1162ygy4]. Tunneled catheters (e.g. PleurX) may remain for months in palliative care, but require vigilant infection surveillance and regular dressing changes. Prolonged drainage increases risks of infection, leakage, and blockage; therefore, duration should be individualized and reassessed frequently [^1151sycy].

## Indications for ascitic drain placement

Ascitic drains are placed for **diagnostic or therapeutic reasons**, including:

- **Diagnostic purposes**: Determine the cause of ascites (e.g. cirrhosis, malignancy, infection) through fluid analysis [^1177Wn5b].

- **Therapeutic purposes**: Relieve symptomatic ascites, improve respiratory function, and enhance patient comfort [^113MXKL3].

---

## Recommended duration of ascitic drain placement

The duration of ascitic drain placement **varies** with the clinical context, patient condition, and type of drain used:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Temporary ascitic drain (non-tunneled) | 3–7 days | - Minimize infection risk [^1162ygy4] <br/> - Remove as soon as clinically feasible [^115sy8tD] |
| Tunneled indwelling catheter (e.g. PleurX) | Weeks to months | - Palliative care <br/> - Chronic ascites management <br/> - Regular monitoring required [^112MjDyM] |
| Postoperative drainage after liver surgery | 3–5 days | Prevent complications such as infection and fluid leakage [^notfound] |

---

## Factors influencing duration of ascitic drain placement

Several factors influence how long an ascitic drain **can remain in place**:

- **Patient condition**: Severity of liver disease, presence of infection, and overall clinical stability [^notfound].

- **Type of drain**: Temporary drains are typically removed within a week, while tunneled catheters may remain in place for extended periods [^1162ygy4].

- **Clinical indication**: Diagnostic drains are removed immediately after fluid collection, whereas therapeutic drains remain until symptomatic relief is achieved [^112vWWff].

- **Complication risk**: Prolonged drainage increases the risk of infection, leakage, and blockage, necessitating careful monitoring and timely removal [^1151sycy].

---

## Risks and complications associated with prolonged ascitic drain placement

Prolonged ascitic drain placement is associated with several **significant risks and complications**:

- **Infection**: Bacterial peritonitis and cellulitis are common complications, with infection rates increasing significantly after seven days of drainage [^1162ygy4] [^1151sycy].

- **Leakage**: Persistent leakage of ascitic fluid around the drain site can lead to skin irritation, infection, and patient discomfort [^113GwBrX] [^1151sycy] [^1138x58o].

- **Blockage**: Catheter blockage or malfunction may necessitate repositioning or replacement [^1151sycy] [^1138x58o].

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Large-volume drainage can cause hypotension, electrolyte disturbances, and renal dysfunction [^1139GvKN] [^111axk63] [^117FK1Nv].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized decision-making** and regular reassessment of the need for continued drainage:

- **Regular monitoring**: Patients with indwelling drains should be monitored closely for signs of infection, leakage, and blockage [^notfound].

- **Timely removal**: Drains should be removed as soon as clinically feasible to minimize complications [^115sy8tD].

- **Patient education**: Patients and caregivers should be educated on proper drain care, infection prevention, and recognition of complications [^113GwBrX].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Temporary drains**: Remove within 3–7 days to minimize infection risk [^notfound].

- **Tunneled catheters**: May remain in place for weeks to months, but require regular monitoring and care [^1151sycy].

- **Individualized care**: Duration should be tailored to patient condition, clinical indication, and complication risk [^114KCJq7].

- **Regular reassessment**: Continuously evaluate the need for continued drainage and remove drains as soon as clinically feasible [^115sy8tD].

---

The duration of ascitic drain placement **varies** with patient condition, drain type, and clinical indication. Temporary drains should be removed within 3–7 days, while tunneled catheters may remain for weeks to months with careful monitoring. Prolonged drainage increases the risk of infection, leakage, and blockage, so duration should be individualized and reassessed regularly.

Discussion

The presence of significant ascites and its abrupt drainage at the time of surgery can lead to PPCD, which is a rapid decompression of the splanchnic vasculature resulting in splanchnic vasodilatation, decrease in SVR with a decrease in intravascular volume, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system. This in turn results in a more rapid re-accumulation of ascites, hyponatremia, renal insufficiency, and encephalopathy. Albumin administration is the main treatment. Intraoperative fluid management can be challenging and there is limited available evidence regarding whether albumin or crystalloid is preferred.

The accumulation of ascites in the postoperative period increases the risk of intra-abdominal infection, fluid leak from surgical sites, and wound dehiscence. The approach to the management of ascites in the postoperative cirrhotic patient is similar to preoperative strategies. However, hemodynamic status may preclude the use of salt restriction and diuretics. Paracentesis may be used in the setting of significant ascites not amenable to medical management or in the setting of fluid leak from surgical sites. In patients with refractory ascites, TIPS can be considered. However, since outcome data are limited, a multidisciplinary decision should be individualized to the clinical setting and type of surgical procedure. Of note, patients who already have an indication for primary or secondary SBP prophylaxis should have that continued in the postoperative setting; if patients cannot take oral medications, a third-generation cephalosporin can be given intravenously.

Placement of intra-abdominal drains at the time of surgery can allow drainage of ascites in order to reduce the risk of wound complications such as fluid leak and dehiscence. Some studies have shown no difference in ascites-related complications or major complications and the need for postoperative paracentesis. Others have demonstrated decreased ascites leakage and reduced hospital stay. Liu et al randomized 104 patients undergoing elective hepatic resection to drains versus no drains and demonstrated an increased morbidity due to wound complications from routine drainage. Notably, this was in elective patients and therefore may not translate to patients with DC. There is limited available evidence on surgical outcomes to recommend for or against the use of routine intra-abdominal drains. The decision should be individualized based on the clinical setting and the type of procedure. If used, drains should be removed as soon as possible. If not used, frequent LVP with albumin supplementation should be performed in the immediate postoperative setting while diuretics are being titrated.

### Pancreatic ascites: update on diagnosis and management [^115UsCLN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic paracentesis remains a cornerstone of symptomatic relief, particularly in patients with large-volume ascites causing discomfort or respiratory compromise. Although paracentesis is effective for immediate symptom relief, it does not address the underlying ductal disruption and may need to be repeated. Combining paracentesis with somatostatin analogs may prolong the interval between procedures. Although effective in mild to asymptomatic cases, conservative treatment of pancreatic ascites has a failure rate of 40–60% and is associated with high mortality. It is also costly and involves prolonged hospitalization, as current wisdom advises waiting 3–4 weeks before considering alternative treatments. Although a cutoff of 3 weeks appears arbitrary, O'Toole et al argued that it is the optimal duration for nutritional therapy and octreotide treatment to take effect. Long-term total parenteral nutrition carries risks, including infection and liver dysfunction, and may not be feasible for all patients. In patients with severe hyponatremia, very low albumin levels and multiple sites of pancreatic duct disruption, conservative therapy has a higher chance of failure.

Endoscopic interventions

In pancreatic ascites, endoscopic therapies can be used as an adjunct to medical therapy, salvage intervention after failed conservative treatment, or as a primary intervention. The endoscopic approach primarily involves the use of ERCP with transpapillary pancreatic duct stenting (Fig. 3). This intervention aims to decompress the pancreatic ductal system and facilitate the resolution of ascites. The procedure typically involves performing a pancreatic sphincterotomy followed by the placement of a pancreatic stent, usually 5F or 7F in size, to bridge the site of ductal disruption. The sphincterotomy reduces the pancreatic duct's outflow resistance, decreasing ductal pressure and facilitating internal drainage of pancreatic secretions. Stent placement across the site of ductal disruption further promotes ductal healing, allowing continuous drainage of pancreatic fluid into the duodenum and reducing ascitic fluid accumulation (Fig. 4). This approach is effective in reducing recurrence rates and often eliminates the need for repeated paracentesis. A study by Bracher et al demonstrated that transpapillary pancreatic duct stenting effectively resolved pancreatic ascites in 88% of patients within 6 weeks, with no recurrence at a mean follow up of 14 months. No immediate or long-term complications were reported. In cases in which standard plastic stents are insufficient, expandable metallic stents may be considered, particularly in patients who are poor surgical candidates. Generally, somatostatin or octreotide is not required after endoscopic therapy.

EUS-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) compared with percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) after failed ERCP — panel considerations and conditional recommendation: if personnel who can perform interventional EUS techniques are unavailable, clinicians should still consider radiologically guided percutaneous interventions for management of biliary obstruction. The panel highlighted that in patients with ascites, percutaneous drainage of the ascitic fluid should be considered before or at the time of PTBD or EUS-BD; in patients who are hemodynamically unstable, PTBD may be preferred over EUS-BD; and in patients who cannot tolerate general anesthesia, PTBD may be preferred over EUS-BD. Overall, the panel made a conditional recommendation for EUS-BD compared with PTBD in the setting of failed ERCP.

### Home versus hospital drainage of fluid from the abdomen (… [^113GwBrX]. isrctn.com (2025). Medium credibility.

for untreatable ascites involves coming into the hospital for 1–2 days, putting a thin tube into the abdomen for a few hours and draining 5–15 L of fluid. This reduces the pain from ascites. However, as the ascites build up quickly, hospital visits are needed every 10–14 days. Our. patients describe repeated hospital drainage as "devastating" and "unbearably painful". For people with untreatable ascites due to cancer, palliative care involves placing another tube, a long-term abdominal drain, into their abdomen. This tube is fitted in the hospital but stays in place for months. Nurses/caregivers then drain smaller amounts of. group are similar to that seen in the hospital drain group, except leakage and inflammation around the drain site were higher in the home drain group. Draining ascites to dryness in the hospital after insertion of LTAD can reduce leakage and this is now our standard practice.

received and blood will be taken for routine analysis and a sample of ascitic fluid will be taken to ensure there is no underlying infection. If there is this will be treated with oral antibiotics prior to any drain insertion. If the participant is eligible and they are willing to continue they will be randomised to either the Intervention or standard of care. The participant will. the baseline visit. If the participant is randomised to the LTAD arm they will be followed up at home by a community nurse who will visit 2–3 times a week to drain the ascites. Informal caregivers can be trained to do this if they are willing. Those randomised to the LVP arm will attend the hospital. for drainage of the ascites in line with the standard of care.

All participants will also receive a fortnightly home visit from the research team for safety monitoring, routine clinical bloods, collection of LTAD drainage data collated by the community nurses and for completion of the questionnaires. In those randomised to LVP, if hospital visits coincide with the fortnightly home. care in the management of refractory ascites due to advanced cirrhosis.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^112vWWff]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Large volume (therapeutic) paracentesis

Large volume paracentesis (LVP) is the standard of care for managing large volume ascites both in conjunction with diuresis to relieve symptoms of a tense abdomen, as well as in the management of refractory ascites, when diuretics become ineffective or the side effects preclude their continued use. Development of refractory ascites is of prognostic significance, therefore, at its onset, suitability of liver transplantation should be considered and assessed as a priority.

Performance standards

An efficient LVP service can be provided safely in a day case or outpatient setting and non-physician healthcare providers such as GI endoscopy assistantsand specialist nursescan be trained to perform therapeutic paracentesis and lead the service effectively. Exemplar training programmes indicate that 10 supervised procedures would be optimal for training to achieve competence in performing therapeutic paracentesis; mean duration of LVP was 97 ± 24 min, and the mean volume of ascitic fluid removed was 8.7 ± 2.8 L.

Patients should provide informed consent before the procedure. In 52 patients (15% obese) with ascites due to cirrhosis, ultrasound demonstrated that the left lower quadrant abdominal wall was thinner and depth of ascites greater, therefore, a suitable site for drain insertion. To minimise the risk of injury to the inferior epigastric artery (and avoid the liver and spleen) during paracentesis, point of puncture should be at least 8 cm from the midline and 5 cm above the symphysis(figure 4). All ascitic fluid should be drained to dryness in a single session as rapidly as possible over 1–4 hours assisted by gentle mobilisation of the cannula or turning the patient onto their side, if necessary. After the paracentesis, the patient should lie on the opposite side for 2 hours if there is leakage of any remaining ascitic fluid, and/or a suture (ideally purse-string) inserted around the site of drainage. These steps help to minimise the risk of ascitic fluid leakage.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^115rYZxw]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Abdominal distension attributable to refractory ascites — palliative options and outcomes include the following: Large volume paracentesis (LVP) requires multiple visits to the hospital and can be burdensome, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an option but many patients with refractory ascites are not candidates because of encephalopathy, cardiac contraindications, or high MELD scores. Indwelling peritoneal drains or catheters have been evaluated for palliation, and a systematic review including 176 patients reported patients' MELD scores ranged from 10 to 22, technical success was 100% with noninfectious complications generally low (< 12%), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurred in 0%–42% with an overall combined rate of 17%, and other complications included cellulitis at the catheter insertion site (6%), transient hyponatremia (11%), and increased serum creatinine (8%). A 12-week, small feasibility, unblinded randomized controlled trial compared LVP to long-term abdominal drains in 36 transplant-ineligible patients with refractory ascites, noted no drain-related serious adverse events or drain removals attributable to complications, found patients in the LVP group had more than double the ascites-related hospital time than the drain group, observed self-limiting cellulitis/leakage 41% versus 11% and peritonitis 6% versus 11%, and reported overall attrition 42% with deaths 7 of 16 and 5 of 18; at study end, all surviving drain participants elected to retain the drains.

### Management of dyspnea in advanced cancer: ASCO guideline [^112d1ntz]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — underlying conditions and comorbidities in dyspnea management states that patients with potentially reversible etiologies of dyspnea "should be given goal-concordant treatment(s)" and that patients with dyspnea because of underlying malignancy "may benefit from cancer-directed treatments", with patients who have comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart failure having management of these conditions optimized. In patients with advanced cancer, "dyspnea is often multifactorial in nature with a combination of acute and chronic causes", and selected condition-directed approaches "may improve significantly" or "may be effective", including drainage for malignant pleural or pericardial effusions and ascites, bronchoscopic interventions for malignant central airway obstruction, and systemic therapy or radiation in appropriate cases, while "the risks and benefits should always be carefully balanced". Patients with advanced cancer often have multiple comorbidities, and "more than 50% of patients with lung cancer have a diagnosis of COPD", underscoring that "optimal treatment of comorbid diagnoses is essential to alleviating dyspnea" and that "primary care clinicians and/or other specialists such as pulmonologists should be actively engaged in the optimization of these comorbidities if not already".

### Management of drainage for malignant ascites in gynaecological cancer [^114Rj761]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Ascites is the accumulation of fluid within the abdominal cavity. Most women with advanced ovarian cancer and some women with advanced endometrial cancer need repeated drainage for ascites. Guidelines to advise those involved in the drainage of ascites are usually produced locally and are generally not evidence-based. Managing drains that improve the efficacy and quality of the procedure is key in making recommendations that could improve the quality of life (QoL) for women at this critical period of their lives.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and adverse events of different interventions for the management of malignant ascites drainage in the palliative care of women with gynaecological cancer.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to 4 November 2019. We checked clinical trial registries, grey literature, reports of conferences, citation lists of included studies, and key textbooks for potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of women with malignant ascites with gynaecological cancer. If studies also included women with non-gynaecological cancer, we planned to extract data specifically for women with gynaecological cancers or request the data from trial authors. If this was not possible, we planned to include the study only if at least 50% of participants were diagnosed with gynaecological cancer.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, evaluated the quality of the included studies, compared results, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

In the original 2010 review, we identified no relevant studies. This updated review included one RCT involving 245 participants that compared abdominal paracentesis and intraperitoneal infusion of catumaxomab versus abdominal paracentesis alone. The study was at high risk of bias in almost all domains. The data were not suitable for analysis. The median time to the first deterioration of QoL ranged from 19 to 26 days in participants receiving paracentesis alone compared to 47 to 49 days among participants receiving paracentesis with catumaxomab infusion (very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were only reported among participants receiving catumaxomab infusion. The most common severe adverse events were abdominal pain and lymphopenia (157 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no data on the improvement of symptoms, satisfaction of participants and caregivers, and cost-effectiveness.

Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the most appropriate management of drainage for malignant ascites among women with gynaecological cancer, as there was only very low-certainty evidence from one small RCT at overall high risk of bias.

Ascites volume

A number of studies have also investigated the association of the volume of ascites at surgery with surgical outcomes and patterns of recurrence. Each study has set their own benchmark for high-volume and low-volume ascites. An early study with a relatively high cut-off of 1.8 l reported that patients with higher volumes of ascites had a significantly shorter OS. This was confirmed in a large study of 685 patients, which showed that patients with an ascites volume > 2 l had a significantly shorter PFS and OS. A 2019 analysis of 210 HGSOC patients found that those with low-volume ascites (defined as < 200 ml) had lower levels of CA125, better surgical outcomes and a longer time to recurrence than patients with high-volume ascites (defined as > 1 l). The studies published to date have mostly examined the volume drained at a single time point, as this parameter is easily retrieved from clinical records. However, combining the volume of ascites drained with the frequency of paracentesis over the course of cancer progression would more accurately reflect the rate of abdominal fluid increase, and might add to the accuracy of ascites volume as a prognostic marker.

Treatment failure — clinical assessment and source control: Treatment of patients who fail initial therapy follows the same principles used in initial management of intra-abdominal infection. Use measures of ongoing or progressive systemic inflammation or organ system dysfunction to identify patients with likely source control failure (Grade 1-B). Assess patients for source control failure if there is progressive organ dysfunction within the first 24–48 hours after source control, if there is no clinical improvement in organ dysfunction 48 hours or more after source control, or if there are persistent or new signs of inflammation 5–7 days after source control (Grade 2-C). Consider abdominal exploration in patients who deteriorate clinically or fail to improve within 48–72 hours of the initial procedure (Grade 2-C). Use computed tomography scanning, with percutaneous aspiration or drainage of any potentially infected fluid collections, in patients suspected of treatment failure after 48–72 hours of the initial source control procedure (Grade 1-B). Use the least invasive approach that will achieve definitive source control or sufficiently control the infection to allow resolution of the inflammatory response and organ dysfunction (Grade 1-B). Undertake further source control within 24 hours when source control failure is identified (Grade 2-C), but as soon as feasible in patients with physiologic instability or progressive organ dysfunction (Grade 2-B). Obtain routine peritoneal cultures in patients with source control failure so that pathogen-directed antimicrobial therapy can be utilized (Grade 1-C).

Conclusions

In conclusion, our data indicate that the risk of clinical complications in those performing repeated low-volume paracentesis without albumin substitution is associated with the volume drained per day. Drainage of 1.5 L/d or more associates with a higher risk for hyponatremia, AKI, and increasing inflammation while those with drainage of less than 1.5 L/d show comparable complication rates with those receiving SOC.

### Routine abdominal drainage for uncomplicated liver resection [^117GGA9X]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The main reasons for inserting a drain after elective liver resections are (i) prevention of sub-phrenic or sub-hepatic fluid collection; (ii) identification and monitoring of post-operative bleeding; (iii) identification and drainage of any bile leak; and (iv) prevent the accumulation of ascitic fluid in cirrhotics. However, there are reports that drain use increases the complication rates.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of routine abdominal drainage in elective liver resections.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until March 2007.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised trials comparing abdominal drainage and no drainage in adults undergoing elective liver resection. We also included randomised trials comparing different types of drain in adults undergoing elective liver resection.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected the data on the characteristics of the trial, methodological quality of the trials, mortality, morbidity, conversion rate, operating time, and hospital stay from each trial. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using the Cochrane Collaboration statistical software RevMan Analysis. For each outcome we calculated the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) (based on intention-to-treat analysis) by combining the trial data sets using fixed-effect model or random-effects model, as appropriate.

Main Results

Drain versus no drain: We included five trials with 465 patients randomised: 234 to the drain group and 231 to the no drain group. Three of the five trials were of high methodological quality. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups for any of the outcomes (mortality, intra-abdominal collections requiring re-operation, infected intra-abdominal collections, wound infection, ascitic leak, and hospital stay, when the random-effects model was adopted. Open drain versus closed drain: One randomised clinical trial of low methodological quality comparing open with closed drainage (186 patients) showed a lower incidence of infected intra-abdominal collections, chest complications, and hospital stay in the closed drain group.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence to support routine drain use after uncomplicated liver resections.

### AABIP evidence-informed guidelines and expert panel report for the management of indwelling pleural catheters [^113aAc4J]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2020). High credibility.

Indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) drainage schedules — goals, outcomes, and guidance emphasize that defining and balancing the goals of IPC therapy for patients with MPEs is important when deciding on a drainage schedule. The primary intent of IPCs in these patients is symptom palliation that enhances quality of life (QoL) and minimizes additional interventions and health care visits, and the literature consistently supports the efficacy of IPCs in achieving these goals. Therefore, draining the pleural space as needed to accomplish the desired effect may be enough, although achieving spontaneous pleurodesis that allows catheter removal is also an important outcome which may be influenced by drainage frequency. The likelihood of achieving spontaneous pleurodesis, the expected lifespan of the patient and their personal preferences all need to be considered when deciding on an ideal drainage schedule, and when catheter removal is not considered an important outcome there is very little data supporting aggressive drainage regimens improve QoL or dyspnea. In this context, less frequent drainage schedules or symptom-based drainage is appropriate (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

### Risk factors associated with complications of palliative drainage of ascites with tunneled peritoneal catheters [^1151sycy]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Symptomatic ascites heavily impacts the quality of life of patients with incurable malignant or benign diseases and, thus, drainage is frequently required. Tunneled peritoneal catheters are an established device to allow permanent ascites drainage in a homecare setting. Although the feasibility and overall low risks of this approach as well as cost-effectiveness compared to repeated large-volume paracentesis – have been demonstrated in several studies, the severe condition of the patients requires careful consideration of the indication.

Main findings

The technical success rate and complication rates described in our study are overall well compatible with previously published literature and confirm that tunneled peritoneal catheters are an effective and safe treatment option for otherwise intractable ascites in patients with incurable underlying disease.,

However, the main focus of our study was to identify patient-, disease- or intervention-inherent factors that might predispose to AEs associated with tunneled permanent ascites drainage. Our analyses did not identify any relevant risk factor for early complications but suggest that a higher risk for late complications and particularly infections exists in patients with benign disease, when the catheter is placed after previous removal or dislocation of another catheter and when performed by less experienced physicians.

What this study adds

Numerous single-center cohorts reporting patients receiving tunneled peritoneal catheters have been published. Overall, technical success rates below 100% have rarely been described and only a few procedure-related severe complications have been reported. However, complications may occur — time-sensitive overall complication risks of 3.7% per weekand 43% per yearhave been calculated — and, in particular, infection of the indwelling catheters is a concern. Accordingly, bacterial colonization is a frequent event and peritonitis has been reported in up to 33%. In most studies, infection rates vary between 2% and 13%,– although definitions and grading differ. Further complications reported in the literature include obstruction, dislocation, fluid leakage at the entry site, and hypotension. Yet, risk factors for such AEs have been rarely reported and, thus, guided strategies for considering the indication and for long-term patient management are lacking. In one study, pancreatic cancer was significantly associated with more frequent drainage obstructionand another group reported that catheter days in patients with active treatment are higher than in those on best supportive care.

### Palliative semi-permanent abdominal drain for the management of refractory malignant ascites: a retrospective study in a comprehensive cancer center [^115FiSGJ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This retrospective analysis suggests that semi-permanent drains could play a role in managing patients with refractory ascites in palliative care, particularly for those who are frail, reluctant to undergo invasive procedures, or have a very poor prognosis. The use of semi-permanent drains may also be considered in cases where the patient wishes to return home.

Regarding complications, the available literature reports various data, and no studies have compared different devices or methods, such as repeated paracentesis, which is the most common management approach. The complication rate observed in our cohort aligns with data reported in other studies and was managed without major difficulties, with the exception of one death that remains multifactorial in etiology with major oncological evolution. The use of antibiotic prophylaxis has been discussed with the infectious disease team. Primary antibiotic prophylaxis does not seem to be relevant, as there was no infection during or immediately after the drain placement procedure. We also discussed the relevance of secondary antibiotic prophylaxis, as recommended for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites. However, the situation is different in this context: malignant ascites is a protein-rich, inflammatory ascites, with a high risk of compartmentalization, which could reduce the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis. Moreover, our patients are often very fragile, with a high risk of Clostridium difficile infections (due to immunosuppression, repeated hospitalizations, and imbalance of intestinal flora due to previous chemotherapy), and the risk of such infections could be increased if we implemented secondary antibiotic prophylaxis. This retrospective study was carried out to assess the feasibility and acceptability of these non-tunneled drains by all the specialists involved and the patients. Initially, interventional radiologists and infectious disease specialists were reluctant to adopt these drains because of the assumed infectious risk. Finally, they were reassured by the management of the complications. To minimize the risk of infection, we chose not to include patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy.

### SAGES guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis [^1134ZhZZ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Discussion — EAES and current review recommendations: Appendectomy remains the gold standard in acute uncomplicated appendicitis, and EAES recommended that diagnostic imaging begin with ultrasound with advanced imaging as needed, suction alone without lavage, no routine use of drains for complicated appendicitis, and no postoperative antibiotics for uncomplicated appendicitis. The current review utilized new evidence showing a relatively high rate of neoplasm in interval appendectomy specimens and therefore recommends eventual appendectomy, particularly in patients over the age of 40 years. While EAES recommended immediate appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis, the authors did not find sufficient evidence to confirm this and make a conditional recommendation for either immediate or delayed appendectomy (> 12 hours) depending upon individual patient, surgeon, or logistical factors. For complicated appendicitis, most reviews agree on a shorter postoperative antibiotic course, and the current review recommends keeping duration in the range of 3–5 days to avoid resistance, C. difficile and urinary tract infections with no evidence of added benefit in abscess reduction.

### Safety and effectiveness of transient ascites drainage in hospitalized patients with large ascites [^1162ygy4]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Single paracentesis is the standard treatment for large ascites. An alternative is the placement of a transient ascites drainage. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transient ascites drainage in patients with large ascites.

Methods

Patients with symptomatic ascites who underwent transient ascites drainage between January 2017 and February 2022 were enrolled in this study. The amount of drained ascites and the duration of the drainage stay were recorded. Drainage-associated acute complications have been documented. Risk factors for complications were analyzed.

Results

A total of 224 ascites drains were inserted into 177 patients. The mean cumulative volume of drained ascites was 14 284ml (± 9987). The duration of drainage varied between 0 and 42 days and averaged 8.57 days (± 6.51). The technical success rate of drain placement was 98.21% (220/224). The most common drainage-associated complications were acute kidney injury in 31/224 (13.84%), bacterial peritonitis 16/185 (8.65%), and drainage-associated fistula [21/224 (9.38%)]. There were significant differences between the groups with and without drainage-associated peritonitis in the duration of drainage stay [13.63 (± 8.13) vs. 8.06 (± 6.20) days; P = 0.001). The frequency of peritonitis with a length of drainage stay of up to 7 days was 1.92%, with a length of stay greater than 7 days 17.28% (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Transient ascites catheters are effective for the drainage of large-volume ascites. The technical success rate was high, and the procedure itself was safe; however, owing to the high rate of drainage-associated peritonitis, a longer duration of drainage should be avoided.

### Risk factors associated with complications of palliative drainage of ascites with tunneled peritoneal catheters [^1174xKgJ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Our study has a number of limitations that need to be considered when interpreting the results. First, it is a retrospective study and, thus, reporting bias might be an issue. Moreover, it is a single-center study reporting data from a tertiary center in Germany and local specifics might contribute to the findings and limit their generalizability. With a total of 49 patients and 57 drainages, our cohort is of substantial size, but may, however, be too small to identify rare adverse events (AEs). Moreover, the multivariable analyses for risk factors underlying these AEs might be underpowered since none of the aspects reached statistical significance despite showing clear differences in univariable analyses. It must be noted, however, that one or the other of these caveats applies to almost all published cohorts. While only a few of them report prospective data, only one cohort is sufficiently larger than ours.

Strengths

On the other hand, a number of strengths have to be underscored: Importantly, our study is the first to systematically investigate the association of baseline parameters and AEs. Thus, it provides substantial novelty of clear clinical relevance and implications for patients under palliative therapy.

### Palliative long-term abdominal drains for the management of refractory ascites due to cirrhosis: a consensus document [^114KCJq7]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Palliative care remains suboptimal in advanced cirrhosis, in part relating to a lack of evidence-based interventions. Ascites remains the most common cirrhosis complication resulting in hospitalisation. Many patients with refractory ascites are not candidates for liver transplantation or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and therefore, require recurrent palliative large volume paracentesis in hospital. We review the available evidence on use of palliative long-term abdominal drains in cirrhosis. Pending results of a national trial (REDUCe 2) and consistent with recently published national and American guidance, long-term abdominal drains cannot be regarded as standard of care in advanced cirrhosis. They should instead be considered only on a case-by-case basis, pending definitive evidence. This manuscript provides consensus to help standardise use of long-term abdominal drains in cirrhosis including patient selection and community management. Our ultimate aim remains to improve palliative care for this under researched and vulnerable cohort.

### Palliative semi-permanent abdominal drain for the management of refractory malignant ascites: a retrospective study in a comprehensive cancer center [^1153NLeA]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Drain placement had a beneficial impact on disabling symptoms in more than 92% of cases, allowing 60% of patients to return to home hospitalization (that provides acute and subacute medical care at home in an attempt to reduce the need for hospitalization), without the need for day hospital visits for ascitic drainage.

Eight patients (35%) showed improvement in digestive symptoms (less vomiting, resolution of a subocclusive syndrome, less abdominal distension); 15 patients (65%) reported less pain or discomfort after the drain placement; 5 patients (22%) experienced reduced dyspnea; and 1 patient (4%) reported feeling less anxious.

The average time between drain placement and death was 36.5 days [4;147], and the average time between the diagnosis of refractory ascites and death was 93.7 days [14;263] (Table 2).

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 2: decompensated cirrhosis [^111VxjaL]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The mainstay of ascites management in the outpatient setting is diuretic therapy. This involves a stepwise approach as outlined in figure 3 with the additional specific recommendations:

Secondary antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered in patients with a previous episode of SBP. Suitable antibiotic choices are norfloxacin 400 mg, ciprofloxacin 500 mg or co-trimoxazole 960 mg once daily. The ASEPTIC trial, investigating the role of primary prophylaxis of SBP, is ongoing. Some centres offer primary prophylaxis for those considered high risk of SBP (protein concentration < 15 g/L)but there are concerns around antibiotic resistance and this should only be considered following discussion with local microbiology teams. Rifaximin prescribed for secondary prophylaxis of HE may negate the prescription of a second oral systemic antibiotic with substantial evidence to suggest it prevents SBP.
NSBB, when indicated, is not contraindicated in refractory ascites; although patients require close monitoring; dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate in those who develop hypotension or acute/progressive renal dysfunction.
Long-term outpatient albumin administration to patients with cirrhosis and ascites is not currently recommended: despite encouraging results from the ANSWER trial, the accompanying medical supervision was a strong confounding variable; further research is required to determine the efficacy, practicality, cost-effectiveness and impact on quality of life.
Patients with refractory ascites requiring regular large-volume paracentesis should have them performed as planned day case procedures as this reduces costs and improves patient outcomes, particularly in the last year of life.
Indwelling abdominal drains remain experimental but can be considered in palliative patients with advanced disease as an alternative to recurrent large volume paracentesis following careful discussion involving the patient about the risk benefit ratio, and in particular the potential infection risk. Their use is currently being evaluated in the REDUCe2 trial.

### 2017 WSES and SICG guidelines on acute calcolous cholecystitis in elderly population [^116crfMJ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Statement 4.4: As in the general population, even in elderly patients, percutaneous cholecystostomy catheter should be removed between 4 and 6 weeks after placement, if a cholangiogram performed 2–3 weeks after percutaneous cholecystostomy demonstrated biliary tree patency (LoE 3 GoR C)

After percutaneous cholecystostomy, the duration of drainage ranges from 3 to 6 weeks, 1 month in average. This represents the mean interval necessary for the maturation of the tract. Over this period, catheter removal is expected to become safer with respect to potential bile leak. In case of associated diabetes, ascites, long-term steroid therapy, and malnutrition, the drain should be left in place for a longer period, because these conditions may hinder tract maturation.

The patients can be discharged home with the drain in place. A cholangiography via the drain is recommended before drain withdrawal. This procedure can ensure the absence of leak or obstructed cystic duct (a non obstructed cystic duct increases the chance of a leak after the removal of the drain lowering the risk of potential symptoms recurrence).

In a series of 27 consecutive transhepatic percutaneous cholecystostomy, Bakkaloglu et al. performed cholecystocholangiography prior to the removal of the catheter in 88.8% cases: this demonstrated the cystic duct patency in 66.7% of subjects. Bleeding from the liver parenchyma was detected unexpectedly in only one patient following the removal of the catheter, while no bile leakage was detected in any patient.

However, it should be noted that none of these studies are specific to the elderly population and evidence for the use of a cholecystocholangiography is low.

### Consensus care recommendations for alfapumpin cirrhotic patients with refractory or recurrent ascites [^1166JEiU]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

(4) "The patient may be admitted up to 48 h pre-implant. Diuretics should be discontinued. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be initiated at admission and paracentesis performed to ensure a flat abdomen and to exclude SBP. Sufficient fluid should be left for in-surgery device testing. Surgeons should personally examine the patient to determine implant site".
(5) "Consider initiating prophylactic antibiotic treatment (norfloxacin 400 mg qd, oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg qd or equivalent) 48 h prior to implant in hospitalised patients and at admission in patients admitted less than 48 h before surgery. Prophylaxis should ideally be continued from admission (i.e. pre-implantation) to alfapump ® explant. Intravenous antibiotics should be used from 30 min prior to surgery but not exceeding 48 h post-surgery".
(6) "Alfapump ® implantation should be performed only by highly experienced and trained surgeons. All operating room (OR) staff should be familiar with the device and a Sequana Medical implant professional should assist".
(7) "To prevent wound dehiscence or infection, the patient should take an antiseptic shower prior to surgery and current (dermal) infections should be ruled out. Precise clean incisions, bleeding control, and adequate pump pocket sizing to avoid tension are encouraged (use single sutures if necessary). Sutures should remain in place for two to three weeks but drains should be removed as soon as possible".
(8) "The pump pocket should be positioned two to four cm below the costal margin, with enough room to house the pump comfortably in different postures. Distance to the peritoneal incision site should be maximised. The pump should be fixed with two non-resorbable stiches, and the pocket should be closed in layers with tension-free sutures; kinking or rotation of the catheters should be avoided. Consider positioning below the fascia in emaciated patients".
(9) "Puncture of the bladder should be strictly suprapubical and extraperitoneal. The use of ultrasound ensures correct localisation and puncture direction. The bladder should not be drained until the catheter is inserted. The bladder catheter felt cuff should be fixed to the subcutaneous tissue or subcutaneous fascia with non-resorbable stiches. Dyed fluid runout should be checked before closure".
(10) "The peritoneal catheter should be fixated with non-resorbable water tight purse-string-suture at the peritoneum, with the felt cuff inside the rectus muscle and the silicon ball inside the peritoneal cavity".
(11) "Correct catheter length is important to avoid tension if too short, or kinking if too long — the length can only be judged correctly when the abdomen is flat".
(12) "The pump should be tested in the OR prior to closing, with an initial pumping rate set to 120% of the expected daily volume".
(13) "Keeping ascites accumulation minimal and abdominal pressure low during and especially after surgery is crucial to reduce the potential for dislocated catheters, peritoneal leakage, pump pocket fluid collection and wound dehiscence".
(14) "The Smart Charger should leave the OR together with the patient".

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^114Kcsj1]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The development of ascites is a landmark in the natural history of cirrhosis. Therefore, it should be considered an important time point at which an individual patient's suitability for liver transplantation which is a definitive treatment of ascites and its complications, should be determined. Over the years, there has been a substantial improvement in care of patients with cirrhosis, including those with ascites. A study involving over 780 000 hospitalisations of patients with cirrhosis demonstrated an improvement in inpatient survival over a decade despite higher age and more medically complex disease. This was remarkably consistent across several cirrhosis complications, suggesting improved cirrhosis care beyond general improvements in inpatient care. Future research should focus on areas of need and questions where there is no high-quality evidence to guide the management of ascites.

### A phase II trial of capecitabine (xeloda) in recurrent ovarian cancer [^1119RDJB]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Capecitabine is an active agent for the treatment of patients with ovarian cancer previously treated with platinum and taxanes. Using CA125 concentrations to indicate response, capecitabine resulted in a response rate of 29% in a population of 28 evaluable patients. Capecitabine also demonstrated a favourable and manageable safety profile in this trial, with a particularly low rate of myelosuppression and alopecia. The most common grade 3 clinical adverse event was the cutaneous disorder HFS, which is never directly life-threatening and is readily managed using dose modification and/or treatment interruption. Grade 3 HFS occurred in 14% of patients and 10% experienced grade 3 vomiting. A similar safety profile was observed during extensive phase II and III trials of capecitabine in MBC and metastatic colorectal cancer. The only previous experience with this agent in recurrent ovarian cancer demonstrated a clinical response rate of 25% (one complete response and two partial responses in 12 evaluable patients) using the same doses but administered on a 28-day schedule.

The interpretation of the CA125 response in patients who have undergone ascitic drainage is difficult. There are a number of different strategies that may be employed in this situation, including the exclusion from the analysis of all patients who have had ascites drained, or using predetermined criteria based on the frequency of evaluable CA125 measurements during treatment. In our study, three of the eight patients with the CA125 response had required drainage of ascites. In one patient, ascitic drainage was performed after observation of CA125 response, but in the remaining two patients, one of whom had two drainage procedures performed, three of 14 and six of 10 of their CA125 values were taken within 4 weeks of drainage of ascites. Following exclusion of these values, neither patient would be considered to be a responder, despite clearly showing clinical benefit from capecitabine treatment. Further investigation of the effect of ascitic drainage on interpretation of the CA125 response dynamics is required.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic enteral access: commentary [^112MK6Bt]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ascites, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts, and peritoneal dialysis — preplacement risk considerations — can present challenges and require specific precautions: the presence of ascites, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts, and peritoneal dialysis can present challenges, including translocation of bacteria and increased risk of infectious complications; the presence of ascites can impair wound healing and apposition of the gastric wall to the abdominal wall, so ascitic fluid should be drained via paracentesis or intraperitoneal drain placement, and T-tacks can be used to improve tract formation; data support placement of a gastrostomy concurrently with a VP shunt or before VP shunt placement compared with within 15 days after VP shunt placement; with respect to individuals on peritoneal dialysis, converting to or maintaining individuals on hemodialysis for 6 weeks reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of peritonitis.

### Risk factors associated with complications of palliative drainage of ascites with tunneled peritoneal catheters [^1161tEgy]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Overall, we conclude that our findings support the concept that tunneled peritoneal catheters should be considered early on in the management of malignant ascites since interventional risks are low and patient comfort is high. On the contrary, in benign ascites, tunneled peritoneal catheters should be reserved for selected cases, where other options such as transjugular portosystemic shunt placement are not an option and which are refractory to diuretics. In general, placement of another drainage after a previous infectious complication should be well justified.

Larger and prospective multi-center trials are warranted to follow up on our findings and to further improve the pre- and post-procedural management of patients with intractable ascites eligible for permanent tunneled peritoneal catheters.

Palliative care

Palliative care is integral to the management of advanced non-cancer conditions, such as cardiac, respiratory and renal disease, often supported by practice guidelines. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites often report a poor quality of life, this being an independent predictor of 12-month mortality. However, only a minority of patients with advanced cirrhosis receive timely palliative care and this has been discussed in recent reviews. A British study indicated that from 2013 to 2015, of the 45 000 cirrhosis-related deaths, about a third required LVP in the last year of their life, overall healthcare costs being over £21 000 per person.

Substantial literature supports the use of palliative tunnelled long-term abdominal drains (LTAD) in individuals with refractory ascites due to malignancy, including NICE medical technology guidance. These drains are inserted in hospital and allow drainage of small amounts of ascites 2–3 times a week at home. Potential advantages over LVP include symptom-guided drainage and avoidance of repeated hospitalisations. A recent systematic review on LTAD in cirrhosis showed that the majority of patients could be managed in the community.

Results from a recent feasibility RCT comparing palliative LTAD with LVP in refractory ascites due to cirrhosis have just been published (REDUCe study). In this 3-month study, 36 patients were randomised, 19 to LVP and 17 to LTAD. All patients received prophylactic antibiotics for the study duration. Following randomisation, the median number (IQR) of hospital ascitic drains for LTAD versus LVP groups were 0 (0, 1) versus 4 (3, 7), respectively. Only two patients allocated to LTAD required hospital admissions specifically for ascites drainage. Self-limiting cellulitis/leakage occurred in 41% (7/17) in the LTAD vs 11% (2/19) in the LVP group; peritonitis incidence being 6% (1/17) vs 11% (2/19), respectively. Median (IQR) fortnightly community/hospital/social care ascites-related costs were lower in the LTAD group than in the LVP group, £329 (253, 580) versus £843 (603, 1060), respectively. Qualitative data (currently only published as a summary) indicate that LTAD could transform the care pathway.

The REDUCe study demonstrates feasibility, with preliminary evidence of LTAD acceptability, effectiveness and safety and reduction in health resource use. Future trials should assess LTAD as a palliative intervention for refractory ascites in cirrhosis.

### Peritoneal catheter for massive cardiac ascites [^1161HeTV]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Cardiac ascites represents 5% of all causes of ascites. Diuretics and salt restriction remain the cornerstone of management. Large volume paracentesis is needed among patients who do not respond to conservative management. The use of peritoneal catheters to continuously drain steady amounts of ascitic fluid has been generally used in malignant ascites. When the ascites of any other origin is massive and requires many consecutive days of large-volume paracentesis, the use of a catheter may represent a more convenient strategy. We present a patient with cardiac ascites that was successfully managed with a peritoneal catheter.

### Palliative semi-permanent abdominal drain for the management of refractory malignant ascites: a retrospective study in a comprehensive cancer center [^111axk63]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

It should be noted that large-volume paracentesis (more than 5 L) can induce circulatory dysfunction, characterized by a marked increase in cardiac output, decreased blood pressure, and a sudden drop in right atrial pressure due to reduced intrathoracic pressure. This can lead to elevated plasma renin and aldosterone levels. Such adverse effects are associated with impaired renal function, rapid reaccumulation of ascites, and shorter survival. This complication is well documented in cirrhotic patients. It seems reasonable to hypothesize that in palliative patients with refractory ascites of mixed etiology, including portal hypertension (with mechanisms similar to cirrhosis), performing iterative low-volume punctures or "semi-continuous" drainage could be better tolerated hemodynamically, with slower recurrence of ascites. This is an empirical observation that warrants further investigation. Indeed, we do not have precise data on the drainage frequency or the quantities drained during each evacuation. After the placement of the semi-permanent drain, drainage was performed every 24 to 72 h by nurses, according to the patient's needs and discomfort. The quantities were often between 1 and 3 L. In some cases, we observed that the drainage intervals could be spaced out after a few days, with a progressive drying up of the ascites.

The average time from the diagnosis of refractory malignant ascites to death was 93.7 days [14;263], while the average time from drain placement to death was 36.5 days [4;147]. This limits our ability to fully assess the long-term benefits and complications of the procedure. Nevertheless, the number of complications in our study remains consistent with the data presented in other articles. Furthermore, it may be advisable to offer the procedure earlier once refractory ascites is diagnosed. A common challenge is that when a semi-permanent peritoneal drain is indicated and the procedure is discussed with the patient, there is often a period of reflection. Additionally, there can be logistical delays related to the availability of the interventional radiology team. In collaboration with interventional radiologists, it might be beneficial to train palliative care physicians to perform semi-permanent drain placements under ultrasound guidance at the patient's bedside similar to the existing practices for suprapubic catheters or peripherally inserted central catheters. This could help avoid multiple consultations and appointments with different teams, ultimately improving patient comfort and reducing the time between decision-making and procedure, especially for patients with a poor prognosis.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^116ies3z]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Patient summary

These guidelines have been produced on behalf of the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) in collaboration with the British Association for the Study of the Liver (BASL). These guidelines are aimed at healthcare professionals who look after patients with cirrhosis and ascites.

Ascites is the build-up of fluid in the belly (abdomen). This occurs when the liver gets irreversibly scarred, a condition known as cirrhosis. Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis.

All patients with a new onset of ascites should have the fluid tested. This involves inserting a small needle into the abdomen and removing about two tablespoons of ascitic fluid. The fluid is then analysed for protein and white cell count. Protein count can help differentiate whether the cause of ascites is cirrhosis or whether the ascites is due to other causes like heart disease or cancer. The white cell count indicates whether there is an infection in the ascitic fluid. If infection is present, this is treated with a short course of antibiotics. Infection of ascites should be ruled out at every hospital admission as it carries a high risk of death and should therefore be diagnosed and treated promptly. After this initial treatment, patients are given long-term antibiotics to prevent repeat infections.

No salt should be added at the table to food. The total amount of salt in food per day should not be more than the equivalent of one teaspoon. Patients should read labels on prepared foods to confirm their daily salt intake is within the limit of 5 g of salt. The initial treatment for patients with ascites involves taking medication, commonly known as 'water tablets' (diuretics). These drugs are begun at a small dose, which is gradually increased until the ascites is treated. Diuretics can have side effects such dehydration, confusion, abnormal levels of sodium and potassium and kidney damage. Therefore patients should be monitored while taking these tablets.

As the liver disease progresses the ascites may no longer respond to medication. This is known as untreatable or refractory ascites. This requires the patient to come into hospital every few weeks to have a temporary drain inserted into the abdomen and the ascitic fluid drained. If more than 5 L of fluid is removed, patients are also given a protein solution into the vein to prevent dehydration.

### Impact of drain placement and duration on outcomes after pancreaticoduodenectomy: a National surgical quality improvement program analysis [^1152vXCa]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The decisions to routinely place a drain after pancreaticoduodenectomy and how long to leave the drain remain controversial due to conflicting evidence and significant variations in clinical practice. This study aims to address those questions by using a large national database and a rigorous analytical model.

Methods

The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 2015–2016 Pancreatectomy Participant Use Data Files were used to identify patients who had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy (n = 7583). Univariable and multivariable binomial regression analyses were performed to control for potential confounders and various preoperative risk factors. Cox regression with drain as a time-dependent covariate, conditional on having a drain placed, was used to examine the association between the drain remaining in place and morbidities.

Results

Of 7583 patients, drains were placed in 6666 (87.9%). Drain placement decreased the risk of developing serious morbidity (relative risk [RR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65–0.82), overall morbidity (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72–0.87), and organ space surgical site infection (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61–0.85). Drain placement did not change the risk of developing a clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.78–1.19). However, for those with drains placed, length of drainage was independently associated with serious morbidity (hazard ratio [HR] 3.06, 95% CI 2.65–3.53), overall morbidity (HR 2.48, 95% CI 2.20–2.80), and organ space surgical site infection (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.23–1.74).

Conclusions

Routine drain placement following pancreaticoduodenectomy may decrease postoperative complications, including serious morbidity, overall morbidity, and organ space surgical site infections; however, length of drainage was associated with increased risk of the previously-named complications. These results support the routine placement and early removal of intraoperative surgical drains in pancreaticoduodenectomy.

### Management of drainage for malignant ascites in gynaecological cancer [^116Pu2co]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Most patients with advanced ovarian cancer and some patients with advanced endometrial cancer need repeated drainage for malignant ascites. Guidelines to advise those involved in the drainage of ascites are usually produced locally and are generally not evidence-based but mainly based on clinicians' anecdotal evidence and experience. To discover whether there are ways of managing drains that have been demonstrated to improve the efficacy and quality of the procedure is key in making recommendations which could improve the quality of life (QOL) for women at this critical period of their lives.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefit and harms of different practices in the management of drains for malignant ascites in the care of women with advanced or recurrent gynaecological cancer. The review aimed to evaluate the evidence regarding the following questions; How long should the drain stay in place? Should the volume of fluid drained be replaced intravenously? Should the drain be clamped to regulate the drainage of fluid? Should any particular vital observations be regularly recorded?

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 1, 2009, Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, MEDLINE1950 to February Week 3 2009, Embase 1980 to 2009 Week 8 2009. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, reference lists of review articles and contacted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and non-randomised studies that compared a range of interventions for management of multiple paracentesis in women with malignant ascites who had a confirmed histological diagnosis of gynaecological cancer.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria. No trials were found and therefore no data were analysed.

Main Results

The search strategy identified 1664 unique references of which 1646 were excluded on the basis of title and abstract. The remaining 18 articles were retrieved in full, but none satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

Since no relevant studies were identified, we are unable to make recommendations regarding the management of drains for malignant ascites in women with gynaecological cancer. Large, multi-centre RCTs are required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the management of ascitic drains when in situ and their impact on QOL.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113d1v8V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Intra-abdominal candidiasis — treatment recommendations and diagnostic considerations: Empiric antifungal therapy should be considered for patients with clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection and significant risk factors for candidiasis, including recent abdominal surgery, anastomotic leaks, or necrotizing pancreatitis (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Treatment should include source control, with appropriate drainage and/or debridement (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). The choice of antifungal therapy is the same as for the treatment of candidemia or empiric therapy for nonneutropenic patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence), and the duration of therapy should be determined by adequacy of source control and clinical response (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Infections are often polymicrobial, with yeast noted in as high as 20% of all cases and 40% in patients with a recent gastroduodenal perforation. For sampling, swabs of superficial wounds and specimens from intra-abdominal catheters in place for > 24 hours do not provide useful information and should not be performed, whereas yeast from normally sterile intra-abdominal specimens (operatively obtained and/or drains placed within 24 hours) in patients with clinical evidence for infection should be considered indicative of intra-abdominal candidiasis. Biomarker data include a study in which β-D-glucan had a 72% positive predictive value and an 80% negative predictive value for distinguishing colonization from intra-abdominal invasive candidiasis. Patients who have Candida species isolated from normally sterile abdominal cultures or drains placed within 24 hours and who have clinical evidence of infection should be treated for intra-abdominal candidiasis; source control with adequate drainage and/or debridement is an important part of therapy, the antifungal agent should be guided by the Candida species and local epidemiology, and duration should be guided by clinical response and adequacy of source control.

Patients with ALD with an expected survival of less than 12 months should have their condition discussed with palliative care services

Core palliative care is best delivered by the hepatology team in parallel with active disease management. This includes ensuring that discussions about disease trajectory and advanced care planning occur alongside active management of disease complications such as transplantation: one should not preclude the other. Patients should be given the opportunity to be introduced to the palliative and supportive care team in hospital and a discussion in a suitable environment offered. If this is declined by the patient an opportunity to meet with the team postdischarge to discuss advanced care planning should be offered.

Planned admissions for paracentesis as a day case are well evidenced to improve patient and carer satisfaction. This can be done by a nurse-led service with the support of the medical team. The opportunity to use a multidisciplinary approach can be used including dietitian input, addictions specialist/ACT and introduction to supportive and palliative care. It allows continuity and advanced care planning. For patients enrolled in day case services, improvements in outcomes correlated with the proportion of large volume paracentesis procedures done in a day case (vs unplanned) setting. There are significant cost savings to planned admissions.

Long-term indwelling ascitic drains (LTAD) drains could also be considered on a case-to-case basis in patients with refractory ascites who are not under consideration for/listed for liver transplantation or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS). The risks of indwelling drains need to be carefully weighed and decisions for LTAD insertion should be made by a multidisciplinary team.

### Palliative semi-permanent abdominal drain for the management of refractory malignant ascites: a retrospective study in a comprehensive cancer center [^112sfZMk]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Refractory malignant ascites in the advanced palliative phase significantly impacts patients' quality of life (QoL), causing pain, respiratory difficulties, digestive issues, and impaired mobility. While iterative drainages can effectively relieve symptoms, frequent hospital visits and the significant volume of fluid requiring removal pose considerable challenges. A semi-continuous approach using a permanent bedside drain may offer more frequent drainages of smaller volumes. This study aimed to examine the feasibility, reliability, and safety of a semi-permanent bedside abdominal drain for patients in advanced palliative care with refractory malignant ascites.

Methods

This is a retrospective study, with cases identified through computerized queries of digital patient records. Data collected included patient characteristics, biological parameters, procedure details, and end-of-life outcomes.

Results

Between 2019 and 2024, this drain was proposed to 25 palliative care patients. They had received a median of three lines of oncological treatment, with 60% of them receiving exclusively palliative care at the time of drainage. Drain placement had a beneficial impact on disabling symptoms in over 92% of cases, allowing 60% of patients to return to home hospitalization, without requiring additional hospital visits for paracentesis. The median time between drain placement and end of life was 36.5 days [4;147], while the median time from the diagnosis of refractory ascites to death was 93.7 days [14;263].

Conclusion

A non-tunneled semi-permanent catheter, easily implanted at the patient's bedside, may improve QoL. This study serves as a pilot for a prospective cohort that will analyze QoL improvements and economic costs.

### Management of ascites: expert panel narrative review [^117WEX5C]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ascites can develop in the setting of a variety of pathologies. The approach to treatment depends on accurate determination of the underlying cause, for which fluid analysis plays a central role. In particular, the serum-ascites-albumin gradient serves as a primary diagnostic test for differentiating among causes, with certain additional fluid tests performed based on clinical suspicion. Treatment options range from nonspecific fluid removal, including large-volume paracentesis and tunneled peritoneal catheters, to targeted therapies (e.g., diuretics, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and lymphangiography). Societal guidelines exist for the approach to cirrhotic ascites, but the management of other less common causes remains less well defined. The goal of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to provide guidance for the diagnosis and management of ascites, based on available evidence and the authors' clinical experience.

### Abdominal drainage after hepatic resection is contraindicated in patients with chronic liver diseases [^114ypw3Z]. Annals of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine whether abdominal drainage is beneficial after elective hepatic resection in patients with underlying chronic liver diseases.

Summary Background Data

Traditionally, in patients with chronic liver diseases, an abdominal drainage catheter is routinely inserted after hepatic resection to drain ascitic fluid and to detect postoperative hemorrhage and bile leakage. However, the benefits of this surgical practice have not been evaluated prospectively.

Patients and Methods

Between January 1999 and March 2002, 104 patients who had underlying chronic liver diseases were prospectively randomized to have either closed suction abdominal drainage (drainage group, n = 52) or no drainage (nondrainage group, n = 52) after elective hepatic resection. The operative outcomes of the 2 groups of patients were compared.

Results

Fifty-seven (55%) patients had major hepatic resection with resection of 3 Coiunaud's segments or more. Sixty-nine (66%) patients had liver cirrhosis and 35 (34%) had chronic hepatitis. Demographic, surgical, and pathologic details were similar between both groups. The primary indication for hepatic resection was hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 100, 96%). There was no difference in hospital mortality between the 2 groups of patients (drainage group, 6% vs. nondrainage group, 2%; P = 0.618). However, there was a significantly higher overall operative morbidity in the drainage group (73% vs. 38%, P < 0.001). This was related to a significantly higher incidence of wound complications in the drainage group compared with the nondrainage group (62% vs. 21%, P < 0.001). In addition, a trend toward a higher incidence of septic complications in the drainage group was observed (33% vs. 17%, P = 0.07). The mean (± standard error of mean) postoperative hospital stay of the drainage group was 19.0 ± 2.2 days, which was significantly longer than that of the nondrainage group (12.5 ± 1.1 days, P = 0.005). With a median follow-up of 15 months, none of the 51 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in the drainage group developed metastasis at the drain sites. On multivariate analysis, abdominal drainage, underlying liver cirrhosis, major hepatic resection, and intraoperative blood loss of > 1.5L were independent and significant factors associated with postoperative morbidity.

Conclusion

Routine abdominal drainage after hepatic resection is contraindicated in patients with chronic liver diseases.

### Intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid… [^111jEEqP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The medical management of cirrhotic ascites has improved greatly during the past few years. There remains, however, a group of patients who either respond slowly or not at all to the most active medical program. In these individuals it is frequently advisable and necessary to remove fluid from the abdomen by paracentesis. Unfortunately, such treatment has been far from satisfactory. If small amounts of fluid are withdrawn, relief is only partial and often of short duration. On the other hand, if the abdomen is emptied, large amounts of body protein are wasted in individuals who can ill afford the loss. In addition, this procedure is frequently followed by reformation of ascites, hyponatremia, hypovolemia, and occasionally hepatic coma. 8 The present report describes the results obtained following the simultaneous withdrawal and continuous intravenous administration of unmodified autogenous ascitic fluid in patients with cirrhotic ascites. It is our impression that this method.

### Consensus care recommendations for alfapumpin cirrhotic patients with refractory or recurrent ascites [^113nXEQd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The alfapump ® is an implantable class III medical device that pumps ascitic fluid from the peritoneal space to the urinary bladder from where it is excreted. The pump reduces or abrogates the need for repeated paracentesis in patients with recurrent or refractory ascites.

Aims

To improve outcomes for alfapump ® implantation and pre- and post-implant patient management in both clinical trial and real-world settings by development of consensus recommendations.

Methods

The alfapump ® working group consisting of hepatologists and surgeons with extensive experience in implantation of the alfapump ® and patient management met on two occasions: (1) to determine the key areas where recommendations should be made; and (2) to discuss the experiences of the working group within those areas and formulate draft statements. Developed statements were submitted to the group and consensus sought on relevance and wording through a collaborative iterative approach in order to consolidate the recommendations into consensus statements. Only recommendations agreed upon unanimously were included.

Results

Twenty-three consensus recommendations were developed in the areas of pre-implantation procedure, (three statements), surgical implant procedure (11 statements), immediate post-implant care (three statements) and long-term management (six statements).

Conclusions

The consensus statements are a valuable reference resource for physicians managing patients with the alfapump ® and for those considering management strategies for patients with refractory ascites.

### The rate of pleural fluid drainage as a criterion for the timing of chest tube removal: theoretical and practical considerations [^113Cwq3Q]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Clinicians place chest tubes approximately 1 million times each year in the United States, but little information is available to guide their management. Specifically, use of the rate of pleural fluid drainage as a criterion for tube removal is not standardized. Absent such tubes, pleural fluid drains primarily through parietal pleural lymphatics at rates approaching 500 mL of fluid per day or more for each hemithorax. Early removal of tubes does not appear to be harmful. A noninferiority randomized trial currently in progress comparing removal without considering the drainage rate to a conservative threshold (2 mL/kg body weight in 24 hours) may better inform tube management.

### Safety, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of daycase paracentesis in the management of malignant ascites with a focus on ovarian cancer [^114d2sJE]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Paracentesis is a simple, low-risk procedure that provides rapid symptomatic relief from malignant ascites. The current practice of in-patient paracentesis is onerous for patients and consumes significant healthcare resources. Our study confirms the safety of free drainage of malignant ascites, and further demonstrates that in contrast to published studies, complete drainage can be achieved in a daycase setting in over 94% of patients, with radiological insertion of drains. The ability to perform complete paracentesis as an out-patient, within 6–8 h, and with minimal nursing intervention represents a significant improvement. It avoids lengthy hospital admission, improves the quality of life in palliative patients, with savings of over £500 per patient.

Our ability to achieve > 95% success rate with daycase paracentesis compared with the study byis likely to relate to planned radiological insertion of drains, minimising both delays associated with drain insertion by junior doctors, and a reduction in failed attempts at drain insertion. The drains used in our study were 6 Fr, which is larger than commonly used Bannano catheters, which is likely to have also expedited the rate of fluid drainage. Drain insertion by radiologist also has the advantage of consistency of the service over time compared with fluctuations that are inherent with changes in junior doctors on rotational attachments. However, provided that the drain is sited by a competent non-radiologist under image guidance, and within protected times early in the working day, the success of such a service should be reproducible.

Radiological drain insertion is often perceived as a costly option for paracentesis. However, our data indicate that overall there is a saving of approximately £519, with daycase compared with in-patient paracentesis. Similarly, an independent cost analysis reviewed by NICE costed in-patient ascitic drainage at £3145, PleureX drains at £2466 and daycase paracentesis at £1456. The cost savings of a daycase paracentesis service therefore range between £519 and £1689 relative to in-patient drainage. Given that paracentesis accounted for more than 28 000 bed-days in hospitals in England during 2007–2008, if implemented nationally, daycase paracentesis has the potential to save the NHS between 18 000 bed-days and £4–14 million per annum.

Results

The procedure was offered to 25 patients (median age 58 years) in the advanced stages of their disease. All patients had metastatic disease and had received a median of three lines of specific oncological treatment. Sixty percent of them were receiving exclusively palliative care. All patients required weekly paracentesis with high-volume drainage, ranging from 2 to 8 L each time. Frequent visits to the day hospital or regular paracentesis during hospitalization were required. The symptoms observed were consistent with those reported in the literature (Table 1).

Table 1
Characteristics of patient. Data are expressed as n (%, rounded up to the next decimal place), median//mean [min; max]

The procedure was well tolerated, with no immediate severe complications. One patient had moderate leakage at the drain site, which was resolved with the application of a dressing. Another patient had the drain dislodged within 24 h post-procedure due to confusion, and it was decided not to reinsert the drain (Table 2). Three weeks after the procedure, three patients (12%) developed an ascitic fluid infection, requiring antibiotic therapy. One of these patients had an unfavorable outcome, leading to death during hospitalization due to multifactorial causes (refractory bowel obstruction, acute renal failure, and tumor progression) (Table 3). Two patients (8%) experienced disabling leakage at the drain site, necessitating the placement of a new drain, which resulted in a favorable outcome. Another patient had a dysfunctional drain 15 days after placement, but did not undergo drain reinsertion due to significant deterioration in his general condition (Tables 2 and 3).

*A patient could present multiple discomfort symptoms, so the total exceeds 100%

The primary goal of this acute palliative care unit, in addition to managing refractory symptoms, is to facilitate communication among oncologists, palliative care specialists, patients, and their families. This collaborative approach seeks to redefine the therapeutic plan, develop a life project, and prevent unnecessary and costly obstinacy

Ten patients (40%) were still undergoing oncological treatment at the time of drain laying. However, these treatments did not cause aplasia (e.g. targeted therapies or monoclonal antibodies).

Safety of paracentesis with free ascitic drainage

A total of 21 paracenteses with free drainage of ascites were performed in 18 patients (Stage 2), between October 2010 and January 2011 (Table 1). The median age of women undergoing drainage was 64 years (range 54–84) (Table 1). Three had not received any prior treatment, including debulking surgery or chemotherapy. The average time from diagnosis was 24 months (0–98 months). Five of the patients had previously undergone ascitic drainage; the average length of time since OR from the previous paracentesis was 3 months (1–10 months). Overall, 13 of the patients were on antihypertensive medication and 10 on anticoagulants.

The average volume of ascites drained was 4500 mL (range 750–8400 ml). On average, 50% of the total ascitic fluid volume drained in 3 h, 70% in 6 h and 75% in 8 h (Figure 2). The median LoS for all patients undergoing drainage of malignant ascites was 7 days. Those admitted solely for drainage of ascites had a median LoS of 3 days (range 1–13), but if admitted via A&E (Accident and Emergency), the median LoS increased to 5 days (Table 2).

Of the 21 episodes of paracenteses with free drainage, 5 were clamped. One ascitic drain was accidentally clamped after 2 h. The patient was well and not hypotensive. In four patients (19% 95% CI 2–36%), the drain was clamped due to a fall in SBP < 95 mm Hg (Figure 3, Supplementary Table 1). However, none of the patients felt unwell or had a compensatory tachycardia, suggesting that the fall in BP was in part a re-normalisation of the BP, with the relief of abdominal discomfort and anxiety (Figure 3). None of these four patients subsequently developed renal dysfunction (a rise in creatinine > 25 μ mol) as a result of their ascites drainage. No individual patient characteristic predicted for the development of asymptomatic hypotension, in particular, a low pre-procedure BP did not predict for the development of asymptomatic hypotension.

Ascites management

How should ascites be managed in the preoperative period?

Recommendation

Preoperative ascites control should include sodium restriction and diuretics for grade 2 ascites and LVP with albumin administration for grade 3 ascites. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) should be considered preoperatively in patients undergoing elective hernia repair with ascites refractory to medical management.

Discussion

Ascites in the cirrhotic patient undergoing abdominal surgery can lead to wound complications including dehiscence, infection, and respiratory insufficiency secondary to abdominal distension. For this reason, the American Gastroenterological Association Clinical Practice Update on Surgical Risk Assessment and Perioperative Management in Cirrhosis recommends avoiding elective abdominal wall hernia surgery in the cirrhotic patient with ascites (in the absence of incarceration or strangulation) until the ascites is completely controlled. Ideally, any patient undergoing surgery should have preoperative ascites management; however, in the emergent setting this may not be feasible.

The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends sodium restriction (2 g or 90 mmol/day) and diuretics (spironolactone with or without furosemide) for grade 2 (moderate) ascites and LVP as the first-line treatment for grade 3 (large or gross) ascites, as LVP prior to surgery will minimize the development of PPCD. If LVP is performed removing > 5 L, albumin infusion at a dose of 6–8 g/L ascites drained should be administered. After paracentesis, sodium restriction and diuretics should be initiated once renal function has been assessed.

TIPS is usually reserved for patients with refractory ascites, but may be an option for patients with large volume ascites. The utilization of TIPS either preoperatively or postoperatively in small series and case reports in complicated hernias demonstrated improved outcomes. However, a small case-control study did not demonstrate benefit for routine use of preoperative TIPS in abdominal surgery. In a retrospective review of patients with DC undergoing abdominal surgery, the use of TIPS correlated to a significantly lower postoperative Model of End Stage Liver Disease Sodium (MELD-Na) score and perioperative TIPS was associated with a decreased incidence of postoperative ascites, infection, and acute kidney injury (AKI), but no mortality benefit. Overall, there is a paucity of data for the prophylactic or routine use of TIPS preoperatively in patients with portal hypertension and its use should be individualized on a case-by-case basis, particularly in those patients with refractory ascites. The AASLD guidelines recommend that TIPS should be considered before elective hernia repair or after an emergent operation in patients with uncontrolled ascites.

### Palliative semi-permanent abdominal drain for the management of refractory malignant ascites: a retrospective study in a comprehensive cancer center [^116hcZqe]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Our analysis indicates an improvement in comfort, symptom relief, and the possibility for patients to return home, which may be associated with an improvement in QoL. None of the patients required readmission to the day hospital or any further consultation due to disabling symptoms related to ascites, an important point for QoL, especially considering how exhausting hospital visits can be for patients receiving advanced palliative care. However, 40% of patients did not return home after the drain was placed. This is because the drain was inserted during hospitalization, and some patients were unable to return home due to a significantly deteriorated general condition or because they requested a transfer to a palliative care unit. Some passed away during the same hospitalization, just a few days after experiencing symptom relief. This represents one of the limitations of our study. The average time between the diagnosis of refractory ascites and death was 22.9 weeks [4.4–65.6]. However, the average time between drain placement and death was only 26.4 days [4–99], which limits the assessment of long-term benefits and complications of the procedure. Given these findings, it may be beneficial to offer the procedure earlier in the course of refractory ascites to provide more patients with the opportunity to return home.

However, our study has other several limitations. This is a monocentric study, with a small cohort, and we employed a retrospective medical record review, so the prevalence of symptoms before and post intervention may have been underreported and underestimated. In the absence of randomized studies comparing repeated ascitic drainage with continuous drainage via an indwelling catheter, there is no convincing evidence to suggest the superiority of one technique over the other in improving QoL. Therefore, a prospective study comparing repeated paracentesis with semi-permanent drain placement, alongside a QoL questionnaire, would be valuable. This approach would provide a pragmatic assessment of the relative advantages and disadvantages of these methods in the specific context of end-of-life care.

In the past 5 years, we have only offered the procedure to 25 patients. This is partly due to the COVID health crisis, which impacted the hospital's organization, particularly in terms of access to interventional radiology. However, it is important to note that 14 procedures have been performed since 2023. The pathway is now better established: interventional radiologists are less hesitant, and the medical oncology team is more informed and reassured by the process.

Introduction

The emergence of refractory malignant ascites in the advanced palliative phase significantly impacts patient's quality of life (QoL), causing pain, respiratory difficulties, digestive issues, and impaired mobility. Malignant ascites accounts for approximately 10% of all cases of ascites and is a marker of poor prognosis. Survival in this patient population is limited, with an average of approximately 20 weeks from diagnosis. The pathophysiology of malignant ascites is multifactorial, involving defective resorption by lymphatic capillaries due to tumor invasion, and hypersecretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leading to increased capillary filtration into the peritoneum. Additionally, ascites may result from portal hypertension caused by hepatic tumor infiltration.

Treatment of refractory malignant ascites is palliative, aiming primarily to relieve discomfort by reducing fluid volume. Several management options are available without standardized recommendations. Paracentesis remains the most common method, providing rapid but temporary symptom relief. Indeed, fluid reaccumulates quickly, with a median recurrence time of 10.4 days, requiring repeated paracentesis. Furthermore, the efficacy of paracentesis declines over time due to the progressive compartmentalization of ascitic fluid. The use of diuretics in the management of malignant ascites varies among physicians and no randomized controlled trials have assessed their efficacy. Greenway et al. described a good symptomatic control of ascites with high doses of spironolactone (150–400 mg/day) in a small group of patients with sodium retention and high plasma renin activity. In addition, alternative and more specific approaches are proposed, including external drainage systems using tunneled or non-tunneled catheters, which range in complexity.

In our palliative care practice, managing recurrent ascites is a frequent issue, particularly for highly frail patients with a limited prognosis. To address this, semi-continuous drainage has been implemented using a non-tunneled, semi-permanent peritoneal catheter, allowing for more frequent but smaller-volume drainages. This approach seeks to balance the benefits of symptom relief with the invasive nature of the intervention, focusing on improving QoL.

Since 2019, we have proposed non-tunneled, semi-permanent peritoneal catheter to simplify symptomatic drainage for several patients. For patients with a very limited prognosis who are unfit for invasive procedures, tunneled permanent catheter such as PleurX® system (Denver Biomedical, Inc. part of Cardinal Health, Inc.; Golden, CO) are often deemed unsuitable due to their invasive nature.

### Tunnelled peritoneal drainage catheter placement for the palliative management of refractory ascites in patients with liver cirrhosis [^113Cy1av]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Refractory ascites is an established indication for liver transplantation. While transplantation is regarded as the definitive therapy for this condition, many patients are unsuitable due to comorbidity or frailty. Alternatives such as transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) and large-volume paracentesis can lead to complications, including encephalopathy, circulatory and renal dysfunction, and protein-calorie deficiency that may accelerate sarcopenia. Cost and complication rates limit therapies such as alfapump. While there are data to support the use of indwelling catheters in the management of patients with malignant ascites, there is limited evidence to support their routine use in the context of end-stage liver cirrhosis. Here we describe our centres' experience using indwelling tunnelled ascitic drains over a 6-year period.

Methods

A retrospective review of data (January 2012-May 2018) was undertaken for all patients with refractory ascites who underwent a tunnelled ascitic drain. Demographics, disease aetiology, procedure data and follow-up data were obtained through interrogation of electronic records and reports.

Results

Twenty-five drains were placed. All procedures were technically successful with no immediate complications. Six patients were readmitted following their index admission with abdominal pain and suspected infected ascites (although only two had a positive ascitic fluid culture). There were three cases of abdominal wall cellulitis and three of leakage around the tunnel site; all managed conservatively.

Conclusion

Indwelling drains appear an effective strategy for palliative management of select patients with liver cirrhosis complicated by refractory ascites who are not amenable to undergo TIPSS or transplantation. While complications can occur, these are most usually minor and can be managed on an outpatient basis.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^111BiSSc]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

In patients with untreatable ascites, alternatives to repeated hospital drainage include placing a small tube (stent) in the liver. This specialised procedure is known as a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS). The TIPSS procedure is effective in reducing the need for repeated fluid drainage. Because of potential side effects, patients should be selected carefully for this procedure. This is particularly true for patients with more advanced liver disease, where the insertion of a TIPSS can potentially be harmful.

The only curative option for untreatable ascites is liver transplantation. If the patient is not suitable for liver transplantation, medical care then focuses on controlling the ascites symptoms. This is known as palliative care. The most common palliative treatment for untreatable ascites is repeated hospital drainage. Alternative treatments for untreatable ascites, such as long-term abdominal drains, need further research.

### Safety, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of daycase paracentesis in the management of malignant ascites with a focus on ovarian cancer [^113Y984F]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Although we have only included good-performance-status patients in the daycase service so far, our preliminary study suggests that patients with a poorer performance status are no more likely to experience haemodynamic compromise. The main limitation to this study is that most of the patients included in Stage 3 are ovarian cancer patients. However, of the few non-gynaecological patients included in the study, we saw no complications. The practicalities of hospital transport and day-unit capacity is currently the major obstacle locally preventing our ability to offer all eligible patients the option of daycase paracentesis.

The recent positive review of PleureX catheters compared with in-patient paracentesis urgently raises the issue of the best strategy for selecting patients for these three alternatives. Although there is a role for long-term indwelling ascitic drains, such as the commonly used Pleurex and Rocket catheters, we feel that the majority of patients do not require sufficiently frequent drainage to necessitate an indwelling drain. Of the 29 patients with ovarian cancer in Stages 2 and 3, only 6 (21%) had been drained in the previous 17 months (Supplementary Table 2). This demonstrates that the majority of ovarian cancer patients are drained for platinum-sensitive relapse, and that daycase paracentesis is the preferred method for drainage. In contrast, in platinum-resistant patients, with recurrence ascites, long-term drains may be considered.

In summary, our results confirm the safety of free ascitic drainage and demonstrate the feasibility of daycase paracentesis with complete fluid drainage in over 94% of patients with radiological catheter insertion. Coupled with it's cost-effectiveness, our results suggest that daycase paracentesis can potentially be considered the primary treatment modality for the management of malignant ascites, especially with ovarian cancer and good performance status, and should be an option more widely available to patients.

How should ascites be managed in the intraoperative or postoperative period?

Recommendation

Albumin administration can be considered as part of intraoperative fluid management to help avoid PPCD related to intraoperative ascites evacuation, based on its benefit in PPCD prevention in non-operative situations such as LVP. TIPS should be considered postoperatively in patients with ascites that is refractory to medical management.

No recommendation is made for or against the routine use of intra-abdominal drains. If used, drains should be removed as soon as feasible.

### Incidence of hyponatremia in patients with indwelling peritoneal catheters for drainage of malignant ascites [^112MjDyM]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Despite the mechanistic differences between cirrhotic and malignant ascites, the latter is often inappropriately managed with diuretics, thus worsening volume depletion and salt loss. This was evident in the subset of hypovolemic hyponatremic patients in our cohort, in which diuretics worsened hyponatremia in patient 15. Hyponatremia secondary to salt loss from recurrent malignant ascitic drainage should be managed by the administration of isotonic IVF and/or albumin (154 mEq of sodium in 1 L of 25% albumin). In the hypovolemic hyponatremic subset of our cohort, repletion with IVF, albumin, or blood returned the sNa level back to baseline. Malignant ascites accumulates independent of volume status; thus, the administration of crystalloid does not worsen ascites. Replacement of sodium losses with regular IVF infusions equivalent to the amount of ascitic fluid drained is key to managing these patients. It is also critical to restrict consumption of hypotonic fluids, increase dietary salt content, and obtain biweekly laboratory samples from high-risk patients, if within the patient's goals of care.

Two small prospective RCTs compared standard dose (6–8 g/L of ascites drained) albumin after LVP with low-dose albumin (2–4 g/L). Pooled results from 70 patients suggested no difference in post-paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (RR = 2.97, 95% CI 0.89, 9.91) and no development of renal dysfunction (no events in either group). A larger retrospective review of 935 patients found no increase in renal dysfunction when adherence to guidance (8 g/L after 5 L drained) was implemented, but significant cost savings were made because less HAS was used.

Potential cost savings have been proposed in relation to length of hospital stay in patients with ascites undergoing LVP who are treated with HAS as compared with an alternative plasma expander. However, HAS is more expensive than alternatives and is in worldwide shortage, therefore it should be prescribed according to recommended guidance based on the available evidence. There have been no cost-effectiveness analyses in the UK.

Until further studies are undertaken to compare efficacy of albumin against clinically available artificial plasma expanders, we would recommend that albumin remains the preferred plasma expander when paracentesis is undertaken. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed.

Ascites — post-TIPS course and management highlight that there is gradual suppression of neurohormonal vasoconstrictor systems over 4–6 months, with significant diuresis and elimination of ascites occurring thereafter. Patients should be maintained on a sodium-restricted diet until ascites is adequately controlled, and caution is recommended about post-TIPS diuretics because they may reduce effective TIPS perfusion and delay ascites clearance. Eventually, approximately 80% of patients will clear their ascites with TIPS, and patients who fail to do so despite a widely patent TIPS at 12 months should be referred for liver transplantation (LT) evaluation.

Executive summary of recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis in new- onset ascites 1.1. A diagnostic paracentesis is recommended in all patients with new-onset ascites. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.2. The initial ascitic fluid analysis should include total protein concentration and calculation of the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.3. Ascites fluid analysis for cytology, amylase, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and adenosine deaminase should be considered based on pretest probability of specific diagnosis (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: weak)
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 2.1. Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis SBP) in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.2. A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.3. Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm 3 count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.4. Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.5. Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.6. A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.7. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong; Recommendation: strong) 2.8. Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.9. Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Dietary salt restriction 3.1. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should have a moderately salt restricted diet with daily salt intake of no more than 5–6.5 g (87–113 mmol sodium). This translates to a no added salt diet with avoidance of precooked meals. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 3.2. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should receive nutritional counselling on the sodium content in the diet. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Diuretics 4.1. In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites, spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 4.2. All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.3. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.4. Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/L). (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.5. Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration should be reserved for those who are severely symptomatic with acute hyponatraemia. Serum sodium should be slowly corrected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.6. It may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case by case basis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Large volume paracentesis (LVP) 5.1. Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 5.2. Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 5.3. Routine measurement of the prothrombin time and platelet count before therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis and infusion of blood products are not recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Use of human albumin solution (HAS) 6.1. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 6.2. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) can be considered after paracentesis of < 5 L at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed in patients with ACLF or high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 6.3. In patients with SBP and an increased serum creatinine or a rising serum creatinine, infusion of 1.5 g albumin/kg within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3, is recommended. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) 7.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with refractory ascites. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 7.2. Caution is required if considering TIPSS in patients with age > 70 years, serum bilirubin > 50 µmol/L, platelet count < 75×10 9 /L, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥ 18, current hepatic encephalopathy, active infection or hepatorenal syndrome. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Umbilical hernia 8.1. Suitability and timing of surgical repair of umbilical hernia should be considered in discussion with the patient and multidisciplinary team involving physicians, surgeons and anaesthetists. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) 9.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with HH after discussion with the multidisciplinary team. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 9.2. In patients with HH who are not undergoing a TIPSS and/or a liver transplant evaluation, alternative palliative interventions should be considered. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) and ascites 10.1. Refractory ascites should not be viewed as a contraindication to NSBB. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 10.2. Patients with refractory ascites who are taking NSBB should be monitored closely, and dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate in those who develop hypotension or acute/progressive renal dysfunction. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Automated low-flow ascites pump 11.1. An automated low-flow ascites pump should be considered only in special circumstances with robust arrangements of clinical governance, audit or research. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Palliative care 12.1. Patients with refractory ascites who are not undergoing evaluation for liver transplant should be offered a palliative care referral. Besides repeated LVP, alternative palliative interventions for refractory ascites should also be considered. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Research recommendations 13.1. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) with large sample size should evaluate the role of antibiotics in the secondary prophylaxis for SBP in ascites secondary to cirrhosis. 13.2. Large RCTs should assess the role of midodrine in the management of ascites. 13.3. Cost-effectiveness of long-term administration of albumin to patients with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites should be evaluated. 13.4. Role of nutritional interventions in the management of ascites should be evaluated. 13.5. Large RCT of long-term carvedilol versus no carvedilol in patients with refractory ascites without large oesophageal varices should be carried out. 13.6. Role of TIPSS in the management of hepatic hydrothorax should be compared with other therapeutic interventions. 13.7. The cost-effectiveness and the effect of automated low-flow ascites pumps on the quality of life of patients with refractory ascites should be evaluated. 13.8. Effectiveness and safety of long-term abdominal drains should be assessed in RCTs for the palliative care of patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites.

### Guidelines for the management of adult acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure in the ICU: neurology, peri-transplant medicine, infectious disease, and gastroenterology considerations [^113qJcPv]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Large volume paracentesis (LVP) in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) among critically ill acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients — We suggest not performing large volume paracentesis (LVP) in critically ill ACLF patients with SBP (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). LVP is defined as removing greater than 4 L of ascitic fluid; in a randomized comparison of LVP plus albumin versus diuretics plus albumin in cirrhotic patients with SBP, there were no statistically significant differences for mortality, renal impairment, or resolution of SBP.
