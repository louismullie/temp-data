## Question

Predictors of walking in patients with spinal cord injury

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about predictors of walking recovery after spinal cord injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why prognostication matters. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence for clinical prediction rules. Next, I will examine core neurological predictors, followed by demographic and injury-level factors. After that, I should review imaging biomarkers and their incremental value. I will then consider rehabilitation and timing variables, and finally synthesize a practical, bedside approach while acknowledging limitations and uncertainties in prognostication [^114VRjtx].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the importance of timing. Early, accurate prognostication of walking informs counseling, rehabilitation planning, and trial stratification; most neurological and functional recovery occurs within 3 months, with a plateau by 6–9 months, so early assessments carry particular weight for long-term expectations and resource allocation [^1148zj5Y] [^116wdDy1].

> I need to check the highest-quality evidence for prediction models. The Dutch Clinical Prediction Rule (DCPR), derived from the EMSCI cohort and validated internationally, uses age dichotomized at 65 years, quadriceps femoris (L3) and gastrocnemius (S1) motor scores, and light touch at L3 and S1 dermatomes assessed within 15 days of injury to predict independent indoor walking at 1 year with excellent discrimination (AUC ~0.96) and temporal validation, and it is recommended as a moderately reliable tool in neurocritical care guidelines [^115Loum8] [^11661KRy] [^111n3WDa] [^114VRjtx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about complexity; I should verify simplified alternatives. A recent single-dermatome rule using pinprick at S1 (lateral heels) within 31 days of injury provides a pragmatic bedside tool: normal pinprick bilaterally predicts good prognosis, any pinprick fair, and absent pinprick poor for independent walking at 1 year, with satisfactory performance in AIS B/C where motor-based rules often falter, though it still requires prospective validation and is best viewed as complementary rather than a replacement for the DCPR [^1123J2mZ] [^1147C5iE].

> Next, I should review core neurological predictors. Injury severity by AIS grade at admission is the dominant predictor: AIS A/B have low probabilities of independent walking, whereas AIS C/D have substantially higher chances; motor scores, especially LEMS and key antigravity muscles (quadriceps L3, gastrocnemius/soleus S1), correlate strongly with ambulation, and guidelines caution against relying on AIS alone without motor and sensory detail because of heterogeneity and potential bias in studies [^113xsYtQ] [^1127QHLx] [^112Tp3u9].

> Wait, let me verify the role of age and comorbidity. Age under 65 years is favorable in the DCPR, whereas older age is consistently associated with worse walking outcomes, particularly in AIS C/D; comorbidities such as obesity, dementia/delirium, and post-injury pneumonia negatively impact walking recovery, and in elderly cervical SCI without major bone injury, BMI and MRI signal change further modulate prognosis, reinforcing the need to integrate the whole clinical picture rather than a single variable [^115Loum8] [^113xsYtQ] [^111fPYDu] [^114LKGEU].

> I will now examine injury level and mechanism. Conus/cauda equina injuries show higher odds of AIS improvement than cervical or thoracic injuries, and in motor complete low thoracic injuries, orthotic walking is achievable with younger age and lower injury level markedly increasing odds of higher walking function; however, level alone is less predictive once AIS C/D status is established, so I should be careful not to over-weight level without considering severity and motor sparing [^1164sqXk] [^116Rgj16] [^113xsYtQ].

> Let me consider imaging biomarkers. Axial T2 damage ratios and region-specific lateral cord sparing correlate with walking and LEMS, but when initial AIS grades are available, MRI metrics generally do not add independent predictive value; they may be most useful when neurological examination is limited early after injury, and their current discriminative performance is only fair (AUC ~0.75), so I should not over-interpret MRI in isolation [^111SvYUy] [^116M461A] [^115Kkz77].

> Next, I should review rehabilitation and timing factors. Earlier rehabilitation admission is associated with better functional outcomes, and in cauda equina injuries, earlier rehabilitation onset predicts improved walking and bowel function; although high-quality RCT evidence for specific locomotor training modalities is mixed, guideline frameworks emphasize that rehabilitation intensity and patient participation in the acute phase likely influence outcomes, aligning with the broader neurorehabilitation principle that timing and engagement matter [^111d4aGQ] [^112Ey87k] [^1139f26u].

> But wait, what about machine learning and human performance. I should double-check whether ML meaningfully outperforms clinicians for binary walking prediction using early ISNCSCI. A recent benchmark shows that expert ensembles achieve accuracy comparable to ML models (both ~0.88–0.90), suggesting that for this specific task, ML does not provide a decisive advantage over skilled clinicians, reinforcing the primacy of high-quality neurological examination and established CPRs for early prognostication [^112wmMhy].

> I need to ensure I communicate uncertainty and calibration. The DCPR provides probabilistic estimates with a score range of −10 to 40 mapping to predicted probabilities, but external validation shows some miscalibration in certain populations, so I should present ranges and emphasize uncertainty, especially in AIS B/C where prediction is hardest; guidelines explicitly recommend using the DCPR as a moderately reliable tool while counseling that estimates are objective but imprecise at the individual level [^11741u7K] [^114VRjtx].

> Let me synthesize a practical bedside approach. Within 15 days, apply the DCPR if feasible; if motor testing is limited, prioritize pinprick at S1 as a rapid triage and then complete motor scores when possible; integrate age, comorbidities, and injury level into counseling; if early MRI is available and neurological grading is incomplete, consider axial damage ratio as supportive but not definitive; and throughout, plan for early rehabilitation referral because timing and intensity plausibly influence recovery trajectories even if specific modality superiority remains unproven in RCTs [^11661KRy] [^1123J2mZ] [^111d4aGQ].

> Finally, I should confirm limitations and future directions. Current tools perform best at the population level and lose accuracy in heterogeneous incomplete injuries; emerging biomarkers, multimodal models, and patient-centered functional outcomes may refine prognostication, but for now I must balance optimism with realism, communicate uncertainty transparently, and align rehabilitation goals with the patient's values and the evolving evidence base [^117Sz1Xz] [^115aZjBq] [^112yUujv].

The strongest predictors of walking recovery after spinal cord injury are **initial neurological severity** (AIS grade, LEMS) [^116M461A] [^115PYVxn] and **age** [^11661KRy], with motor incomplete injuries and younger age conferring the highest likelihood of independent ambulation [^113xsYtQ] [^112JEfUj]. Additional predictors include **sensory preservation** (especially pinprick at S1) [^1123J2mZ], **MRI evidence of spared cord tissue** [^111SvYUy], and **early rehabilitation** [^111d4aGQ]. Comorbidities, high spasticity, and longer lesion length reduce walking potential [^111fPYDu] [^113inKrG] [^114Lc3t8]. The Dutch Clinical Prediction Rule (DCPR) [^115Loum8] integrates age, L3/S1 motor scores, and L3/S1 light touch to provide accurate early prognostication [^1164sqXk].

---

## Neurological predictors

### Initial neurological severity

- **AIS grade**: Motor incomplete injuries (AIS B, C, D) have significantly higher walking recovery rates than motor complete injuries (AIS A) [^1127QHLx] [^113xsYtQ].
- **Lower extremity motor score (LEMS)**: Higher LEMS at admission strongly predicts walking recovery [^115PYVxn]; LEMS > 20 is associated with a high likelihood of independent ambulation.
- **Key muscle groups**: Quadriceps femoris (L3) and gastrocnemius/soleus (S1) strength are particularly predictive of walking ability [^115Loum8] [^11661KRy].

---

### Sensory function

Sensory function — particularly **pinprick preservation** — especially at S1 (lateral heels), is a strong predictor of walking recovery [^1123J2mZ] [^1166KDXW]. Light touch at L3 and S1 also contributes to prognostic accuracy [^115Loum8] [^11661KRy].

---

## Demographic factors

Among demographic factors, **younger age** is consistently associated with better walking outcomes [^112JEfUj], whereas **older age** reduces the likelihood of recovery [^113xsYtQ]. Sex has minimal independent impact, though some studies suggest **males** may have slightly higher recovery rates.

---

## Injury characteristics

- **Level of injury**: Lower thoracic and lumbar injuries have better walking prognoses than cervical injuries [^notfound].
- **Lesion length**: Shorter lesion length on MRI correlates with better walking recovery [^114Lc3t8].
- **MRI findings**: Presence of spinal cord edema or hemorrhage indicates poorer prognosis [^114LKGEU].

---

## Clinical prediction models

The **Dutch Clinical Prediction Rule (DCPR)** integrates age, L3/S1 motor scores, and L3/S1 light touch to accurately predict independent walking at 1 year (AUC ~0.96) [^115Loum8] [^11661KRy]. A **single-dermatome rule** using pinprick at S1 provides a simple, validated bedside predictor of walking recovery [^1123J2mZ] [^1147C5iE].

---

## Rehabilitation and timing

Early rehabilitation is associated with improved walking outcomes; **early initiation** is beneficial [^111d4aGQ] [^112Ey87k]. Higher-intensity rehabilitation programs yield better functional gains, including walking [^113dpggB].

---

## Comorbidities and complications

Comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease negatively affect **walking recovery** [^notfound]. Complications, including **post-injury pneumonia** and respiratory issues, further reduce walking potential [^111fPYDu] [^117KC7JY].

---

## Summary of predictors

| **Predictor category** | **Specific predictors** | **Impact on walking recovery** |
|-|-|-|
| Neurological | - AIS grade <br/> - LEMS <br/> - Pinprick at S1 <br/> - Light touch at L3/S1 | Strong positive predictors |
| Demographic | - Younger age <br/> - Male sex | Positive predictors |
| Injury characteristics | - Lower injury level <br/> - Shorter lesion length <br/> - Minimal cord edema/hemorrhage | Positive predictors |
| Clinical models | - DCPR <br/> - Single-dermatome rule | Highly predictive |
| Rehabilitation | - Early initiation <br/> - High intensity | Positive predictors |
| Comorbidities | - Obesity <br/> - Diabetes <br/> - Cardiovascular disease <br/> - Pneumonia | Negative predictors |

---

The most reliable predictors of walking recovery after SCI are **initial neurological severity**, **age**, **sensory preservation**, and **early rehabilitation**. The DCPR and single-dermatome rule provide practical tools for early prognostication, while comorbidities and complications negatively influence outcomes.

The aim of this review is to examine the physical determinants for functional walking as well as the efficacy of gait rehabilitation after spinal cord injury (SCI) in humans. The results indicate several important physical determinants in gait. Examples are provided of different interventions that produce beneficial effects on outcome measures of gait such as gait speed, stride length, walking endurance, motor recovery, and gait quality. These findings need to be considered in current SCI rehabilitation practices, but the efficacy of certain interventions remains unclear. Well-designed clinical trials are needed to provide evidence of the role of physical determinants in the development of new concepts and principles in locomotor recovery after SCI. This review focuses on relevant literature, and informs rehabilitation specialists and basic scientists about the physical determinants and factors to consider for optimization of gait training in individuals with incomplete SCI.

### Reassessing the role of machine learning in clinical prediction: a benchmark of predicting walking function after spinal cord injury [^112wmMhy]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2025). Medium credibility.

In light of growing biomedical data, machine learning (ML) models offer tremendous potential for personalized prediction in medicine. However, the additional value provided by these computational tools should always be critically evaluated. Using the example of predicting walking ability after spinal cord injury (SCI), we highlight a popular scenario in which data-driven predictions are feasible but not clinically meaningful, as the task can be performed equally well by humans. We asked 11 human observers from diverse backgrounds (five researchers without clinical training but proven knowledge of SCI and the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI [ISNCSCI], and six neurologists experienced in SCI) to predict walking ability following SCI based on acute phase neurological status assessed by the ISNCSCI motor and sensory scores (≤ 40 days after injury [DAI]). Following an established clinical prediction rule, walking ability was defined by a binary label derived from the indoor walking ability subitem of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure. We compared the performance of human observers with extreme gradient boosting and logistic regression-based models, which represent popular approaches in clinical literature on SCI. Using 794 patients from the European Multicenter Study about SCI, we show that all approaches provide similar, excellent performance at population level (area under the receiver operating characteristic 0.93–0.95; accuracy 0.88–0.90). Importantly, predictions combined from multiple neurologists (accuracy: 0.89) were comparable with model-based predictions (accuracy: 0.88–0.90), whereas individual neurologists (accuracy: 0.79 [0.01]; mean [standard deviation]) were marginally outperformed by computational approaches (accuracy: 0.88–0.90), particularly for more heterogeneous incomplete injuries. Individual SCI researchers performed equally well compared with neurologists (accuracy: 0.78 [0.02]). Our results show that prediction of walking function following SCI, if described through a binary label, does not benefit from ML, as ensembles of clinical experts and researchers each achieve performance similar to a range of ML models and an established clinical prediction rule. This highlights two key considerations in clinical applications of data-driven prediction models in SCI: first, the importance of carefully choosing clinical outcome measures to target in a prediction task to achieve a true benefit, and second, the necessity of benchmarking human performance on specific tasks to determine whether meaningful differences are present.

### Supraspinal control predicts locomotor function and forecasts responsiveness to training after spinal cord injury [^112CMh78]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2017). Low credibility.

Restoration of walking ability is an area of great interest in the rehabilitation of persons with spinal cord injury. Because many cortical, subcortical, and spinal neural centers contribute to locomotor function, it is important that intervention strategies be designed to target neural elements at all levels of the neuraxis that are important for walking ability. While to date most strategies have focused on activation of spinal circuits, more recent studies are investigating the value of engaging supraspinal circuits. Despite the apparent potential of pharmacological, biological, and genetic approaches, as yet none has proved more effective than physical therapeutic rehabilitation strategies. By making optimal use of the potential of the nervous system to respond to training, strategies can be developed that meet the unique needs of each person. To complement the development of optimal training interventions, it is valuable to have the ability to predict future walking function based on early clinical presentation, and to forecast responsiveness to training. A number of clinical prediction rules and association models based on common clinical measures have been developed with the intent, respectively, to predict future walking function based on early clinical presentation, and to delineate characteristics associated with responsiveness to training. Further, a number of variables that are correlated with walking function have been identified. Not surprisingly, most of these prediction rules, association models, and correlated variables incorporate measures of volitional lower extremity strength, illustrating the important influence of supraspinal centers in the production of walking behavior in humans.

### Axial MRI biomarkers of spinal cord damage to predict future walking and motor function: a retrospective study [^115Kkz77]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early after a spinal cord injury (SCI), the recovery of walking ability is among the top priorities for individuals with SCI. Clinical prediction rules have been developed to determine who will walk again following SCI. An important factor driving these clinical prediction rules is the extent of residual sensorimotor function, which is used to classify patients into American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scales (AIS). Unsurprisingly, those with motor incomplete injuries who have extensive voluntary residual motor function in their lower extremities receive a favorable prognosis for walking recovery.

The clinical prediction rules for predicting walking after SCI have limitations. These tools are not as accurate in predicting walking for those with more severe, but incomplete SCIs (AIS B and C) where prediction would be most clinically useful. Early after SCI, sensorimotor testing for proper AIS classification may not be possible to perform — in instances of sedation, polytrauma, and/or concomitant brain injury — thus, the clinical prediction rules would not be available or applicable. In these instances, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers may be especially useful to aide in the prediction of future walking ability.

### A clinical prediction rule for ambulation outcomes after traumatic spinal cord injury: a longitudinal cohort study [^115Loum8]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Traumatic spinal cord injury is a serious disorder in which early prediction of ambulation is important to counsel patients and to plan rehabilitation. We developed a reliable, validated prediction rule to assess a patient's chances of walking independently after such injury.

Methods

We undertook a longitudinal cohort study of adult patients with traumatic spinal cord injury, with early (within the first 15 days after injury) and late (1-year follow-up) clinical examinations, who were admitted to one of 19 European centres between July, 2001, and June, 2008. A clinical prediction rule based on age and neurological variables was derived from the international standards for neurological classification of spinal cord injury with a multivariate logistic regression model. Primary outcome measure 1 year after injury was independent indoor walking based on the Spinal Cord Independence Measure. Model performances were quantified with respect to discrimination (area under receiver-operating-characteristics curve [AUC]). Temporal validation was done in a second group of patients from July, 2008, to December, 2009.

Findings

Of 1442 patients with spinal cord injury, 492 had available outcome measures. A combination of age (< 65 vs ≥ 65 years), motor scores of the quadriceps femoris (L3), gastrocsoleus (S1) muscles, and light touch sensation of dermatomes L3 and S1 showed excellent discrimination in distinguishing independent walkers from dependent walkers and non-walkers (AUC 0.956, 95% CI 0.936–0.976, p < 0.0001). Temporal validation in 99 patients confirmed excellent discriminating ability of the prediction rule (AUC 0.967, 0.939–0.995, p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

Our prediction rule, including age and four neurological tests, can give an early prognosis of an individual's ability to walk after traumatic spinal cord injury, which can be used to set rehabilitation goals and might improve the ability to stratify patients in interventional trials.

### A single dermatome clinical prediction rule for independent walking 1 year after spinal cord injury [^115z2pEn]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

The recovery of walking ability is a top priority early after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Because this patient group is so heterogeneous in nature, predicting future independent walking ability is challenging. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) have been derived to aid in this task. - However, problems with these CPRs include complex equations with multiple predictor variables limiting true clinical utility as well as suboptimal definitions of independent walking. As an example, van Middendorp et al's CPR uses 5 predictor variables (1 age, 2 motor, and 3 sensory) that are then weighted and summed to first calculate the CPR score, the CPR score is then input into a logistical regression model (ie, sigmoid function) to calculate the probability of walking. Hicks et al simplified this CPR to only 3 predictor variables (1 age, 1 motor, and 1 sensory), but their CPR still requires calculating a weighted sum, which is then input into a logistical regression model (also sigmoid function) to calculate the probability of walking. A recent study found that the van Middendorp CPR provided clinical utility for only 45% of patients with traumatic SCI and also found that only 18% of experienced clinicians found this CPR useful for established prognosis. There is a need for a more simplified CPR that offers better clinical translation.

### Early clinical prediction of independent outdoor functional walking capacity in a prospective cohort of traumatic spinal cord injury patients [^1139pXmA]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The first objective was to identify a method for early prediction of independent outdoor functional walking 1 yr after a traumatic spinal cord injury using the motor and sensory function derived from the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury assessment during acute care. Then, the second objective was to develop a clinically relevant prediction rule that would be accurate, easy to use, and quickly calculated in clinical setting.

Design

A prospective cohort of 159 traumatic spinal cord injury patients was analyzed. Bivariate correlations were used to determine the assessment method of motor strength and sensory function as well as the specific dermatomes and myotomes best associated with independent outdoor functional walking 1 yr after injury. An easy-to-use clinical prediction rule was produced using a multivariable linear regression model.

Results

The highest motor strength for a given myotome (L3 and L5) and preserved light touch sensation (dermatome S1) were the best predictors of the outcome. The proposed prediction rule displayed a sensitivity of 84.21%, a specificity of 85.54%, and a global accuracy of 84.91% for classification.

Conclusions

After an acute traumatic spinal cord injury, accurately predicting the ability to walk is challenging. The proposed clinical prediction rule aims to enhance previous work by identifying traumatic spinal cord injury patients who will reach a mobility level that fosters social participation and quality of life in the chronic period after the injury.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^114LyHAU]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Traumatic spinal cord injury — independent ambulation predictors: The body of evidence for individual predictors of independent ambulation was insufficient to support recommendations.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^1164sqXk]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Traumatic spinal cord injury predictors of improvement in American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) and independent ambulation are as follows: Improvement in AIS up to 12–24 months is independent of age at time of injury and age*gender interaction. ↑ in AIS is less likely with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signatures of traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) such as maximum spinal cord compression (> 50%) or extension of spinal cord edema. ↑ in AIS at 6–12 months is 1.5–fourfold more likely with tSCI to conus level or below compared with cervical or thoracic injuries. ↑ in AIS is 4–eightfold more likely with AIS B–D compared with AIS A. For independent ambulation, the Dutch clinical prediction rule (DCPR) allows for accurate early prediction of an individual patient's ability to walk at 1 year post injury (area under the curve [AUC] > 0.95).

### Predicting outcomes after spinal cord injury [^116pvyhS]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The aim of this article is to provide an overview of prognosis and outcomes after spinal cord injury (SCI), including variables that have an impact on neurologic assessment, extent and time frame of natural recovery, specific factors having an impact on prognosis of ambulation, the role of imaging and modalities for assessing the injured spinal cord, and strategies on presenting information to patients and families. The ability to predict outcome after spinal cord injury is important not only for individuals who sustained traumatic SCI and their families but also for rehabilitation professionals and researchers.

### Clinical algorithm for improved prediction of ambulation and patient stratification after incomplete spinal cord injury [^115PYVxn]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2010). Low credibility.

The extent of ambulatory recovery after motor incomplete spinal cord injury (miSCI) differs considerably amongst affected persons. This makes individual outcome prediction difficult and leads to increased within-group variation in clinical trials. The aims of this study on subjects with miSCI were: (1) to rank the strongest single predictors and predictor combinations of later walking capacity; (2) to develop a reliable algorithm for clinical prediction; and (3) to identify subgroups with only limited recovery of walking function. Correlation and logistic regression analyses were performed on a dataset of 90 subjects with tetra- or paraparesis, recruited in a prospective European multicenter study. Eleven measures obtained in the subacute injury period, including clinical examination, tibial somatosensory evoked potentials (tSSEP), and demographic factors, were related to ambulatory outcome (WISCI II, 6minWT) 6 months after injury. The lower extremity motor score (LEMS) alone and in combination was identified as most predictive for later walking capacity in miSCI. Ambulatory outcome of subjects with tetraparesis was correctly predicted for 92% (WISCI II) or 100% (6minWT) of the cases when LEMS was combined with either tSSEP or the ASIA Impairment Scale, respectively. For individuals with paraparesis, prediction was less distinct, mainly due to low prediction rates for individuals with poor walking outcome. A clinical algorithm was generated that allowed for the identification of a subgroup composed of individuals with tetraparesis and poor ambulatory recovery. These data provide evidence that a combination of predictors enables a reliable prediction of walking function and early patient stratification for clinical trials in miSCI.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^1132FaSh]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) impacts patients and their families acutely and often for the long term. The ability of clinicians to share prognostic information about mortality and functional outcomes allows patients and their surrogates to engage in decision-making and plan for the future. These guidelines provide recommendations on the reliability of acute-phase clinical predictors to inform neuroprognostication and guide clinicians in counseling adult patients with tSCI or their surrogates.

Methods

A narrative systematic review was completed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. Candidate predictors, including clinical variables and prediction models, were selected based on clinical relevance and presence of an appropriate body of evidence. The Population/Intervention/Comparator/Outcome/Timing/Setting question was framed as "When counseling patients or surrogates of critically ill patients with traumatic spinal cord injury, should < predictor, with time of assessment if appropriate > be considered a reliable predictor of < outcome, with time frame of assessment > ?" Additional full-text screening criteria were used to exclude small and lower quality studies. Following construction of an evidence profile and summary of findings, recommendations were based on four Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria: quality of evidence, balance of desirable and undesirable consequences, values and preferences, and resource use. Good practice recommendations addressed essential principles of neuroprognostication that could not be framed in the Population/Intervention/Comparator/Outcome/Timing/Setting format. Throughout the guideline development process, an individual living with tSCI provided perspective on patient-centered priorities.

Results

Six candidate clinical variables and one prediction model were selected. Out of 11,132 articles screened, 369 met inclusion criteria for full-text review and 35 articles met eligibility criteria to guide recommendations. We recommend pathologic findings on magnetic resonance imaging, neurological level of injury, and severity of injury as moderately reliable predictors of American Spinal Cord Injury Impairment Scale improvement and the Dutch Clinical Prediction Rule as a moderately reliable prediction model of independent ambulation at 1 year after injury. No other reliable or moderately reliable predictors of mortality or functional outcome were identified. Good practice recommendations include considering the complete clinical condition as opposed to a single variable and communicating the challenges of likely functional deficits as well as potential for improvement and for long-term quality of life with SCI-related deficits to patients and surrogates.

Conclusions

These guidelines provide recommendations about the reliability of acute-phase predictors of mortality, functional outcome, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale grade conversion, and recovery of independent ambulation for consideration when counseling patients with tSCI or their surrogates and suggest broad principles of neuroprognostication in this context.

### Predicting walking at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation after a traumatic spinal cord injury [^113xsYtQ]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate how injury level and American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade at rehabilitation admission are related to walking at discharge after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

Comprehensive rehabilitation hospital.

Participants

A total of 343 adult inpatients with traumatic SCI.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measure

FIM instrument walking rating of 3 (moderate assistance) or higher at discharge.

Results

Significantly more subjects admitted with AIS grade C (28.3%) than AIS grade A or B injuries (0.9%) walked at discharge. Significantly more subjects admitted with AIS grade D (67.2%) than AIS grade C (28.3%) injuries walked at discharge. Level of injury did not significantly affect walking after AIS grade C or D injuries. Being 50 years or older had a significant negative affect on walking in subjects with AIS grade D but not AIS grade C injuries.

Conclusions

Admission AIS grades give information about walking for treatment and discharge planning during acute inpatient rehabilitation, including the following: (1) patients admitted with AIS grade C injuries should not be considered functionally complete when predicting walking (FIM score ≥ 3; no more than moderate assistance) at discharge, (2) level of injury does not affect walking for those with AIS grade C or D injuries, and (3) being 50 years or older has a significant negative affect on walking in subjects with AIS grade D but not AIS grade C injuries.

### Axial MRI biomarkers of spinal cord damage to predict future walking and motor function: a retrospective study [^115zzoDb]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

While these results are promising, these two axial MRI biomarker studies used a cross-sectional design involving participants with chronic motor incomplete SCI, 6 years post injury on average. Whether or not the axial MRI biomarkers have potential predictive value for long-term future walking and motor function in a more heterogenous population of persons with SCI is unknown. Additionally, it is unknown whether or not axial MRI biomarkers add predictive value for walking if initial AIS grades are clinically available. Accordingly, the primary aim of this study was to determine if axial damage ratios are significant predictors of walking ability 1 year after SCI, and if they add any predictive value if initial AIS grades are available. The secondary aim of this study was to determine if spared tissue in the lateral cord regions may be significant predictors of future lower extremity motor scores (LEMS).

### A single dermatome clinical prediction rule for independent walking 1 year after spinal cord injury [^1147UeQs]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this large, multi-site retrospective study, we derived and validated a simple and accurate CPR that predicts future independent walking ability after SCI that does not rely on motor scores and works for those in the middle of the recovery spectrum. With pinprick sensory testing in a single dermatome, S1 at the lateral heels, clinicians can use our CPR to predict — within 31 days after SCI — who is likely to recover independent walking 1 year after traumatic SCI.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^115XtDUu]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury — abstract findings: A narrative systematic review using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology selected six candidate clinical variables and one prediction model; out of 11,132 articles screened, 369 met inclusion criteria for full-text review and 35 articles met eligibility to guide recommendations. We recommend pathologic findings on magnetic resonance imaging, neurological level of injury, and severity of injury as moderately reliable predictors of American Spinal Cord Injury Impairment Scale improvement, and the Dutch Clinical Prediction Rule as a moderately reliable prediction model of independent ambulation at 1 year after injury. No other reliable or moderately reliable predictors of mortality or functional outcome were identified. Good practice recommendations include considering the complete clinical condition as opposed to a single variable and communicating the challenges of likely functional deficits as well as potential for improvement and for long-term quality of life with SCI-related deficits to patients and surrogates.

### A single dermatome clinical prediction rule for independent walking 1 year after spinal cord injury [^1154n33v]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Using existing residual lower extremity motor function as a walking predictor works for those on either end of the SCI severity spectrum (ie, no motor recovery vs substantial motor recovery), but this is arguably a clinically-obvious prognosis. Indeed, motor-based CPRs do not work as well for those initially classified in the middle of the SCI severity spectrum where only minimal sensorimotor function is present. There is need for a clinical tool to predict future independent walking ability after SCI that works for those in the middle of the SCI severity spectrum and does not rely on motor scores.

The presence or absence of sensing pinprick below the level of SCI has demonstrated promise to serve as a predictor variable for future walking ability.- Per the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS), people classified with AIS B injuries (sensory sparing but motor complete) under 50 years old, having substantial pinprick sensation in the lower extremities was associated with an increased likelihood of household ambulation 1 year after SCI. Dermatomal testing of pinprick sensation is 1 part of the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) examination, which is the criterion standard SCI clinical exam. The full ISNCSCI exam may take longer than 45 minutes to completeand may not be feasible during the acute phase of SCI due to sedation or long bone fracture. Thus, a CPR using more targeted sensory information may be beneficial.

Light touch sensation may be another variable to consider for the prediction of ambulation, as dermatomal testing of light touch is another part of the ISNCSCI exam and also does not rely on motor scores. Two established CPRs included S1 dermatome lower extremity light touch scores as predictor variables for future walking. Questions remain as to what type of sensory testing may best predict independent walking after SCI.

The objective of this study was to use a large, multisite SCI dataset to derive and independently validate a simple and accurate CPR to predict future independent walking ability after SCI at the bedside that does not rely on motor scores and is predictive for those initially classified in the middle of the SCI severity spectrum (AIS B and C injuries).

### Clinical factors that affect walking level and performance in chronic spinal cord lesion patients [^113inKrG]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Observational Study.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of neurologic and non-neurologic factors on walking level and performance in chronic spinal cord lesion (SCL) patients.

Summary Of Background Data

Walking is one of the primary goals of patients after a SCL. Several studies have demonstrated that different neurologic and non-neurologic factors can affect walking level and performance. However, in SCL age and muscle strength have always been considered the major determinants of walking.

Methods

Sixty-five patients with chronic SCL were included. Their demographic, neurologic status (ASIA standards), balance, and spasticity were recorded. Pearson and Spearman correlations were adopted to quantify the association between patients' characteristics and walking ability. The relationship between functional walking measures, Timed Up and Go, Six Minutes Walking Test (SMWT), Ten Meters Walking Test, and Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury, and demographic and neurologic factors were measured by regression analyses.

Results

Strength, balance, spasticity, and age were strictly correlated with walking level and walking performance. They also were the best predictors of walking features.

Conclusion

Results confirm the recognized importance of age and upper and lower extremity strengths for walking after a SCL. They also highlight the role of 2 other factors, i.e., balance and spasticity, seldom considered as thoroughly in SCL.

Traumatic spinal cord injury — DCPR for ambulation: One model, the DCPR, met criteria for inclusion, and it predicts the probability of independent ambulation at 1 year post injury using information available during early management of tSCI; when counseling patients, family members, and/or surrogates of patients with acute tSCI, we suggest the Dutch Clinical Prediction Rule for ambulation (DCPR), with neurological assessment performed within 15 days following injury, be considered a moderately reliable predictor of the ability to walk 1-year following injury (weak recommendation; moderate quality evidence).

### Axial MRI biomarkers of spinal cord damage to predict future walking and motor function: a retrospective study [^111SvYUy]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective.

Objectives

Primary: to assess if axial damage ratios are predictors of future walking after spinal cord injury (SCI), and if they add any predictive value if initial neurological impairment grades are available. Secondary: to determine if lateral spinal cord regions are predictors of future lower extremity motor scores (LEMS).

Setting

University/hospital.

Methods

Axial T 2 -weighted MRIs were used. Axial damage ratios and non-damaged lateral cord volumes were calculated. Each participant answered at 1 year after SCI, "Are you able to walk for 150 feet? (45.72 meters)" For the secondary aim, right and left LEMS were used.

Results

In total, 145 participants were selected. Individuals that could walk had smaller ratios than those that were unable. Walking and axial damage ratios were negatively correlated. A 0.374 ratio cut-off showed optimal sensitivity/specificity. When initial neurological grades were used, axial damage ratios did not add predictive value. Forty-two participants had LEMS available and were included for the secondary aim. Right cord regions and right LEMS were positively correlated and left regions and left LEMS, but these variables were also correlated with each other.

Conclusions

Axial damage ratios were significant predictors of walking ability 1 year after SCI. However, this measure did not add predictive value over initial neurological grades. Lateral cord regions correlated with same-side LEMS, but the opposite was also found, calling this biomarker's specificity into question. Axial damage ratios may be useful in predicting walking after SCI if initial neurological grades are unavailable.

### Walking ability at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation in a cohort of non-traumatic spinal cord injury patients [^116doYff]. Spinal Cord (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective, observational study.

Objectives

To determine the proportion of patients with non-traumatic spinal cord injury (NTSCI) who regain the ability to walk and to describe walking outcomes with reference to three commonly used clinical measures of walking capacity.

Setting

Spinal Rehabilitation Unit specializing in NTSCI, Melbourne, Australia.

Methods

Demographic, clinical and mobility data collected from a consecutive cohort of patients admitted to the spinal rehabilitation unit between March 2006 and December 2007. Main outcome measures were the Timed Up And Go (TUG), the 10-m walk test (10 mWT) and the 6-min walk test (6MWT). Logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore predictors of walking ability after NTSCI.

Results

Of 62 patients, 30 (48%) regained some capacity to walk during inpatient rehabilitation. Initial ASIA grade was the strongest predictor of walking. Twenty-seven patients regained the ability to perform functional tests (TUG, 10 mWT and 6MWT) of walking at approximately 2 months after injury. Their performance at discharge remained low compared with normal scores but were similar to those measured in some studies of subjects with traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI).

Conclusion

Three simple clinical tests of walking suggest that half of all NTSCI patients are able to walk at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Their gait speed, however, remained impaired and not compatible with safe and efficient community walking.

### Early trauma predictors of mobility in people with spinal cord injury [^117F2JMt]. Spine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective cohort study.

Objective

This study aims to assess the potential value of very early trauma variables such as Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and the Injury Severity Score for predicting independent ambulation following a traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI).

Summary Of Background Data

Several models for prediction of ambulation early after TSCI have been published and validated. The vast majority rely on the initial examination of American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale and level of injury; however, in many locations and clinical situations this examination is not feasible early after the injury.

Methods

Patient characteristics, trauma data, and ASIA scores on admission to rehabilitation were collected for each of the 144 individuals in the study. Outcome measure was the indoor mobility item of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure taken upon discharge from rehabilitation. Univariate and multivariable models were created for each predictor, Odds ratios (ORs) were obtained by a multivariable logistic regression analysis, and area under the receiver operator curve was calculated for each model.

Results

We observed a significant correlation between the trauma variables and independent ambulation upon discharge from rehabilitation. Of the early variables, the AIS for the spine region showed the strongest correlation.

Conclusion

These findings support using preliminary trauma variables for early prognostication of ambulation following a TSCI, allowing for tailored individual interventions. Level of Evidence: 3.

### Lower extremity outcome measures: considerations for clinical trials in spinal cord injury [^111Gj4pK]. Spinal Cord (2018). Low credibility.

Non-ambulatory measures

A big challenge in assessing gait is that SCI therapies targeting neuro-recovery (or neuro-protection) are designed to be applied in an acute stage of SCI meaning within hours or days after injury. It is obvious that, at this early stage of SCI, walking function cannot be measured directly in the majority of patients, therefore, outcome measures that can be applied early after SCI and indirectly assess walking function, may be used to predict walking function.

The "International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury" (ISNCSCI) is considered to be the gold standard for the assessment of location, severity and extent of SCI. It consists of a motor (manual test of arm and leg key muscles) and a segmental sensory (light touch, pinprick) evaluation. On the basis of these assessments, injury severity is classified into complete (ASIA Impairment Scale A or AIS A) or incomplete SCI (AIS B/ C/ D), and the most caudal normal spinal levels are determined (motor/sensory and overall single neurological level of injury). ISNCSCI does not directly assess walking function. However, as it describes the severity of a lesion, it shows good correlation (e.g. lower extremity motor score, LEMS) with functional outcome measures such as the 10 MWT, 6 mWT and WISCI. The walking function at 1 year post injury can be likely predicted by the AIS classification acquired within 2 weeks of initial injury.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^117Sz1Xz]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Future directions — multimodal and patient-centered neuroprognostication emphasize that a multimodal approach is therefore essential, with the interaction of age and comorbidities described as "frailty" needing better scientific exploration and consensus on descriptors. In tSCI it is also essential to consider multidimensional, patient-centered functional outcomes and the potential interaction between social determinants of health and outcomes. Clinical prediction models use multiple independent predictors but only a limited number of models exist, and while models such as the DCPR may require further modification and validation to improve predictive accuracy, they provide a reasonable estimate of the likelihood of meaningful functional outcomes, such as a return to ambulation, allowing patients and families to set realistic expectations and plan for the future.

### Axial MRI biomarkers of spinal cord damage to predict future walking and motor function: a retrospective study [^117GCsEf]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures: walking ability and lower extremity motor scores

For the primary aim of this study, as part of the United States SCI Model Systems database at Craig Hospital protocol, each participant answered yes/no at 1-year follow up after SCI to the question, "Are you able to walk (with or without mobility aid) for 150 feet (45.72 meters) in your home?" Responses were assigned a binary code of either 1 (yes) or 0 (no).

For the secondary aim of this study, International Standards for the Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) LEMS for the right and left lower extremities were used, collected at the time of discharge from inpatient therapy. The ISNCSCI examinations were completed and agreed upon by pairs of licensed physical and occupational therapists who were extensively trained in ISNCSCI testing, and each report was reviewed and approved by the corresponding team physician. The LEMS clinical testing, assessed using an ordinal scale, has demonstrated high levels of inter-rater reliability.

Statistical analyses

All analyses were performed using SPSS Version 26.0 statistical software (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic, anthropometric, and imaging variables.

### Axial MRI biomarkers of spinal cord damage to predict future walking and motor function: a retrospective study [^116M461A]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this retrospective study involving 145 participants with SCI, T 2 MRI axial damage ratios early after injury demonstrated significant predictive value for self-reported ability to walk 150 feet (45.72 meters) 1-year after SCI, and the ROC curve had an AUC value of 0.75, indicating fair discriminative ability. However, when including initial AIS grades as a predictor, axial damage ratios did not add significant additional predictive value. In a subset of 42 participants, lateral cord region spared tissue was correlated with the same-side LEMS, but the opposite was also found, calling the specificity of the biomarker into question. The axial damage ratio biomarker may be a useful tool in predicting future walking ability after SCI, but initial AIS grades remain the optimal predictor if clinically available. Future research is warranted to prospectively validate these findings.

### Axial MRI biomarkers of spinal cord damage to predict future walking and motor function: a retrospective study [^115fAVF3]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations

For the purposes of this study, we deliberately wanted to focus on the prognostic value of the axial MRI biomarkers, as it is more clinically obvious that following SCI, existing lower extremity strength will likely lead to some ability to ambulate in the future. Previous research also cites this issue when focusing on imaging biomarkers for prognosis in SCI. Nevertheless, when we included initial AIS grades as a predictor, the inclusion of the MRI measure did not add significant predictive value. This suggests that, similar to a recent previous study, initial AIS grades remain the most optimal predictor, if clinically available. Another limitation is that, due to the nature of our experimental design, our axial damage ratio cut-off score of 0.374 is specific to our cohort, and these results need to be validated in additional independent cohorts before an axial damage ratio cut-off score can be generalizable to the population with SCI as a whole. An inherent limitation of retrospective studies is that researchers are limited to data available for analyses, and for this study, the earliest imaging available averaged 3.7 ± 2.8 weeks. This is a possible confounder, as SCI imaging characteristics are dynamic, especially within the first 3 weeks of injury. Although only one blinded researcher performed the measures in this study (which is a limitation), we are confident in the results as evidenced by reported high levels of inter-rater reliability with the same measures. Lastly, only a subset of our cohort (42 out of 145) had discharge LEMS scores to use for analysis in our region-specific damage secondary aim, and only ten of those participants showed clinically meaningful asymmetries in their residual motor function. There is also a question of the specificity of this biomarker given that the left and right lateral cord spared tissue were significantly correlated with each other in the current study (R = 0.829, p < 0.05). We also found that right lateral cord percent spared tissue was significantly correlated with left LEMS, and vice versa (left cord versus right LEMS R = 0.569, and right cord versus left LEMS R = 0.620, p < 0.05). Future prospective research should focus on a larger sample with these data available, and should examine this issue of specificity of the region-specific damage biomarker.

### Predictors of exoskeleton motor learning in spinal cord injured patients [^113tcKzr]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of The Article

Learning to use an exoskeleton is time consuming and diverse between users. Knowledge about trainability of exoskeleton skills is relevant for planning and expectation management. The objective was to assess predictors of exoskeleton skill performance during and after exoskeleton training.

Materials and Methods

Twenty-four participants with a motor complete spinal cord injury were given 24 training sessions in 8 weeks. Nine potential predictors were identified: lesion level, age, gender, age at injury, time since injury, BMI, sport, active lifestyle, and anxiety. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to examine predictors of skill performance after 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks.

Results and Conclusions

Twenty participants completed the training. Univariate analysis revealed that positive predictors were: low lesion level and more active lifestyle after 2 weeks, whereas low age at injury, low BMI, and more active lifestyle were positive predictors after 6 weeks. Multivariate regression model explained 65% of the performance after 2 weeks (predictors: lesion level, anxiety, active lifestyle) and 66% after 6 weeks (predictors: BMI, active lifestyle, age). Lesion level was a predictor during the first 4 weeks, but did not influence participants' final skill level. BMI, age, and active lifestyle were predictors toward the end of the training period. Implications for rehabilitationWith the help of wearable exoskeletons people with a complete spinal cord injury can regain their standing and walking mobility. Learning to use an exoskeleton is time consuming and the number of training sessions required to walk independently differs greatly between users. This study shows that lesion level was an important predictor of exoskeleton motor learning in the first 4 weeks of training.BMI, age, and active lifestyle were predictors of exoskeleton skill performance toward the end of the 8 week training period.

### A single dermatome clinical prediction rule for independent walking 1 year after spinal cord injury [^1166KDXW]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Our results are in alignment with previous studies that found pinprick sensation to be important in the prediction of future functional recovery. Waters et al found that 16% of people with motor complete SCI who had bilateral sacral pinprick sensation eventually regained some voluntary movement in the lower extremities. In another study by Crozier et al in 27 people with initial motor complete SCI, 89% of those with pinprick sensation below the zone of injury recovered walking ability of at least 200 feet. In a more recent study of 131 people with initial motor complete SCI, Oleson et al found that walking ability was significantly better 1 year post injury for a subgroup of people with pinprick preserved in at least 50% of lower extremity dermatomes (L2 through S1).

We believe that our CPR is straightforward to implement at the bedside. After SCI, if the individual can perceive pinprick sensation at the right and left lateral heels and it feels normal, then there is a good prognosis for recovering future independent walking ability. If the individual reports any pinprick sensation in either lateral heel, even if it feels different than other unimpaired skin areas (ie, face), then there is a fair prognosis for recovering future independent walking ability. If the individual cannot feel pinprick sensation at either lateral heel, then there is a poor prognosis for recovering future independent walking ability. For these fair and poor prognosis cases, wheelchair training and compensatory strategies may be prioritized, and additional neuromodulation may be necessary to achieve improved voluntary mobility and/or walking. -

### A single dermatome clinical prediction rule for independent walking 1 year after spinal cord injury [^1123J2mZ]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To derive and validate a simple, accurate CPR to predict future independent walking ability after SCI at the bedside that does not rely on motor scores and is predictive for those initially classified in the middle of the SCI severity spectrum.

Design

Retrospective cohort study. Binary variables were derived, indicating degrees of sensation to evaluate predictive value of pinprick and light touch variables across dermatomes. The optimal single sensory modality and dermatome was used to derive our CPR, which was validated on an independent dataset.

Setting

Analysis of SCI Model Systems dataset.

Participants

Individuals with traumatic SCI. The data of 3679 participants (N = 3679) were included with 623 participants comprising the derivation dataset and 3056 comprising the validation dataset.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Self-reported ability to walk both indoors and outdoors.

Results

Pinprick testing at S1 over lateral heels, within 31 days of SCI, accurately identified future independent walkers 1 year after SCI. Normal pinprick in both lateral heels provided good prognosis, any pinprick sensation in either lateral heel provided fair prognosis, and no sensation provided poor prognosis. This CPR performed satisfactorily in the middle SCI severity subgroup.

Conclusions

In this large multi-site study, we derived and validated a simple, accurate CPR using only pinprick sensory testing at lateral heels that predicts future independent walking after SCI.

### Longitudinal patterns of functional recovery in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury receiving activity-based rehabilitation [^113dpggB]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To model the progression of 3 functional outcome measures from patients with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) receiving standardized locomotor training.

Design

Observational cohort.

Setting

The NeuroRecovery Network (NRN), a specialized network of treatment centers providing standardized, activity-based therapy for SCI patients.

Participants

Patients (N = 337) with incomplete SCI (grade C or D on the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury scale) who were enrolled in the NRN between February 2008 and March 2011.

Intervention

All enrolled patients received standardized locomotor training sessions, as established by NRN protocol, and were evaluated monthly for progress.

Main Outcome Measures

Berg Balance Scale, 6-minute walk test, and 10-meter walk test. Progression over time was analyzed via the fitting of linear mixed effects models.

Results

There was significant improvement on each outcome measure and significant attenuation of improvement over time. Patients varied significantly across groups defined by recovery status and American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade at enrollment with respect to baseline performance and rates of change over time. Time since SCI was a significant determinant of the rate of recovery for all measures.

Conclusions

Locomotor training, as implemented in the NRN, results in significant improvement in functional outcome measures as treatment sessions accumulate. Variability in patterns of recovery over time suggest that time since SCI and patient functional status at enrollment, as measured by the Neuromuscular Recovery Scale, are important predictors of performance and recovery as measured by the targeted outcome measures.

### Axial MRI biomarkers of spinal cord damage to predict future walking and motor function: a retrospective study [^114Lc3t8]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found that the axial damage ratio taken from MRIs early after injury was a significant predictor of walking ability 1-year post SCI, meaning the smaller the damage ratio, the more likely the individual reported "yes" for ability to walk 150 feet (45.72 meters) at 1 year. This finding is in accordance with a previous incomplete SCI cohort study, where axial damage ratios correlated with performance on the 6-min walk test. Interestingly, we found a significant positive relationship between age and walking ability, meaning the older the individual was at the time of injury, the more likely the patient was able to walk 1-year post injury. When we explored this further, we found a significant negative correlation between age at the time of injury and the axial damage ratio, which suggests that, in this study's cohort, younger individuals had greater axial damage ratios. We believe this is due to the nature of Craig Hospital, where relatively younger patients admitted to inpatient rehabilitation tend to have more severe SCIs compared to the older patients. Per previous literature, older age has been shown to be a negative predictor of future walking ability.

Our axial damage ratio ROC curve had an AUC of 0.75, indicating fair discriminative ability for determining walking 1 year after SCI. A previous study using a lesion length of 36 mm found a similar AUC value (0.776) for discriminating neurological outcome. The axial damage ratio cut-off score for our cohort was 0.374, with ratios below this significantly associated with a "yes" response to walking. Previous literature examined the associations between future function after SCI and the extent of T 2 -weighted MRI-observed lesion hyperintensity in the sagittal plane. One study found that participants with incomplete SCIs had lesion length of ~20 mm while those with complete SCIs had up to 40 mm. Another study reported that individuals with AIS D injuries tended to have a lesion length of less than 45 mm, and these patients were able to walk with or without a cane at discharge. A third study that included 86 patients with incomplete SCI found that a lesion length of greater than 36 mm was independently associated with a more severe AIS grade 1 year later. The sensitivity of our axial damage ratio cut-off score was relatively lower (0.57) compared with the specificity (0.80). This suggests that this biomarker, early after SCI, might serve best for ruling in those who have good potential for future walking, rather than ruling out.

### Orthotic walking outcome of persons with motor complete low thoracic spinal cord injury-a retrospective study [^116Rgj16]. Spinal Cord (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective study.

Objective

To analyse the orthotic walking outcome of patients with Low Thoracic Spinal Cord Injury (LT-SCI).

Setting

The Rehabilitation Institute at Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.

Methods

Data between January 2005 and June 2015 were retrospectively collected from electronic medical reports of patients with motor complete LT- SCI who were admitted for the comprehensive rehabilitation program. The orthotic walking outcome of these patients was measured by the Walking index for SCI version II (WISCI II). Demographical and clinical parameters were measured and their association with the walking outcome was analyzed using regression analysis.

Results

A total of 430 patients were identified within the study period. Eighty-five percent of people (n = 365) achieved walking at the time of discharge (WISCI II level 12 = 260 and level 9 = 105). Out of 11 demographical and clinical parameters considered, eight of them were found to be significant predictors of walking in the univariate analysis. Age less than 30 years had the highest odds of predicting WISCI II level 9 and level 12 than those older in the multivariate analysis (OR 17.58; 95% CI 7.35–42.03). Single neurological level T12 increased the chance of achieving WISCI II level 12 by 10 times (OR 10.2; 95% CI 3.8–27.36).

Conclusions

Orthotic walking for persons with motor complete low thoracic spinal cord injury is an achievable goal through a comprehensive rehabilitation program. The factors identified in this study will help rehabilitation professionals strategically select the ideal candidate for orthotic gait training.

### Axial MRI biomarkers of spinal cord damage to predict future walking and motor function: a retrospective study [^113P14Z3]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Primary aim

One hundred and forty-five participants met the established criteria and their records were used for this study. The baseline demographics are summarized in Table 1. The earliest axial T 2 -weighted imaging used for analyses ranged from 0 to 12 weeks post SCI (average 3.7 ± 2.8 weeks). The self-reported ability to walk at 1 year and the axial damage ratios are reported in Table 2. Individuals that were able to walk 150 feet (45.72 meters) 1 year after SCI had a smaller axial damage ratio than those that were unable to walk (mean difference = 0.124, SED = 0.032, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.188, p < 0.001, see Table 2).

### Axial MRI biomarkers of spinal cord damage to predict future walking and motor function: a retrospective study [^111KwFT6]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

For our region-specific damage biomarker, the percentage of spared tissue for the right lateral cord was correlated with right LEMS, and the same was true for the left side. This result is in alignment with our previous cross-sectional study, using a higher resolution outcome measure of isometric maximum voluntary torque production of the knee extensors and ankle plantarflexors.

### Walking index for spinal cord injury (WISCI): criterion validation [^1127QHLx]. Spinal Cord (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective examination.

Objectives

To compare the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI) and current scales for their sensitivity to walking changes in subjects with a spinal cord lesion (SCL) and further validate the WISCI for use in clinical trails.

Setting

A large rehabilitation hospital in the center of Italy.

Patients and Methods

Retrospective review was performed on 284 patient records with an SCL. Measurements included neurological evaluation with Lower Extremity Motor Scores (LEMS) according to the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) and walking status assessed by Barthel Index (BI (0–15)), Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI (three levels)), Functional Independence Measure (FIM (1–7)), Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM (0–8)), and WISCI (0–20). The WISCI is a 21-level hierarchical scale which incorporates gradations of physical assistance and devices required for walking. Improvement in walking is based on the change of scores from admission to discharge. Statistical analysis included Spearman rank correlation and χ² test; P < 0.05.

Results

There was a significant positive correlation between WISCI and other scales (WISCI and BI r = 0.67, P < 0.001; WISCI and RMI r = 0.67, P < 0.001; WISCI and SCIM r = 0.97, P < 0.001; WISCI and FIM r = 0.7, P < 0.001). The initial ASIA grade was predictive of mobility outcome on the WISCI: of the 78 ASIA A patients, only five achieved independent walking versus 4/17 ASIA B (P = 0.02), 56/109 ASIA C (P < 0.001) and 39/44 ASIA D (P < 0.001). The correlation of LEMS to the WISCI was 0.58 (P < 0.001). At discharge, patients were distributed into 12 WISCI levels versus four FIM, three BI, two RMI and five SCIM levels. The most frequent WISCI levels at discharge were 13 (walker, no braces or assistance), 16 (two crutches, no braces or assistance) and 20 (no devices or assistance).

Conclusions

Similar correlation between the WISCI and the other scales indicates that all these measures address the same concept, mobility, which is a measure of concurrent validity. The correlation is not 100% because of conceptual differences (the WISCI incorporates gradations of physical assistance and devices required for walking while most of the other scales focus on burden of care or mobility in the environment). The WISCI is more detailed and appears more sensitive to walking recovery than the other scales, as demonstrated by our patients' score distribution at discharge. Within each of the most frequent WISCI levels (13, 16, 20) LEMS and other walking features varied; therefore the scale would benefit from further refinement based on speed, distance and energy cost.

### Axial MRI biomarkers of spinal cord damage to predict future walking and motor function: a retrospective study [^1159tVBp]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary aim

As a subset of the participants included in the primary aim, 42 participants had right and left LEMS available and were included for the secondary aim analysis. Average length of inpatient stay was 13.2 ± 6.5 weeks. The lateral cord region percent spared tissue volumes and the LEMS are reported in Table 3. There was a significant positive correlation with right lateral cord region percent spared tissue and right LEMS (Rₛ = 0.654, 95% CI: 0.440, 0.813, p < 0.0001) and with left lateral cord region spared tissue and left LEMS (Rₛ = 0.558, 95% CI: 0.323, 0.741, p < 0.0001).

### Asia impairment scale conversion in traumatic SCI: is it related with the ability to walk? A descriptive comparison with functional ambulation outcome measures in 273 patients [^115DHkcp]. Spinal Cord (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective multicenter longitudinal cohort study.

Objectives

To determine the relationship between improvements of the American Spinal Injury Association/International Spinal Cord Society (ASIA/ISCoS) neurological standard scale (AIS) outcome measure and improvements of functional ambulatory outcome measures in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).

Setting

European multicenter study of human SCI (EM-SCI).

Methods

In 273 eligible patients with traumatic SCI, acute (0–15 days) and chronic phase (6 or 12 months) AIS grades, timed up and go (TUG) test and 10-m walk test (10MWT) outcome measurements were analyzed. Subanalysis of those patients who did have AIS conversion was performed to assess its relation with functional ambulatory outcomes.

Results

Studied population consisted of 161 acute phase AIS grade A patients; 37 grade B; 43 grade C and 32 acute phase AIS grade D patients. Forty-two patients (26%) converted from AIS grade A, 27 (73%) from grade B, 32 (75%) from grade C and five patients (16%) from AIS grade D. The frequencies of AIS conversions and functional ambulation recovery outcomes were significantly different (P < 0.001) in patients with motor complete SCI. The ratio of patients with both recovery of ambulatory function and AIS conversion (n = 101) differed significantly (P < 0.001) between the acute phase AIS grade scores; AIS grade A (6/40 patients, 15%), B (9/27 patients, 33%), C (23/29 patients, 79%) and D (5/5 patients 100%).

Conclusions

The AIS conversion outcome measure is poorly related to the ability to walk in traumatic SCI patients. Therefore, the authors recommend the use of functional ambulation recovery outcome measures in prognosticating the recovery of walking capacity and performance of patients with SCI.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^11661KRy]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Dutch Clinical Prediction Rule (DCPR) — early prediction of ambulation after traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) is summarized as follows: The DCPR, derived from the EMSCI data set, was introduced in 2011 to aid prediction of independent ambulation; variables in the final model were age dichotomized at 65 years, motor scores of the quadriceps femoris (L3) and gastrocnemius (S1) muscles, and light touch sensation in the corresponding dermatomes. Neurological assessment was performed within 15 days of injury, and international validation studies have been conducted in North America (USA and Canada) and Australia. The DCPR generates a total score of − 10 to 40 to predict probability of ambulation at 1 year.

### Prognostic factors for cervical spinal cord injury without major bone injury in elderly patients [^114LKGEU]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Medium credibility.

In the current study, BMI was also an independent predictor for recovery of walking in AIS A–C cases, consistent with the finding that an unhealthy weight (underweight and overweight) is associated with diminished functional recovery. Another multi-center study suggested that patients with obesity had a higher mortality risk within one year after SCI compared with those with normal weight, mainly because of infectious and respiratory diseases.

The mechanism of CSCI without major bone injury, including central cord syndrome, is characterized by minimal trauma in patients with degenerative spinal conditions with a narrow canal from cervical spondylosis and/or OPLL. Therefore, the prevalence of a cervical narrow canal might be a risk factor for SCI, especially in Asians, who have high morbidity in such conditions.

In our study, the prevalence of OPLL of 34.3% was very high but similar to that found in a previous multi-center study in Japan. The prevalence of pre-existing factors, such as OPLL and stenosis, has also been found to be significantly higher in CSCI without bone injury than in those with bone injury in retrospective cohort studies, which suggests a link between these factors and CSCI without major bone injury. In our study, the prevalence of OPLL was an independent negative prognostic factor for recovery of walking ability in AIS B and C cases.

An MRI is important for the evaluation of patients with CSCI for imaging of the injured cord and prediction of outcome. A systematic review of MRI findings suggested that longer intramedullary hemorrhage, smaller canal diameter at maximal spinal cord compression, and the presence of spinal cord edema were associated with poor neurological recovery in acute SCI. In the current study, most patients had signal intensity changes on MRI, and AIS A–C cases with these changes had a negative impact on neurological improvement leading to walking recovery based on the results of multi-variate analysis, while there was no impact on full upper extremity motor recovery in AIS D cases.

Conventional MRI cannot distinguish recoverable from non-recoverable tissue injury, and the evidence regarding the utility of MRI in the clinical outcome of acute SCI is limited and controversial. The detailed evaluation of MRI findings (length of cord damage, T1-weighted imaging, etc.) was not assessed in the current study, but further development of MRI techniques is likely to produce more detailed prognostic findings for an injured spinal cord.

### Prognostic factors for cervical spinal cord injury without major bone injury in elderly patients [^112JEfUj]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

There has been a marked increase in the incidence of CSCI without major bone injury because of an increase in the population of elderly persons in the past 30 years in Japan. There are no reliable predictors of neurological improvement after injury, however. Therefore, we assessed 591 patients aged ≥ 65 years with CSCI without major bone injury using data from multiple centers.

In AIS A, B, and C cases, recovery of the ability to walk independently is the most important concern. Considering the high prevalence of central cord syndrome, especially in AIS D cases, recovery of upper extremity motor function is the most important concern in these patients because the usual sequence of recovery in these populations starts with motor power of the lower limbs followed by the upper limbs with fine finger movements. A neurological examination to establish the severity of injury at admission is the main prognostic factor for ambulation after SCI.

In the current study, 11.8%, 22.6%, and 62.3% of AIS A, B, and C cases, respectively, recovered walking ability, and AIS severity at admission was the strongest predictor of this functional outcome. These rates were similar to those of 6.2%, 37.8%, and 69.8% in AIS A, B, and C cases, respectively, in a European multi-center study. A systematic review found rates of conversion to AIS D of 3%, 31%, and 67% for AIS A, B, and C cases, respectively, which shows that patients in the AIS A category have only a small possibility of recovery of walking.

Age has previously been found to be a negative prognostic factor for walking recovery in AIS C cases: patients aged < 50 years have a rate of recovery of 80–90%, but this rate is markedly reduced to 30–40% in older patients. In our study of patients aged ≥ 65 years, age had no significant effect in AIS A-C cases. In AIS D cases, however, higher age was an independent negative prognostic factor for full upper extremity motor recovery at the final follow-up. It has been suggested that rehabilitation in elderly patients should focus on functional training because these patients may find it difficult to translate neurological recovery into ADL.

### Virtual reality interventions for spinal cord injury-related neuropathic pain: a comprehensive scoping review of multidimensional outcomes [^1123iexR]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Research by Laver et al on VR treatment in stroke patients demonstrated that appropriately extending individual session duration and increasing total intervention periods may more effectively promote neuroplasticity changes, thereby alleviating pain. However, no studies have systematically examined the temporal effects of VR in SCI-NP treatment. Although Landmann et alconsidered the influence of timing and frequency factors, they only investigated variations in timing and frequency while maintaining consistent total session numbers, specifically comparing twice weekly for five weeks versus five times weekly for two weeks, without conducting more comprehensive temporal factor analyses. Future research requires more systematic investigations to determine and standardize optimal parameters.

Regarding participant characteristics, whether injury severity and lesion level influence treatment outcomes remains unclear. Research by Moseley et alindicated that participant injury severity and lesion level may represent the most important and reliable predictors of virtual walking success, with their findings indicating that patients with incomplete thoracolumbar spinal cord injuries demonstrate greater therapeutic benefits from virtual walking treatments. Virtual walking interventions primarily provide a visual illusion of lower limb movement, which may theoretically be more effective for SCI patients experiencing lower limb NP — a condition commonly observed in thoracolumbar SCI patients. While providing attentional distraction, these interventions help restore visual-proprioceptive coherence in the lower limbs, enhance functional connectivity between primary somatosensory (S1) and primary motor (M1) cortical areas, and modulate neuroplasticity changes to achieve pain relief. Additionally, the superior outcomes in incomplete injuries may be attributed to preserved sensorimotor pathways, as retained neural circuits support neuroplasticity in both brain and spinal cord, facilitating the establishment of new neural connections and thereby modulating pain signals. However, it is important to note that these conclusions are not derived from large-scale RCTs. Therefore, whether patient characteristics influence the effectiveness of virtual walking and other VR interventions, particularly their specific effects on SCI-NP, requires validation through additional high-quality prospective studies.

### Early versus delayed inpatient spinal cord injury rehabilitation: an Italian study [^111d4aGQ]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine what effect the injury-to-rehabilitation interval has on the outcome of spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

Spinal unit of a large rehabilitation hospital.

Participants

Consecutive admissions were divided into groups according to age, sex, and American Spinal Injury Association impairment grade and neurologic level of injury. The patients were matched for these variables and divided into groups according to the interval from injury to admission into acute rehabilitation. This approach resulted in 150 patients with SCI grouped into 50 comparison subgroupings. Interventions Three comparison groups-short (< 30 d), medium (31–60 d), and long (> 60 d) time to admission (TTA)-were evaluated for rehabilitation outcomes.

Main Outcome Measures

Barthel Index, Rivermead Mobility Index, Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury, and motor scores at admission and discharge were examined. The changes and efficiencies were evaluated.

Results

The 3 groups were comparable for all medical and demographic characteristics as well as neurologic recovery. The 3 subgroups differed significantly in activity of daily living outcomes, with the short TTA group exhibiting higher Barthel Index raw discharge scores, score increases, and score efficiencies.

Conclusions

Early rehabilitation seems to be a relevant prognostic factor of functional outcome. Rehabilitation intervention in patients with SCI should begin as soon as possible, in a specialized setting, because delay may adversely affect functional recovery.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^115MggNK]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Guideline questions and outcomes — time of assessment and outcome prioritization: The panel framed the question, "When counseling patients, family members, and/ or surrogates of adults with acute traumatic spinal cord injury, should time of assessment, if appropriate, be considered a reliable predictor of outcome, with time frame of assessment?" Outcomes were selected using the GRADE 1–9 scale, and outcomes rated "critical" included mortality at discharge from the acute care hospital or later (average rating 7.67), functional outcome at discharge from rehabilitation or later (average rating 8.67), improvement in ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS grade conversion) at discharge from rehabilitation or later (average rating 7.0), independent ambulation at discharge from rehabilitation or later (average rating 8.0), and bowel and bladder control (average rating 8.0). For mortality, predictors of acute in-hospital mortality have been described separately from predictors of long-term mortality.

### Kunming locomotor training: neurological, functional, and autonomic outcomes in complete spinal cord injury [^113gMgnf]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Neurological recovery potential after spinal cord injury (SCI) is variable and difficult to predict. Standard classification measures, used as outcomes, such as the ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS), capture categorical improvements but may overlook other clinically significant gains. The Kunming Locomotor Training (KLT) program, developed over a two-decade period, provides structured, high-intensity overground gait training that emphasizes task-specific stepping, standing, and balance.

The value of locomotor rehabilitation after SCI has been well established. The advent of body-weight supported locomotor training allowed individuals with severe SCI to participate more fully in upright locomotor exercises compared to complex bracing systems. In parallel, health benefits of standing and upright exercises after SCI, including their effects on bones and metabolism, have been documented. Debate emerged over the best training methods, with initial enthusiasm for robotic or treadmill-based approaches shifting toward evidence supporting overground methods that permit greater variability in step cycles. More recently, several exoskeleton systems have been tested to assist with upright walking. In the US and Canada, inpatient rehabilitation duration is typically limited, often leaving insufficient time for intensive locomotor training. However, at Kunming Tongren Hospital, inpatient programs can last up to a year, allowing for more sustained and high-intensity interventions.

The KLT protocol was empirically developed through iterative clinical practice. It utilizes simple, low-cost assistive devices – such as walking platforms, four-post walkers, crutches, and canes – together with experienced therapists, progressively increasing lower-limb loading and stepping independence. The program follows a progressive adaptive principle: specific deficits are identified, targeted assistance is provided, and support is gradually withdrawn as recovery occurs. The Kunming Locomotor Scale (KLS) was created to document these stages, analogous to the WISCI scale but adapted to the Chinese clinical setting.

Prior reports have documented neurological recovery in AIS A participants, but quantitative predictors and functional correlates have not been systematically analyzed. In this study, we tested three hypotheses: that KLS change predicts AIS improvement, that there exists a clinically relevant KLS threshold for stratifying recovery, and that neurological improvement is associated with injury level.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^113dXHsV]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Traumatic spinal cord injury — conclusions on predictors with moderate reliability at 1-year follow-up: Three predictors — absence of pathologic findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neurological level of injury (NLI), and injury severity — were considered moderately reliable for the prediction of AIS conversion on 1-year follow-up, and a clinical prediction model, the Dutch Clinical Prediction Rule (DCPR), was considered moderately reliable for the prediction of independent ambulation at 1-year follow-up.

### Axial MRI biomarkers of spinal cord damage to predict future walking and motor function: a retrospective study [^112CVVH4]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

The above studies measured the length of signal hyperintensity using sagittal T 2 -weighted MRI and related this measure to walking ability at the time of hospital discharge. A number of other studies confirm that hyperintensity length is predictive of future neurological status. Yet, there are a lack of studies investigating if SCI imaging characteristics are predictive of long-term walking ability, 1 year or more following injury.

Recently, using axial T 2 -weighted sequences and quantifying the signal hyperintensity after SCI, two novel MRI biomarkers have been reported: (1) axial damage ratio, (2) region-specific damage. The axial damage ratio is determined by finding the axial slice where the area of cord hyperintensity is the largest in relationship to its surrounding cord diameter and calculating the ratio of hyperintensity area divided by cord area (see Fig. 1). In a cohort of individuals with chronic motor incomplete SCI, the axial damage ratio was significantly related to their performance on the 6-min walk test. For the region-specific damage biomarker, the T 2 -weighted images are registered to a standard spinal cord template image with a corresponding white matter atlas, permitting estimation of damage to specific regions such as the lateral corticospinal tract (see Fig. 2). In the same cohort as above, damage to the left or right lateral corticospinal tract was significantly related to the ability to generate maximum voluntary torque in the ipsilateral lower extremity.

The left panel shows the mid-sagittal image with the lesion hyperintensity observed. The middle panel shows consecutive axial slices through the damage, with the lesion hyperintensity segmented in red and the surrounding spinal cord segmented in blue. The calculated axial damage ratios are seen in the right panel, with the cranial-most axial slice demonstrating the maximum axial damage ratio used for statistical analysis.

The T 2 -weighted image is seen as shown with the spinal cord and lesion masks overlaid (a) and then registered to the PAM50 T 2 -weighted template (b). To quantify the spatial extent of the spinal cord lesion (c), the lesion mask was projected to the axial plane (d), and the percentage of spared left or right lateral region volume (non-lesion) within the axial plane was calculated (e).

### Locomotor recovery in spinal cord injury: insights beyond walking speed and distance [^111Bh78d]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

Recovery of locomotor function after incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) is clinically assessed through walking speed and distance, while improvements in these measures might not be in line with a normalization of gait quality and are, on their own, insensitive at revealing potential mechanisms underlying recovery. The objective of this study was to relate changes of gait parameters to the recovery of walking speed while distinguishing between parameters that rather reflect speed improvements from factors contributing to overall recovery. Kinematic data of 16 iSCI subjects were repeatedly recorded during in-patient rehabilitation. The responsiveness of gait parameters to walking speed was assessed by linear regression. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on the multivariate data across time to identify factors that contribute to recovery after iSCI. Parameters of gait cycle and movement dynamics were both responsive and closely related to the recovery of walking speed, which increased by 96%. Multivariate analysis revealed specific gait parameters (intralimb shape normality and consistency) that, although less related to speed increments, loaded highly on principal component one (PC1) (58.6%) explaining the highest proportion of variance (i.e., recovery of outcome over time). Interestingly, measures of hip, knee, and ankle range of motion showed varying degrees of responsiveness (from very high to very low) while not contributing to gait recovery as revealed by PCA. The conjunct application of two analysis methods distinguishes gait parameters that simply reflect increased walking speed from parameters that actually contribute to gait recovery in iSCI. This distinction may be of value for the evaluation of interventions for locomotor recovery.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^1125oW1d]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

These guidelines provide recommendations on the use of predictors of mortality as well as functional outcome in the context of counseling adult patients with tSCI and their surrogates. Recommendations are summarized in Table 5. A suggested approach to neuroprognostication after tSCI is summarized in Fig. 2. Three predictors (absence of pathologic findings on MRI, NLI, and injury severity) were considered moderately reliable for the prediction of AIS conversion at 1-year follow-up. A clinical prediction model, the DCPR, was considered moderately reliable for the prediction of independent ambulation at 1-year follow-up. Future development of additional biomarkers and models will help enhance the field of neuroprognostication in tSCI.

### Physical impairment and walking function required for community ambulation in patients with cervical incomplete spinal cord injury [^115VPHn2]. Spinal Cord (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study.

Objective

To identify the physical impairments and walking function required for community ambulation in patients with cervical incomplete spinal cord injury (ISCI).

Setting

Chubu Rosai Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.

Methods

Forty patients with cervical ISCI (mean age: 49.9 years, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale D) were included. The primary outcome measure was community ambulation based on Spinal Cord Independence Measure outdoor scores for a distance of > 480m. We measured the upper- and lower-extremity motor scores (UEMS and LEMS), sensory and spasticity. The walking tests included 10m of walking at a comfortable- and maximum-walking speed (CWS and MWS; m/s), 6min walking test (6 MWT; m) and the walking index for spinal cord injury II (WISCI II). Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the physical impairments associated with community ambulation. Receiver operating characteristic curves were analyzed to determine the cutoff points for physical impairment and walking function.

Result

The LEMS (beta coefficient (β) = 0.71) and UEMS (β = 0.41) were independently associated with community ambulation in patients with cervical ISCI. The cutoff points of the LEMS, UEMS, CWS, MWS, 6MWT and WISCI II were 41.5, 36.5, 1.00 m/s, 1.32 m/s, 472.5m and 17.5, respectively, which suggests moderate to high accuracy.

Conclusion

The LEMS and UEMS were the most important factors affecting community ambulation in patients with cervical ISCI. The cutoff points of the walking function tests were highly accurate; therefore, these points can serve as targets for walking training in the future.

### Axial MRI biomarkers of spinal cord damage to predict future walking and motor function: a retrospective study [^115xaYxc]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary aim

Axial damage ratio descriptive statistics were calculated for all participants, and separately for individuals that were and were not able to walk 150 feet (45.72 meters). Based on 1000 bootstrap samples, 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Statistical comparisons of axial damage ratios were made between the walking and non-walking groups using analysis of covariance with age as a covariate. Findings were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05.

Bivariate associations between the self-reported ability to walk and baseline variables were assessed using correlation analyses (point biserial correlations for dichotomous variables and Pearson product moment correlations for continuous variables). Associations were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05.

A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the walking outcome. Sensitivity and specificity values were calculated for each level of the predictor variable and plotted on a ROC curve. The point on the curve that was nearest the upper left corner represented the value with the best diagnostic accuracy, and this point was chosen as the cut-off defining the ability to walk. Using the cut-off point generated from the ROC curve, a new dichotomized variable was created and each score was characterized as above or below the cut-off point. Logistic regression was run to assess if the axial damage ratio was a significant predictor of self-reported ability to walk 150 feet (45.72 meters) 1 year after SCI. The following were calculated: sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios.

Logistic regression was performed to determine if axial damage ratios added any predictive value for walking versus initial AIS grades alone. In model 1, initial AIS grades were used as a predictor variable and compared to model 2, where both initial AIS grades and axial damage ratios were used as predictor variables.

Secondary aim

For the investigation of lateral cord region-specific damage, the percent volume of the spared region was used for analysis. Bivariate associations between lateral cord region spared tissue and LEMS were assessed using Spearman correlation analyses. Based on 1000 bootstrap samples, 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Associations were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05.

### Prognostic factors for cervical spinal cord injury without major bone injury in elderly patients [^111fPYDu]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Medium credibility.

In the current aging society, there has been a marked increase in the incidence of cervical spinal cord injury (CSCI) without major bone injury. This multi-center study aimed to identify predictors of neurological improvement in elderly patients with CSCI without major bone injury. The participants were 591 patients aged ≥ 65 years with CSCI without major bone injury and a minimum follow-up period of three months. Neurologic status was defined using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale (AIS). Univariate and multi-variate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for walking recovery in AIS A–C cases and full upper extremity motor recovery in AIS D cases. In AIS A–C cases, body mass index (odds ratio (OR): 1.112), magnetic resonance imaging signal change (OR: 0.240), AIS on admission (OR: 3.497), comorbidity of dementia/delirium (OR: 0.365), and post-injury pneumonia (OR: 0.194) were identified as independent prognostic factors for walking recovery. The prevalence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OR: 0.494) was also found to be an independent prognostic factor in AIS B and C cases only. In AIS D cases, age (OR: 0.937), upper extremity ASIA motor score on admission (OR: 1.230 [per 5 scores]), and operation (OR: 0.519) were independent prognostic factors for full motor recovery. The severity of AIS at admission was the strongest predictor of functional outcomes. Promoting rehabilitation, however, through measures to reduce cognitive changes, post-injury pneumonia, and unhealthy body weight changes can contribute to greater neurological improvement in AIS A–C cases.

### Axial MRI biomarkers of spinal cord damage to predict future walking and motor function: a retrospective study [^111cdnof]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

Self-reported ability to walk was significantly negatively correlated with the axial damage ratio (R = −0.404; 95% CI: −0.537, −0.258, p < 0.001). Age and the ability to walk at 1 year were significantly positively correlated (R = 0.397; 95% CI: 0.251, 0.539, p < 0.001) Age at the time of injury and the axial damage ratio were significantly negatively correlated (R = −0.372; 95% CI: −0.507, −0.230, p < 0.001).

For the ROC curve analysis, with the state variable being the ability to walk 150 feet (45.72 meters) at 1 year after SCI and the test variable the axial damage ratio, it was found that the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.751 (95% CI: 0.667, 0.834, p < 0.001). An axial damage ratio cut-off value of 0.374 was chosen based on the position of the upper left corner of the curve with consideration of optimizing of specificity. Another variable was created dichotomizing individuals above and below this cut-off point. The logistic regression model for the axial damage ratio below 0.374 was a significant predictor of the ability to walk 1 year after injury (χ² = 20.62, p < 0.001, Nagelkerke R² = 0.181, Exp(B) = 5.36; 95% CI: 2.54, 11.34). The sensitivity of using the axial damage ratio cut-off of 0.374 was 0.57 and the specificity was 0.80. The positive likelihood ratio was 2.89 (95% CI: 1.80, 4.66) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.75).

The logistic regression model for initial AIS grades showed this variable to be a significant predictor of the ability to walk 1 year after injury (χ² = 111.91, p < 0.001, R² = 0.743). When axial damage ratios were added as an additional predictor, this variable was non-significant (p = 0.783).

### Recovery after spinal cord infarcts: long-term outcome in 115 patients [^11156Hc9]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the long-term outcome of patients with spinal cord infarct (SCI) and identify prognostic predictors.

Methods

We reviewed 115 patients with SCI treated between 1990 and 2007. Severity of impairment was defined using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scoring. Functional outcome endpoints were ambulatory status, need for bladder catheterization, and pain.

Results

Mean age was 64 years; 72 (62.6%) patients were men. A total of 45% of infarcts were perioperative (69% aortic surgeries). A total of 68% reached maximal deficit within 1 hour (mean = 5 hours). Impairment at nadir was ASIA A 23%, B 26%, C 14%, and D 37%. A total of 75/93 (81%) patients studied with MRI had cord signal abnormality. At nadir, 81% required wheelchair, 86% required catheterization, and 32% had pain. At last follow-up (mean = 3 years), 23% had died. Among survivors, 42% required a wheelchair, 54% required catheterization, and 29% had pain upon last follow-up. Of 74 patients using a wheelchair at hospital dismissal, 41% were walking by final follow-up. Of 83 patients catheterized at dismissal, 33% were catheter-free at last follow-up. Older age (p < 0.0001), increased severity of impairment at nadir (p = 0.02), and peripheral vascular disease (p = 0.003) were independent risk factors for mortality. Severe impairment (ASIA A/B) at nadir predicted wheelchair use (p < 0.0001) and bladder catheterization (p < 0.0001) at last follow-up.

Conclusions

Gradual improvement in not uncommon after spinal cord infarction and it may continue long after hospital dismissal. While severe impairment at nadir is the strongest predictor of poor functional outcome, meaningful recovery is also possible in a substantial minority of these patients.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^1148zj5Y]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) functional outcomes — ambulation and continence — are defined with time-course benchmarks: most improvement is seen within 3 months following injury with a plateau 6–9 months following injury; independent ambulation is broadly defined as the ability to walk for short distances with or without assistive devices, with FIM-based studies typically using a locomotion (walking) score of 6 or 7 and an alternative definition of a locomotion-walking score of 5 (supervision only) or higher with at least 50 m of unassisted walking; bowel and bladder control is broadly defined as the ability to maintain continence with or without the use of adjuncts, but despite several articles, none met inclusion criteria due to methodological flaws or lack of prognostication information available during critical care management.

### Prognostic factors for cervical spinal cord injury without major bone injury in elderly patients [^117KC7JY]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Medium credibility.

Prognostic factors in AIS A–C cases

A comparison of AIS A-C patients with and without recovery of walking ability at the final follow-up is shown in Table 3. In univariate analysis, the severity of AIS on admission was particularly significant, and the prevalence of OPLL, signal change on MRI, comorbidity of dementia/delirium, and post-injury pneumonia were significantly different between the patients with and without recovery of walking. There was no difference in walking recovery between the surgical and conservative treatment groups (p = 0.47). There were also no significant differences in patient background, cause of SCI (lower- or higher-energy trauma), diagnostic delay, comorbidity of diabetes and hypertension, administration of methylprednisolone, or complicating injuries between patients with and without walking recovery.

Table 3.
Comparison of Admission Data for American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale A–C Cases with and without Independent Walking Recovery at Follow-Up

Multi-variate logistic regression analysis including significant variables from univariate analysis and patient background factors was used to identify independent prognostic factors in AIS A-C cases (Table 4). In this analysis, BMI (OR: 1.112), signal change on MRI (OR: 0.240), AIS on admission (OR: 3.497), comorbidity of dementia/delirium (OR: 0.365), and post-injury pneumonia (OR: 0.194) were identified as independent prognostic factors for walking recovery in AIS A–C patients after CSCI without major bone injury.

Table 4.

Multi-variate analysis excluding AIA A cases (i.e. AIS B-C cases only) showed similar results, with BMI (OR: 1.129), prevalence of OPLL (OR: 0.494), signal change on MRI (OR: 0.238), AIS on admission (OR: 4.659), and post-injury pneumonia (OR: 0.155) identified as independent prognostic factors (Table 5).

### International surveillance study in acute spinal cord injury confirms viability of multinational clinical trials [^112RRbF5]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The epidemiological international landscape of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) has evolved over the last decades along with given inherent differences in acute care and rehabilitation across countries and jurisdictions. However, to what extent these differences may influence neurological and functional recovery as well as the integrity of international trials is unclear. The latter also relates to historical clinical data that are exploited to inform clinical trial design and as potential comparative data.

Methods

Epidemiological and clinical data of individuals with traumatic and ischemic SCI enrolled in the European Multi-Center Study about Spinal Cord Injury (EMSCI) were analyzed. Mixed-effect models were employed to account for the longitudinal nature of the data, efficiently handle missing data, and adjust for covariates. The primary outcomes comprised demographics/injury characteristics and standard scores to quantify neurological (i.e., motor and sensory scores examined according to the International Standards for the Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury) and functional recovery (walking function). We externally validated our findings leveraging data from a completed North American landmark clinical trial.

Results

A total of 4601 patients with acute SCI were included. Over the course of 20 years, the ratio of male to female patients remained stable at 3:1, while the distribution of age at injury significantly shifted from unimodal (2001/02) to bimodal distribution (2019). The proportional distribution of injury severities and levels remained stable with the largest percentages of motor complete injuries. Both, the rate and pattern of neurological and functional recovery, remained unchanged throughout the surveillance period despite the increasing age at injury. The findings related to recovery profiles were confirmed by an external validation cohort (n = 791). Lastly, we built an open-access and online surveillance platform ("Neurosurveillance") to interactively exploit the study results and beyond.

Conclusions

Despite some epidemiological changes and considerable advances in clinical management and rehabilitation, the neurological and functional recovery following SCI has remained stable over the last two decades. Our study, including a newly created open-access and online surveillance tool, constitutes an unparalleled resource to inform clinical practice and implementation of forthcoming clinical trials targeting neural repair and plasticity in acute spinal cord injury.

### Toward improving the prediction of functional ambulation after spinal cord injury through the inclusion of limb accelerations during sleep and personal factors [^112iQ3px]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine if functional measures of ambulation can be accurately classified using clinical measures; demographics; personal, psychosocial, and environmental factors; and limb accelerations (LAs) obtained during sleep among individuals with chronic, motor incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) in an effort to guide future, longitudinal predictions models.

Design

Cross-sectional, 1–5 days of data collection.

Setting

Community-based data collection.

Participants

Adults with chronic (> 1 year), motor incomplete SCI (N = 27).

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Ambulatory ability based on the 10-m walk test (10MWT) or 6-minute walk test (6MWT) categorized as nonambulatory, household ambulator (0.01–0.44 m/s, 1–204 m), or community ambulator (> 0.44 m/s, > 204 m). A random forest model classified ambulatory ability using input features including clinical measures of strength, sensation, and spasticity; demographics; personal, psychosocial, and environmental factors including pain, environmental factors, health, social support, self-efficacy, resilience, and sleep quality; and LAs measured during sleep. Machine learning methods were used explicitly to avoid overfitting and minimize the possibility of biased results.

Results

The combination of LA, clinical, and demographic features resulted in the highest classification accuracies for both functional ambulation outcomes (10MWT = 70.4%, 6MWT = 81.5%). Adding LAs, personal, psychosocial, and environmental factors, or both increased the accuracy of classification compared with the clinical/demographic features alone. Clinical measures of strength and sensation (especially knee flexion strength), LA measures of movement smoothness, and presence of pain and comorbidities were among the most important features selected for the models.

Conclusions

The addition of LA and personal, psychosocial, and environmental features increased functional ambulation classification accuracy in a population with incomplete SCI for whom improved prognosis for mobility outcomes is needed. These findings provide support for future longitudinal studies that use LA; personal, psychosocial, and environmental factors; and advanced analyses to improve clinical prediction rules for functional mobility outcomes.

### Prognostic factors for cervical spinal cord injury without major bone injury in elderly patients [^114QJmpA]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Medium credibility.

Neurological evaluation

Neurological status on admission, at discharge, and six months after injury or at final follow-up (hereafter referred to as 3–6 months after injury) were evaluated by senior spine surgeons and physical therapists at each center using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale (AIS). At admission, the most frequent AIS category was D (52.6%), followed by C (36.4%), A (5.8%), and B (5.2%) (Table 1).

Mobility was also objectively assessed simultaneously (independent walking/walking with a cane/walking with a walker/standing and transferring only sitting only/unable to sit and in bed). For AIS A–C cases on admission, patients who recovered walking with or without a cane or a walker (AIS D or E) 3–6 months after injury were considered to have significant neurological improvement. For AIS D cases, considering a high prevalence of central cord syndrome (weakness in the upper extremities and less severe weakness of the lower extremities), patients without residual upper extremity motor paralysis (upper extremity AIS motor score = 50) at 3–6 months after injury were considered to have significant neurological improvement.

Statistical analysis

Comparisons were made for AIS A–C cases and D cases with and without significant neurological improvement (Fig. 1). A subanalysis of AIS B-C cases was also performed based on the influence of data for AIS A cases on the results. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test, Fisher exact test, or non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test.

Significant factors in the univariate analysis and those reported in the literature were included in a multi-variate regression model with listwise deletion of missing data. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to identify independent predictors of neurological improvement in CSCI without major bone injury. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 24.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^113sge49]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Evidence to recommendation criteria — predictor reliability thresholds — state that predictors described as "reliable" have both a higher overall certainty in the evidence and greater effect size than "moderately reliable". For "reliable" predictors and prediction models, one downgrade was permitted for risk of bias, but none for inconsistency, imprecision or indirectness, and the overall quality of evidence had to be high or moderate; "reliable" prediction models were required to demonstrate an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of > 0.8, and no evidence of miscalibration in external validation studies that reported the method and found none, whereas "moderately reliable" prediction models were required to demonstrate an AUC > 0.7, and some miscalibration in some external populations was allowed; predictors that did not fit these criteria were classified as "not reliable".

### Recovery following ischemic myelopathies and traumatic spinal cord lesions [^115xG33m]. Spinal Cord (2011). Low credibility.

Background

As the general population ages, the rising prevalence of vascular lesions of the spinal cord will become significant. The aim of this study was to compare the neurological and functional outcomes of patients with ischemic spinal cord injury (ISCI) and traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI).

Setting

Spinal cord unit of a rehabilitation hospital in Italy.

Study Design

Retrospective study.

Patients and Methods

We studied 179 patients with a TSCI and 68 with an ISCI. At admission and discharge, patients were examined by American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) standards, Barthel Index, Rivermead Mobility Index and Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury. Bowel and bladder management and discharge destination were recorded at discharge. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and logistic regression models were used to analyze the effects of the etiology of the lesion, AIS level at admission, site of the lesion and the presence of complications on measured outcomes.

Results

Patients with an ISCI were older and experienced fewer cervical lesions and complications at admission. By ANCOVA and logistic regression, age, AIS level and lesion level were the chief predictors of neurological and functional outcome, whereas etiology had no effect on outcome.

Conclusions

A diagnosis of ischemia and trauma is not a determinant of neurological and functional recovery in spinal cord injury patients. Instead, the outcome of these patients is influenced by age, lesion level and AIS level.

### Early predictors of global functional outcome after traumatic spinal cord injury: a systematic review [^1131G2g7]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Accurately predicting functional recovery is an asset for all clinicians and decision makers involved in the care of patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI). Unfortunately, there is a lack of information on the relative importance of significant predictors of global functional outcome. There is also a need for identifying functional predictors that can be timely optimized by the medical and rehabilitation teams throughout the hospitalizations phases. The main objective of this work was to systematically review and rate early factors that are consistently and independently associated with global functional outcome in individuals with TSCI. A literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases from January 1, 1970 to April 1, 2017 was performed. Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts yielded by this literature search and subsequently selected studies to be included based on predetermined eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved by a consensus-based discussion, and if not, by an external reviewer. Data were extracted by three independent reviewers using a standardized table. The quality of evidence of the individual studies was assessed based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine modified by Wright and colleagues (2000) as well as the National Institutes of Health (2014). Fifteen articles identifying early clinical predictors of functional outcome using multiple regression analyses were included in this systematic review. Based on the compiled data, this review proposes a rating of early factors associated to global functional outcome according to their importance and their potential to be modified by the medical/rehabilitation team throughout the early phases of hospitalization. It also proposes a new conceptual framework that illustrates the impact of specific categories of factors and their interaction with each other. Ultimately, this review aims to guide clinicians and researchers in improving the continuum of care throughout early phases post-SCI.

### Factors associated with recovery in motor strength, walking ability, and bowel and bladder function after traumatic cauda equina injury [^1172dZWs]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of traumatic cauda equina injury

The benefit of early surgery in lumbar spine fracture in the presence of neurological deficit is not well defined in the literature, and there is no standard of care regarding optimal timing of surgery in patients with TCEI. However, it is recommended that surgery be performed as soon as the patient is medically stable given that early surgery may have the advantages of allowing early mobilization and reducing complications such as pain.

In our study, time from injury to surgery was not correlated with recovery of motor strength, the ability to walk, or bowel or bladder function, which is consistent with previous studies. Early surgical treatment may not be as beneficial in patients with TCEI as compared to those with cervical and thoracic SCI, where early surgical decompression of the spinal cord was found to be safe and may improve neurological recovery after acute traumatic SCI. In our cohort, > 60% had less-severe neurological injury, which could explain the finding of delayed surgery (> 24 h) in 51% of the patients.

Predictors of recovery in traumatic cauda equina injury

Studying the predictors of outcomes after TCEI has proved challenging because of the uniqueness and heterogeneity of TCEI, with variable degrees of injury severity from mild neurological deficits to severe complete cauda equina injury. However, there are important advantages in identifying predictors of outcomes after TCEI; a more informed prognosis can facilitate interprofessional communication, patient education, and setting realistically rehabilitation goals. Our results showed that earlier rehabilitation onset was a significant predictor for recovery in the ability to walk and improvement in bowel score after adjusting for injury severity, level of injury, and time of surgery. The association between early rehabilitation onset and improved functional outcome has also been found in previous studies.

Interestingly, longer length of rehabilitation stay, older age, and being female were associated with improved bladder score. The effect of these predictors on bladder score requires further evaluation. For motor strength recovery, older age and higher LEMS at admission were significantly associated with higher LEMS at discharge from care. The observation that older age was associated with better motor outcome could partially be explained by the fact that persons in this demographic are less exposed to high-impact mechanisms of injury and thus maintain higher LEMS at admission than younger patients. Further, with a less-severe injury, older patients would also be likely to make more-significant improvement in bladder scores than the younger persons despite a low bladder score at admission. It remains to be determined why a similar effect was not observed in the bowel recovery.

### Factors associated with recovery in motor strength, walking ability, and bowel and bladder function after traumatic cauda equina injury [^112Ey87k]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Traumatic cauda equina injury (TCEI) is usually caused by spine injury at or below L1 and can result in motor and/or sensory impairments and/or neurogenic bowel and bladder. We examined factors associated with recovery in motor strength, walking ability, and bowel and bladder function to aid in prognosis and establishing rehabilitation goals. The analysis cohort was comprised of persons with acute TCEI enrolled in the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry. Multi-variable regression analysis was used to determine predictors for lower-extremity motor score (LEMS) at discharge, walking ability at discharge as assessed by the walking subscores of either the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) or Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM), and improvement in bowel and bladder function as assessed by FIM-relevant subscores. Age, sex, neurological level and severity of injury, time from injury to surgery, rehabilitation onset, and length of stay were examined as potential confounders. The cohort included 214 participants. Median improvement in LEMS was 4 points. Fifty-two percent of participants were able to walk, and > 20% recovered bowel and bladder function by rehabilitation discharge. Multi-variable analyses revealed that shorter time from injury to rehabilitation admission (onset) was a significant predictor for both improvement in walking ability and bowel function. Longer rehabilitation stay and being an older female were associated with improved bladder function. Our results suggest that persons with TCEI have a reasonable chance of recovery in walking ability and bowel and bladder function. This study provides important information for rehabilitation goals setting and communication with patients and their families regarding prognosis.

### Concurrent validity of single and groups of walking assessments following acute spinal cord injury [^115ZB3a9]. Spinal Cord (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected longitudinal data. Variables of interest are timed and untimed walking assessments (10MWT, 6MWT, TUG, WISCI, SCIM3a, SCIM3b) and lower extremities motor scores (LEMS) from both sides' lower limb motor segments, measured five times within the first year after acute spinal cord injury (SCI).

Objectives

Assessing concurrent validity of single and groups of walking assessments in comparison with LEMS in SCI patients.

Setting

European Multicenter study about Spinal Cord Injury, a collaboration of 22 centers.

Methods

Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was applied to single and groups of assessments at each time point, separately for patients able to perform timed walking assessments (less impaired; patient subgroup I) and for all patients (no selection; patient subgroup II).

Results

In patient subgroup I, SCIM3b, WISCI, 10MWT and 6MWT all had high and similar concurrent validity one year after injury. Among all groups of three walking assessments, SCIM3a, WISCI and 10MWT had highest concurrent validity, similar to all six walking assessments together. Timed walking assessments generally had higher concurrent validity than untimed ones. In patient subgroup II, WISCI distinctly had highest concurrent validity one year after injury, similar to all three untimed walking assessments together.

Conclusions

CCA can assess concurrent validity of single and groups of assessments. Minimal sets of walking assessments with comparable concurrent validity as all assessments together were proposed. As these sets differ by patient group, walking assessments should be specified according to expected walking ability to allow for targeted, cost-effective application of assessments.

### Lower extremity outcome measures: considerations for clinical trials in spinal cord injury [^112w45se]. Spinal Cord (2018). Low credibility.

The "10MWT" is used to assess gait speed. The walking distance is 14 m to accommodate 2 m for acceleration at the beginning and 2 m for deceleration at the end. Speed is calculated from the time it takes for a patient to walk the intermediate 10 m. The test can be conducted at a preferred walking speed or at the person's fastest (but safe) speed. The assessment does not discriminate the amount of assistance provided by a walking aid, though its use should be recorded and may be kept consistent in repeated measures. It is considered that faster walking speed is a surrogate measure for an overall improvement in LE motor function and performance. However, it is not clear how to define a meaningful walking speed for daily living. Different walking speeds have been recommended to discriminate between functional walking categories after SCI (indoor walkers > 0.15 ± 0.08 m/s, assisted walkers > 0.44 ± 0.14 m/s and independent walkers > 0.70 ± 0.13 m/s). The speed needed to safely cross a street at many crosswalks was defined as 0.6 m/s, but crosswalk timers vary by region and sometimes require a faster walking velocity. Independent living has been correlated with a walking speed above 1.0 m/s for elderly people.

### Muscle force and gait performance: relationships after spinal cord injury [^111GjP1C]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To relate locomotor function improvement, within the first 6 months after spinal cord injury (SCI), to an increase in Lower Extremity Motor Score (LEMS) and to assess the extent to which the level of lesion influenced the outcome of ambulatory capacity.

Design

Longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses.

Setting

Seven SCI rehabilitation centers.

Participants

Patients (N = 178) were analyzed longitudinally (group A, motor complete; group B, motor incomplete; nonwalking or group C, motor incomplete and able to stand). The cross-sectional analysis included 86 patients (paraplegic, n = 46; tetraplegic, n = 40; group 1 with limited and group 2 with unrestricted walking function 6 mo after SCI).

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI), gait speed, and LEMS.

Results

For group A, 24.8% of the patients improved in LEMS (median range, 0–10) and 7.7% in walking function (WISCI median range, 0–8; mean gait speed range, 0 to .14 ± .10 m/s). For group B, LEMS improved in 93.5% of the patients (median range, 14–28) and walking function in 84.8% of the patients (WISCI median range, 0–10; mean gait speed range, 0 to .41 ± .45 m/s) (P < .001). For group C, LEMS and walking function improved in 100% of the patients (LEMS median range, 29–41; WISCI median range, 8–16; mean gait speed range, .36 ± .29 m/s to .88 ± .44 m/s) (P = 0.001). In groups B and C, the improvement of walking function was greater than in LEMS. The cross-sectional analysis showed that group 1 patients with tetraplegia had more muscle strength (median LEMS, 31.5), and equal walking function (WISCI, 8; walking speed, 0.4 ± 0.3 m/s) compared with patients with paraplegia (LEMS, 23; P < .01; WISCI, 12; P = 0.6; speed, 0.4 ± 0.3 m/s; p = 0.68). In group 2, patients with tetraplegia had slightly more strength (LEMS, 48) and equal walking function (WISCI, 20; walking speed, 1.4 ± 0.3 m/s) compared with patients with paraplegia (LEMS, 45; P < .05; WISCI, 20; P = 1.0; speed, 1.4 ± 0.3 m/s; p = 0.89).

Conclusions

An improvement in locomotor function does not always reflect an increase in LEMS, and LEMS improvement is not necessarily associated with improved locomotor function. LEMS and ambulatory capacity are differently associated in patients with tetra- and paraplegia. Functional tests seem to complement clinical assessment.

### Locomotor training for walking after spinal cord injury [^1139f26u]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a lesion of neural elements of the spinal cord that can result in any degree of sensory and motor deficit, autonomic or bowel dysfunction. Improvement of locomotor function is one of the primary goals for people with SCI. Locomotor training for walking is therefore used in rehabilitation after SCI and might help to improve a person's ability to walk. However, a systematic review of the evidence is required to assess the effects and acceptability of locomotor training after SCI.

Objectives

To assess the effects of locomotor training on improvement in walking for people with traumatic SCI.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register (searched November 2011); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4); MEDLINE (Ovid) (1966 to November 2011); EMBASE (Ovid) (1980 to November 2011); CINAHL (1982 to November 2011); AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database) (1985 to November 2011); SPORTDiscus (1949 to November 2011); PEDro (the Physiotherapy Evidence database) (searched November 2011); COMPENDEX (engineering databases) (1972 to November 2011); and INSPEC (1969 to November 2011). We also searched the online trials databases Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com/isrctn) and Clinical Trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov). We handsearched relevant conference proceedings, checked reference lists of relevant published papers and contacted study authors in an effort to identify published, unpublished and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving people with SCI that compared locomotor training to a control of any other exercise or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcomes were the speed of walking and walking capacity at final follow-up.

Main Results

Five RCTs involving 309 people are included in this review. Overall, the results were inconclusive. There was no statistically significant superior effect of any locomotor training approach on walking function after SCI compared with any other kind of physical rehabilitation. The use of bodyweight supported treadmill training as locomotor training for people after SCI did not significantly increase walking velocity (0.03 m/sec with a 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.05 to 0.11; P = 0.52; I(2) = 22%) nor did it increase walking capacity (-1.3 metres (95% CI -41 to 40); P = 0.95; I(2) = 62%). However, in one study involving 74 people the group receiving robotic-assisted locomotor training had reduced walking capacity compared with people receiving any other intervention, a finding which needs further investigation. In all five studies there were no differences in adverse events or drop-outs between study groups.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence from RCTs to conclude that any one locomotor training strategy improves walking function more than another for people with SCI. The effects especially of robotic-assisted locomotor training are not clear, therefore research in the form of large RCTs, particularly for robotic training, is needed. Specific questions about which type of locomotor training might be most effective in improving walking function for people with SCI need to be explored.

### Prognostic factors for cervical spinal cord injury without major bone injury in elderly patients [^114QEGSE]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Neurological status

Neurological status evaluated by AIS at admission and follow-up at 3–6 months after injury is shown in Table 2. Among AIS A–C cases at admission, 154 patients (55.0%) — 11.8% in AIS A, 22.6% in AIS B, and 66.5% in AIS C — had walking recovery at follow-up. In all 591 patients, there were 13 deaths (2.2%) — 8.8% in AIS A, 12.9% in AIS B, 2.3% in AIS C, and 0.3% in AIS D — within six months after injury.

Table 2.
Changes in American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale between Admission and Follow-up

In AIS D cases at admission, 64 patients had a full upper extremity ASIA motor score (50). Of the remaining 247 AIS D cases, 107 (43.3%) patients recovered with full upper extremity motor function at follow-up. Among AIS C and D cases with motor paralysis, 38.6% (n = 83) in AIS C and 85.4% (n = 211) in AIS D patients were classified as having central cord syndrome.

### Lower extremity outcome measures: considerations for clinical trials in spinal cord injury [^114UgvFS]. Spinal Cord (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions and recommendations

There is no single outcome measure that can be universally applied to all people living with SCI to track changes in LE performance regardless of severity and level of injury (Fig. 1). Walking is important to most people after SCI and certainly LE function shows some improvement following incomplete cervical or thoracolumbar SCI. Thus, carefully tracking change in LE activities is fundamental in assessing any clinical treatment effect.

It is generally agreed that a direct measurement of the performance for an appropriate functional activity supersedes any surrogate biomarker or neurological indicator (e.g. ISNCSCI). However, for aspects of feasibility, we are limited in measuring complex LE functional activities at the acute stage after SCI. Furthermore, how to relate measures of a patient with limited LE (non-ambulatory) movement at an early stage after SCI to any eventual recovery of ambulatory ability? Thus, we often have no baseline measurement of the primary or secondary outcome measure, we would like to follow across the whole range from very acute to end of trial participation. Shakespeare's Hamlet stated it succinctly "Ay, there's the rub!"

The unidimensional interval SCAR was created from elements of ISNCSCI and SCIM III to overcome this obstacle; should it be independently validated in prospective clinical studies, it might become a valid and useful clinical outcome tool in SCI studies. Clinical trials in SCI would be best served by having unidimensional interval measures that can be applied at early and late time points after spinal injury for all people, regardless of level or severity of SCI.

It is reasonable to suggest that the timed walk or distance walked outcome measures (10MWT, 6mWT, TUG) are valid study metrics for people already possessing good ambulatory abilities at the beginning of a study involving individuals with chronic SCI. For example, the efficacy of a rehabilitation training study designed to improve a person's fitness and/or walking capacity after incomplete SCI could be supported by overall improvements in walking speed or distance. But these measures do not track the quality of the gait. If this is important for assessing the benefits of an intervention, then the assessment of changes in items within SCI-FAI, NRS or 3D kinematic gait analysis would be useful tools.

### A therapist-administered self-report version of the walking index for spinal cord injury II (WISCI): a psychometric study [^115t49Tg]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Walking is an important and common goal for people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and a key measure of physical function. Moreover, people with SCI rate walking as a very important determinant of their quality of life. Not surprisingly, most cohort studies and clinical trials interested in some aspect of physical rehabilitation and walking include a measure of walking ability.

The most commonly used measure of walking ability is the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury Version II (WISCI). WISCI was developed for research purposes and has been validated for use in the acute and chronic stages of SCI, with high inter- and intra-rater reliability. It is a hierarchical 21-point scale, where the WISCI score reflects the participants' ability to walk on a 10-m flat smooth surface. Scores range from 0 (unable to stand and/or participate in assisted walking) to 20 (ambulates with no devices, no braces and no physical assistance, 10 m). The assessment involves progressing the participants through each level of the scale by manipulating different combinations of walking aids, leg braces and physical assistance, until the maximal score is attained. The WISCI score does not take walking speed and quality of gait into consideration, and the participants are scored on how they can walk in a testing environment, rather than on how they prefer to walk in the community or at home.

### Assessment of disability in patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injury: a systematic review of the literature [^116BVNr5]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2011). Low credibility.

Given the importance of accurately and reliably assessing disability in future clinical trials, which will test therapeutic strategies in acute spinal cord injury (SCI), we sought to appraise comprehensively studies that focused on the psychometric properties (i.e., reliability, validity, and responsiveness) of all previously used outcome measures in the SCI population. The search strategy included Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. Two reviewers independently assessed each study regarding eligibility, level of evidence (using Sackett's criteria), and quality. Of 363 abstracts captured in our search, 36 full articles fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eight different outcome measures were used to assess disability in the SCI population, including Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Spinal cord Injury Measure (SCIM), Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI), Quadriplegia Index of Function (QIF), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), Timed Up & Go (TUG), 6-min walk test (6MWT), and 10-m walk test (10MWT). While 19 of 36 studies provided level-4 evidence, the remaining 17 articles were classified as level-2b evidence. Most of the instruments showed convergent construct validity in the SCI population, but criterion validity was not examined due to the lack a gold standard for assessment of disability. All instruments were tested in the rehabilitation and/or community setting, but only FIM was examined in the acute care setting. Based on our results of quality assessment, the SCIM has the most appropriate performance regarding the instrument's psychometric properties. Nonetheless, further investigations are required to confirm the adequate performance of the SCIM as a comprehensive measure of functional recovery in patients with SCI in rehabilitative care. The expert panel of the Spinal Cord Injury Solutions Network (SCISN) that participated in the modified Delphi process endorsed these conclusions.

### Kunming locomotor training: neurological, functional, and autonomic outcomes in complete spinal cord injury [^111Sa1zC]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

KLS: A 10-grade ordinal assessment scale designed for the KLT protocol (Table 1). Grade 1 indicates inability to stand; Grades 2–8 correspond to successive stages of assisted walking with walkers/crutches. Grade 9 denotes unsupported walking with observable instability; Grade 10 represents stable unsupported ambulation (Fig. 1).

Table 1
The Kunming Locomotor Scale

FIGURE 1
The stages in the Kunming Locomotor Training program illustrated. The stages of the KLS are illustrated with typical walking aids and modes of assistance.

ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS): Assessed using standardized ASIA examination worksheets at admission and discharge.

SCIM III bladder and bowel subscores: The bladder score includes seven graded elements (0, 3, 6, 9, 11, 13, 15 points) from indwelling catheter use to continence without external drainage. The bowel score includes four elements (0, 5, 8, 10 points) from irregular movements to independent regular movements without accidents.

Statistical analysis

Primary analyses: Logistic regression was used to examine predictors of AIS improvement, controlling for covariates (age, sex, injury level, and time to admission). ROC analysis identified the KLS change cutoff most predictive of AIS conversion.

Secondary analyses: Regression models examined the effects of KLS change, AIS conversion, and injury level on bladder and bowel outcomes. Interaction models tested for moderation by neurological level (KLS × level; AIS × level).

Robustness checks, including Huber regression, bootstrap resampling, and outlier trimming, were performed to assess the stability of the estimates.

### Lower extremity outcome measures: considerations for clinical trials in spinal cord injury [^115Z6Kju]. Spinal Cord (2018). Low credibility.

The "Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II" (WISCI II) assesses the physical assistance (i.e. number of people) and assistive devices (i.e. walking aids) a patient needs to ambulate 10 metres. The scale assesses walking function on a hierarchical scale from 0 to 20, where higher numbers indicate less impairment. The rank on the index is dependent on the amount of assistance (device, braces and physical assistance) used to ambulate 10 m on a level surface. WISCI II has clinical impact as it is widely used in the SCI population, however, it has some limitations. The score shows ceiling effects in patients who do not require assistive devices/physical assistance and is therefore not suitable for patients with good walking function. Scoring for individuals with very poor walking capacity will also generate a floor effect. Like many ordinal scales, WISCI is not a linear scale because the distance between each successive ranked score might not be equal in terms of difficulty to perform. Finally, therapists' decisions regarding which walking aids to prescribe are dependent on factors that indirectly influence walking such as balance and safety, and therefore, the assessor will affect the WISCI score by requiring walking aids for safety reasons. This is also reflected by the finding that in people with chronic SCI who are capable of ambulating at multiple WISCI levels show more efficient ambulation (e.g. higher walking speed) at self-selected WISCI.

The "Spinal Cord Injury Functional Ambulation Inventory" (SCI-FAI) consists of three key domains of walking function: an ordinal score that assesses the quality of gait (observational gait assessment), an ordinal score that assesses the use of assistive devices and a score that assesses temporal/distance aspects of walking (distance walked within 2 min and an ambulation classification score). Higher scores indicate higher levels of function in each subscale. Each key domain is interpreted separately as an overall composite score would result in a multidimensional score, describing different aspects of gait. SCI-FAI can only be applied in patients with SCI who can ambulate independently with or without the use of assistive devices. It shows ceiling effects in good walkers in the observational gait assessment, the assistive device score and the ambulation classification score. SCI-FAI is not yet a routine clinical study outcome measure. However, it has the potential to broadly categorize the mechanisms (compensation vs. recovery) underlying improvements in LE function over time and therefore could shortly become more commonly used.

### Hyperextension injury of the cervical spine with central cord syndrome [^114dKCMu]. European Spine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Traumatic central cord syndrome (TCCS) is the most commonly encountered type of incomplete spinal cord injury. TCCS typically occurs in patients over the age of 50 with a narrow spinal canal and follows an acute hyperextension injury of the cervical spine. Here, we report on the demographics of TCCS patients, their clinical course and outcomes, and the factors that may have influenced these outcomes.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective folder review of patients who presented to our facility between January 2004 and December 2008 following hyperextension injury of the cervical spine and with the clinical manifestations of a central cord syndrome. Patient details were obtained from the acute spinal cord injury register at Groote Schuur Hospital and the patient folders, radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging films were reviewed. Predetermined data points were identified, tabulated and analysed, with only information from the injury-related admission being included.

Results

An ASIA motor score of ≥ 60 on admission or discharge correlated with an 80% chance of being able to walk at discharge from hospital. An ASIA motor score of ≤ 50 on admission correlated with an 80% chance of not walking at discharge. An ASIA motor score of ≤ 50 at discharge meant a patient was not only unable to walk, but required placement in a spinal injury rehabilitation centre. Further, if a patient had a cervical spinal canal diameter of ≥ 8 mm they had a 50% chance of clinical improvement and nearly 80% chance of a functional outcome.

Conclusion

The Groote Schuur Hospital patient population differs from the international norm, particularly with respect to age and mechanism of injury. The ASIA motor score and cervical spine canal diameter proved to be useful predictors of outcome. Within our patient group, timing of surgery did not appear to influence the outcome.

### Research priorities to enhance life for people with spinal cord injury: a Swedish priority setting partnership [^114eEKJp]. Spinal Cord (2023). Medium credibility.

In line with the previous PSP for SCI, the top ten priorities included cure and stem cell research. In this PSP, it should be emphasised that for the workshop participants, this question concerned not only cure but also ways of reducing risks of nerve damage and promoting healing in the acute phase, to optimise the scope for maximising functional recovery. Two recent reviews were identified in our literature review as providing initial or partial evidence for the question For people with spinal cord injury, how reliably and how soon after the injury can their attainable level of functional capacity be predicted? The initial American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale score has proved to be a strong predictor of both neurological outcome and chronic functional outcome. Furthermore, surgical and specialised functional rehabilitation measures are also emphasised as the strongest predictors of chronic functional impairment. However, future studies are urged to consider in addition, first, management by a specialist multidisciplinary team during emergency care and, second, the intensity and degree of patient participation in rehabilitation therapies and nursing care during the acute phase. The latter two aspects may both fit well together with the tenth prioritised question: What kinds of treatment are effective in improving the healing (regeneration) ability of damaged nerves?

### The role of rehabilitation in the recovery of walking in the neurological population [^114pErx4]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Recent studies demonstrate that neurological patients show great potential for recovery in both the early and late stages following injury. Enhancement of the recovery process could be achieved with new rehabilitation approaches alone or in combination with pharmacological intervention. These new approaches have evolved from fundamental advances in both animal and human studies. To date few randomized clinical trials have addressed the efficacy or effectiveness of these new approaches. In this paper, important quantitative studies will be reviewed and discussed in relation to the important mechanisms of locomotor control and plasticity that take place following lesions of the central nervous system.

Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury

Outcome Predictors and Prognostic Models

The available literature of the past decade was reviewed on prognostic scores and models for outcome prediction after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). The first clinical prediction rule for ambulation outcomes after 12 months was derived from a longitudinal cohort study (European Multicenter Study on Human Spinal Cord Injury) conducted at 19 centers over a 7-year period. Predictor variables were retrieved from standardized neurological examinations within 15 days of injury as defined by the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury in addition to age.

A simplified 3-variable model of this prediction rule was proposed and tested on the basis of acute phase (< 15 days) and outcome (> 12 months) data from the Canadian Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry. Demonstrating similar accuracy, it could potentially enhance clinical utility.

Another clinical prediction model for long-term outcome (at 1 year) after traumatic SCI was based on two prospective datasets from the North American Clinical Trials Network for SCI and the Surgical Timing in Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study. It included both clinical and imaging variables obtained in the acute setting (i.e. within 72 h of SCI). Data from the US-multicenter Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems database were used to compare mathematical models for accurately predicting different levels of independence at 12 months following SCI, ambulation status, as well as non-ambulation outcomes from rehabilitation admission examinations (i.e. within 9 weeks of SCI). All models were based on logistic regression analyses and one employed artificial neural networks in comparison. Classifications of injury severity typically utilize the ASIA impairment scale obtained either on admission or within 72 h. Outcome assessment at one year included ambulation ability (self-reported or examined) and composite functional assessments such as the functional independence measure and/or spinal cord independence measure.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^115aZjBq]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) neuroprognostication — values, preferences, and resource use emphasizes patient-centered communication. The panel and patient representative noted that many patients with isolated tSCI are conscious and able to participate in discussion with providers, and individuals would likely value information about predicted functional outcomes even when that information is incomplete or uncertain because it supports planning for the future; the patient representative stressed the importance of providing balanced information when discussing prognosis, specifically addressing both the potential for a good quality of life and the burdens associated with functional losses. Resource considerations note that the predictors and models that have been tested in prognostication of spinal cord injury reflect information already collected as part of routine care.

### Palliative care best practices guidelines [^115isaA3]. ACS (2017). Medium credibility.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) prognosis and ambulation outcomes indicate that the vast majority of motor recovery occurs over the first two years, and the cumulative 20-year survival rate is 70 percent; however, this figure is likely generous and subject to under-reporting and patients lost to follow-up. Little chance of functional recovery is found in the lower extremities of tetraplegics if the motor and sensory deficits remain complete for greater than one month post-injury. Prognosis for ambulation at one to two years (requires at least one functioning hip flexor and leg braces) is: complete paraplegic 5%, incomplete paraplegic 76%, complete tetraplegic 0%, and incomplete tetraplegic 46%.

### Validity and reliability of the 2-minute walk test in individuals with spinal cord injury [^113r2g4u]. Spinal Cord (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Almost half of all spinal cord injuries (SCI) are functionally incomplete, meaning that there is some remaining motor or sensory function below the level of the lesion. These individuals have a high chance to regain some walking function after rehabilitation. But also a small proportion of individuals with complete thoracolumbar SCI are able to recover some lower extremity function. Regaining locomotor function after SCI is of high priority for the affected individuals, especially in individuals with paraplegia. This shows the need for valid and reliable gait assessments that allow therapists to monitor individuals' walking performance during the course of rehabilitation.

One of the most established assessments of walking function in individuals with SCI is the 6-minute walk test (6mWT) which measures the distance an individual is able to walk within 6 min. The 6mWT is widely used to measure endurance, fatigability, and cardiovascular fitness, showing good psychometric properties in individuals with SCI. However, performing the 6mWT is time-consuming, a critical factor in daily clinical practice. Moreover, walking 6 min can be demanding for severely impaired individuals resulting in a floor effect. To overcome these limitations, the 2-minute walk test (2mWT) has gained more attention in the SCI field. Derived from the 6mWT, the 2mWT assesses walking performance by measuring the distance a person is able to walk within 2 min. Previous studies have shown a strong association between the 6mWT and the 2mWT in other neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis, stroke, and neuromuscular disease, but psychometric properties of the 2mWT have not yet been established for the SCI population. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the construct validity of the 2mWT as an outcome measure for walking function in individuals with SCI by testing its relationship with other commonly used functional tests. In addition, test-retest reliability of the 2mWT was assessed by quantifying the degree to which two measurements performed within 1 week are free from measurement error, which means in other words, to quantify the measurement error.

Selection of Outcomes

Outcomes were selected using the GRADE 1–9 scale with input from experts on the writing panel and the patient representative. The outcomes rated "critical" were mortality at discharge from the acute care hospital or later (average rating 7.67), functional outcome at discharge from rehabilitation or later (average rating 8.67), improvement in ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS grade conversion) at discharge from rehabilitation or later (average rating 7.0), independent ambulation at discharge from rehabilitation or later (average rating 8.0), and bowel and bladder control (average rating 8.0). Outcomes were defined as follows:
Mortality. Because the factors impacting mortality related to tSCI vary based on time from injury, the reliability of predictors of acute in-hospital mortality (occurring during the initial acute hospitalization after injury) has been described separately from predictors of long-term mortality (cumulative mortality measured at any time point after hospital discharge).
Functional outcome. Assessment of functional outcome after tSCI is most often performed with the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) or Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Both FIM and SCIM are validated tools that measure the patient's ability to perform tasks important to daily living. The FIM can be used with a wide range of patients and is divided into a motor subscale (self-care, sphincter control, transfers, and locomotion) and a cognition subscale (communication and social cognition). Scores range from 1 (totally dependent) to 7 (device- and helper-independent). The FIM motor score, constructed from 13 subscales, therefore ranges from 13 to 91. Functional independence is assumed once scores of 6 or higher are reached on all subscales. The SCIM assesses three domains: self-care, respiration and sphincter management, and mobility. Because FIM and SCIM scores are expected to vary based on NLI, no specific score was used to define good versus poor outcomes. Scores are expected to improve in the first 3 months and plateau within 6–9 months with continued rehabilitation. In clinical studies, functional outcome assessments based on the FIM score are typically performed at 1 year. When 1-year outcomes are unavailable, 6 month-scores are acceptable.
AIS grade conversion. Studies reporting only change in motor score on the ISNCSCI scale or its predecessors were excluded because an isolated change in motor score is difficult to interpret and may not reflect improved function. A number of studies reported AIS grade conversion as a surrogate marker of improved function. These studies were included because AIS grade provides broad categories of function for discussion with patients and families. In addition, improvement in AIS grade may reflect increased potential for future participation in self-care. As with other functional outcome measures (see above), most improvement is seen within 3 months following injury with a plateau 6–9 months following injury. This measure is widely used clinically during acute care and at follow-up.
Independent ambulation. Independent ambulation was broadly defined as the ability to walk for short distances with or without assistive devices. Most studies report ambulation using a subscale of either the FIM or SCIM, with scores dichotomized into two groups (independent ambulation/walkers or no independent ambulation/nonwalkers) for analysis. The specific definition of independent ambulation varies slightly by the scale used (FIM or SCIM) and the version used (SCIM I, II, or III). Studies that utilize the FIM typically define independent ambulation as a locomotion (walking) score of 6 or 7, representing modified or complete independence. Alternatively, independent ambulation has been defined by a locomotion-walking score of 5 (supervision only) or higher with at least 50 m of unassisted walking. All versions of SCIM include multiple subscales for mobility. Independent ambulation is typically defined as an indoor mobility score > 3, reflecting the ability to walk short distances inside without supervision, with or without assistance devices such as a walking frame, crutches, or canes.
Bowel and bladder control. Bowel and bladder control, broadly defined as the ability to maintain continence with or without the use of adjuncts, was included as an outcome of interest because continence is a functional outcome that impacts quality of life. Although the initial literature search returned several articles addressing this outcome, none of the studies met criteria for inclusion, either due to methodological flaws or because they did not address prognostication based on information available during critical care management.

### The walking index for spinal cord injury (WISCI / WISCI II): nature, metric properties, use and misuse [^115w6W7c]. Spinal Cord (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Literature review.

Objective

To critically review all publications/internet sites that have described/used the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI II), as a measure of impairment of walking function after spinal cord injury (SCI), in order to identify its psychometric properties, clarify its nature, specify misuse and incorporate the findings in an updated guide.

Method

A systematic literature search was done of Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus and electronic sites using key words: WISCI or WISCI II, SCI, paraplegia/ tetraplegia/ quadriplegia and ambulation/gait/walking. Among 1235 citations retrieved, 154 relevant articles/sites were identified, classified and examined by the authors; recommendations were made based on findings.

Results and Discussion

The validity (face/concurrent/content/construct/convergent/criterion) and reliability of the WISCI II has been documented in clinical trials and clinical series, and considered adequate by systematic reviewers. In chronic SCI subjects, reliable determination of the maximum (as opposed to self-selected) WISCI II level requires more time and experience by the assessor. The correct use of WISCI II is clarified for testing acute/chronic phases of recovery after SCI, age of subjects, devices and settings. The WISCI II and walking speed measures may be performed simultaneously.

Conclusion

The increased use of the WISCI II is attributed to its unique characteristics as a capacity measure of walking function and its strong metric properties. Appropriate use of the WISCI II was clarified and incorporated into a new guide for its use. Combining it with a walking speed measure needs further study.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^112Tp3u9]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Question: When counseling patients, family members, and/or surrogates of adults with acute tSCI, should the initial severity of injury as measured by the ASIA impairment score alone be considered a reliable predictor of functional outcome at discharge from rehabilitation or beyond?
Recommendation: When counseling patients, family members, and/or surrogates of patients with acute tSCI, we suggest that initial severity of injury as measured by the ASIA impairment score alone not be considered a reliable predictor for future motor outcome at 1-year follow-up. However, patients and surrogates should be counseled that motor incomplete injury is associated with a higher probability of functional improvement (weak recommendation; moderate quality evidence).
Rationale: The body of evidence was downgraded for risk of bias, with various studies demonstrating potential bias in the QUIPS domains of study attrition, confounding, statistical analysis and reporting, and self-fulfilling prophecy. The quality of evidence was not limited by inconsistency, indirectness, or imprecision. Evidence was from prospective registries and study data sets revealed a strong relationship between initial ASIA grade and functional outcome as measured by the motor score of the FIM. As independent predictors of functional outcome, the AIS and NLI are most consistently included in clinical prediction models. Patients with motor complete injuries (AIS A and B) were least likely to achieve functional independence, compared with patients with AIS C and D injuries. As previously outlined, these studies primarily included patients with cervical tSCI, about half with motor complete injuries. However, an analysis by Lee et al. (2016) confirmed these results in a population with thoracic tSCI, in which 90% of patients had motor complete injuries. This predictor could not be recommended as a reliable (or moderately reliable) predictor in isolation because a substantial number of patients with motor complete injuries demonstrate AIS grade conversion and variable functional independence at long-term follow-up.

There was insufficient evidence to provide a recommendation on comorbidities as a predictor of functional outcome. Data from individual studies of concomitant injuries and MRI as predictors of functional outcome were also insufficient to support recommendations. A summary of these studies is available in Supplementary Appendix 4.

### Mobility, continence, and life expectancy in persons with Asia impairment scale grade D spinal cord injuries [^115JYCYG]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Previous research on the life expectancy of persons with American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale Grade D spinal cord injury has considered them as a large homogenous group, making no functional or medical distinctions. This study sought to (1) determine how survival in this group depends on ambulatory function and the extent of bowel or bladder dysfunction, (2) compute life expectancies for various subgroups, and (3) examine whether survival has improved over time.

Design

Data were from 8,206 adults with ASIA Impairment Scale Grade D spinal cord injury in the Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems database who were not ventilator dependent and who survived more than 1 yr after injury. There were a total of 114,739 person-years of follow-up and 1,730 deaths during the 1970–2011 study period. Empirical age- and sex-specific mortality rates were computed. Regression analysis of survival data with time-dependent covariates was used to determine the effect of risk factors, to test for a time trend, and to estimate mortality rates for subgroups. Life expectancies were obtained from life tables constructed for each subgroup.

Results

The ability to walk, whether independently or with an assistive device, was associated with longer survival than wheelchair dependence. The need for an indwelling catheter, and to a lesser extent intermittent catheterization, was associated with increased mortality risk. Persons who walked unaided and who did not require catheterization had life expectancies roughly 90% of normal. Those who required a wheelchair for locomotion had life expectancies comparable with that in paraplegia, less than 75% of normal. No time trend in survival was found.

Conclusions

Life expectancy of persons with ASIA Impairment Scale D spinal cord injury depends strongly on the ability to walk and the need for catheterization.

### Assessing walking ability in subjects with spinal cord injury: validity and reliability of 3 walking tests [^114vw6Yd]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the validity and reliability of 3 timed walking tests (Timed Up & Go [TUG], 10-meter walk test [10MWT], 6-minute walk test) in subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI).

Design

Cross-sectional study and repeated assessments.

Setting

The SCI center of a university hospital in Switzerland.

Participants

Validity was assessed by using the data of 75 patients with SCI, and reliability was determined with 22 patients with SCI.

Intervention

Patients performed the timed tests and the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II (WISCI II) on the same day. Three measurements within 7 days were taken to assess reliability.

Main Outcome Measures

The measures were scatterplots, correlation coefficients (r), and the Bland-Altman plot. Validity was determined in patients with different walking abilities.

Results

Overall, correlation of the 3 timed walking tests was excellent with each other (| r | > .88) and moderate with the WISCI II (| r | > .60). The correlation between the timed tests for patients with poor walking ability remained high (| r | > .70) but decreased in WISCI II (| r | < .35). High correlation coefficients (r > .97) were found for intra- and interrater reliability. However, TUG and 10MWT reliability were negatively influenced by a poor walking function.

Conclusions

The 3 timed tests are valid and reliable measures for assessing walking function in patients with SCI.
