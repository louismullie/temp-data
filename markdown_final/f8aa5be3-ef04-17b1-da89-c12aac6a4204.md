## Question

in submersion injury will albuterol help in mild distress

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether albuterol helps in mild distress after submersion injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of submersion injury and whether it produces bronchospasm. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about bronchodilators in drowning or near-drowning. Next, I will examine indirect evidence from related conditions and any direct clinical data. After that, I need to weigh potential benefits versus risks in mild distress. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with dosing and monitoring advice, and note any exceptions or caveats.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology. Submersion causes aspiration of water with surfactant disruption, alveolar-capillary injury, and an ARDS-like process with hypoxemia; bronchospasm can occur, but the dominant problem is atelectasis, edema, and V/Q mismatch rather than pure reversible bronchospasm, so I should be cautious not to over-attribute wheeze to classic asthma-type bronchospasm alone [^116spww7] [^115Kg43m].

> Wait, let me verify what authoritative guidelines actually recommend. The Wilderness Medical Society drowning guidelines emphasize supportive oxygenation and ventilation, including CPAP for mild-to-moderate distress, and do not list bronchodilators as standard therapy; they also advise observation for 4–6 hours in mild cases with normal mentation, which implies that routine bronchodilators are not mandated in mild presentations [^113Bdw7u] [^113urg8V]. The AHA/AAP focused update similarly prioritizes airway, oxygen, and ventilation strategies without recommending routine beta-agonists in drowning, reinforcing that supportive care is the cornerstone [^116Ygbk9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check for indirect or conflicting guidance. Some prehospital protocols for respiratory distress from noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and irritant exposures allow inhaled bronchodilators when wheeze or bronchospasm is present, and a few documents mention albuterol in "toxin/environmental" contexts; however, these are not drowning-specific and often reflect extrapolation rather than drowning-derived evidence, so I need to be careful not to overgeneralize to submersion injury [^1154jrtX] [^1114nQPE] [^111bdoVQ]. I initially thought one of these prehospital sources explicitly endorsed albuterol for drowning, but wait, I should double-check: the NASEMSO respiratory distress protocols explicitly exclude submersion/drowning from their bronchodilator pathways, which actually argues against routine albuterol use in drowning, not for it [^117FVM6S].

> Next, I should review direct evidence. I need to check whether randomized or prospective trials support beta-agonists in drowning. The best available systematic review concludes there is a dire lack of evidence to guide pharmacologic therapy in drowning, and no high-quality studies demonstrate benefit from inhaled beta-agonists in this population, which means any recommendation here is extrapolated and low-certainty at best [^11786U6z] [^116spww7]. Observational signals from ARDS cohorts suggesting possible benefit with inhaled beta-agonists are hypothesis-generating but not definitive and were not studied in drowning, so I should not rely on them to make a drowning-specific recommendation [^115ZtErp] [^115w5ScT].

> I will now examine the risk–benefit balance in mild distress. Potential benefit is modest and theoretical: if there is true bronchospasm contributing to wheeze or dyspnea, albuterol may transiently improve airflow; however, in drowning, the dominant issues are edema, atelectasis, and impaired gas exchange, so bronchodilation alone is unlikely to correct hypoxemia or the underlying lung injury, and overtreatment could distract from oxygenation and ventilatory support [^116spww7] [^115Kg43m]. Risks include tachycardia, tremor, and paradoxical bronchospasm, which are particularly undesirable in patients with hypoxemia or evolving respiratory failure; given the lack of proven benefit in drowning, I should be conservative and avoid routine albuterol in mild cases [^117Amyso] [^116EcvQ9].

> But wait, what if there is clear wheeze or a history of reactive airway disease. Let me reconsider: if there is objective wheeze or a known asthma/COPD phenotype and the clinician judges bronchospasm is contributory, a cautious trial of albuterol is reasonable as an adjunct to oxygen and supportive care, with close monitoring for response; if there is no wheeze or the presentation is purely crackles, retractions, and hypoxemia, albuterol is unlikely to help and should be avoided [^1176baZe]. I should confirm that any such use is individualized and not a substitute for oxygenation, CPAP, or escalation if distress progresses [^113Bdw7u].

> Next, I should review practical management for mild distress after submersion. Supportive care remains first-line: administer oxygen to maintain SpO₂ ≥ 94–98%, observe for 4–6 hours if symptoms are mild and mentation is normal, and consider CPAP in alert patients with mild-to-moderate distress; reserve bronchodilators for cases with convincing wheeze or known reactive airway disease, and avoid routine albuterol otherwise [^113Bdw7u] [^113urg8V] [^117SwWqh]. If albuterol is used, typical dosing is 2.5–5 mg nebulized or 4–8 puffs MDI with spacer, repeated based on response and tolerability, while watching for tachycardia and clinical deterioration that would prompt escalation rather than repeated bronchodilators [^111bdoVQ] [^1154jrtX].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. For mild distress after submersion injury, albuterol is not routinely indicated and should not be used reflexively; supportive oxygenation, observation, and CPAP when appropriate are the evidence-aligned priorities, with bronchodilators reserved for cases with demonstrable bronchospasm or reactive airway disease, recognizing that the certainty of benefit in drowning is very low and decisions should be individualized [^11786U6z] [^113Bdw7u] [^113urg8V].

---

Albuterol is **reasonable for mild distress after submersion** if wheeze or bronchospasm is present, as it can relieve bronchospasm and improve ventilation [^1154jrtX]. It is **not routinely indicated** if there is no wheeze or bronchospasm, and guidelines do not recommend albuterol for all submersion patients [^117FVM6S]. Use albuterol as an adjunct to oxygen and supportive care, and monitor for response and adverse effects such as tachycardia or tremor [^117Amyso].

---

## Pathophysiology of submersion injury and respiratory distress

Submersion injury causes **aspiration of water** into the lungs, leading to:

- **Surfactant disruption**: Alveolar collapse and atelectasis.
- **Alveolar-capillary membrane injury**: Interstitial and alveolar edema.
- **Inflammatory response**: ARDS-like syndrome with hypoxemia [^116spww7].

Respiratory distress ranges from mild dyspnea to severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure; **bronchospasm can occur**, especially in patients with reactive airway disease or irritant exposure [^113gszPY].

---

## Evidence for albuterol use in submersion injury

There is **limited direct evidence** on albuterol in submersion injury; recommendations are extrapolated from related conditions and expert opinion:

- **Bronchodilator use in inhalation injury**: Albuterol is recommended for bronchospasm in smoke inhalation and irritant exposures, supporting its use when wheeze is present [^113gszPY] [^113eAH6R].
- **Prehospital guidelines**: Albuterol is indicated for respiratory distress with bronchospasm, including noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, but not specifically for submersion injury [^1154jrtX] [^117FVM6S].
- **Systematic review**: No high-quality evidence supports routine albuterol in drowning; use is individualized based on clinical judgment [^11786U6z].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **supportive care** — oxygenation, ventilation, and monitoring — and do not recommend routine albuterol for all submersion patients [^notfound]. Albuterol is reasonable when wheeze or bronchospasm is present, as it may improve airflow and relieve distress [^1154jrtX].

---

## Potential benefits and risks of albuterol in mild distress

### Benefits

Potential benefits include **bronchodilation** with relief of bronchospasm and improved ventilation, as well as reduced work of breathing and dyspnea.

---

### Risks

- **Tachycardia and tremor**: Common adverse effects, especially in anxious patients [^116EcvQ9].
- **Paradoxical bronchospasm**: Rare but possible [^117Amyso].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia with repeated dosing [^117Amyso].

---

## Clinical scenarios where albuterol may be beneficial

Albuterol is most likely to help when **wheeze or bronchospasm** is present on exam or when the patient has a history of reactive airway disease (asthma, COPD) or irritant exposure, as bronchospasm is more likely in these settings [^113gszPY].

---

## Clinical scenarios where albuterol may not be beneficial

Albuterol is unlikely to help and may be omitted when **no wheeze or bronchospasm** is present, when the presentation is purely atelectasis or edema without airway obstruction, or when the patient has a history of adverse reactions to beta-agonists.

---

## Alternative or adjunctive therapies

Supportive care remains the cornerstone, including **oxygen therapy** to maintain SpO₂ ≥ 94% [^117SwWqh], continuous pulse oximetry and frequent respiratory assessments, and consideration of noninvasive ventilation (CPAP/BiPAP) for moderate distress [^113Bdw7u]. Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended without evidence of bronchospasm or inflammatory airway disease.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Patients receiving albuterol should be monitored for **heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and clinical improvement**. Observe for 4–6 hours after mild distress to ensure stability before discharge, and advise patients to return if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop [^113urg8V].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Albuterol recommended?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild distress with wheeze or bronchospasm | Yes | Relieves bronchospasm and improves ventilation |
| Mild distress without wheeze or bronchospasm | No | Unlikely to benefit; supportive care only |
| History of reactive airway disease | Yes | Higher likelihood of bronchospasm |
| Adverse reaction to beta-agonists | No | Avoid albuterol |

---

Albuterol is **reasonable for mild distress after submersion** when wheeze or bronchospasm is present, but it is not routinely indicated otherwise. Use clinical judgment, monitor for response, and prioritize oxygen and supportive care.

They all had confirmed gas exposure and suffered respiratory symptoms including chest tightness, breathlessness, cough and wheezing. When presented with an albuterol challenge, there was an increased airway responsiveness to albuterol in subjects that had been exposed to chemical warfare agents compared to 15 normal controls. In vitro, in canine smooth muscle tissue, albuterol produced a partial relaxation of tension induced by the nerve agent soman but relaxation was not sustained. B. Link to clinical studies Studies involving multiple populations RATIONALE: β 2-Adrenergic receptor agonists accelerate resolution of pulmonary edema in experimental and clinical studies. OBJECTIVES: This clinical trial was designed to test the hypothesis that an aerosolized β 2-agonist, albuterol, would improve clinical outcomes in patients with acute lung injury.

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which 282 patients with ALI receiving mechanical ventilation were randomized to receive aerosolized albuterol or saline placebo every 4 hours for up to 10 days. Data will be recorded by participating ICUs until hospital discharge, and all surviving patients will be followed up by post at six and twelve months post randomization. Background: Intravenous salbutamol reduces lung water in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Experimental data show that it also reduces pulmonary neutrophil accumulation or activation and inflammation in ARDS. Aim: To investigate the effects of salbutamol on neutrophil function. Intra-alveolar salmeterol 10 M attenuated the degree of pulmonary edema following acid-induced lung injury.

Extravascular lung water increased to only 180 ± 30 microL with salmeterol treatment, compared with 296 ± 65 microL in saline-treated rats 4 hrs after acid injury. This decrease in lung water was accompanied by a 2. 4-fold increase in the rate of alveolar fluid clearance at 4 hrs in the salmeterol-treated group. Lung endothelial permeability, expressed as extravascular plasma equivalents, was reduced to 64 ± 9 microL with salmeterol compared with 119 ± 51 microL in saline-treated rats 4 hrs after acid injury.

### Management of phosgene-induced acute lung injury [^114WXt7z]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Phosgene is a substance of immense importance in the chemical industry. Because of its widespread industrial use, there is potential for small-scale exposures within the workplace, large-scale accidental release, or even deliberate release into a built-up area.

Objective

This review aims to examine all published studies concerning potential treatments for phosgene-induced acute lung injury and incorporate them into up-to-date clinical guidance. In addition, it aims to contrast the approaches when dealing with small numbers of patients known to be exposed (possibly with dose information) with the presentation of a large and heterogeneous population of casualties following a significant industrial accident or deliberate release; no published guidelines have specifically addressed this second problem.

Methods

PubMed and Embase were searched for all available years till April 2010 and 584 papers were identified and considered.

Experimental Studies

Because of the nature of the injury, there have been no human trials of patients exposed to phosgene. Multiple small and large animal studies have been performed to examine potential treatments of phosgene-induced acute lung injury, but many of these used isolated organ models, pretreatment regimens, or clinically improbable doses. Recent studies in large animals using both realistic time frames and dosing regimens have improved our knowledge, but clinical guidance remains based on incomplete data. Management of a small-scale, confirmed exposure. In the circumstance of a small-scale, confirmed industrial release where a few individuals are exposed and present rapidly, an intravenous bolus of high-dose corticosteroid (e.g., methylprednisolone 1 g) should be considered, although there are no experimental data to support this recommendation. The evidence is that there is no benefit from nebulized steroid even when administered 1 h after exposure, or methylprednisolone if administered intravenously ≥ 6 h after exposure. Consideration should also be given to administration of nebulized acetylcysteine 1–2 g, though there is no substantive evidence of benefit outside a small animal, isolated lung model and there is a possibility of adverse effects. If the oxygen saturation falls below 94%, patients should receive the lowest concentration of supplemental oxygen to maintain their SaO₂ in the normal range. Once patients require oxygen, nebulized β-agonists [e.g., salbutamol (albuterol) 5 mg by nebulizer every 4 h] may reduce lung inflammation if administered within 1 h of exposure. Elective intubation should be considered early using an ARDSnet protective ventilation strategy. Management of a large-scale, non-confirmed exposure. In the circumstances of a large-scale industrial or urban release, not all patients presenting will have been exposed and health services are likely to be highly stretched. In this situation, patients should not be treated immediately as there is no evidence that delaying therapy causes harm, rather they should be rested and observed with regular physical examination and measurement of peripheral oxygen saturations. Once a patient's oxygen saturation falls below 94%, treatment with the lowest concentration of oxygen required to maintain their oxygen saturations in the normal range should be started. Once oxygen has been started, nebulized β-agonists [e.g., salbutamol (albuterol) 5 mg by nebulizer every 4 h] may reduce lung inflammation if administered within 1 h of exposure, though delayed administration which is likely following a large-scale release has not been tested formally. There is no benefit from nebulized steroid even when administered 1 h after exposure, or high-dose corticosteroid if administered intravenously ≥ 6 h after exposure. Although there are no experimental data to support this recommendation, an intravenous bolus of high-dose corticosteroid (e.g., methylprednisolone 1 g) may be considered if presentation is < 6 h and resources allow. Depending on the numbers of casualties presenting, invasive ventilation should be initiated either electively once symptoms present (especially where there is a short latent period, indicating likelihood of more significant injury), or delayed until required. Ventilation should be with high positive end expiratory pressure, ARDSnet recommended ventilation.

Conclusions

The mechanisms underlying the phosgene-induced acute lung injury are not well understood. Future experimental work should ensure that potential treatments are tested in a large animal model using realistic dosing regimens and clinically relevant timings, such as those that might be found in a mass casualty situation.

Drowning — definitions and classification specify that the World Health Organization definition of drowning is "the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid". Drowning is further defined as non-fatal drowning (patients rescued from drowning) and fatal drowning (any death, acutely or subacutely, resulting from drowning). Submersion refers to situations in which the patient's airway is underwater, whereas immersion refers to situations in which the patient's body is in water, but the patient's airway remains out of the water.

Key messages

- 	β2 agonists have several properties that could be beneficial in ALI, including improving respiratory mechanics, reducing inflammation and increasing edema clearance.

- 	To date there have been no published studies examining the effect of β2 agonists on outcome from ALI.

- 	This retrospective study demonstrates an improved outcome from ALI with higher doses (average 3.72 mg/day) of inhaled salbutamol.

- 	A prospective randomized controlled trial examining the effect of β2 agonists on outcome from acute lung injury is required.

### Submersion [^114MH7yf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Many thousands of individuals are submersion victims each year in the United States. The majority of victims are young, previously healthy people. There have been no recent breakthroughs in medical technology or treatment modalities that have improved survival rates for submersion victims. The key to their successful outcome and return to productive, full lives is aggressive resuscitation by emergency physicians and prehospital care providers. Most submersion incidents should never take place. Emergency physicians can take the lead in public education and prevention.

### Inhaled β-2 agonist salbutamol and acute lung injury: an association with improvement in acute lung injury [^115w5ScT]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This preliminary retrospective study demonstrates for the first time that the aerosolized β2 agonist salbutamol at a dose greater than 2.2 mg/day (average dose of 3.72 mg/day) given to mechanically ventilated patients with ALI was associated with more days alive and free of ALI. This possible beneficial association requires prospective studies, such as a rigorous randomized controlled trial, to determine whether inhaled β2 agonists improve relevant outcomes of ALI.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2024 update [^116JVreS]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Terminology — drowning definitions and modifiers are clarified: Drowning is defined as "the process of experiencing respiratory impairment due to submersion or immersion in liquid", and the standard definition "allows for only 3 outcomes after drowning: nonfatal drowning (with or without morbidity) and fatal drowning". For clarity of use, "Immersion refers to a situation in which the airway is above water, whereas "submersion" refers to a situation in which the airway is underwater", with immersion in cold water potentially leading to hypothermia and "submersion at any water temperature may lead to drowning". The guideline states "The following modifiers should not be used in association with drowning: near, wet, dry, active, passive, saltwater, freshwater, or secondary", because "none of these modifiers is valid because the final common pathway is hypoxemia and eventual cardiopulmonary arrest".

Drowning — prehospital care guideline actions include monitoring, oxygenation thresholds, airway strategies, circulatory access, and diving-specific considerations. Monitor vital signs, including oxygen saturations. If O₂ saturations are less than 92%, administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation, and consider positive pressure ventilation in patients with signs or symptoms of respiratory difficulty. Consider hypothermia and treat per Hypothermia/Cold Exposure Guideline. If the victim was involved in underwater diving and uncertainty exists regarding therapy, consider contacting medical direction and discussing need for hyperbaric treatment, including discussion regarding submersion time, greatest depth achieved, ascent rate, and gas mix. Establish IV access and give fluid bolus as indicated. Advanced airway management as indicated; consider CPAP in awake patients with respiratory distress. Cardiac monitor.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2019 update [^1132xUmu]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Drowning terminology and definitions — The standard definition for drowning is "the process of experiencing respiratory impairment due to submersion or immersion in liquid", and the standard definition allows for only 3 outcomes after drowning: 1) morbidity; 2) no morbidity; and 3) mortality. Respiratory impairment occurs as the person's airway goes below the surface of the liquid (submersion) or water splashes over the face (immersion), and immersion refers to situations in which airways are above water whereas submersion refers to situations in which airways are under water. Thus immersion (in cold water) may lead to hypothermia, and submersion at any water temperature may lead to drowning. The following modifiers should not be used in association with drowning: near, wet, dry, active, passive, saltwater, freshwater, or secondary, because sufficient data related to human drowning pathophysiology show that none of these modifiers is valid as the final common pathway is hypoxemia and eventual cardiopulmonary arrest.

### Drowning [^115Kg43m]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Drowning is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide, and it is estimated that 90% of drownings are preventable. Drowning is defined as "the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid". Emergency providers should focus on airway management and rapid delivery of oxygen to interrupt the drowning process and improve patient outcomes. Patients with minimal or no symptoms do not require any specific diagnostic workup, aside from physical examination and 4 to 6 hours of observation prior to discharge. Patients with more severe symptoms may present with rales and foamy secretions, and should be managed with high-concentration oxygen and positive airway pressure.

Uncertainties and research priorities

There are several unanswered questions about NMBAs in ARDS. Although their presumed mechanism of action is through the reduction of ventilator-induced lung injury by decreasing ventilator dyssynchrony, it remains unknown whether NMBAs might also be of benefit in sedated patients who are already fully passively ventilated. It is also unclear if there is a dose–response relationship across the spectrum of passive breathing to strong or dyssynchronous efforts. Some level of spontaneous breathing may be important to prevent diaphragmatic atrophy, whereas too much respiratory effort may cause lung and diaphragm injury; accordingly, NMBAs may have a variable impact on patients. Further research efforts should also focus on answering questions about NMBA agent selection, as well as the impact of the timing of initiation (i.e. early vs. late, immediately after meeting criteria vs. after a period of stabilization), dosing (i.e. partial blockade vs. full blockade, intermittent vs. continuous dosing), and duration. Finally, longitudinal data are needed to understand the impact of NMBAs on long-term outcomes.

Question 4: Should Patients with ARDS Receive Higher Compared with Lower PEEP, with or without LRMs?

Recommendation

We suggest using higher PEEP without LRMs rather than lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low-moderate certainty). We recommend against using prolonged (PEEP ⩾35 cm H₂O for > 60 s) LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).

Background

Higher PEEP can facilitate alveolar recruitment and prevent cyclic opening/closing injury, which may in turn improve gas exchange by decreasing intrapulmonary shunting and reduce lung stress. However, PEEP can also cause injurious overdistension in aerated lung and hemodynamic compromise via increased right ventricular afterload and decreased venous return. The net balance of benefit to harm is reliant on the proportion of recruitment to overdistension in an individual patient. The 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline previously issued conditional recommendations suggesting higher versus lower PEEP and the use of LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Since that time, several large RCTs evaluating various PEEP strategies have been published. Some have included cointerventions of prolonged LRMs, defined as incremental increases in PEEP to achieve airway pressures ⩾35 cm H 2 O for ⩾60 seconds. Thus, it was important to incorporate these most recent studies into an updated recommendation.

### Do not drown the patient: appropriate fluid management in critical illness [^115DVApg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Administering intravenous fluids to support the circulation in critically ill patients has been a mainstay of emergency medicine and critical care for decades, especially (but not exclusively) in patients with distributive or hypovolemic shock. However, in recent years, this automatic use of large fluid volumes is beginning to be questioned. Analysis from several large trials in severe sepsis and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome have shown independent links between volumes of fluid administered and outcome; conservative fluid strategies have also been associated with lower mortality in trauma patients. In addition, it is becoming ever more clear that central venous pressure, which is often used to guide fluid administration, is a completely unreliable parameter of volume status or fluid responsiveness. Furthermore, 2 recently published large multicenter trials (ARISE and ProCESS) have discredited the "early goal-directed therapy" approach, which used prespecified targets of central venous pressure and venous saturation to guide fluid and vasopressor administration. This article discusses the risks of "iatrogenic submersion" and strategies to avoid this risk while still giving our patients the fluids they need. The key lies in combining good clinical judgement, awareness of the potential harm from excessive fluid use, restraint in reflexive administration of fluids, and use of data from sophisticated monitoring tools such as echocardiography and transpulmonary thermodilution. Use of smaller volumes to perform fluid challenges, monitoring of extravascular lung water, earlier use of norepinephrine, and other strategies can help further reduce morbidity and mortality from severe sepsis.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2019 update [^113zzX8u]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Drowning — cessation of rescue and resuscitation: Based primarily on retrospective studies, submersion times of > 10 min appear to correlate with increased mortality or survival with severe neurologic dysfunction. Based on resources, it might be reasonable to cease rescue and resuscitation efforts when there is a known submersion time of greater than 30 min in water > 6°C (43°F), or greater than 90 min in water < 6°C (43°F), or after 25 min of continuous cardiopulmonary resuscitation. If at any point during search and rescue efforts the safety of the rescue team becomes threatened, rescue efforts should be ceased, and if resources are available and recovery team safety is maintained, body recovery efforts may continue beyond the search and rescue period with the understanding that resuscitation attempts will likely be futile. Recommendation Grade: 1C.

### Treatment of the lung injury of drowning: a systematic review [^11786U6z]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

There is a dire lack of evidence informing the management of the drowning patient. This makes any recommendations regarding best practice impossible other than to follow local guidelines and clinical judgement. There is an urgent need for high-quality research on the treatment of drowning. Duration of immersion is a critical factor in patient prognosis, and as such, prevention is currently the most effective strategy in reducing drowning mortality.

### Prevention of drowning [^1152uiaa]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric drowning — bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and transport guidance emphasizes that immediate resuscitation at the submersion site, even before the arrival of emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, is the most effective means to improve outcomes in the event of a drowning incident. Prompt initiation of bystander CPR, with a focus on airway and rescue breathing before compressions and activation of prehospital advanced cardiac life support for the pediatric submersion victim, have the greatest impact on survival and prognosis. Rescue and resuscitation of a drowning victim must occur within minutes to save lives and reduce morbidity in nonfatal drownings. Current guidelines recommend that drowning victims who require any form of resuscitation (including only rescue breaths) be transported to the emergency department for evaluation and monitoring, even if they appear alert with effective cardiopulmonary function at the scene.

### Drug study of albuterol to treat acute lung injury (ALTA) [^112RzoVG]. ClinicalTrials (2007). Low credibility.

Aerosolized beta-2 agonist therapy is anticipated to diminish the formation of lung edema, enhance clearance of lung edema and decrease pulmonary inflammation in patients with acute lung injury. Because beta-2 agonists have been shown to reduce permeability induced lung injury, it is anticipated that the severity of lung injury will be reduced by aerosolized beta-2 agonist therapy. The therapy may work by enhancing resolution of pulmonary edema by upregulating alveolar epithelial fluid transport mechanisms that will in turn enhance the clearance of alveolar edema. A reduction in the severity of lung injury and the quantity of alveolar edema should result in earlier extubation and more ventilator free days, improved pulmonary oxygen uptake, and improved lung compliance. Study design: phase II/III prospective, randomized double-blind, placebo controlled trial.
- In Phase II, patients will be treated with aerosolized albuterol 5. 0 mg vs.

normal saline administered every 4 hours for 10 days following randomization or until 24 hours following extubation, whichever occurs first. The protocol stipulates that the 5. 0 mg dose will be reduced to
2. 5 mg if patients exceed defined heart rate limits.
- In Phase III, the 5. 0 mg dose will be used unless there is evidence that this dose has an unacceptable safety profile or dose reductions for tachycardia occur in a large fraction of patients. In that case, a lower dose of 2. 5 mg will be used.
- Patients will be followed for 90 days or until discharge from the hospital to home with unassisted breathing whichever occurs first.

### Pharmacological agents for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^115EVqMD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition caused by direct or indirect injury to the lungs. Despite improvements in clinical management (for example, lung protection strategies), mortality in this patient group is at approximately 40%. This is an update of a previous version of this review, last published in 2004.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacological agents in adults with ARDS on mortality, mechanical ventilation, and fitness to return to work at 12 months.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL on 10 December 2018. We searched clinical trials registers and grey literature, and handsearched reference lists of included studies and related reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pharmacological agents with control (placebo or standard therapy) to treat adults with established ARDS. We excluded trials of nitric oxide, inhaled prostacyclins, partial liquid ventilation, neuromuscular blocking agents, fluid and nutritional interventions and medical oxygen. We excluded studies published earlier than 2000, because of changes to lung protection strategies for people with ARDS since this date.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

We included 48 RCTs with 6299 participants who had ARDS; two included only participants with mild ARDS (also called acute lung injury). Most studies included causes of ARDS that were both direct and indirect injuries. We noted differences between studies, for example the time of administration or the size of dose, and because of unclear reporting we were uncertain whether all studies had used equivalent lung protection strategies. We included five types of agents as the primary comparisons in the review: corticosteroids, surfactants, N-acetylcysteine, statins, and beta-agonists. We included 15 additional agents (sivelestat, mesenchymal stem cells, ulinastatin, anisodimine, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, recombinant human ACE2 (palifermin), AP301, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), levosimendan, prostacyclins, lisofylline, ketaconazole, nitroglycerins, L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (OTZ), and penehyclidine hydrochloride). We used GRADE to downgrade outcomes for imprecision (because of few studies and few participants), for study limitations (e.g. high risks of bias) and for inconsistency (e.g. differences between study data). Corticosteroids versus placebo or standard therapyCorticosteroids may reduce all-cause mortality within three months by 86 per 1000 patients (with as many as 161 fewer to 19 more deaths); however, the 95% confidence interval (CI) includes the possibility of both increased and reduced deaths (risk ratio (RR) 0.77, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.05; 6 studies, 574 participants; low-certainty evidence). Due to the very low-certainty evidence, we are uncertain whether corticosteroids make little or no difference to late all-cause mortality (later than three months) (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.52; 1 study, 180 participants), or to the duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference (MD) -4.30, 95% CI -9.72 to 1.12; 3 studies, 277 participants). We found that ventilator-free days up to day 28 (VFD) may be improved with corticosteroids (MD 4.09, 95% CI 1.74 to 6.44; 4 studies, 494 participants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported adverse events leading to discontinuation of study medication, or fitness to return to work at 12 months (FTR). Surfactants versus placebo or standard therapyWe are uncertain whether surfactants make little or no difference to early mortality (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.29; 9 studies, 1338 participants), or whether they reduce late all-cause mortality (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.61; 1 study, 418 participants). Similarly, we are uncertain whether surfactants reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (MD -2.50, 95% CI -4.95 to -0.05; 1 study, 16 participants), make little or no difference to VFD (MD -0.39, 95% CI -2.49 to 1.72; 2 studies, 344 participants), or to adverse events leading to discontinuation of study medication (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.44; 2 studies, 88 participants). We are uncertain of these effects because we assessed them as very low-certainty. No studies reported FTR.N-aceytylcysteine versus placeboWe are uncertain whether N-acetylcysteine makes little or no difference to early mortality, because we assessed this as very low-certainty evidence (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.30; 1 study, 36 participants). No studies reported late all-cause mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, VFD, adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation, or FTR. Statins versus placeboStatins probably make little or no difference to early mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.26; 3 studies, 1344 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or to VFD (MD 0.40, 95% CI -0.71 to 1.52; 3 studies, 1342 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Statins may make little or no difference to duration of mechanical ventilation (MD 2.70, 95% CI -3.55 to 8.95; 1 study, 60 participants; low-certainty evidence). We could not include data for adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation in one study because it was unclearly reported. No studies reported late all-cause mortality or FTR. Beta-agonists versus placebo controlBeta-blockers probably slightly increase early mortality by 40 per 1000 patients (with as many as 119 more or 25 fewer deaths); however, the 95% CI includes the possibility of an increase as well as a reduction in mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.42; 3 studies, 646 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Due to the very low-certainty evidence, we are uncertain whether beta-agonists increase VFD (MD -2.20, 95% CI -3.68 to -0.71; 3 studies, 646 participants), or make little or no difference to adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation (one study reported little or no difference between groups, and one study reported more events in the beta-agonist group). No studies reported late all-cause mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or FTR.

Authors' Conclusions

We found insufficient evidence to determine with certainty whether corticosteroids, surfactants, N-acetylcysteine, statins, or beta-agonists were effective at reducing mortality in people with ARDS, or duration of mechanical ventilation, or increasing ventilator-free days. Three studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of this review. As the potential long-term consequences of ARDS are important to survivors, future research should incorporate a longer follow-up to measure the impacts on quality of life.

In this article we review recent advances made in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of inhalation injury. Historically, the diagnosis of inhalation injury has relied on nonspecific clinical exam findings and bronchoscopic evidence. The development of a grading system and the use of modalities such as chest computed tomography may allow for a more nuanced evaluation of inhalation injury and enhanced ability to prognosticate. Supportive respiratory care remains essential in managing inhalation injury. Adjuncts still lacking definitive evidence of efficacy include bronchodilators, mucolytic agents, inhaled anticoagulants, nonconventional ventilator modes, prone positioning, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Recent research focusing on molecular mechanisms involved in inhalation injury has increased the number of potential therapies.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^116K3kga]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Are inhaled beta-2 agonists effective in the treatment of anaphylaxis?

Updated recommendation

1 Beta-2 agonists (such as salbutamol) may be useful as an adjunct treatment for lower respiratory symptoms caused by anaphylaxis, following initial treatment with IM adrenaline (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).
2 In the presence of persisting respiratory symptoms in anaphylaxis, beta-2 agonists (whether inhaled or parenteral) should not be used as an alternative to further parenteral treatment with adrenaline (strong recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

(adapted from RCUK 2008, WAO 2011/2020, EAACI 2014 and ASCIA 2020 guidelines, with greater emphasis on using bronchodilators as an adjunct rather than a replacement for adrenaline)

Rationale

Beta-2 agonists are widely used in clinical practice and feature in most guidelines as a second-line treatment option for anaphylaxis. There is limited evidence to support the use of inhaled beta-2 agonists in the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis and evidence is extrapolated from their use to treat acute asthma. International guidelines agree that bronchodilators may be helpful for persisting wheeze, but caution that they do not prevent or relieve upper airway obstruction, hypotension or shock, and should therefore be used as adjunct treatments.,

In patients with mild to moderate respiratory symptoms, beta-2 agonists can be administered by repeated activations of a Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) via an appropriate large volume spacer where the patient does not require supplementary oxygen. There are insufficient data to make a recommendation over the use of MDIs with spacers in acute severe or life-threatening respiratory symptoms; in these patients, beta-2 agonists should be administered by oxygen-driven nebuliser. There are anecdotal reports of anaphylaxis initially misdiagnosed as severe asthma, which did not respond to parenteral bronchodilator therapy but did respond to adrenaline. For this reason, parenteral beta-2 agonists (such as intravenous salbutamol) must not be used in preference to adrenaline for acute anaphylaxis. This recommendation is made on the basis of adrenaline (including further doses) being established as the first-line treatment of anaphylaxis.

How long should patients be observed in hospital following anaphylaxis?

Updated recommendation

We suggest a risk-stratified approach to the discharge of patients following anaphylaxis (Table 5) (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

### Treatment of the lung injury of drowning: a systematic review [^116spww7]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Drowning is a major cause of preventable death and morbidity worldwide. There are over 295,000 unintentional drowning deaths (excluding boating) per year. Ninety percent of these deaths occur in middle- and low-income countries, and half the fatalities are aged less than 25 years. Despite the modern medical literature on drowning reaching back at least as far as The Lancet in 1878, there have only recently been efforts to standardise definitions and data collection for drowning research. The majority of the published studies focus on three themes — preventative strategies such as secure pool fencing, high-risk groups such as children and factors determining clinical outcome, especially duration of immersion.

The mechanism of drowning involves aspiration of water into the lung which damages surfactant, disrupts the alveolar capillary membrane and leads to the development of alveolar oedema, resulting in a local acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like syndrome. A high proportion of drowning patients are hypoxic and have a PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio < 300 mm Hg. Treating this lung injury and reversing the hypoxia are the cornerstone of the management of drowning.

However, current ventilation guidelines for drowning patients are adapted from ARDS and as such may not reflect the needs of the drowned patient. The aim of this paper is to review the existing evidence to guide the clinician in the treatment of the lung injury and respiratory distress associated with drowning.

### Spine injury [^115iAcJU]. ACS (2022). High credibility.

Spinal cord injury-induced bradycardia — In the acute phase of spinal cord injury (SCI), sinus bradycardia is the most common dysrhythmia, cardiovascular abnormalities commonly occur at level T-6 or higher, and instability is often precipitated by tracheal stimulation (suctioning), turning, and hypoxia, with most cardiovascular changes observed from immediately after injury to 6 weeks post injury. Initial management of SCI must ensure adequate blood pressure with fluid resuscitation and the use of vasopressors with both alpha- and beta-adrenergic actions (norepinephrine). Persistent bradycardia or intermittent episodes of severe bradycardia can be treated with a beta-2 adrenergic agonist (albuterol), chronotropic agents (atropine, epinephrine, dopamine, norepinephrine) or phosphodiesterase inhibitors (aminophylline, theophylline). Rarely, patients with medication-resistant bradycardia may benefit from pacemaker insertion; however, this is associated with a 4 to 5 percent device complication rate. In a retrospective study of cervical SCI-induced bradycardia, enteral albuterol reduced the frequency of symptomatic bradycardia and resulted in less rescue therapy, and it has a rapid onset of action (30 minutes), peak plasma concentrations within 2 hours, and a duration of 4 to 6 hours with a half-life of 2.7 to 6 hours. For treatment of orthostatic hypotension, the alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist, midodrine, is recommended.

Mechanical ventilation after drowning — ARDS-based strategy — should follow acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) protocols (Recommendation Grade: 1C). This includes mechanical ventilation starting with a tidal volume of 6 to 8 mL·kg⁻¹, augmentation of respiratory rate to maintain plateau pressure < 30 mm Hg, and adjusting positive end expiratory pressure and fraction of inspired oxygen to maintain partial pressure of arterial oxygen at 55 to 80 mm Hg.

### Drowning: a review of epidemiology, pathophysiology, treatment and prevention [^114VFegF]. Resuscitation (2004). Low credibility.

Although often preventable, drowning remains a leading cause of accidental death, especially in children. New definitions classify drowning as the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion or immersion in a liquid. The key pathophysiological feature in drowning is hypoxia. Accurate neurological prognosis cannot be predicted from the initial clinical presentation, laboratory, radiological, or electrophysiological examinations. Prompt and aggressive resuscitation attempts are crucial for optimal survival. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention of drowning.

### Radiologic, neurologic and cardiopulmonary aspects of submersion injury [^114Gh5VP]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Many indices and scores are used in critical care medicine to aid management and predict risk of mortality. We report 2 cases of submersion injury and discuss the usefulness and application of common respiratory and critical care indices. The respiratory indices help better understand the pulmonary pathophysiology and characterize the severity of lung injury and ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Severe lung injury resolved after ventilation support with appropriate positive end-expiratory pressure in both cases. The 6-year-old girl survived the near-fatal submersion injury intact despite grossly abnormal initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and high Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 scores, whereas the 5-year-old boy with grossly abnormal GCS and Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 scores died despite resolution of lung injury. These cases illustrate that resuscitation should be promptly instituted at the scene to ensure optimal outcome because initial pulmonology and neurology indices may not reliably predict mortality or intact survival. The GCS score was not initially designed for prognostication. Nevertheless, 2 serial GCS scores of 3, one performed at emergency department and one at the pediatric intensive care unit, were associated with nonsurvival in our second patient.

### Part 10: adult and pediatric special circumstances of resuscitation: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^114cx9qs]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

AHA 2025 drowning — introduction and scope — states that drowning is the third leading cause of death from unintentional injury worldwide, accounting for 7% of all injury-related deaths. Drowning generally progresses from initial respiratory arrest due to submersion-related hypoxia to cardiac arrest, and pulses are difficult to accurately palpate within the recommended 10-second window; therefore, resuscitation from cardiac arrest attributable to this specific circumstance must focus on restoring breathing as much as it does circulation. These guidelines are designed for health care professionals, trained rescuers, and untrained lay rescuers resuscitating adults and children who have drowned. We have defined trained rescuer as an individual with appropriate training to perform the task discussed in a given recommendation. This is independent of the individual's occupation or ethical duty to respond. The Drowning Chain of Survival highlights a series of interventions that reduce drowning-associated mortality when put into action by trained rescuers or untrained lay rescuers.

Damage to the pulmonary parenchyma from smoke represents a second cause of inhalation injury. To date, the treatment of lung injury due to smoke has been largely supportive in nature. Patients are intubated, placed on mechanical ventilation, and maintained on support until pulmonary status improves, permanent airway access obtained, or the patient dies. Given that the insult associated with inhalation injury causes direct pulmonary damage and that the lungs have the ability of absorb drugs, the use of inhaled therapies for inhalation injury is appealing. The goal of this chapter is to describe the potential role of inhalation therapies in the treatment of smoke inhalation injury.

### The association between physiologic dead-space fraction and mortality in subjects with ARDS enrolled in a prospective multi-center clinical trial [^113GBboU]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

Background

We tested the association between pulmonary dead-space fraction (ratio of dead space to tidal volume [Vᴅ/Vᴛ]) and mortality in subjects with ARDS (Berlin definition, P(aO₂)/F(IO₂) ≤ 300 mm Hg; PEEP ≥ 5 cm H₂O) enrolled into a clinical trial incorporating lung-protective ventilation.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, multi-center study at medical-surgical ICUs in the United States. A total of 126 ALI subjects with acute lung injury were enrolled into a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled study of aerosolized albuterol. Vᴅ/Vᴛ and pulmonary mechanics were measured within 4 h of enrollment and repeated daily on study days 1 and 2 in subjects requiring arterial blood gases for clinical management.

Results

At baseline, non-survivors had a trend toward higher Vᴅ/Vᴛ compared with survivors (0.62 ± 0.11 vs 0.56 ± 0.11, respectively, P = 0.08). Differences in Vᴅ/Vᴛ between non-survivors and survivors became significant on study days 1 (0.64 ± 0.12 vs 0.55 ± 0.11, respectively, P = 0.01) and 2 (0.67 ± 0.12 vs 0.56 ± 0.11, respectively, P = 0.004). Likewise, the association between Vᴅ/Vᴛ and mortality was significant on study day 1 (odds ratio per 0.10 change in Vᴅ/Vᴛ [95% CI]: 6.84 [1.62–28.84] P = 0.01; and study day 2: 4.90 [1.28–18.73] P = 0.02) after adjusting for Vᴅ/Vᴛ, P(aO₂)/F(IO₂), oxygenation index, vasopressor use, and the primary risk for ARDS. Using a Cox proportional hazard model, Vᴅ/Vᴛ was associated with a trend toward higher mortality (HR = 4.37 [CI 0.99–19.32], P = 0.052) that became significant when the analysis was adjusted for daily oxygenation index (HR = 1.74 [95% CI 1.12–3.35] P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Markedly elevated V(D)/V(T) (≥ 0.60) in early ARDS is associated with higher mortality. Measuring V(D)/V(T) may be useful in identifying ARDS patients at increased risk of death who are enrolled into a therapeutic trial.

Ceasing water-based rescue and resuscitation efforts highlights that "the most important predictor of outcome is duration of submersion". "Available evidence shows that prognosis is poor with submersion times greater than 30 min, regardless of water temperature". While "there are also case reports of survival with good neurologic outcome despite prolonged submersion, predominantly in children aged ≤ 6 y in water < 6°C (43°F) and with use of advanced treatment modalities, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation", the evidence base notes: "A literature review of 43 cases serves as the evidence for water-based rescue". The report concludes "that there is minimal chance of neurologically intact survival with submersion time > 30 min in water > 6°C (43°F) or > 90 min in water ≤ 6°C (43°F)".

### A proposed decision-making guide for the search, rescue and resuscitation of submersion (head under) victims based on expert opinion [^116spEZX]. Resuscitation (2011). Low credibility.

There is some confusion, and consequent variation in policy, between the agencies responsible for the search, rescue and resuscitation of submersion victims regarding the likelihood of survival following a period of submersion. The aim of this work was to recommend a decision-making guide for such victims. This guidance was arrived at by a review of the relevant literature and specific case studies, and a "consensus" meeting on the topic. The factors found to be important for determining the possibility of prolonged survival underwater were: water temperature; salinity of water; duration of submersion; and age of the victim. Of these, only water temperature and duration are sufficiently clear to form the basis of guidance in this area. It is concluded that if water temperature is warmer than 6°C, survival/resuscitation is extremely unlikely if submerged longer than 30 min. If water temperature is 6°C or below, survival/resuscitation is extremely unlikely if submerged longer than 90 min.

### Prevention and treatment of drowning [^111mYSiU]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Nearly 4,000 drowning deaths occur annually in the United States, with drowning representing the most common injury-related cause of death in children one to four years of age. Drowning is a process that runs the spectrum from brief entry of liquid into the airways with subsequent clearance and only minor temporary injury, to the prolonged presence of fluid in the lungs leading to lung dysfunction, hypoxia, neurologic and cardiac abnormalities, and death. The World Health Organization has defined drowning as "the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid". Terms such as near, wet, dry, passive, active, secondary, and silent drowning should no longer be used because they are confusing and hinder proper categorization and management. The American Heart Association's Revised Utstein Drowning Form and treatment guidelines are important in guiding care, disposition, and prognosis. Prompt resuscitation at the scene after a shorter duration of submersion is associated with better outcomes. Because cardiac arrhythmias due to drowning are almost exclusively caused by hypoxia, the resuscitation order prioritizes airway and breathing before compressions. Prevention remains the best treatment. Education, swimming and water safety lessons, and proper pool fencing are the interventions with the highest level of current evidence, especially in children two to four years of age. Alcohol use during water activities dramatically increases the risk of drowning; therefore, abstinence is recommended for all participants and supervisors.

Discussion

Although significant advancements have been made in the management of ARDS, many questions remain. Several recommendations in this guideline are conditional in nature and, as such, require careful evaluation of patient and illness characteristics when considering their use. Future studies may serve to strengthen these recommendations or provide additional caveats to their implementation. Measures with more established evidence of benefit also exist, including lung protective ventilation for all patients with ARDS and prone positioning for those with severe ARDS. Although strong recommendations in favor of these measures have previously been made, translating evidence into practice has been fraught with challenges. Considerable practice variation exists in ARDS management, and evidence-based modalities remain underused. This underuse is associated with increased mortality, suggesting that there is significant opportunity to improve ARDS outcomes. To maximize these opportunities, future efforts must be made to facilitate access to readily available, granular data about ARDS management practices in real-world settings to allow for benchmarking, auditing, and continuous quality improvement. Additionally, it is crucial to understand the clinician-, systems-, and patient-level barriers to, and facilitators of, the use of evidence-based supportive care in ARDS to inform a comprehensive approach to implementation.

In addition to implementation research, there are several opportunities to address other areas of uncertainty. Much remains unknown about the impact of supportive measures used for ARDS on the long-term outcomes of survivors, an issue of vital importance to patients. There is a critical need for future clinical trials to not only consistently collect these data, but also to involve patient and family representatives to help identify and guide the selection of specific outcomes to study. There are also other modalities used in a small but significant minority of patients with ARDS, such as pulmonary vasodilators and alternative ventilator modes, for which further data are needed before meaningful recommendations can be made. Additionally, although supportive therapies are often used in combination rather than in isolation, it remains unknown whether combination treatments are synergistic. Treatment effects can also vary across individuals, a concept known as heterogeneity of treatment effect, which is an issue that may be especially relevant to ARDS. There is substantial heterogeneity in ARDS, including patient characteristics, underlying etiologies, mechanisms of injury, and degrees of severity. In light of these issues, there has been growing interest in identifying homogeneous subgroups in ARDS with potential differential responses to treatment. Although the methods for subphenotyping patients with ARDS are currently investigational, the identification of distinct subsets of patients may provide an opportunity to improve patient selection for clinical trials in the future and ultimately increase the likelihood of finding effective interventions.

Inhalational lung injury — immediate and supportive management emphasizes decontamination and respiratory support with conditional interventions. Immediate treatment is based on the general precepts of personal protective equipment for first responders, removal of victims from the area, decontamination, and supportive care. General supportive respiratory care includes warm, humidified oxygen, antitussives, and bronchodilators. Endotracheal intubation and low tidal volume mechanical ventilation may be necessary for airway compromise, copious secretions, and/or hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to ARDS. Bronchoscopic lavage may be necessary to maintain airway patency because of epithelial injury and sloughing. Inhaled or systemic corticosteroids have been used as treatments for irritant and vesicant injuries. Certain compounds, such as nerve agents and cyanide, which are not primarily lung-damaging agents, do have specific antidotes, although further optimization is needed. These management strategies have been extrapolated from treatments for other forms of airway injury or pulmonary disease, and supported in animals through anecdotal reports and small, uncontrolled studies.

### Improving asthma management: the case for mandatory inclusion of dose counters on all rescue bronchodilators [^113HW5yS]. The Journal of Asthma (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition of the airways, characterized by limited airflow and punctuated by acute symptoms related to hyperresponsiveness to a variety of "triggers", such as allergens or fumes. Chronic inflammation of the airways can lead to persistent alterations in airway structure, including sub-basement membrane fibrosis, mucus hypersecretion, injury to epithelial cells, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and angiogenesis. Asthma symptoms include wheezing, dyspnea, coughing, and chest tightness associated with broad but variable airflow obstruction in the lungs. During acute asthma events, symptom severity may range from mild to life-threatening, the latter being due to severe bronchospasm, airway edema, impaired gas exchange, and ultimately, respiratory failure.

Asthma continues to be a serious global health challenge. Worldwide, an estimated 300 million people suffer from the disease and prevalence is increasing. Of the 25 million Americans with asthma, 12 million experience acute symptoms and asthma was linked to 3447 deaths (about 9 per day) in 2007. Asthma symptoms account for about 500,000 hospitalizations and nearly 2 million emergency room visits per year in the United States.

In addition to contemporary military publications and expert recommendation, an EMBASE and MEDLINE search of English speaking journals was undertaken using the medical subject headings (MeSHs) 'blast injury' and 'lung injury'. Review articles, retrospective case series, and controlled animal modelling studies published since 2000 were evaluated.
6–11% of military casualties in recent conflicts have suffered primary blast lung injury but the incidence increases to more than 90% in terrorist attacks occurring in enclosed spaces such as trains. The majority of victims require mechanical ventilation and intensive care management. Specific therapies do not exist and treatment is supportive utilizing current best practice.

Resuscitation from drowning may begin with in-water rescue breathing when safely provided by rescuers trained in the technique and should continue with chest compressions, in keeping with basic life support guidelines, once the drowned individual and the rescuer are in a safe environment. 8, 9 A brief summary of evidence-based prevention strategies is outlined later in this article, within the context of the Drowning Chain of Survival. The recommendations in this focused update provide guidance on the application of BLS and ALS for the resuscitation of children in the special circumstance of drowning. This update is not intended to modify BLS and ALS in resuscitation circumstances other than drowning. These guidelines are not intended for other special circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. 10–12. 2, 3 and those in distress will rapidly submerge, lose consciousness, and be hidden from those not actively seeking them.

As a result, during this process of drowning, persons may not be able to verbalize or signal when they need help. 4 Drowning often involves an underestimation of the dangers of the aquatic environment or an overestimation of water competency. 11–14 Recognize distress and ask someone to call for help: Recognizing a person in distress and sending for help is a key element that ensures early activation of professional rescue and EMS. 4Recognition of drowning may be challenging because drowning persons may not be able to verbalize distress or signal for help using their arms, given the instinctive drowning response that prioritizes attempts to breathe. Provide care as needed by using BLS and ALS: Cardiac arrest following drowning comprises < 0. 5% of all rescues. 9Early BLS contributes to a good outcome and should be initiated as soon as possible.

19Once EMS arrives, initiation of ALS is appropriate if cardiac arrest has occurred. All persons requiring any level of resuscitation following drowning should be transported to the emergency department.

Controlled oxygen therapy is associated with lower mortality and better outcomes than high-concentration (100%) oxygen therapy.

Management of asthma exacerbations in primary care (adults, adolescents, children 6–11 yr). SABA doses are for albuterol. Reproduced by permission from Reference(Box 4–3). PEF = peak expiratory flow; pMDI = pressurized metered-dose inhaler; SABA = short-acting β 2 -agonist.

Arrange immediate transfer to an acute care facility if there are signs of severe exacerbation, or to intensive care, particularly if the patient is drowsy, confused, or has a silent chest. During transfer, give inhaled SABA and ipratropium bromide, controlled oxygen, and systemic corticosteroids.

Repeated administration of albuterol (up to 4–10 puffs every 20 min for the first hour) is effective for rapidly reversing airflow limitation. Avoid nebulization except for life-threatening asthma; delivery of rapid-acting β 2 -agonist via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler and spacer or via a dry-powder inhaler is as effective in patients with moderately severe acute asthma and avoids the risk of disseminating infectious particles. Current evidence does not support the routine use of intravenous β 2 -agonists in patients with severe asthma exacerbations.

2 Methods

2.1 Study Population

This was a prospective observational cohort study of patients presenting to the ED of an urban, free‐standing children's hospital that had 73641 total visits and 2997 asthma visits during the study period (July 22, 2022 to May 26, 2023). The study was approved by Nationwide Children's Hospital Institutional Review Board with a waiver of informed consent (STUDY00002591).

Eligible patients included children ages 2 to < 18 years with a previous diagnosis of asthma (defined as 2 prior episodes of wheezing requiring albuterol and/or steroids) who presented to the ED for wheezing or respiratory distress and received albuterol and/or steroids during the index visit. Children transferred from another facility, with chronic medical conditions other than asthma (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cerebral palsy, chronic respiratory failure, congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, global developmental delay, sickle cell disease, tracheomalacia), with alternative primary diagnoses (allergic reaction/anaphylaxis, anxiety, bronchiolitis, croup, foreign body aspiration, inhalation injury, intrathoracic mass, pneumothorax, vocal cord dysfunction), or presenting with asthma exacerbations that required cardiopulmonary resuscitation were excluded.
