## Question

Hyperemesis gravidarum

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hyperemesis gravidarum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining hyperemesis gravidarum and how it differs from nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Then, I should verify epidemiology and risk factors. Next, I will examine pathophysiology, followed by maternal and fetal complications. After that, I need to review diagnostic criteria and severity assessment. Then, I will appraise treatment options, including first-line, second-line, and refractory strategies, and I should double-check safety signals and guideline positions. Finally, I will consider models of care, special populations, and future directions, and I will close with a concise, clinically actionable summary.

> Let me first confirm the definition and clinical spectrum. Hyperemesis gravidarum is best understood as the severe end of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, characterized by persistent vomiting, inability to maintain normal oral intake, weight loss of at least 5% of pre-pregnancy body weight, dehydration, and ketonuria, typically arising before 16 weeks' gestation and strongly limiting daily activities, which distinguishes it from milder NVP that does not cause such functional impairment or metabolic derangements [^114LaaPe] [^112pg7iP] [^111Dz2jt].

> I should confirm the epidemiology next. HG affects roughly 0.3% to 3% of pregnancies, with most estimates clustering around 1% to 2%, and it is the most common reason for hospitalization in the first half of pregnancy. Recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is high, ranging from about 15% in registry data to over 80% in some cohorts, and risk is higher with prior HG, multiple gestation, female fetus, family history, and extremes of maternal weight [^112wxYo6] [^114LaaPe] [^1135FHCN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causation; I need to check the pathophysiology. Historically, hCG and estrogen have been implicated, but emerging evidence points to GDF-15 as a key driver, with maternal sensitivity to placental GDF-15 signaling via GFRAL-RET contributing to severity; this mechanistic insight underpins development of GDF-15 pathway antagonists such as NGM120, currently in phase 2 trials, and may explain why pre-pregnancy exposure to GDF-15 appears protective while acute high levels in pregnancy precipitate emesis [^111EeGuS] [^111ohXNP] [^11756R5g].

> Next, I should review maternal complications. Severe HG can lead to Wernicke encephalopathy from thiamine deficiency, electrolyte disturbances including hyponatremia and hypokalemia with risk of osmotic demyelination if corrected too rapidly, and liver enzyme elevations in about half of hospitalized cases, typically mild and resolving with hydration. Psychological sequelae are common, with high rates of anxiety, depression, and PTSD, and up to a quarter reporting occasional suicidal ideation, underscoring the need for mental health screening and support [^114BZGJi] [^112Hkh99] [^113M7dkU] [^114opoar] [^113TksPZ].

> I will now examine fetal and offspring effects. Observational data associate HG with increased risks of low birth weight, small-for-gestational-age infants, and preterm delivery, particularly when maternal weight gain is inadequate or when HG is diagnosed in the second trimester; however, reassuringly, perinatal mortality is not increased in large cohorts, and some analyses suggest that adverse outcomes track with severity and maternal weight trajectory rather than HG per se [^1143xGRU] [^113dP1Hs] [^111hHCtW] [^115y1oYq].

> Let me think about diagnosis and severity assessment. HG remains a clinical diagnosis of exclusion; I should confirm gestational timing, quantify weight loss, assess dehydration and ketosis, and screen for alternative causes such as gastroenteritis, UTI, hepatitis, and thyroid disease. Validated tools like PUQE-24 help track severity, and the HELP score is promising but needs further validation; importantly, I should remember that liver test abnormalities up to about 1,000 IU/L are not uncommon and usually resolve with supportive care [^111eftX9] [^113tNLUo] [^112Hkh99].

> Now, I should review first-line management. Supportive care with rehydration, correction of electrolytes, and thiamine supplementation is foundational; thiamine 100 mg daily for at least 7 days, then 50 mg daily until adequate oral intake, helps prevent Wernicke encephalopathy, and dextrose should be given with thiamine to mitigate risk. Non-oral routes for antiemetics are often necessary early on, and early treatment of NVP may prevent progression to HG, so I need to ensure timely escalation rather than watchful waiting [^114BZGJi] [^111xmwP9] [^115A42i5].

> Wait, let me verify pharmacologic sequencing. For antiemetics, I initially thought metoclopramide was universally first-line, but I should correct that: many contemporary guidelines endorse a stepwise approach starting with doxylamine-pyridoxine for NVP, then adding agents like metoclopramide, promethazine, or ondansetron as needed; metoclopramide is effective but should be limited to short courses due to extrapyramidal risks, and ondansetron is widely used with reassuring safety data despite a small signal for orofacial clefts that translates to a very low absolute risk; I should counsel patients and individualize decisions, especially in the first trimester [^115A42i5] [^117URK8X] [^113jeLmk].

> I should double-check corticosteroid positioning. Corticosteroids are reserved for refractory cases after failure of standard antiemetics; evidence is mixed, with some studies and reviews suggesting reduced readmissions while others show no clear benefit, and there is a small but real risk of oral clefts with first-trimester exposure, so if used, methylprednisolone 48 mg daily for 3 days with a 2-week taper and total duration under 6 weeks is a commonly cited regimen, ideally avoided before 10 weeks when possible [^112XCuda] [^114BZGJi] [^115AWg4x].

> But wait, what if standard therapy fails? I need to consider alternatives. Gabapentin has RCT-level evidence showing a 52% greater reduction in nausea and vomiting versus ondansetron or metoclopramide in refractory HG, with improved oral intake and satisfaction; mirtazapine and olanzapine are reasonable off-label options in select cases, and for nutrition, enteral feeding via NG or ND tubes is preferred over PICC lines due to substantially higher complication rates with PICCs, including thrombosis and sepsis, so I should avoid PICCs unless enteral access is not feasible [^114CbVmx] [^114hDmGn] [^111wHdKn] [^115xWKXv].

> Next, I should review models of care. Outpatient day-case units and ED clinical decision units can reduce inpatient admissions and length of stay without compromising outcomes, and dedicated HG clinics with multidisciplinary input from obstetrics, midwifery, dietetics, and mental health improve coordination and patient experience; digital health supports and telemedicine can extend access, though high-quality comparative effectiveness data remain limited [^114XnajT] [^1138BejN] [^112toDK9].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In multiple gestation or trophoblastic disease, the risk of HG is higher and vigilance for complications is warranted; in patients with type 1 diabetes, HG complicates glycemic management and may necessitate intensive multidisciplinary care; and in those with prolonged vomiting, I should proactively screen for thiamine deficiency and consider empiric thiamine even before lab confirmation if neurological symptoms emerge [^1135FHCN] [^115GGBLT] [^116vNiN8].

> Let me reconsider the future directions. GDF-15 targeted therapies are the most promising disease-modifying approach on the horizon, and standardization of definitions and outcomes via the Windsor definition and core outcome sets should improve trial comparability; nonetheless, I should emphasize that current evidence for many interventions remains low to very low quality, reinforcing the need for larger, well-designed RCTs and pragmatic implementation studies [^111EeGuS] [^115qYryn] [^1158rPHw].

> In summary, I should confirm that HG is a severe, potentially life-threatening condition requiring prompt recognition, exclusion of alternative diagnoses, aggressive supportive care, and stepwise pharmacotherapy with attention to mental health and nutrition. Early intervention, avoidance of delays, and coordinated multidisciplinary care mitigate maternal and fetal risks, and clinicians should not withhold effective antiemetics due to unfounded safety fears when benefits outweigh risks in shared decision-making [^114LaaPe] [^112TkMDE] [^115A42i5].

Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, defined by **persistent vomiting, weight loss ≥ 5% of pre-pregnancy weight, dehydration, and ketonuria** [^111Dz2jt] [^112pg7iP]. It affects 0.3–2% of pregnancies and is the most common cause of first-trimester hospitalization [^114LaaPe] [^115y1oYq]. HG is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, with **supportive care as the cornerstone**: rehydration, electrolyte correction, thiamine to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy, and antiemetics such as metoclopramide, ondansetron, or promethazine [^114BZGJi] [^112Hkh99]. Corticosteroids are reserved for refractory cases after 10 weeks due to cleft risk, and enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral when needed [^112XCuda] [^111xmwP9]. HG increases risks of preterm birth, low birth weight, and maternal complications, so **early, multidisciplinary care is essential** [^111hHCtW] [^113dP1Hs].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

HG is defined by **severe nausea and vomiting** that causes weight loss ≥ 5% of pre-pregnancy weight, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and ketonuria [^111Dz2jt] [^112pg7iP]. The diagnosis is clinical and one of exclusion, requiring assessment of severity and complications [^113tNLUo].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

HG occurs in **0.3–2% of pregnancies**, with higher incidence in Western countries [^112wxYo6] [^115y1oYq]. Risk factors include:

- **Previous HG**: strongest predictor; recurrence 15–89% [^112wxYo6].
- **Family history**: maternal or sibling HG increases risk [^1135FHCN].
- **Multiple gestation**: increased placental mass raises risk [^1135FHCN].
- **Female fetus**: higher incidence observed [^112wxYo6].
- **Younger maternal age and extremes of BMI**: associated with higher risk [^112wxYo6].

---

## Pathophysiology

The exact cause is **multifactorial**; proposed mechanisms include:

- **Hormonal**: elevated hCG, estrogen, and progesterone contribute to nausea and vomiting [^115DEyyn].
- **Genetic**: variants in GDF-15 and its receptor are implicated in HG susceptibility [^111EeGuS] [^11756R5g].
- **Gastrointestinal**: delayed gastric emptying and altered motility may play a role [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and complications

HG typically presents in the **first trimester** with persistent vomiting, weight loss, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia), and ketonuria [^111Dz2jt]. Severe complications include Wernicke encephalopathy, renal failure, and hepatic injury [^notfound]. Fetal risks include preterm birth, low birth weight, and small-for-gestational-age infants [^111hHCtW] [^113dP1Hs].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is clinical, supported by:

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function, thyroid function, and urinalysis for ketones [^113xAQU9].
- **Imaging**: ultrasound to confirm intrauterine pregnancy and exclude multiple gestation or molar pregnancy [^notfound].
- **Severity assessment**: PUQE-24 score to quantify symptom severity and guide management [^111eftX9].

---

## Management strategies

### Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological care includes **dietary modifications** — small, frequent, low-fat meals; avoidance of triggers — and **psychological support** with counseling and support groups to address mental health impacts [^113M7dkU].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Metoclopramide | First-line antiemetic | Safe; monitor for extrapyramidal effects [^117URK8X] |
| Ondansetron | Second-line antiemetic | Effective; minimal fetal risk [^11341ihX] |
| Promethazine | Alternative antiemetic | Sedation common [^1158rPHw] |
| Corticosteroids | Refractory cases after 10 weeks | Short course; cleft risk if used earlier [^112XCuda] |
| Thiamine | Prevent Wernicke encephalopathy | 100 mg daily for 7 days, then 50 mg daily [^114BZGJi] |

---

### Nutritional support

Enteral nutrition via nasogastric or nasoduodenal tubes is **preferred** when oral intake is inadequate; parenteral nutrition is reserved for cases where enteral feeding is not feasible due to higher complication rates [^111xmwP9] [^115dsuKU].

---

## Impact on maternal and fetal outcomes

HG is associated with **significant maternal morbidity**, including electrolyte disturbances, nutritional deficiencies, and psychological distress [^113M7dkU]. Fetal risks include preterm birth, low birth weight, and small-for-gestational-age infants, particularly with severe or prolonged HG [^111hHCtW] [^113dP1Hs].

---

## Current research and future directions

Recent advances implicate **GDF-15** in HG pathogenesis, supporting targeted therapies such as GDF-15 receptor antagonists [^111EeGuS] [^11756R5g]. Standardization of diagnostic criteria and outcome measures aims to improve research quality and clinical care [^115qYryn].

---

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe, potentially life-threatening condition requiring **early recognition, supportive care, and targeted pharmacologic therapy**. Multidisciplinary management and patient education are essential to optimize outcomes and reduce the burden of disease.

Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy affecting around 1%-3% of pregnancies worldwide and is the most common reason for hospital admission in early pregnancy. HG can have lasting consequences for both pregnant individuals and their offspring. Current best-practice management includes symptomatic treatment with anti-emetic pharmacological treatment, rehydration if needed, and psychological support. There is a lack of high-quality evidence on treatment for HG. Future research should focus on understanding the cause, developing effective treatment, and so limiting the burden of disease on patients and healthcare systems.

1 INTRODUCTION

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) is considered a normal symptom of pregnancy. Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), in contrast to normal NVP, is a rare and debilitating disorder of pregnancy, defined by the Windsor definition as nausea and vomiting, at least one of which is severe, starting in early pregnancy (before 16 weeks gestational age), and which causes an inability to eat and/or drink normally and strongly limits daily living activities.HG has important antenatal and postnatal consequences, some of which are long‐lasting, for both parent and child. Currently, evidence on treatment options is limited: the Cochrane review, including all trials on HG treatment, included just 2045 participants, of whom 931 had been enrolled in pharmacological trials, and the included studies were of low methodological quality. Treatment is, at present, aimed at symptom reduction, but emerging knowledge on the etiological pathways can open new avenues of management. Better recognition and treatment of HG have the potential to amend HG's detrimental effects on maternal, perinatal, and long‐term outcomes.

The aim of this narrative review is to highlight what is currently known of HG and provide an overview of consequences of the disease and best‐practice management, highlight current research, and inform future research.

Standardisation of care

The variation in treatment practices and costs across different studies highlights the need for standardised care protocols. Implementing consistent guidelines, which can help reduce unnecessary hospital admissions, improve timely care and reduce associated costs, are important factors in providing effective and cost-effective care. The included studies demonstrated that costs related to NVP and HG escalate as the severity of the disease increases (n = 3 studies). Evidence from another randomised trial indicated that early intervention and treatment have the potential to mitigate the severity of symptoms. Consequently, there is an implication that early intervention may yield cost benefits.

Investigation of the effectiveness of early intervention of treatments and models of care are important, and should include the role of optimal and early management in preventing the progression of NVP and HG. Studies exploring the cost effectiveness of the management of NVP and HG in various models of maternity care in the review were both from the UK. Further research is required to investigate the implementation of these specialised units in an Australian context. Currently, women may not encounter maternity services until 12–16 weeks' gestation, by which time they may have significantly advanced illness. Prior to this, women with NVP/HG are often managed in the general patient population (through emergency departments and/or general practice). Providing earlier specialised pregnancy care with midwives and obstetricians, with specialised knowledge, may be highly effective in managing women's symptoms and complications of illness.

The extent of clinician understanding of care requirements, and adherence to HG guidelines, including education and training needs, is also essential to understand for early and effective treatment. Investing in preventative measures and early interventions can potentially reduce the severity of symptoms and associated costs. This includes knowledge translation strategies for educating healthcare providers and patients about early signs and effective management strategies using evidence-based guidelines for recommended care.

Further research is warranted to explore the relationship between early treatment, including appropriate access to specialised maternity services, and the potential cost benefits. Additionally, addressing issues associated with differences in research methodology and consistency in reporting common outcomes across health economic studies would make comparisons between studies and their implementation more feasible. Further research is needed with more consistent methodological approaches and use of agreed, common outcome measures to facilitate meaningful data synthesis and enable more robust analysis, interpretation and implementation of findings.

Background

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy affecting 0.3% to 1.0% of pregnancies, and is one of the most common indications for hospitalization during pregnancy. While a previous Cochrane review examined interventions for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, there has not yet been a review examining the interventions for the more severe condition of hyperemesis gravidarum.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety, of all interventions for hyperemesis gravidarum in pregnancy up to 20 weeks' gestation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field's Trials Register (20 December 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of any intervention for hyperemesis gravidarum. Quasi-randomized trials and trials using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion. We excluded trials on nausea and vomiting of pregnancy that were not specifically studying the more severe condition of hyperemesis gravidarum.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed the eligibility of trials, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

Twenty-five trials (involving 2052 women) met the inclusion criteria but the majority of 18 different comparisons described in the review include data from single studies with small numbers of participants. The comparisons covered a range of interventions including acupressure/acupuncture, outpatient care, intravenous fluids, and various pharmaceutical interventions. The methodological quality of included studies was mixed. For selected important comparisons and outcomes, we graded the quality of the evidence and created 'Summary of findings' tables. For most outcomes the evidence was graded as low or very low quality mainly due to the imprecision of effect estimates. Comparisons included in the 'Summary of findings' tables are described below, the remaining comparisons are described in detail in the main text. No primary outcome data were available when acupuncture was compared with placebo, There was no clear evidence of differences between groups for anxiodepressive symptoms (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.40; one study, 36 women, very low-quality evidence), spontaneous abortion (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.03; one study, 57 women, low-quality evidence), preterm birth (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.26; one study, 36 women, low-quality evidence), or perinatal death (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.04 to 8.30; one study, 36 women, low-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to identify clear differences between acupuncture and metoclopramide in a study with 81 participants regarding reduction/cessation in nausea or vomiting (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.49 and RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.48, respectively; very low-quality evidence). In a study with 92 participants, women taking vitamin B6 had a slightly longer hospital stay compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) 0.80 days, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.52, moderate-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate a difference in other outcomes including mean number of episodes of emesis (MD 0.50, 95% CI -0.40 to 1.40, low-quality evidence) or side effects. A comparison between metoclopramide and ondansetron identified no clear difference in the severity of nausea or vomiting (MD 1.70, 95% CI -0.15 to 3.55, and MD -0.10, 95% CI -1.63 to 1.43; one study, 83 women, respectively, very low-quality evidence). However, more women taking metoclopramide complained of drowsiness and dry mouth (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.23 to 4.69, and RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.10 to 5.11, respectively; moderate-quality evidence). There were no clear differences between groups for other side effects. In a single study with 146 participants comparing metoclopramide with promethazine, more women taking promethazine reported drowsiness, dizziness, and dystonia (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.87, RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.69, and RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.90, respectively, moderate-quality evidence). There were no clear differences between groups for other important outcomes including quality of life and other side effects. In a single trial with 30 women, those receiving ondansetron had no difference in duration of hospital admission compared to those receiving promethazine (MD 0.00, 95% CI -1.39 to 1.39, very low-quality evidence), although there was increased sedation with promethazine (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.94, low-quality evidence). Regarding corticosteroids, in a study with 110 participants there was no difference in days of hospital admission compared to placebo (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.70 to 0.10; very low-quality evidence), but there was a decreased readmission rate (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.94; four studies, 269 women). For other important outcomes including pregnancy complications, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and congenital abnormalities, there was insufficient evidence to identify differences between groups (very low-quality evidence for all outcomes). In other single studies there were no clear differences between groups for preterm birth or side effects (very low-quality evidence). For hydrocortisone compared with metoclopramide, no data were available for primary outcomes and there was no difference in the readmission rate (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.28; one study, 40 women). In a study with 80 women, compared to promethazine, those receiving prednisolone had increased nausea at 48 hours (RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.72; low-quality evidence), but not at 17 days (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.15, very low-quality evidence). There was no clear difference in the number of episodes of emesis or subjective improvement in nausea/vomiting. There was insufficient evidence to identify differences between groups for stillbirth and neonatal death and preterm birth.

Authors' Conclusions

On the basis of this review, there is little high-quality and consistent evidence supporting any one intervention, which should be taken into account when making management decisions. There was also very limited reporting on the economic impact of hyperemesis gravidarum and the impact that interventions may have. The limitations in interpreting the results of the included studies highlights the importance of consistency in the definition of hyperemesis gravidarum, the use of validated outcome measures, and the need for larger placebo-controlled trials.

In order to better answer the research priorities for HG, steps have been taken to standardize research in this field. First, the Windsor definition for HG was published in order to assist in clinical diagnosis and homogenize the definition of HG in study populations to enable the possibility for meta‐analysis. Next, an international consensus was achieved on a core outcome set for trials on HG. This core outcome set contains a list of 24 outcomes in 10 domains that will help to standardize outcome reporting in HG research, furthering the opportunity for meta‐analyses and therefore providing more robust evidence on the effectiveness of treatment options for HG. A core measurement set, a list of instruments recommended to measure core outcomes, is also in development. Improving outcome reporting in the field of HG will provide more robust evidence to answer the questions still facing the field today.

There is a lack of international guidelines for the treatment of HG. Some countries lack a national guideline. By standardizing care for persons with HG and exchanging information between countries on optimal care through an international guideline, we can increase the quality of care. The most appropriate combination of medical treatment should be further investigated with consideration for efficacy and adverse effects. Individuals with HG should be offered medical treatment based on robust evidence in the future. Furthermore, how to best organize care for people with HG is an important factor to consider. Evaluation of the feasibility and patient satisfaction with home or community‐based care should be further investigated. Medical care for individuals with HG often ends once symptoms subside or once delivery has taken place. With the potential for long‐term effects, there should be some follow‐up available to people with HG. This follow‐up should include help with family planning in case this is desired, and psychological follow‐up given that 20% of HG patients are left with PTSD postpartum. Lastly, due to the high recurrence rate of HG preconception, counseling should be offered to those wanting to get pregnant after a previous HG pregnancy.

Abstract

Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy affecting around 1%–3% of pregnancies worldwide and is the most common reason for hospital admission in early pregnancy. HG can have lasting consequences for both pregnant individuals and their offspring. Current best‐practice management includes symptomatic treatment with anti‐emetic pharmacological treatment, rehydration if needed, and psychological support. There is a lack of high‐quality evidence on treatment for HG.

6 CONCLUSION

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe condition of pregnancy and should not be left untreated. HG has a high burden on individuals, their offspring, and the healthcare system. Antiemetics are the cornerstone for treatment (Table 1). Future research should be aimed at providing robust evidence regarding effective treatment for HG. Current research has started to answer questions surrounding the etiology and effects of HG. Perhaps with this knowledge, future treatments can aim at specific biological targets in order to limit maternal and offspring consequences of HG (Figure 1).

### What are the costs associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum? A systematic review [^113SmzdB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), is a common condition and can be a significant cause of morbidity for pregnant women. Up to 70–80% of pregnant women suffer from nausea in pregnancy, with additional vomiting experienced by 50%. The level of severity varies among affected individuals, with around 1–3% of women developing hyperemesis gravidarum (HG); however, this number could be substantially underestimated. HG is a condition characterised by severe, intractable nausea and/or vomiting, usually requiring hospital admission to manage associated dehydration, electrolyte disturbances and other more severe complications such as preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders. While there is a wide variety of definitions for NVP or for the more severe disorder, HG. The 2021 Windsor definition, which was developed using an international consensus process with all relevant stakeholders, has established the first international definition of HG to help achieve more uniformity in clinical studies and clinical management. The Windsor definition specifies criteria including symptoms beginning in early pregnancy (before 16 weeks' gestation), characterised by severe nausea and/or vomiting, inability to eat and/or drink normally and finally, strongly limits daily activities. HG is the primary cause of hospitalisation in the first half of pregnancy.

NVP and HG can create substantial physical, psychological, and economic burden for patients, significantly affecting a woman's quality of life and day-to-day functioning. While NVP is common, most women do not require medical intervention. However, as severity increases, women may suffer from debilitating dehydration and malnutrition often requiring medication to manage symptoms, the impact of which is often not recognised. In more severe cases of NVP and HG, pregnant women may require inpatient hospitalisation to manage symptoms and complications. While previously Australia lacked NVP-specific management guidelines for those requiring intervention, in 2019 The Society of Obstetric Medicine of Australia and New Zealand (SOMANZ) released new guidelines highlighting evidence-based treatments which range from outpatient management with various pharmacological therapies to ambulatory day-stay facilities and inpatient care depending on severity.

Research and development

The limited number of studies included in this review highlights the scarcity of research on the economic burden of NVP and HG which is so far unexplored in the Australian context. To address the existing gap in evidence, routine data collection, such as that used by Pont and colleagues,6 is recommended, and can be used to examine the economic impact of NVP and HG, as well as other maternal health conditions. Australia, being a high-income country, may indeed share certain characteristics with countries included in this study, potentially experiencing a similarly significant economic burden of NVP and HG. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that differences in healthcare systems, geographic variance and policies can limit the generalisability of these findings. Therefore, conducting country-specific research is imperative to obtain more precise and contextually relevant insights.

Additionally, the variations in approaches used to assess the cost of NVP and HG in the included studies are crucial to recognise and explore. Conducting further research with consistent methodologies and employing more standardised outcome measures to generate a larger body of high-quality evidence, would assist policy makers in better allocating resources for appropriate interventions, with potential for more effective and streamlined healthcare services to treat this population. Continued research into the cost-effectiveness of different treatments and care models is essential. Policymakers should support studies that provide robust data and use consistent outcome measures to inform future healthcare strategies.

By recognising the outcomes and implications of the current research, and addressing the gaps in knowledge, healthcare policies can better manage the economic burden of NVP and HG, improve patient outcomes, and ensure efficient use of healthcare resources.

### A scoping review of models of care and services for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum [^114XnajT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum have significant physical and psychological impacts on pregnant women. Women are often unable to participate in everyday care and work activities, potentially affecting individual wellbeing and ability to contribute to the economy. Research priorities for hyperemesis gravidarum have been established, however little is known about the current landscape of literature on the health and social care provided to affected women. To inform decision makers on effective models of care and identify remaining evidence gaps, this scoping review aimed to map existing literature that evaluated health and social care delivery arrangements for pregnant women with nausea and vomiting and hyperemesis gravidarum.

Methods

Seven databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Maternity and Infant Care, Cochrane Library and Scopus) were searched in August 2023 and again in March 2024 to identify evaluations of health care delivery arrangements for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum. Database searches were supplemented by a Google search for additional peer-reviewed and grey literature. Data from included publications were extracted and synthesised to report on models of care identified, countries, study designs, outcome measures and key findings.

Results

Seventy-two records describing 60 separate models of care were identified. Models of care were grouped into hospital settings (n = 34 records), digital health (n = 19 records), group-based care (n = 11 records), and primary care (n = 8 records). Literature in the hospital setting addressed outpatient management (n = 15 records), inpatient management (n = 5 records), comparisons of outpatient and inpatient management (n = 10 records), in-home care (n = 3 records) and emergency departments (n = 1 record). Digital health care evaluations included telephone and web-based support (n = 14 records) and mobile phone applications (n = 5 records).

Conclusions

This scoping review has identified the need for further research on approaches to care provision for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum. Whilst some positive findings on patient outcomes, patient experiences and reduced hospital stays resulting from outpatient hospital management pathways were reported, much of this research was observational and limited to UK settings. Other research gaps identified pertained to the effectiveness of primary care, social support and in-home care services, including economic evaluations.

4 BEST‐PRACTICE MANAGEMENT

4.1 Diagnosis

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a clinical diagnosis. The lack of a laboratory test to aid diagnosis, in combination with the fact that nausea and vomiting is so common in pregnancy, contributes to the clinical challenge of differentiating normal NVP from HG. The Windsor definition for HG highlights the most important characteristics of the disease and was partly created to assist in consistency in clinical diagnosis. The Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis 24 h (PUQE‐24) score is a short and easy‐to‐use validated scoring tool to quantify NVP severity and is most commonly used in clinical and research settings to track symptom improvements following treatment. Recently, a promising new tool containing 12 questions, called the HyperEmesis Level Prediction (HELP) score, has been developed to measure NVP severity; however, further validation is needed to determine its role in HG care.

4.2 Medical treatment

Treatment of HG is mainly aimed at symptom reduction to prevent dehydration and malnutrition. In 2018, a Cochrane review of treatments of HG, including 25 trials involving 2052 participants, of whom only 931 patients were involved in pharmacological trials, showed a lack of high‐quality evidence for HG treatments. The lack of high‐quality evidence was mainly due to the small sample size of individual studies and comparisons. The little available evidence applied different diagnosis definitions and measured a broad range of outcomes, hampering aggregation of data.

In cases of threatening dehydration, rehydration therapy should be started. Various rehydration regimens have proved to be effective, with outpatient day‐case management often being chosen. In areas where there are services available to provide intravenous (IV) treatment at home, these services may be utilized for IV rehydration at home for HG patients, as it has been associated with high patient satisfaction in a pilot study. Clear criteria need to be established for who is eligible for at‐home rehydration treatment and what treatment regimen is most appropriate.

Hyperemesis gravidarum occurs in 0.3% to 2% of pregnant women, although populations with significantly higher rates have been reported. In clinical practice, hyperemesis gravidarum is identified by otherwise unexplained intractable vomiting and dehydration. This article discusses the causes, presentation, diagnosis, and management of hyperemesis gravidarum.

### Management of hyperemesis gravidarum [^111BQdoL]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy are common complaints and vary considerably in duration and severity. Hyperemesis gravidarum represents the extreme end of the spectrum associated with dehydration and weight loss. As embryonic organogenesis occurs during the first trimester, pharmacological intervention for any condition during this period poses a significant clinical dilemma requiring careful assessment of risks and benefits. In the UK, there are no formal national guidelines for the management of hyperemesis gravidarum. In addition, no high-quality evidence exists for i.v. fluid and electrolyte replacement in hyperemesis gravidarum, and a Cochrane review on interventions for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy specifically excluded studies on hyperemesis gravidarum. In this article, we review the evidence for the efficacy and safety of different management options for hyperemesis gravidarum.

### Managing hyperemesis gravidarum: a multimodal challenge [^1145Y2Ja]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Up to 90% of pregnant women experience nausea and vomiting. When prolonged or severe, this is known as hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), which can, in individual cases, be life threatening. In this article the aetiology, diagnosis and treatment strategies will be presented based on a selective literature review. Treatment strategies range from outpatient dietary advice and antiemetic drugs to hospitalization and intravenous (IV) fluid replacement in persistent or severe cases. Alternative methods, such as acupuncture, are not yet evidence based but sometimes have a therapeutic effect. In most cases, the condition is self limiting and subsides by around 20 weeks gestation. More severe forms require medical intervention once other organic causes of nausea and vomiting have been excluded. In addition, a psychosomatic approach is often helpful. In view of its potential complexity, general practitioners and obstetricians should be well informed about HG and therapy should be multimodal.

### Managing hyperemesis gravidarum: a multimodal challenge [^113cpDwm]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

About 50% - 90% of all pregnancies are accompanied by nausea and vomiting. According to a study of more than 360 pregnant women, only 2% experienced only nausea in the morning whereas, in 80%, complaints persisted throughout the day. The condition is usually self-limiting and peaks at around 9 weeks gestation. At 20 weeks symptoms typically cease. However, in up to 20% of cases, nausea and vomiting may continue until delivery.

This condition is known as nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) or emesis gravidarum and is of no pathological significance as long as the affected women do not feel unwell or restricted in their daily life. There are, however, different grades in the scope of NVP, which range from occasional morning-sickness to excessive vomiting that persists throughout the day. The most severe grade of NVP often leads to hyperemesis gravidarum (HG; see below), but it can be difficult to differentiate between the two conditions.

A prospective study of more than 9000 pregnant women showed that NVP occurred significantly more often in primigravidas and in women who were less educated, younger, non-smokers and overweight or obese. The incidence of NVP was also higher in women with a history of nausea and vomiting in a previous pregnancy.

In order to exclude differential diagnoses the following crucial parameters should be investigated: Onset of nausea and vomiting (nearly all of the cases begin before 9 weeks of gestation), attendant symptoms, underlying chronic disorders or, in rare cases, hereditary diseases (see Figures 1 and 2).

Figure 1
Differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting.

Figure 2
Differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting in respect to abdominal symptoms.

A small percentage of pregnant women experience a severe form of nausea and vomiting that is termed HG (synonym: excessive vomiting during pregnancy). This disorder has an estimated incidence of 0.5% - 2% of all live births. A standard definition of HG is the occurrence of more than three episodes of vomiting per day with ketonuria and more than 3 kg or 5% weight loss. However, the diagnosis is usually made clinically following the exclusion of other causes.

### Assessment of management approaches for hyperemesis gravidarum and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a retrospective questionnaire analysis [^114aHr32]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperemesis gravidarum is the most severe form of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, or morning sickness. 2% of pregnancies in the United States are affected by hyperemesis gravidarum. The condition is characterized by severe vomiting in pregnant people, especially during the first trimester, often leading to hypovolemia and weight loss. The standard of care for hyperemesis and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is commonly ineffective. We hypothesize that based on patient experience; the current treatment guidelines for hyperemesis are not clinically effective. Our objective was to identify the efficacy of the various management approaches that are currently in place for hyperemesis and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

Methods

A questionnaire was designed based on diagnostic criteria, standard demographic identifiers, and common medications for the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum. This questionnaire was distributed online to through hyperemesis and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy support groups, personal social media, and institutional email.

Results

In our study, most participants diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum trialed at least three medications, most of which were ineffective and/or had severe side effects. The most used medication for treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum is ondansetron, a standard antiemetic, with fatigue and constipation being the most reported side effects. All data in the dataset was coded as categorical and analyzed using contingency tables using Mantel-Haenszel Chi square tests.

Conclusions

The data presented in this research provides insight into the suffering that patients with these diagnoses face day-to-day due to the lack of efficacious, well-tolerated treatment options. Establishing this gap in treatment can facilitate the development of effective treatments that will provide relief for thousands of patients.

### A scoping review of models of care and services for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum [^113313LC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG) is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP), and the most common cause of hospitalisation during the first and second trimesters. Evidence suggests that while 70% of pregnant women experience nausea and vomiting, the prevalence of HG is estimated to be much lower (between 0.3%−3.6% globally). Characterised by early onset of symptoms, severe vomiting and/or nausea, and an inability to eat and/or drink normally or participate in daily living activities, HG has significant effects on the physical and mental health of pregnant women. Unmanaged cases of HG can be life threatening, with severe complications including Wernicke's encephalopathy, electrolyte imbalances and vitamin K deficiency.

Whilst recent advances have been made in better understanding the cause of HG and in developing curative treatments, such treatments are not yet available. Current management options for women with severe NVP and HG include pharmaceutical interventions, intravenous rehydration, outpatient care and other supportive treatments such as acupuncture and acupressure.

To support the implementation of evidence into practice, several clinical practice guidelines are available to inform health care providers and health policy and practice stakeholders responsible for service delivery models and ongoing quality improvement. A recent systematic review and appraisal of these guidelines found that national guidelines published in Australia, the UK, the USA and Canada provided similar recommendations, with UK guidelines updated since publishing of the review.

Despite the availability of relatively harmonised guidelines to support practice, inefficiencies remain in service delivery models for women with NVP and HG. In some cases, there are no or few health and social care options available. In the USA, high and increasing rates of presentation to the emergency department for HG have been reported. This has resulted in increased emergency department costs, with one study citing a 65% increase in patient costs. Similarly in the UK, hospital admissions for HG are increasing. This has resulted in calls for further investigation into the role of improved primary care management.

### Inpatient management of hyperemesis gravidarum [^114hDmGn]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum has a reported incidence of approximately 0.3–3% of pregnancies. Without treatment, refractory hyperemesis gravidarum can result in dehydration, electrolyte deficiencies, and severe nutritional deficiencies, resulting in significant maternal morbidity. The overall goals of inpatient management of refractory hyperemesis gravidarum are the resumption of oral intake to an adequate level to maintain hydration and nutrition, including the ability to tolerate oral pharmacotherapy. Patients initially are stabilized with rehydration and electrolyte repletion. There are numerous pharmacotherapeutics available that can be administered intravenously to control symptoms when oral intake is not an option. However, despite maximizing typical antiemetics, there will be cases refractory to these medications, and alternative pharmacotherapeutics and nutrition-support modalities must be considered. Mirtazapine, olanzapine, corticosteroids, and gabapentin are examples of alternative pharmacotherapeutics, and enteral and parenteral nutrition are alternative therapies that can be used when oral intake is not tolerated for prolonged time periods with ongoing weight loss. In refractory cases of hyperemesis gravidarum, the risks and benefits of these alternative forms of management must be considered, along with the risks of undertreated hyperemesis gravidarum and the overall effect of hyperemesis gravidarum on patients' quality of life.

Design

A new clinical pathway for the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum in the ED was introduced on 15 September 2015. This quality improvement project was initiated by clinicians in the ED and O&G teams to improve the quality of care for patients presenting with hyperemesis gravidarum. The project included the development of a guideline and a pathway for the management of these patients in the ED short stay unit called CDU. This care pathway facilitates the effective management of hyperemesis gravidarum within the ED by admitting the patient to CDU rather than to the O&G ward, with the aim of treatment up to a maximum of 24 hours.

This pathway was developed after collaborative work between the ED and O&G teams and resulted in the introduction of the hyperemesis pathway in CDU. A working group was created involving senior members of the ED and O&G teams including consultants in ED and O&G, clinical nurse specialists in O&G and senior ED nursing staff. The group met often and initially started off revising the existing guideline for the management of patients with hyperemesis in the hospital. The new guideline developed was based on the latest Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology guidelines for the management of hyperemesis gravidarum. Following this, we decided to create a pathway for management of these patients on the CDU and this involved writing up a proforma which guided all medical staff regarding suitability for admission to CDU and indications for referral and admission to the O&G team (online Supplementary appendices 1 and 2).

This pathway was circulated and agreed by the senior clinical team of the respective departments and introduced in September 2015. We planned to conduct a reaudit soon after the introduction of this pathway and complete two PDSA cycles to establish good practice. We aimed to look for improvements in patient care, reduction in admissions to O&G and adherence to the proforma.

The audited parameters included investigations, urinalysis and confirmation of pregnancy, blood glucose measurement and blood tests, administration of intravenous fluids; antiemetics, folic acid, thiamine, thromboprophylaxis and discharge outcome, as well as the length of stay in the ED.

The patient inclusion criteria:
Patient discussed with an ED consultant or senior.
Pregnancy confirmed.
Two or more ketones in urine.
No alternative diagnosis more likely than hyperemesis.

### Optimisation of hyperemesis gravidarum management through an emergency department setting [^114hYT3z]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a common condition which affects women during early pregnancy and is characterised by severe nausea and vomiting leading to dehydration. Consequently, mothers suffering with hyperemesis gravidarum commonly present to the emergency department (ED) and are initially treated there before being referred to the gynaecology team.

This referral process can lead to treatment delays before the gynaecology team reviews the patient. This often results in unnecessary prolonged inpatient stays on the gynaecology ward. This costly process can be optimised if patient management is streamlined through the use of ED clinical decision unit (CDU) beds. In 2015, a hyperemesis gravidarum CDU pathway was created at the Princess Royal University Hospital to effectively identify and treat hyperemesis gravidarum in the ED, with the aim of promptly treating patients on presentation and reducing the need for referrals to obstetrics and gynaecology (O&G).

TABLE 1
Antiemetics used in the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum (HG).

Metoclopramide and ondansetron are considered second‐line antiemetic treatments for HG. Metoclopramide is considered safe and effective; however, due to a risk of extrapyramidal effects, a prescription should be provided with information on the potential side effects, and treatment should be discontinued if such side effects arise. Ondansetron should be considered as a second‐line treatment. One study found a slightly increased risk of orofacial clefting in babies born to individuals using ondansetron during the first trimester. However, due to extremely low absolute incidence (14 per 10 000 pregnancies compared with 11.4 per 10 000 pregnancies) some guidelines, including the RCOG guideline, state that use should not be discouraged if first‐line antiemetics are insufficiently effective. Individuals should be informed of potential side effects, which should be weighed against the risks of poorly managed HG (including termination of pregnancy), and healthcare professionals should not avoid ondansetron as a second‐ or third‐line treatment in the first trimester.

If symptoms cannot be adequately contained with (combination) antiemetic treatment, corticosteroids should be considered. Corticosteroids may reduce the frequency of vomiting and need for readmission. Due to well‐known side effects of corticosteroids, which include their effect on immune, metabolic, and adrenal function as well as fetal growth, this therapy is reserved for cases in which other antiemetics have not provided sufficient relief. Individuals using corticosteroids should have their blood pressure monitored and should be screened for gestational diabetes mellitus. Fetal growth monitoring should be considered in cases with prolonged use.

Combination of drugs should be used in individuals who have not responded to single antiemetic treatment. Despite the fact that there is an absolute dearth of studies comparing multi‐drug combination antiemetic treatment in HG, synergism of antiemetics from different classes has been the established best practice in other conditions, including postoperative nausea and vomiting or chemotherapy‐induced nausea and vomiting. It is also important to consider the route of administration of drugs for people with HG, as oral medication is often poorly tolerated due to frequent vomiting. For individuals with HG, antiemetic formulations, including buccal melts, transdermal patches, and rectal administrations, should be considered, if possible. In severe cases, parenteral or intramuscular route of administration may be necessary.

5 HIGHLIGHTS OF CURRENT RESEARCH AND FUTURE AREAS OF INTEREST

While the HG field of research has been expanding in recent years, evidence on best‐practice management of HG is still scarce. As the prioritized list of HG research questions shows, the causes of HG, more effective treatments, and the impact of HG on mothers and babies are considered pivotal areas of future research.

The pathophysiology of HG was always considered multifactorial, although little was known about the mechanisms involved. In recent years, however, emerging evidence has demonstrated that variants in the GDF‐15 gene, a gene coding for the hormone that causes nausea and vomiting, and its receptor GFRAL‐RET are associated with HG.GDF‐15 in pregnant persons is derived from trophoblast production of GDF‐15. Higher GDF‐15 levels in maternal blood are associated with an increased risk of vomiting. Conversely, in the non‐pregnant state, higher levels of circulating GDF‐15 were associated with a lower risk of developing NVP or HG, establishing the hypothesis that maternal sensitivity to GDF‐15 levels is influenced significantly by prior exposure to the hormone before pregnancy. New insights into the etiology can be harnessed to provide the base for new treatment options such as GDF‐15 receptor antagonists, or treatments targeting a preconception increase in GDF‐15 levels, although given the delicate timing of HG during embryonic development and organogenesis, safety aspects of any novel treatments need to be rigorously investigated and balanced against efficacy and side effects. Pre‐emptive intervention may significantly impact the incidence, severity, and duration of HG pregnancies. Currently, NGM pharmaceuticals is completing a phase 2 trial testing NGM120, a GFRAL antagonist antibody, to see if it is safe and effective for treating HG, which could be the first medical treatment using the knowledge of GDF‐15 for the basis of new treatment.

3.3 Societal consequences

In addition to physical and psychological suffering, HG presents an economic and societal burden. The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK estimates an annual cost of up to £62 million due to NVP‐related healthcare, including hospital admissions, general practice visits, and ambulance call‐outs. Studies have shown that costs increase with the severity of NVP. Besides healthcare utilization costs, work absenteeism is not uncommon among individuals with HG. Specifically, hospital admissions lead to increased costs and longer sick leave. Day care management of NVP is less costly and equivalent in effectiveness to inpatient management. Therefore, improved or more effective treatments hold a sizeable societal and economic benefit, besides the medical advantages.

### Optimisation of hyperemesis gravidarum management through an emergency department setting [^113FY6kN]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The introduction of the hyperemesis gravidarum pathway and its use 1 year since introduction has been very successful. The collaborative work between ED and the O&G team throughout the project helped bring consistent improvements to the pathway and optimised the management of hyperemesis gravidarum at Princess Royal University Hospital.

We believe that the success of this pathway and pro forma could be attributed to the fact that rather than being a simple tick-box admission sheet, it serves as a clinical guide to managing hyperemesis gravidarum to the standards set out by the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. This encourages its use by junior doctors, as most rotating into emergency medicine will most likely not have had much prior experience of managing hyperemesis.

In the 3-month period PDSA cycle 2 measured, the pathway had saved the O&G department an estimated £66 425 as a result of reduced admissions and length of stay. This is based on the average length of stay for a hyperemesis patient in 2015 being 2.4 days prior to the pathway, and an acute obstetrics bed costing £838.70 per day. Over a year, this could save an estimated £265 700 even after factoring in the costs for the management of these patients in CDU. The reduction in emergency admissions improves patient care by freeing up inpatient beds and releasing O&G staff for elective admissions and procedures. Audit suggests that over a year, at least 235 bed days have been saved due to this pathway. In the future, we plan to have nurse-led criteria-based discharges of these patients to prevent further delays and improve efficiency.

### Optimisation of hyperemesis gravidarum management through an emergency department setting [^1138BejN]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a common condition characterised by severe nausea and vomiting. The referral process from the emergency department (ED) to obstetrics and gynaecology (O&G) can lead to treatment delays before the gynaecology team review the patient, resulting in unnecessary prolonged inpatient stays in O&G. This quality improvement project created a clinical pathway which optimised care of patients presenting with hyperemesis gravidarum in the ED at the Princess Royal University Hospital using a treatment protocol. Two audits were carried out to assess improvements in patient care and reduction in admissions to O&G. Overall, admissions to O&G were reduced by 68.7% (cycle 1) and 70.5% (cycle 2) compared with admission rates before the proforma, saving the trust an estimated £265700 and 235 bed days over a year.

### Hyperemesis gravidarum [^114LaaPe]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum describes nausea and vomiting in pregnancy severe enough to cause weight loss, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and nutritional deficiencies. The condition can render women so physically and mentally unwell that they are at increased risk of terminating a wanted pregnancy and experiencing suicidal ideation. Concerns regarding prescribing in pregnancy and inaccurate assumptions that the condition is self-limiting result in women being dismissed and having difficulty accessing appropriate care. Over the past decade, a wealth of literature has been published that gives new insights into the causes of hyperemesis gravidarum, the safety of antiemetic therapy, and short-term and long-term consequences for women with the condition and their children. This Review summarises the findings of this literature with the aim of informing decisions about the care of these women and future research priorities.

### Managing hyperemesis gravidarum: a multimodal challenge [^112FnuCT]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Since the causal factors of HG are multifarious, treatment of this condition should be multimodal, ranging from dietary and lifestyle advice to psychosomatic counselling or psychoanalytic therapy. Administration of antiemetic drugs may be necessary, as well as IV fluid replacement, food administration via nasogastric or parenteral routes in severe cases. Since this condition is accompanied by a significant reduction in quality of life for the patient and high costs to the healthcare system, general practitioners and obstetricians should ensure that they are well informed about this condition so that they are able to provide advice, counselling and effective medication to pregnant women and thus prevent the exacerbation of symptoms.

### Optimisation of hyperemesis gravidarum management through an emergency department setting [^115DEyyn]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are common, affecting women in up to 80% of pregnancies. Hyperemesis gravidarum represents the severe end of the spectrum and is associated with dehydration, weight loss of > 5% and electrolyte imbalance. Diagnosis is dependent on exclusion of other causes like gastritis and urinary tract infections and inclusion of those with ketones of four or more on urinalysis. It occurs in 0.3%–3.6% of pregnancies with variable recurrence rates between 15.2% and 81%.

Hyperemesis gravidarum has several aetiological theories but is primarily associated with increased beta human chorionic gonadotropin hormone levels. It affects women in the first trimester of pregnancy, with symptoms peaking at approximately 9 weeks and mostly resolving by 20 weeks in 90% of women.

Treatment is supportive focusing on fluid, vitamin and electrolyte replacement as well as antiemetic therapy.

One should not dismiss the increasing evidence which highlights the psychological burden of hyperemesis gravidarum, not to mention the financial cost to both the patient and the healthcare system.

### Assessment of management approaches for hyperemesis gravidarum and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a retrospective questionnaire analysis [^117CNC7p]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Despite the grave ramifications of this condition, many healthcare providers do not meet the needs of their HG patients. This is evident not only from the sheer number of medications that patients are trialing as shown in our data, but also from several studies regarding lessened quality of life and even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Furthermore, we discovered that more than half of the patients who are prescribed medication for their symptoms are experiencing a plethora of side effects. It is vital to reverse this trend; health care providers need to be aware of the high burden NVP/HG and its current treatment places on these patients.

Support and high-quality care are essential for this vulnerable population. However, the lack of a unified standard of care for NVP/HG patients prevents the condition from being widely recognized and downplays the need for effective interventions, which is considered one of the highest priorities of experts in this field regarding this condition. Without fully understanding the etiology of this multifactorial condition, the obstetrics community is at a loss for solutions to the root-cause of this problem. By emphasizing the lack of efficacious, well-tolerated treatment, we hope that this research will inspire the obstetrics community to better understand NVP/HG, including treatments and outcomes. Though pregnant people are a controversial study population, high-quality research is necessary to bridge this gap. Effective therapeutics for NVP/HG will give patients a better outlook on pregnancy, an improved relationship with their healthcare providers, and a higher quality of life during and after pregnancy.

2 EPIDEMIOLOGY

While up to 90% of pregnant people worldwide experience NVP, HG is estimated to effect around 1%–3% of pregnancies. Geographically, HG seems to be more prevalent in western countries. A history of HG is the single largest risk factor for (recurrent) HG. Recurrence rate estimates range from 15% from registry studies to 89% from cohort studies. Positive family history for HG, multiple pregnancy, primiparity, female fetal sex, younger maternal age, and over‐ or underweight are each associated with an increased risk of HG. Recent research has shown that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF‐15) is implicated in the pathogenesis of NVP and HG, with feto‐placental production of GDF‐15 and maternal sensitivity both contributing to the risk of HG.

Hyperemesis gravidarum — hospitalization criteria and outpatient management indicates that when a woman cannot tolerate liquids without vomiting and has not responded to outpatient management, hospitalization for evaluation and treatment of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance is recommended. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 98 pregnant women found that outpatient treatment resulted in fewer overnight hospital stays, whereas a subsequent RCT of 53 pregnant women reported no differences in symptoms over 7 days between outpatient rehydration and antiemetic therapy versus inpatient care. The option of hospitalization for observation and further assessment should be preserved for patients who experience a change in vital signs or a change in mental status, continue to lose weight, and are refractory to treatment.

HG can, in individual cases, be life threatening and treatment must be initiated immediately. Clinical findings include dehydration, acidosis due to inadequate nutrition, alkalosis due to loss of hydrochloride and hypokalaemia. There are two degrees of severity: (i) grade 1, nausea and vomiting without metabolic imbalance; and (ii) grade 2, pronounced feelings of sickness with metabolic imbalance.

In this article the aetiology, diagnosis, clinical presentation and treatment options will be outlined on the basis of a selective literature review.

Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) — definition, frequency, course, and management: HG is defined by persistent vomiting, associated with loss of 5% or more of pre-pregnancy body weight, dehydration, and ketosis. HG is uncommon (0.3–2% of pregnancies), occurs early in the first trimester, and typically resolves by 20 weeks gestation. In all, 50–60% of hospitalized women with HG will have a mild elevation in aminotransferase levels, although AST and ALT levels more than 20 times the upper limit of normal rarely have been reported. Management of HG is supportive, and given the risk for electrolyte abnormalities and dehydration, hospitalization is not infrequent.

4.4 Psychological support

The care for HG should include offering professional psychological care. Healthcare professionals should assess people's mental health during pregnancy and refer to psychological support if necessary. Clinical assessment should be performed if there is suspicion of depression, anxiety, postnatal depression, and/or PTSD. Information from patient support groups, such as Pregnancy Sickness Support in the UK or the HER foundation in the USA, should be provided to individuals and their partners. As many as 25.5% of individuals with HG suffer from occasional suicidal ideation, thus suicidal ideation should specifically be assessed by healthcare providers when assessing mental health status of individuals with HG. As HG poses an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and PTSD as long as 4.5 years after pregnancy with HG, consideration should be given to follow‐up psychological care of individuals with HG beyond pregnancy. Pregnancy sickness‐specific counseling may be appropriate in people with HG. As many as 10% of people with HG will terminate a wanted pregnancy due to their condition. The full range of therapeutic options should be offered to an HG patient before deciding that termination of pregnancy is the only option. Few data are available on the best way to organize psychological care for people with HG.

4.5 Multidisciplinary care

Care for individuals with HG ideally is based on a holistic approach with a multidisciplinary team. A study has shown that involvement of a mental health professional in the care team of a person with HG resulted in an improvement in quality of life and coping with the impact of pregnancy. Emotional support and psychological and psychiatric care should be available to persons with HG if requested or required. Dieticians should be consulted to monitor their intake and give nutritional advice, including supplementations via various routes if indicated. If complications arise, designated subspecialties should be consulted.

### Watermelon and dietary advice compared to dietary advice alone following hospitalization for hyperemesis gravidarum: a randomized controlled trial [^115wr9rL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This is a randomized controlled trial comparing watermelon and dietary advice leaflet to dietary advice leaflet only (control) at hospital discharge for HG. The trial was approved by our center's Medical Ethics Committee (approval on 21/05/2019; reference number 2019327–7262) and registered in the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number registry on 24/05/2019; reference number ISRCTN96125404 prior to trial enrolment. Informed consent was taken from all participants and research has been performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The first participant was recruited on 31 May, 2019 and the last on 18 December, 2020.

Our HG cases were characterized 'intractable nausea and vomiting of pregnancy with dehydration and starvation clinically judged to require hospitalization for intravenous rehydration and antiemetic drug administration'. We had shown that HG cases admitted to our centre have 'comparable metabolic and biochemical characteristics to previous studies of hyperemesis gravidarum'. Women admitted for HG in our centre typically 'received our standard inpatient care for HG, which comprised intravenous rehydration with normal saline solution (with potassium chloride added if required for hypokalaemia), intravenous anti-emetic drug (first-line 10 mg metoclopramide 8-hourly and supplementation with oral thiamine' and 'were encouraged to resume oral intake of both fluid and solid as soon as, as much as and as often as could be tolerated'.

Women were assessed for eligibility by scrutinizing their medical records during their inpatient management of HG in the gynecology ward, University Malaya Medical Center, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia usually on the day of discharge. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of HG, gestation age less than 16 weeks, age ≥ 18 years and first hospitalization for HG in the current pregnancy. Exclusion criteria were confirmed non-viable pregnancy, allergy or intolerance to watermelon. aversion to watermelon and multiple gestations. Eligible women were approached, given the Patient Information Sheet and their oral queries were addressed by the recruiting investigator (co-author GR). Written informed consent was obtained.

Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE-24) score, Simplified Nutritional Appetite Questionnaire (SNAQ) score, and an 11-point NRS (0–10 numerical rating scale, high score greater wellbeing) were obtained at ward discharge. Participants' characteristics were transcribed onto the Case Report Form.

### Intractable hyperemesis gravidarum in a patient with type 1 diabetes [^115GGBLT]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum is not uncommon. Its pathogenies is multifactorial but not fully understood. We present a case of a middle class, Caucasian pregnant woman aged 24 years with coexisting type 1 diabetes, who had severe hyperemesis gravidarum from the sixth week of pregnancy and was resistant to all standard and off-the-label treatments raising questions about the pathogenesis of hyperemesis gravidarum. She was managed with a multidisciplinary approach and was supported with total parenteral nutrition till she had an emergency caesarean section in the 29th week of pregnancy. Her vomiting stopped as soon as a small for gestational age but otherwise healthy male baby was delivered.

### Improving management of patients with hyperemesis [^117HuDxD]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), defined as severe nausea and vomiting resulting in dehydration, is a common reason for emergency admission in gynaecology (1). The management of HG is supportive, including the correction of dehydration and electrolyte disturbances and use of antiemetics. An audit in our unit identified that women with HG were not receiving appropriate fluid resuscitation and in particular inadequate potassium replacement. A proforma was developed by a multidiscplinary team to prompt appropriate investigations, medications, and fluid resuscitation. The proforma was introduced in paper format and electronically, accompanied by an education programme for junior doctors. This intervention has improved prescribing practice and fluid resuscitation for these patients. Length of admission has reduced. Efforts have been made to ensure this change is sustainable in the long term, through involvement of the junior doctors using the proforma at all stages of the project.

### Optimisation of hyperemesis gravidarum management through an emergency department setting [^116k6GxR]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Results

PDSA cycle 1 (table 2) showed that there was an overall improvement in the medical management of patients presenting with hyperemesis gravidarum. In particular, of note, we saw an improvement in prescription of antiemetic's in line with the hospital guideline and also noticed improvement in prescription of vitamins and thromboprophylaxis. The remarkable improvement was a drop in admissions to O&G, reduced by 68.7% in cycle 1 and 70.5% in cycle 2 compared with admission rates before the introduction of the pathway.

Table 2
Results of the data collected over the two cycles and its comparison with the baseline measurement

The medical management of hyperemesis patients has remained at an improved standard over the next year. The reduction in admissions since the introduction of the pathway is statistically significant with p < 0.001 (online Supplementary appendix 3).

In the 3 months post-introduction PDSA cycle 1, 6.9% (2 out of 29 patients) were admitted to O&G. This was consistent in the cycle 2, with 4.5% (2 out of 44 patients) admitted to O&G (table 2). The two patients who were admitted to the O&G team in both the cycles failed to improve with the 20 hours treatment they received in CDU and hence required referral for ongoing treatment and further specialist input from the O&G team.

The measured average length of stay prior to introduction of this pathway was about 2.4 days on the O&G wards and this reduced to an average length of stay of about 12 hours post-pathway on CDU. This reduction in length of stay is likely due to early recognition of the patient in ED, timely initiation of treatment which was in accordance with guideline, frequent nursing assessments and re-evaluations which were made available on CDU. The nursing staff on CDU were also provided with a clear criterion for discharge which helped identify patients' who were fit for discharge earlier than they would have been on the O&G wards.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112Hkh99]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum — epidemiology, clinical features, laboratory patterns, and management: Hyperemesis gravidarum occurs in 0.35% to 2.0% of pregnancies, typically in the first trimester, and is characterized by persistent vomiting with weight loss greater than or equal to 5% of prepregnancy body weight, dehydration, and ketonuria. Abnormal liver enzymes occur in approximately 50% and are rarely greater than 1,000 IU/mL; in general, ALT is greater than aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and jaundice rarely occurs. Biochemical abnormalities typically resolve with hydration and resolution of vomiting, and liver biopsy is rarely indicated but, when performed, reveals normal parenchyma, mild fatty change, or bland cholestasis. Treatment includes rehydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, nutrition, thiamine supplementation to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy, and anti-emetic therapy; anti-emetic agents with favorable pregnancy safety include ondansetron.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of corticosteroids for hyperemesis due to pregnancy [^115AWg4x]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of nausea and vomiting due to pregnancy for which there is no proven pharmacological treatment, is the third leading cause for hospitalization during pregnancy. Corticosteroids are commonly used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting due to cancer chemotherapy-induced emesis and might prove useful in hyperemesis gravidarum.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 126 women who previously had not responded to outpatient therapy for hyperemesis gravidarum during the first half of pregnancy. Intravenous methylprednisolone (125 mg) was followed by an oral prednisone taper (40 mg for 1 day, 20 mg for 3 days, 10 mg for 3 days, 5 mg for 7 days) versus an identical-appearing placebo regimen. All women also received promethazine 25 mg and metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously every 6 hours for 24 hours, followed by the same regimen administered orally as needed until discharge. The primary study outcome was the number of women requiring rehospitalization for hyperemesis gravidarum.

Results

A total of 110 women delivered at our hospital and had pregnancy outcomes available for analysis; 56 were randomized to corticosteroids and 54 were administered placebo. Nineteen women in each study group required rehospitalization (34% versus 35%, P = 0.89, for corticosteroids versus placebo, respectively).

Conclusion

The addition of parenteral and oral corticosteroids to the treatment of women with hyperemesis gravidarum did not reduce the need for rehospitalization later in pregnancy.

### A scoping review of models of care and services for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum [^113vDjuU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

The conduct of this systematic scoping review was informed by Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) methodological framework. It follows the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) for reporting (see Additional File 1 for completed PRISMA-ScR checklist).

Identifying the research question

The parameters of the review were discussed by the research team in mid-2023 and a protocol for the conduct of the review was established at this time. Literature that was related to improving the ways in which women accessed or received information, support and care for NVP or HG was identified as being of interest. Participants of interest were pregnant women with nausea and vomiting or HG that accessed care across any health or social care sector. The key concept of the review was to identify initiatives that focused on improving the way that health or social care was delivered, including both existing and new MoC and services.

Identifying relevant studies

A comprehensive literature search strategy was developed in consultation with medicine and health academic liaison librarians, which included both peer-reviewed and grey literature. Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Maternity and Infant Care, Cochrane Library and Scopus were searched using key terms related to NVP and HG, and MoC, for articles published from January 2012. An initial search was conducted on 8 August 2023, with an updated search conducted on 19 March 2024 to identify additional publications.

Using similar search terms, a Google search using a private browser and clear cache in Microsoft Edge was conducted to identify relevant websites from Australia, New Zealand, United States of America, United Kingdom and Canada. These countries were selected as representative of health systems from OECD countries, with similar percentages of GDP expended on health care. Each search string was captured with both government and organisation domain Names where available, with their respective country domain. Depending on the number of results, up to 50 search results were saved for each country and domain. Searches were conducted from 21 to the 29 of February 2024 (see Additional File 2 for full search strategy).

Reference lists of included articles were hand searched, and experts were consulted for the identification of any additional literature suitable for inclusion. Twenty-four experts within our health service networks were contacted via email in February 2024, to which four responded with literature to consider. Respondents included an obstetrician-gynaecologist, an obstetric physician, a telephone service counsellor for pregnant women, and a clinical midwife consultant.

### Effectiveness of treatment options for hyperemesis gravidarum… [^111wHdKn]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, may cause maternal electrolyte disturbances; weight loss; dehydration; and, sometimes, the need for iatrogenic premature birth. The disorder commonly persists throughout pregnancy, possibly leading to prolonged or repeated hospitalizations. In addition to the patient avoiding trigger foods and eating small meals, treatment may involve antiemetic medications, intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement, and, possibly, supplemental nutrition. Peripherally inserted central catheters are sometimes used to facilitate prolonged parenteral nutrition and intravenous fluid replacement. Dobbhof feeding tubes have also been shown to be beneficial in patients with hyperemesis gravidarum. Holmgren and colleagues compared maternal and neonatal outcomes after treatment with antiemetic medications alone or with the medications plus a nasogastric/nasoduodenal feeding tube or PICC.

Of the remaining 94 patients, 33 received a PICC, 19 received a nasogastric/nasoduodenal feeding tube, and 42 received only intravenous antiemetic medications. The groups were similar in respect to maternal demographics and health status, neonatal weight, gestational age at delivery, and Apgar scores. Outcomes were expressed in odds ratios and were controlled for maternal age, parity, and smoking status; gestational age; and fetal weight. Results: Neonatal complications, such as small size for gestational age and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, were increased in the PICC group, but this did not achieve statistical significance. Maternal complications were uncommon in the medication-only and feeding tube groups. However, maternal complications were significantly more common in the PICC group and included thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, localized cellulitis, and bacteremia or sepsis. Conclusion: More than one half of patients who received a PICC experienced a serious or potentially life-threatening complication directly related to the treatment. Because there were no differences in neonatal outcomes, the authors conclude that PICCs should be avoided in the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum; enteral feeding through a nasogastric/nasoduodenal feeding tube likely is a safer method when medical management alone is insufficient.

### AGA clinical practice update on pregnancy-related gastrointestinal and liver disease: expert review [^114BZGJi]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) — management includes supportive care and defined vitamin and steroid protocols. Elevated levels of liver enzymes can be seen in 40%–50% of patients with HG. Thiamine therapy should be started at a dose of 100 mg daily for a minimum of 7 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg daily until adequate oral intake is established. For refractory severe HG, methylprednisolone can be given as a last resort, using 16 mg intravenous (IV) every 8 hours for up to 3 days, followed by tapering over 2 weeks and limiting the maximum duration to 6 weeks; because its administration in the first trimester has been reported to slightly increase the risk of cleft palate when given before 10 weeks of gestation, it should be administered with caution in the first trimester. Patients with severe symptoms may need hospitalization for IV hydration and replacement of electrolytes, vitamins, and nutrients; if weight loss and symptoms persist, enteral or parenteral nutrition may be required.

6 | HYPEREMESIS GRAVIDARUM AND GDF15: A SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGH IN MECHANISTIC INSIGHT

Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) affects ~70% of women with often debilitating consequences. It usually begins at approximately 6–8 weeks of gestation and generally diminishes in intensity by the end of the first trimester. Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), a severe and highly dangerous emetic condition associated with pregnancy, has been reported to occur in up to 11% of pregnant women and it is characterized by nausea and emesis that are so severe that normal eating/drinking is negatively impacted and often leads to weight loss and electrolyte disturbances which carry significant risks to the longer-term health of both mother and offspring. In fact, HG is the primary cause of hospitalization in the first trimester, and the second most common cause of pregnancy hospitalization overall in the United States. Despite being a severe problem, only in the last few years have significant advances in the understanding of its underlying pathophysiological mechanism(s) been made. Traditional forms of interventions or management for HG encompass dietary supplementation (e.g. vitamin supplements), lifestyle adjustments (like consuming smaller and more frequent meals), and medical treatments (e.g. metoclopramide, ondansetron). The latter is used by ~20% of pregnant women in the United States. While demonstrating some efficacy in alleviating HG symptoms, these medications were not originally designed for HG and are considered off-label for treating other types of nausea and emesis, making them suboptimal choices at best and likely unable to qualitatively improve the condition.

### Pulsed steroid therapy is an effective treatment for intractable hyperemesis gravidarum [^112efnJz]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Intractable hyperemesis gravidarum remains a serious cause of morbidity among pregnant women. If not controlled, hyperemesis gravidarum can lead to severe disability, electrolyte and acid base imbalance, and even various organ system dysfunctions. From the successful use of steroids for chemotherapy-induced emesis, corticosteroids might prove useful in hyperemesis gravidarum. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of pulsed hydrocortisone therapy with that of metoclopramide for the management of intractable hyperemesis gravidarum.

Design

Prospective, double-blind study.

Setting

Intensive care unit of Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital.

Patients

Forty patients aged 19–34 yrs having a normal appearing intrauterine pregnancy, of ≤ 16 wks gestation, admitted to the intensive care unit with intractable hyperemesis meeting the study criteria.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous hydrocortisone 300 mg as a daily dose or intravenous metoclopramide 10 mg 3 times daily. After 3 days the hydrocortisone was tapered completely during the course of 1 wk, whereas the metoclopramide was continued without change for 1 wk. Patients were followed up daily during the therapy course and for 2 wks following intensive care unit discharge.

Measurements and Main Results

There was a significant reduction in vomiting episodes in the hydrocortisone group compared with the metoclopramide group (p < .0001). Within-patient analyses showed a significant reduction in mean vomiting episodes in the hydrocortisone group within the first 3 days (p < .0001). No patients from the hydrocortisone group but six of the patients receiving metoclopramide were readmitted for intractable vomiting within 1 wk from discharge. Five of them showed improvement on intravenous hydrocortisone therapy.

Conclusions

A short course of hydrocortisone is an effective treatment for intractable hyperemesis gravidarum.

### Reorganising and improving quality of care for hyperemesis gravidarum in a Danish hospital: a quality improvement project [^112toDK9]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

At the local Danish hospital, Nordsjællands Hospital, treatment for HG was administered by midwives in the obstetric department. Care was consistently provided according to local and national guidelines, and patients often expressed satisfaction with treatment. However, patient satisfaction had never been systematically investigated.

In this quality improvement project, we initially aimed to investigate and possibly improve patient satisfaction among women treated for HG at Nordsjællands Hospital. Through dialogue with patients, midwives, nurses, obstetrician–gynaecologists and GPs, we aimed to explore possibilities for improving treatment. Concurrently, we wanted to implement new treatment recommendations according to the 2021 National Guideline on HG. However, during the project period, COVID-19 caused increasing work load in the obstetric department, and this was simultaneously challenged by vacancies in midwife positions limiting staff resources. These circumstances warranted exploration of possible ways to release midwife resources. Reorganising the management of HG care was quickly identified as an option, and thus, the project aim was redefined to reorganising the treatment offered for HG in a manner to release midwife resources while optimising organisation and patient satisfaction.

Hyperemesis gravidarum — corticosteroid use and outcomes: Oral prednisolone therapy has no proven benefit; data for intravenous corticosteroids are conflicting but can be considered for severe disease. If treated early, hyperemesis gravidarum is not usually associated with any major adverse maternal or fetal outcomes; low birth weight and premature delivery have been associated, although long-term health effects are unknown. Recurrence is high with subsequent pregnancies, although there is no association with chronic liver disease.

### Secular trends in the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum [^113K26uf]. American Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to describe the treatment of women with hyperemesis gravidarum (HG). Women with HG pregnancies of at least 27 weeks duration occurring between 1985 and 2004 described their treatment on an HG website from 2003 to 2005. The usage and effectiveness of > 20 treatment options were reported by 765 women for 1193 pregnancies. The women who used intravenous (IV) hydration, serotonin inhibitors, and parenteral nutrition (PN) reported the highest rates of effectiveness, with 84%, 83%, and 79% reporting that these respective treatments may have contributed to decreased nausea/vomiting. The use of conventional treatments increased from 20 to 30% to > 60% between 1985 and 1989 and 2000 and 2004; serotonin inhibitor use increased to 55% after its introduction in the 1990s. Over the past 20 years, multiple treatments have been used for women with HG, with a trend toward treatment with reportedly more effective modalities, such as IV hydration and serotonin inhibitors.

### Systematic druggable genome-wide mendelian randomization identifies therapeutic targets for hyperemesis gravidarum [^11756R5g]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) is a common disorder in pregnancy with a relatively benign course. However, the most severe form, hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), is associated with adverse maternal, fetal, and offspring outcomes. HG is the leading cause of hospitalization in the first trimester, and generally occurs between 0.3 to 10.8% of pregnancies. HG refers to severe vomiting and simple dietary modification, leading to weight loss, ketonuria, nutritional deficiencies, electrolyte disturbances, preterm birth, and even maternal death. Despite significant advances in our understanding of HG, it remains a condition with complex etiology that is not fully understood. However, recent research has implicated the growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) as a significant factor in the pathogenesis of HG. While there are several treatments that have demonstrated efficacy in managing HG symptoms, including ondansetron and other antiemetics, the variability in treatment response underscores the need for more effective therapies. It is crucial to continue developing and identifying novel treatments, as HG can have profound impacts on affected individuals, including therapeutic terminations of pregnancy due to the severity of symptoms, suicidal ideation, and increased risks for adverse outcomes for both the mother and child.

A large-scale randomized clinical trial (RCT) is the most efficient method to estimate drug treatment strategies, however, it requires substantial preparation, economic support, and time for design and implementation. Fortunately, large-scale human genetic studies are successfully used in drug discovery pipelines, providing the potential for developing novel treatments for many complicated disorders. The proteins or gene expression profiles of druggable genes offer important clues about pharmacological targets. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have discovered that GDF15 and IGFBP7 are associated with hyperemesis gravidarum. Because of the complex mechanisms underlying HG, there are many undiscovered aspects awaiting our exploration using different methods.

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method using genetic variations as unconfounded unbiased proxies to investigate causal associations between risk factors and disease outcomes. By combining summary data of GWAS and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), MR analysis has been widely utilized to repurpose licensed medications and identify novel therapeutic targets.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^1143xGRU]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum — fetal effects — are influenced by severity; with mild or moderate vomiting there is little apparent effect on pregnancy outcome, studies have documented a lower rate of miscarriage compared with controls, no significant association with congenital anomalies has been demonstrated, and findings for low birth weight (LBW) are mixed with some studies showing no increase and a systematic review and meta-analysis showing higher incidence of LBW, small-for-gestational-age, and premature infants; no association with perinatal or neonatal mortality has been demonstrated in large retrospective cohorts, and it is appropriate to reassure patients that these conditions most often portend well for pregnancy outcome.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^112XCuda]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum — corticosteroids and dosing guidance: A randomized trial comparing methylprednisolone versus promethazine showed equal improvement but readmission within 2 weeks was significantly less with steroids; a later RCT found no reduction in rehospitalization, and a systematic review found reduced rehospitalization but no difference in hospital admission days. Three studies confirmed an association between oral clefts and first‑trimester methylprednisolone; the teratogenic effect is weak, probably accounting for no more than one or two cases per 1,000 treated women. Corticosteroid use for hyperemesis gravidarum should be used with caution and avoided as a first-line agent before 10 weeks of gestation. The most commonly described regimen is methylprednisolone, 48 mg daily for 3 days, given orally or intravenously; patients who do not respond within 3 days are not likely to respond and treatment should be stopped, while responders may taper over 2 weeks, and for recurrent vomiting the tapered dose may be stopped with continuation of the effective dose for up to 6 weeks. To limit serious maternal adverse effects, corticosteroids should not be continued beyond this period; methylprednisolone may be efficacious in refractory cases, but the risk profile suggests it should be a last-resort treatment.

### Wernicke encephalopathy in pregnancy associated with hyperemesis gravidarum: a case report [^112Nq1DR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Before considering termination of pregnancy, all possible therapeutic measures should be explored to ensure optimal management of severe NVP and HG. This includes the use of corticosteroids in treatment-resistant cases, as recommended by clinical guidelines, given their potential efficacy when other options have failed.

Early recognition and timely intervention in Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG) are crucial for preventing weight loss, general weakness, and recurrent hospitalizations. Comprehensive treatment should include medical management, patient education, dietary and lifestyle modifications, and emotional support. Such an approach not only improves maternal health and quality of life during pregnancy but also reduces the need for parenteral therapy, alleviating both the financial and emotional burden on families and the healthcare system.

There is limited evidence suggesting that pregnant women with HG often found interactions with healthcare professionals challenging, with many reporting that their concerns were dismissed and that the complications of HG were downplayed. In response to these challenges, Irish researchers have strongly advocated for the establishment of dedicated HG clinics. This type of service is an example of both individualized and multidisciplinary care. These interdisciplinary services offer comprehensive care, treatment, and support from midwives, dietitians, obstetricians, and mental health specialists. Patients attending these clinics receive an individualized assessment from a dietitian at each visit, with specialists determining the necessity of intravenous (IV) fluid therapy and vitamin supplementation, as well as reviewing or adjusting medication doses. As concluded in the study, dedicated multi-disciplinary HG clinics, available nationally and internationally for all women with HG, are strongly recommended.

Severe HG when left unmanaged, can progress to serious complications, including WE, necessitating a coordinated, interdisciplinary approach to patient care. This collaboration involves obstetricians, midwives, neurologists, psychiatrists, addiction specialists, dietitians, and social workers, each contributing their expertise to address the multifaceted needs of affected patients.

Midwives and obstetricians are often the first to detect signs of excessive vomiting and associated nutritional deficiencies during pregnancy. Their role includes monitoring for symptoms such as severe dehydration, weight loss, and neurological changes that could indicate the development of WE. Educating healthcare providers on the early neurological signs of thiamine deficiency, beyond the classical triad of WE, is essential to prevent delayed diagnosis. Early referral to neurologists is essential for assessing and managing potential cognitive or motor impairments resulting from thiamine deficiency that are a hallmark of WE.

### Optimisation of hyperemesis gravidarum management through an emergency department setting [^1147M8Af]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Each of the PDSA cycles included a different number of patients from which data were collected; this could be due to variable amounts of patients presenting to ED with hyperemesis gravidarum during the measurement periods. We collected the data for a 3-month block rather than including a set number of patients. We are unable to explain the reason for this variability. It is worth noting that in cycle 2, there seemed to be double the number of patients (44) compared with the previous data (29) and this could be due to an increased familiarity in the use of the pathway and therefore more patients were admitted on to the short stay unit rather than in the main ED. We believe that this indirectly helped divert patients away from the ED and helped create capacity for more unwell patients to be treated in the ED.

A second limitation would be that we were unable to comment on the care that the patients with hyperemesis gravidarum received after admission to an O&G ward as their medical notes on admission to O&G were not audited before the introduction of the pathway. By reviewing the online patient management database, we were only able to confirm that the average length of stay was more on the O&G wards (2.4 days) and this was reduced post-introduction of the pathway. We can only assume that this may have contributed to a better patient experience as this data was not collected during the audits.

### ACG clinical guideline: liver disease and pregnancy [^116QTnnP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Liver diseases unique to pregnancy — For hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), the treatment is supportive and may require hospitalization (strong recommendation, very low level of evidence). For intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (IHCP), early delivery after 37 weeks is recommended (strong recommendation, very low level of evidence), and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) should be given at 10–15 mg/kg to women with IHCP for symptomatic improvement (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence). Preeclampsia with hepatic involvement elevates the diagnosis to severe preeclampsia, and after 36 weeks, women with severe preeclampsia should be delivered promptly to limit maternal and fetal complications (strong recommendation, very low level of evidence). Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome should be managed by prompt delivery, especially after 34 weeks gestation (strong recommendation, very low level of evidence). Platelet transfusion to 40,000–50,000 cells/μl should be considered before delivery, especially if cesarean section is likely (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). Women with acute fatty liver disease of pregnancy (AFLP) should be delivered promptly; expectant management is not appropriate (strong recommendation, very low level of evidence). All women with AFLP and their children should have molecular testing for long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD; conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence), and the offspring of mothers affected by AFLP should be monitored carefully for manifestations of deficiency of LCHAD including hypoketotic hypoglycemia and fatty liver (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence).

ACOG Practice Bulletin — Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy definition, incidence, severity assessment, and hyperemesis gravidarum: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is common with "prevalence rates for nausea of 50–80% and for vomiting and retching of 50%", and "recurrence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy with subsequent pregnancies ranges from 15–81%". Severity has been categorized by daily duration and frequency, assessing "the duration of nausea and vomiting each day (from less than 1 hour in mild cases to more than 6 hours in severe cases)" and "the amount of vomiting and retching per day (up to two times for mild and moderate nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and more than five times in severe cases)". A validated "pregnancy-unique quantification of emesis and nausea (PUQE) assesses the severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy during the first trimester", and "scores from the PUQE index are associated with quality of life measurements", supporting clinical utility. Regarding timing of care, "Early treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be beneficial to prevent progression to hyperemesis gravidarum". For hyperemesis gravidarum, "No single accepted definition of hyperemesis gravidarum exists", it "is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion", and commonly cited criteria include "persistent vomiting", "usually large ketonuria", and weight loss "most often at least 5% of prepregnancy weight"; epidemiologically, it "appears to represent the extreme end of the spectrum of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy".

### Placenta-associated adverse pregnancy outcomes in women experiencing mild or severe hyperemesis gravidarum-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1156rtVG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The evidence of this research, although uncertain, suggests that women with HG may have an increased risk for adverse placenta-associated outcomes whilst women with NVP may have a reduced risk. Both women with NVP and HG have a high female/male fetal ratio, suggesting an interesting sexual dimorphism. The levels of hCG were found to be higher in women with HG. Further research is needed to draw grounded conclusions about any correlations. Above all, studies with lower risk of bias are needed to improve the certainty of evidence.

### Hyperemesis gravidarum… [^113rr7TU]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

By this term is usually meant that aggravated uncontrollable form of vomiting of pregnancy which resists local as well as constitutional treatment, and which so reduces the patient's vitality that it very seriously endangers her life. Occasionally, deaths directly due to this cause have been reported, so that a very serious and difficult problem confronts the physician who has charge of such a case. A large number of these patients abort as the result of the irritation of the uterus caused by the violent fits of retching and vomiting; this relieves by removing the source of the irritation. The lives of a number of these patients may be maintained for a time by rectal alimentation, but, unfortunately, by many this mode of feeding is not borne very well, especially if it must be kept up for a long time. Realizing, however, that the vomiting of pregnancy usually abates toward the ROSEWATER C. HYPEREMESIS GRAVIDARUM. JAMA. 1906; XLVI: 101–103.

### Effect of gabapentin on hyperemesis gravidarum: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial [^114CbVmx]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a disabling disease of nausea, vomiting, and undernutrition in early pregnancy for which there are no effective outpatient therapies. Poor weight gain in hyperemesis gravidarum is associated with several adverse fetal outcomes including preterm delivery, low birthweight, small for gestational age, low 5-minute Apgar scores, and neurodevelopmental delay. Gabapentin is most commonly used clinically for treating neuropathic pain but also substantially reduces chemotherapy-induced and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Pregnancy registry data have shown maternal first-trimester gabapentin monotherapy to be associated with a 1.2% rate of major congenital malformations among 659 infants, which compares favorably with the 1.6% to 2.2% major congenital malformation rate in the general population. Open-label gabapentin treatment in hyperemesis gravidarum was associated with reduced nausea and vomiting and improved oral nutrition.

Objective

This study aimed to determine whether gabapentin is more effective than standard-of-care therapy for treating hyperemesis gravidarum.

Study Design

A double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial was conducted among patients with medically refractory hyperemesis gravidarum requiring intravenous hydration. Patients were randomized (1:1) to either oral gabapentin (1800–2400 mg/d) or an active comparator of either oral ondansetron (24–32 mg/d) or oral metoclopramide (45–60 mg/d) for 7 days. Differences in Motherisk-pregnancy-unique quantification of nausea and emesis total scores between treatment groups averaged over days 5 to 7, using intention-to-treat principle employing a linear mixed-effects model adjusted for baseline Motherisk-pregnancy-unique quantification of nausea and emesis scores, which served as the primary endpoint. Secondary outcomes included Motherisk-pregnancy-unique quantification of nausea and emesis nausea and vomit and retch subscores, oral nutrition, global satisfaction of treatment, relief, desire to continue therapy, Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy Quality of Life, and Hyperemesis Gravidarum Pregnancy Termination Consideration. Adjustments for multiple comparisons were made employing the false discovery rate.

Results

A total of 31 patients with hyperemesis gravidarum were enrolled from October 2014 to May 2019. Among the 21 patients providing primary outcome data (12 assigned to gabapentin and 9 to the active comparator arm), 18 were enrolled as outpatients and all 21 were outpatients from days 5 to 7. The study groups' baseline characteristics were well matched. Gabapentin treatment provided a 52% greater reduction in days 5 to 7 baseline adjusted Motherisk-pregnancy-unique quantification of nausea and emesis total scores than treatment with active comparator (95% confidence interval, 16–88; P = 0.01). Most secondary outcomes also favored gabapentin over active comparator treatment including 46% and 49% decreases in baseline adjusted Motherisk-pregnancy-unique quantification of nausea and emesis nausea (95% confidence interval, 19–72; P = 0.005) and vomit and retch subscores (95% confidence interval, 21–77; P = 0.005), respectively; a 96% increase in baseline adjusted oral nutrition scores (95% confidence interval, 27–165; P = 0.01); and a 254% difference in global satisfaction of treatment (95% confidence interval, 48–459; P = 0.03). Relief (P = 0.06) and desire to continue therapy (P = 0.06) both showed trends favoring gabapentin treatment but Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy Quality of Life (P = 0.68) and Hyperemesis Gravidarum Pregnancy Termination Consideration (P = 0.58) did not. Adverse events were roughly equivalent between the groups. There were no serious adverse events.

Conclusion

In this small trial, gabapentin was more effective than standard-of-care therapy for reducing nausea and vomiting and increasing oral nutrition and global satisfaction in outpatients with hyperemesis gravidarum. These data build on previous findings in other patient populations supporting gabapentin as a novel antinausea and antiemetic therapy and support further research on gabapentin for this challenging complication of pregnancy.

### ECG changes in hyperemesis gravidarum [^116UJBCf]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

This is a case report of a 30-year-old patient presenting at advanced gestation with hyperemesis, who developed a prolonged QT interval secondary to electrolyte imbalance during recovery. This potentially fatal complication should be considered in all patients with hyperemesis gravidarum, especially after a prolonged period of starvation. We hope to highlight the importance of ECG monitoring and careful prescribing in such cases, something that is not considered in current guidelines.

### AGA clinical practice update on pregnancy-related gastrointestinal and liver disease: expert review [^115y1oYq]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) — clinical thresholds, prevalence, and course are summarized: HG can lead to dehydration, weight loss of > 5% of prepregnancy weight, and electrolyte imbalances. It can affect 0.3%–2% of pregnant persons and usually starts before 22 weeks of gestation. By week 16, symptoms resolve in > 50% of affected persons and by 20 weeks, 80% improve; however, in 10%, symptoms persist throughout pregnancy and occasionally into the postpartum period. In a meta-analysis, HG was associated with a higher female to male ratio of offspring and a higher frequency of low birth weight, small for gestational age, and preterm delivery, and higher growth or differentiation factor-15 levels in maternal blood were found to be associated with vomiting in pregnancy and HG.

### Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^114L5ZH5]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

More than half of pregnant women suffer from nausea and vomiting, which typically begins by the fourth week and disappears by the sixteenth week of pregnancy. The cause of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is unknown, but may be due to the rise in human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration. In 1 in 200 women, the condition progresses to hyperemesis gravidarum, which is characterised by prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy? What are the effects of treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to September 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 22 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupressure, acupuncture, antihistamines, corticosteroids, corticotrophins, diazepam, dietary interventions other than ginger, domperidone, ginger, metoclopramide, ondansetron, phenothiazines, and pyridoxine (vitamin B6).

### Managing hepatic complications of pregnancy: practical strategies for clinicians [^116GmF5C]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Key points

Pregnancy-specific liver diseases can be differentiated based on their timing within pregnancy, clinical features and laboratory values.
In hypertension-related disease, differentiating between haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) is challenging and criteria for both diseases have been developed to aid diagnosis.
Prompt delivery of the fetus is the most important management for pre-eclampsia with liver involvement, HELLP syndrome and AFLP.
Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is managed pharmacologically and with early delivery at 37 weeks gestation.
Management of hyperemesis gravidarum is supportive.
Prognosis of pregnancy-specific liver diseases has improved in recent years with earlier diagnosis and improvements in multidisciplinary management.
In the majority of cases, pregnancy-specific liver diseases have no long-term impact on liver function.

Data analysis

Data was entered into RevMan, and OR with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the dichotomous outcomes. Meta-analyses were performed for the outcomes with at least three studies, and forest plots were generated. For the outcomes reported in fewer than three studies, the study results were compared to each other and described in a narrative text. Women with NVP and with HG were analysed in different meta-analyses for the individual outcomes. Mild and severe HG were analysed together. Sensitivity analysis was performed for the studies with moderate or serious/critical risk of bias. Subgroups were created for each outcome, dividing the studies into women with NVP and women with HG. Heterogeneity was measured by I² and calculated in RevMan.

### Hyperemesis gravidarum and fetal outcome [^114aBBwf]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is reported in 0.5–2% of all pregnancies. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the relationship of maternal HG, neonatal birth weight, and birth outcomes.

Methods

This is a prospective cohort study of 45 patients diagnosed, by Fairweather's criteria, with HG compared with 306 non-HG control pregnant patients with singleton pregnancies. Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained from the pregnant patients. Neonatal data were also collected, including indicators of neonatal wellness.

Results

Significantly higher incidences of being nonwhite (33% vs 16%; p < .05) and of attaining post-high school education (60% vs 38%) were noted in the HG group, relative to controls. Mothers in the control group experienced greater gestational weight gain, 14.9 ± 0.3 kg (mean ± SEM) relative to mothers in the HG group (10.6 ± 1.3 kg). Infants from HG pregnancies manifested significantly lower birth weight (3.23 ± 0.09 kg vs 3.52 ± 0.03 kg), younger gestational age (38.4 ± 0.3 weeks vs 39.7 ± 0.1 weeks), and a greater length of hospital stay (2.9 ± 0.5 days vs 1.8 ± 0.1 day), relative to infants from the control group. After undergoing multivariate analysis, HG was a significant predictor of decreased gestational age and increased hospital length of stay.

Conclusions

Infants born of women who had HG are more likely to experience decreased gestational age and increased length of hospital stay. Efficacy of early and aggressive treatment of HG, including nutrition support, in minimizing these outcomes needs to be studied.

### Hyperemesis gravidarium: epidemiologic findings from a large cohort [^1149Tm2d]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to quantify the frequency, clinical course, charges, and outcomes of hyperemesis gravidarum.

Study Design

California birth certificate data linked with maternal and neonatal hospital discharge data in 1999 were used (N = 520,739). Hyperemesis was defined by ICD-9 codes. The frequency, estimated charges, and demographic characteristics associated with hyperemesis patients were assessed. Maternal and neonatal perinatal outcomes were compared by maternal hyperemesis status.

Results

Hyperemesis complicated 2,466 of 520,739 births. The average length of stay was 2.6 days and the average charge was $5,932. Singleton hyperemesis infants were smaller (3,255 vs 3,380 g; P < .0001 and more likely to be small for gestational age (29.21% vs 20.8%; P < .0001).

Conclusion

Hyperemesis occurs in 473 of 100,000 live births and is associated with significant charges. Infants of mothers with hyperemesis have lower birth weights and the mothers are more likely to have infants that are small for gestational age.

### Assessment of management approaches for hyperemesis gravidarum and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a retrospective questionnaire analysis [^115fm75d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data acquisition and study population

Before proceeding with the study, respondents were required to view and acknowledge written informed consent and were assured confidentiality. The questionnaire was administered via Google forms and each participant was asked to fill out one survey per child.

This questionnaire was distributed via institutional email, social media (including online international HG support groups and personal, non-HG related social media pages), as well as the Hyperemesis Education and Research (HER) Foundation website. Participants were incentivized with a raffle for gift cards of various amounts. Identifying information (email addresses) were collected at the time of data collection for the purpose of associating one participant with multiple pregnancies, resulting in multiple entries. This was necessary to separate those who may have had more than one child to determine the exact the number of participants, and sparse out duplicate data (if applicable). Identifiers were removed during data analysis and all information was kept on encrypted files on a password protected account and never shared with anyone outside of the research team. Inclusion criteria for this research included access to the internet, being assigned female sex at birth and birthing a live child. There was no limit regarding the number of pregnancies, how recently the pregnancy occurred, or country of residency.

Questionnaire development

The questionnaire (Additional file 1 Appendix A) was created by adapting the diagnostic criteria used by the HELP Score Assessment developed by the HER Foundation. Participants were asked to answer 26 questions, consisting of multiple-choice, Likert scales, and free-response question formats. The study was approved by the Rocky Vista University Institutional Review Board. A patient representative was consulted in the creation of the questionnaire to ensure accuracy and inclusivity from a patient's perspective.

Statistical analysis

All data in the dataset was coded as categorical and was therefore analyzed using contingency tables. The dimensions of these tables were dependent on the number of levels for each category. Since counts in cells were small in some cases, we base our main testing on Mantel-Haenszel Chi square tests for being more robust using smaller samples than asymptotic Pearson's chi square tests. All data analyzes were performed using SAS/STAT v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary NC). Significance was declared at 95% confidence (P -value ≤ 0.05).

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with a jejunal port for severe hyperemesis gravidarum [^111Bieqx]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum affects up to 2% of pregnancies and is characterized by severe nausea and vomiting persisting beyond the 14th week of gestation with weight loss, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and ketonuria. We present the case of a woman with severe, refractory hyperemesis gravidarum in whom treatment with a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with a jejunal extension allowed improvement of symptoms, reversal of maternal weight loss and the delivery of a healthy infant. Review of the literature reveals only one other paper describing this treatment. In all three cases successful outcomes for both mothers and children are described. We propose that percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with a jejunal extension is a safe, effective and relatively cheap intervention for severe, refractory hyperemesis gravidarum.

### Visual loss and encephalopathy in a pregnant patient with hyperemesis gravidarum [^114opoar]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A pregnant woman in her 20s at 17 weeks of gestation, presented with symptoms of painless diminution of vision preceded by 8 weeks history of hyperemesis gravidarum. On examination, she was confused, disoriented and had gait ataxia with complete loss of vision in both eyes. Fundus examination revealed grade 4 disc oedema with superficial retinal haemorrhages. Possibilities kept were cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE). Thiamine levels were low. MRI brain with MR venography revealed symmetrical areas of hyperintensities in bilateral medial thalami, hypothalamus, mammillary body and area postrema. She was managed as a case of WE with intravenous thiamine with complete clinical and radiological resolution within 2 weeks of treatment. Therefore, we conclude that a high index of suspicion of WE in appropriate clinical settings leading to early treatment can potentially reverse its grave clinical symptoms and complications.

### Hyperemesis in pregnancy: an evaluation of treatment strategies with maternal and neonatal outcomes [^115xWKXv]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to evaluate the use of interventions such as a peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) line or nasogastric (NG)/nasoduodenal (ND) tube with the use of medications alone in the management of pregnancies with hyperemesis.

Study Design

Subjects were identified with confirmed intrauterine pregnancy, admitted with hyperemesis gravidarum (HEG) between 1998 and 2004. Medical records were then abstracted for information with regard to therapy. Subjects were assigned on the basis of the management plan: medication alone, PICC line, or NG/ND tube. Outcomes were compared between groups.

Results

Ninety-four patients met study criteria and had complete outcome data available. Of those, 33 had a PICC line placed (35.1%), 19 had a NG/ND placed (20.2%), and 42 were managed with medication alone (44.7%). These groups were similar with respect to gestational age at delivery, Apgar score, and mean birthweight. Maternal complications were significantly higher among those with PICC lines. Of patients managed with PICC lines, 66.4% (P < .001) required treatment for infection, thromboembolism, or both. Adjusted odds ratio for a PICC line complication was 34.5 (5.09, 233.73).

Conclusion

Maternal complications associated with PICC line placement are substantial despite no difference in neonatal outcomes, suggesting that the use of PICC lines for treatment of HEG patients should not be routinely used.

### Pregnancy outcomes by hyperemesis gravidarum severity and time of diagnosis: a retrospective cohort study [^111hHCtW]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

With inconsistencies regarding the possible effect of hyperemesis gravidarum on the course of pregnancy, this research aimed to study the association between hyperemesis gravidarum and pregnancy outcomes, while also addressing the trimester of diagnosis and severity.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed, including all singleton deliveries of mothers from the largest health maintenance organization in the country, in a single tertiary hospital between 1991 and 2021. The incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes was compared between pregnancies with and without hyperemesis gravidarum diagnosis. Multivariable generalized estimation equation binary models were used to study the association between maternal hyperemesis gravidarum, trimester of diagnosis and hyperemesis gravidarum severity and the studied outcomes.

Results

The study population included 232476 pregnancies, of which 3227 (1.4%) were complicated with hyperemesis gravidarum. Women with hyperemesis gravidarum were more likely to deliver preterm (adj. OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.18–1.50), a newborn with low birthweight (adj. OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.16–1.98, only if diagnosed in the second trimester), and to have a cesarean delivery (adj. OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.09–1.32). They were less likely to deliver small gestational age newborn (adj. OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.69–0.99) and their offspring to experience perinatal mortality (adj. OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.31–0.93, among mild cases only). A dose-response association was observed between preterm birth and hyperemesis gravidarum (adj. OR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.11–1.44, for mild cases and adj. OR = 2.04; 95% CI: 1.31–3.19, for severe cases).

Conclusions

Hyperemesis gravidarum is associated with an increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes including mainly preterm delivery in a dose-response manner and when diagnosed during the second trimester.

Nausea and vomiting and hyperemesis gravidarum typically occur during the first trimester, the sensitive time for exposure to teratogens because organogenesis is occurring in the embryo. An efficacious treatment used widely across the United States for both nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum is ondansetron. Recent studies have provided conflicting findings on the safety of ondansetron during pregnancy. There are numerous limitations in the current literature on ondansetron safety including exposure to the medication is not limited to sensitive windows of organogenesis, there is a lack of information on dosing and compliance, self-reports of exposure are commonly used, an inadequate accounting exists for other factors that may explain the relationship between ondansetron exposure and the adverse outcome, and there exists a lack of biologic plausibility by which ondansetron might cause harm. It is the authors' opinion that current data do not support a reluctance to treat women with ondansetron in clinical practice.

### Which drug is more effective for treating hyperemesis… [^111bhmKw]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Background: Hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe form of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy that can cause dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and weight loss. It affects 0. 3 to
2. 3 percent of all pregnancies. Less severe forms of nausea and vomiting affect up to 85 percent of all pregnancies. Treatment for hyperemesis gravidarum may require hospitalization, and includes intravenous rehydration, antiemetic medications, and psychosocial support. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends intravenous dimenhydrinate, metoclopramide, and promethazine as first-line medications. Previous studies have evaluated promethazine, ondansetron, corticosteroids, metoclopramide, and diphenhydramine, but no trial has directly compared metoclopramide and promethazine. Tan and colleagues assessed the effectiveness and adverse effect profiles of these drugs as treatment for hyperemesis gravidarum.

The Study: This randomized controlled study included women admitted to a hospital in Malaysia with presumed hyperemesis. Patients who were no more than 16 weeks pregnant and were admitted to the hospital for the first time in their current pregnancy with dehydration and ketonuria were eligible to participate. Women who had a multiple gestation pregnancy, nonviable pregnancy, a preexisting medical condition that could cause nausea and vomiting, or an allergy to either study medication were excluded. Patients received an initial dose of 10 mg of metoclopramide or 25 mg of promethazine, and additional doses at eight, 16, and 24 hours. Participants recorded their vomiting episodes and reported their nausea on a 10-point visual numeric scale before starting the drug and after each dose. The seven women who did not complete the trial because of adverse effects were all in the promethazine group.

Limitations of the study include the possibility that intravenous rehydration therapy alone is equally effective in treating hyperemesis. Additionally, the authors cite a Cochrane review that found no benefit with any specific treatment for hyperemesis gravidarum. Conclusion: The authors conclude that when metoclopramide is given in a dosage of 10 mg every eight hours, it is as effective as and better tolerated than promethazine for hyperemesis gravidarum.

### Wernicke encephalopathy in pregnancy associated with hyperemesis gravidarum: a case report [^116vNiN8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, there are no universally accepted guidelines specifying exact blood thiamine levels that should trigger therapeutic intervention. Given this, clinical decision-making should prioritize early recognition of symptoms and implementation of preventative strategies, rather than relying solely on laboratory-confirmed deficiency. Reference values may vary between laboratories, and the interpretation of results should take into account the patient's clinical status and symptoms suggestive of thiamine deficiency. In cases where thiamine deficiency is suspected, such as in hyperemesis gravidarum, chronic malnutrition, prolonged parenteral nutrition, or alcohol use disorder, early administration of high-dose thiamine is recommended, even before laboratory confirmation. While thiamine deficiency is typically defined as a blood thiamine level below 28 µg/L (2.1 nmol/L), a severe deficiency requiring urgent intervention is generally considered when levels fall below 7 µg/L (0.5 nmol/L). However, the presence of neurological symptoms consistent with WE (ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, confusion) should prompt immediate administration of 500 mg IV (intravenous) thiamine every 8 h for 3 days, followed by 250 mg IV daily for 5 additional days, in accordance with recent clinical guidelines. The presence of neurological symptoms is emphasized in the diagnostic criteria for Wernicke encephalopathy, as decreased thiamine levels alone is insufficient to establish the diagnosis. Given the potentially irreversible neurological damage associated with thiamine deficiency, particularly in high-risk populations, preventive supplementation (oral 100 mg tds or intravenous as part of vitamin B complex) should be considered in individuals with prolonged vomiting, severe malnutrition, or other conditions predisposing to tiamine depletion. Although there are recommendations for the treatment of Wernicke encephalopathy, they are not specifically tailored to pregnant women. Existing guidelines for pregnant women in the context of hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) mainly focus on the prevention of WE. There are some case reports of WE in pregnancy with various doses of thiamine administered (ranging from 100 to 500 mg a day orally or intravenously).

### Outcomes of pregnancies complicated by hyperemesis gravidarum [^113dP1Hs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate maternal and neonatal outcomes among women with hyperemesis during pregnancy.

Methods

A population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among women with singleton deliveries between 1988 and 2002. Hyperemetic pregnancies were defined as those requiring one or more antepartum admissions for hyperemesis before 24 weeks of gestation. Severity of hyperemesis was evaluated according to the number of antenatal hospital admissions (1 or 2 versus 3 or more) and according to weight gain during pregnancy (< 7 kg [15.4 lb] versus ≥ 7 kg). Maternal outcomes evaluated included weight gain during pregnancy, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, labor induction, and cesarean delivery. Neonatal outcomes included 5-minute Apgar score of less than 7, low birth weight, small for gestational age, preterm delivery, and perinatal death. Logistic regression was used to generate adjusted odds ratios for all outcomes, and the odds ratios were converted to relative risks.

Results

Of the 156,091 singleton pregnancies, 1,270 had an admission for hyperemesis. Compared to women without hyperemesis, infants born to women with hyperemesis and with low pregnancy weight gain (< 7 kg [15.4 lb]) were more likely to be low birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), born before 37 weeks of gestation, and have a 5-minute Apgar score of less than 7. Compared with infants born to women without hyperemesis, rates of low birth weight and preterm delivery were substantially higher among infants born to women with hyperemesis and low pregnancy weight gain (4.2% versus 12.5% and 4.9% versus 13.9%, respectively). The outcomes among infants born to women with hyperemesis with pregnancy weight gain of 7 kg (15.4 lb) or more were not different from the outcomes among women without hyperemesis.

Conclusion

The results of this study suggest that the adverse infant outcomes associated with hyperemesis are a consequence of, and mostly limited to, women with poor maternal weight gain.

### Antiemetic treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum in 1, 064 Norwegian women and the impact of European warning on metoclopramide: a retrospective cohort study 2002–2019 [^113jeLmk]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Women suffering from severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, hyperemesis gravidarum, have poor quality of life and increased risk of potentially fatal maternal and fetal complications. There is increasing and reassuring knowledge about safety of antiemetics in pregnancy. In 2013, the European Medical Agency (EMA) issued a warning on metoclopramide limiting treatment to maximum five days. Metoclopramide was the most used antiemetic in pregnancy at the time the warning was implemented in the Norwegian hyperemesis guidelines (2014). We aimed at describing changes in the treatment of hyperemesis over time, including changes associated with the EMA warning.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of all women hospitalized for hyperemesis gravidarum with metabolic disturbances between 01/Jan/2002 and 31/Dec/2019 at a university hospital serving nearly 10% of the pregnant population in Norway. Time-series analysis described changes over time and interrupted time series analysis quantified changes in treatment and clinical outcomes related to the EMA warning.

Results

In total, 1,064 women (1.2% of the birthing population) were included. The use of meclizine, prochlorperazine, and ondansetron increased during 2002–2019. This led to a yearly increase in the percentage of women using any antiemetic of 1.5% (95%CI 0.6; 2.4) pre-hospital, 0.6% (95%CI 0.2; 1.1) during hospitalization, and 2.6% (95%CI 1.3; 3.8) at discharge. Overall, only 50% of the women received antiemetics pre-hospital. Following the EMA warning, prehospital use of metoclopramide dropped by 30% (95%CI 25; 36), while use of any antiemetic pre-hospital dropped by 20% (95%CI 5.7; 34). In timely association, we observed a decrease in gestational age (-3.8 days, 98.75%CI 0.6; 7.1) at first admission, as well as indication of increased rate of termination of pregnancy with an absolute increase of 4.8% (98.75%CI 0.9; 8.7) in 2014.

Conclusion

During 2002–2019, the overall use of antiemetics in treatment of hyperemesis increased. The EMA-warning on metoclopramide in 2013 temporarily limited pre-hospital antiemetic provision associated with hospitalization at lower gestational length and indication of an increase in termination of pregnancy.

### The impact and management of hyperemesis gravidarum: current and future perspectives [^115dsuKU]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

People with HG have insufficient nutritional intake. Dietetic consultation may be helpful in expanding food choices, prescribing oral nutritional support, monitoring nutritional deficiencies, and optimizing intake. If rehydration therapy and antiemetics do not reduce nausea and vomiting to normalize nutritional intake, parenteral or enteral nutrition supplementation should be considered. Results on the efficacy of tube feeding vary, with the result that there are no defined criteria for starting parenteral or enteral tube feeding. A retrospective cohort in Norway found that enteral nutrition provided for patients with insufficient rehydration and partial parenteral supplementation was associated with adequate maternal and favorable pregnancy outcomes. Contrarily, a trial investigating tube feeding started on the first day of admission in addition to standard care did not find an improvement in birth weight or secondary outcomes. Both the RCOG and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend enteral tube feeding to provide nutritional support in those with HG who do not respond to antiemetic therapy. Parenteral nutrition may be applicable to individuals with a long course of HG and significant weight loss, but should only be used as a last resort in those in whom enteral tube feeding is not possible due to the associated risk of complications.

### Managing hyperemesis gravidarum: a multimodal challenge [^114nF2ax]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Medication

If symptoms cannot be managed by dietary and lifestyle changes alone, low dose antiemetics may be administered. All pharmacologic interventions should be based upon known safety, proven efficacy and cost effectiveness.

In a metaanalysis of 28 randomized trials of medications for the treatment of HG, antiemetics diminished nausea in early pregnancy and were superior to placebo. Ondansetron is one of the more commonly used and effective drugs and has relatively few side effects.

Other recommended options are the use of metoclopramide to improve gastrointestinal motility and administration of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Pyridoxine is given three times daily at a dose of 10–25 mg starting with a low dose that may reduce symptoms and has been proven to be more effective than placebo. The daily dose can be increased up to 200 mg without side effects. However, a more recent placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that a combination of oral pyridoxine and metoclopramide did not improve the vomiting frequency or the nausea score.

Antihistamines and anticholinergics such as meclizine, dimenhydrinate and diphenhydramine have also been shown to be superior to placebo and can be used safely for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (see Table 2).

However, the side effect profiles vary between the different medications: While nearly all of the above mentioned medicaments may cause dizziness, drowsiness, constipation or dry mouth, more severe adverse effects comprise convulsions, decreased alertness, heartbeat alterations and hallucinations (doxylamine, metoclopramide, diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine). Headache, muscle pain or tremor and fever (prednisolone, procholrperazine, promethazine, dimenhydrinate, doxylamine, metoclopramide) may also occur.

Interestingly, diazepam also has positive effects on HG, probably due to its sedative properties. A prospective randomized clinical trial in 74 patients showed that a combination of antiemetic therapy and diazepam reduced the need for hospitalization and improved patient satisfaction. Frequent use of diazepam, however, might lead to dependency. Another risk factor that must be taken into consideration is the possibility of fetal side effects. Antidepressants such as mirtazapine have also been used with some success in ameliorating the symptoms of HG.

### Differential diagnosis and… [^113KED1U]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of nausea and vomiting, affects one in 200 pregnant women. 4 Although the definition of this condition has not been standardized, accepted clinical features include persistent vomiting, dehydration, ketosis, electrolyte disturbances, and weight loss. Multiple gestation, gestational trophoblastic disease, triploidy, trisomy 21 syndrome, and hydrops fetalis have been associated with an increased incidence of hyperemesis gravidarum.
5. Many reports have suggested that hormones may cause nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum. In one comparative study. A recent study 10 suggested that chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori may play a role in hyperemesis gravidarum. In this study, 61. 8 percent of pregnant women with hyper-emesis were found to be positive for the H. pylori genome, compared with 27. 6 percent of pregnant women without hyperemesis.

11, 12 In contrast, hyperemesis gravidarum has been associated with increases in maternal adverse effects, including splenic avulsion, esophageal rupture, Mallory-Weiss tears, pneumothorax, peripheral neuropathy, and preeclampsia, as well as increases in fetal growth restriction and mortality. 13–15. Treatment The management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy depends on the severity of the symptoms. Treatment measures range from dietary changes to more aggressive approaches involving antiemetic medications, hospitalization, or even total parenteral nutrition. We prefer to start with dietary changes and then add medications as necessary. A Cochrane review of various nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum was recently published.

Of note, these and other authors have found that almost all women with hyperemesis gravidarum can tolerate oral corticosteroid therapy. We have used the two-week tapering regimen in pregnant women who have been refractory to standard antiemetic therapy and have noted a subjective decrease in hospitalization rates and readmissions. Corticosteroid therapy generally is considered safe during pregnancy. However, a recent meta-analysis. 34 demonstrated a marginally increased risk of major malformation and a 3. 4-fold increased risk of oral cleft in infants exposed to corticosteroids in the first trimester.

### A case of osmotic demyelination syndrome occurred after the correction of severe hyponatraemia in hyperemesis gravidarum [^113TksPZ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We reported here a case of ODS occurred in a pregnant woman with hyperemesis gravidarum after an overly rapid correction of low serum [Na +] in the presence of several concomitant risk factors. The overly rapid increase of serum sodium may has been likely caused by the simultaneous correction of severe hypokalemia and it might have been prevented by a more cautious and thoughtful management of the patient. This case may very well be considered as an appropriate example to reinforce warning among physicians about the care that should be taken in a clinical setting, in order to prevent rapid changes in serum osmolarity, which may lead to dramatic and sometimes irreversible consequences.

### Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^116X3M7v]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common experiences in pregnancy, affecting 70% to 80% of all pregnant women. Various metabolic and neuromuscular factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), an entity distinct from NVP. However, their exact cause is unknown. Consequently, treatment of NVP and HG can be difficult, as neither the optimal targets for treatment nor the full effects of potential treatments on the developing fetus are known. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis, outcomes, and treatment of NVP and HG.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^111xmwP9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy — The following recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C): Early treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be beneficial to prevent progression to hyperemesis gravidarum. Intravenous hydration should be used for the patient who cannot tolerate oral liquids for a prolonged period or if clinical signs of dehydration are present. Correction of ketosis and vitamin deficiency should be strongly considered. Dextrose and vitamins should be included in the therapy when prolonged vomiting is present, and thiamine should be administered before dextrose infusion to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy. Enteral tube feeding (nasogastric or nasoduodenal) should be initiated as the first-line treatment to provide nutritional support to the woman with hyperemesis gravidarum who is not responsive to medical therapy and cannot maintain her weight. Peripherally inserted central catheters should not be used routinely in women with hyperemesis gravidarum given the significant complications associated with this intervention. Peripherally inserted central catheters should be utilized only as a last resort in the management of a woman with hyperemesis gravidarum because of the potential of severe maternal morbidity.

### AGA clinical practice update on pregnancy-related gastrointestinal and liver disease: expert review [^115A42i5]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update is to review the available published evidence and expert advice regarding the clinical management of patients with pregnancy-related gastrointestinal and liver disease.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through the standard procedures of Gastroenterology. This article provides practical advice for the management of pregnant patients with gastrointestinal and liver disease based on the best available published evidence. The Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because formal systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: To optimize gastrointestinal and liver disease before pregnancy, preconception and contraceptive care counseling by a multidisciplinary team should be encouraged for reproductive-aged persons who desire to become pregnant. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Procedures, medications, and other interventions to optimize maternal health should not be withheld solely because a patient is pregnant and should be individualized after an assessment of the risks and benefits. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Coordination of birth for a pregnant patient with complex inflammatory bowel disease, advanced cirrhosis, or a liver transplant should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, preferably in a tertiary care center. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Early treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may reduce progression to hyperemesis gravidarum. In addition to standard diet and lifestyle measures, stepwise treatment consists of symptom control with vitamin B6 and doxylamine, hydration, and adequate nutrition; ondansetron, metoclopramide, promethazine, and intravenous glucocorticoids may be required in moderate to severe cases. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Constipation in pregnant persons may result from hormonal, medication-related, and physiological changes. Treatment options include dietary fiber, lactulose, and polyethylene glycol-based laxatives. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Elective endoscopic procedures should be deferred until the postpartum period, whereas nonemergent but necessary procedures should ideally be performed in the second trimester. Pregnant patients with cirrhosis should undergo evaluation for, and treatment of, esophageal varices; upper endoscopy is suggested in the second trimester (if not performed within 1 year before conception) to guide consideration of nonselective β-blocker therapy or endoscopic variceal ligation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, clinical remission before conception, during pregnancy, and in the postpartum period is essential for improving outcomes of pregnancy. Biologic agents should be continued throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period; use of methotrexate, thalidomide, and ozanimod must be stopped at least 6 months before conception. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography during pregnancy may be performed for urgent indications, such as choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, and some cases of gallstone pancreatitis. Ideally, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should be performed during the second trimester, but if deferring the procedure may be detrimental to the health of the patient and fetus, a multidisciplinary team should be convened to decide on the advisability of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Cholecystectomy is safe during pregnancy; a laparoscopic approach is the standard of care regardless of trimester, but ideally in the second trimester. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: The diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is based on a serum bile acid level > 10 μmol/L in the setting of pruritus, typically during the second or third trimester. Treatment should be offered with oral ursodeoxycholic acid in a total daily dose of 10–15 mg/kg. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Management of liver diseases unique to pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia; hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome; and acute fatty liver of pregnancy requires planning for delivery and timely evaluation for possible liver transplantation. Daily aspirin prophylaxis for patients at risk for pre-eclampsia or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome is advised beginning at week 12 of gestation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, serum hepatitis B virus DNA and liver biochemical test levels should be ordered. Patients not on treatment but with a serum hepatitis B virus DNA level > 200,000 IU/mL during the third trimester of pregnancy should be considered for treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: In patients on immunosuppressive therapy for chronic liver diseases or after liver transplantation, therapy should be continued at the lowest effective dose during pregnancy. Mycophenolate mofetil should not be administered during pregnancy.
