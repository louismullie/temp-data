## Question

34. Using each of the nine digits 1,2,3, …,9 exactly once, write down three numbers such that their sum is the greatest possible, and the difference between the largest and smallest numbers is as small as possible. Find this sum and difference.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to find three numbers using each digit from 1 to 9 exactly once, such that their sum is maximized and the difference between the largest and smallest numbers is minimized. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to maximize the sum by placing larger digits in higher place values. Then, I should verify the constraint that each digit is used exactly once. Next, I will consider how to minimize the range between the largest and smallest numbers while keeping the sum maximal. Finally, I will check for competing configurations and confirm the optimal solution with a clear statement of the sum and difference.

> Let me first confirm the objective and constraints. We must use each digit 1 through 9 exactly once to form three numbers, maximize their total sum, and simultaneously minimize the difference between the largest and smallest of those three numbers. This is a combinatorial optimization problem with two objectives, where maximizing the sum is primary and minimizing the range is secondary, so I should prioritize the sum first and then optimize the range within the maximal-sum solutions.

> To maximize the sum, I need to place the largest digits in the highest place values. The most significant contribution comes from the hundreds place, so I should assign 9, 8, and 7 to the hundreds digits of the three numbers. Then, I should assign the next largest digits to the tens places and the remaining digits to the units places, which will yield the largest possible total sum under the digit-uniqueness constraint.

> Wait, let me verify the maximal-sum configuration. If I assign 9, 8, 7 to hundreds, 6, 5, 4 to tens, and 3, 2, 1 to units, the sum is (900 + 800 + 700) + (60 + 50 + 40) + (3 + 2 + 1) = 2400 + 150 + 6 = 2556. I initially thought this might be the unique maximal sum, but hold on, I should double-check whether swapping tens and units while keeping hundreds fixed could yield the same total; yes, any permutation of 6,5,4 across tens and 3,2,1 across units will still sum to 2556, so the maximal sum is 2556 and there are multiple maximal-sum arrangements.

> Now, among all maximal-sum arrangements, I need to minimize the difference between the largest and smallest numbers. Let me consider the structure: the hundreds digits are 9, 8, 7, so the largest possible number starts with 9 and the smallest with 7, giving a base difference of at least 200. To reduce the range, I should make the 9xx number as small as possible and the 7xx number as large as possible by carefully assigning the tens and units digits.

> I will now examine candidate configurations. Let me try 9 3 2, 8 6 1, 7 5 4. The numbers are 932, 861, and 754. The sum is 932 + 861 + 754 = 2547, which is less than 2556, so this sacrifices the maximal sum and is not acceptable. Hmm, wait a minute, I should not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure I keep the hundreds fixed as 9, 8, 7 and only permute tens and units to stay within maximal-sum solutions.

> Next, I should review maximal-sum candidates that minimize the range. Let me try 9 1 2, 8 5 3, 7 6 4. The numbers are 912, 853, and 764. The sum is 912 + 853 + 764 = 2529, which again is below 2556; I see the mistake now — assigning smaller tens to the 9xx number and larger tens to the 7xx number reduces the range but can lower the total if I inadvertently change the hundreds assignment. I need to keep hundreds as 9, 8, 7 and only adjust tens and units.

> Hold on, I should verify the correct approach. Within the maximal-sum set, I should pair the largest hundreds with the smallest remaining tens and units to pull the maximum downward, and pair the smallest hundreds with the largest remaining tens and units to push the minimum upward. Let me try 9 1 3, 8 5 2, 7 6 4. The numbers are 913, 852, and 764, and the sum is 913 + 852 + 764 = 2529, which is still not 2556; I realize I am repeatedly misassigning digits. Let me reconsider and strictly assign 9, 8, 7 to hundreds, then 6, 5, 4 to tens, and 3, 2, 1 to units, and only permute within those groups to preserve the maximal sum of 2556.

> Let me correct this and enumerate maximal-sum options systematically. With hundreds fixed as 9, 8, 7, the tens must be 6, 5, 4 and the units must be 3, 2, 1. To minimize the range, I should assign the smallest tens and units to the 9xx number and the largest tens and units to the 7xx number. So, 9 4 1, 8 5 2, 7 6 3 gives 941, 852, and 763. The sum is 941 + 852 + 763 = 2556, and the range is 941 − 763 = 178. Is this the minimal possible range among maximal-sum solutions? I should check alternatives, but any other assignment of 6,5,4 and 3,2,1 will increase the spread because it will either raise the maximum or lower the minimum, so 178 appears to be optimal for the range under the maximal-sum constraint.

> I should confirm that no other configuration achieves a smaller range while keeping the sum at 2556. Suppose I try to make the 9xx number smaller by giving it 4 and 2, and compensate by giving 8xx 5 and 1, and 7xx 6 and 3; that yields 942, 851, 763, with range 942 − 763 = 179, which is larger than 178. Similarly, assigning 9 4 3, 8 5 1, 7 6 2 gives 943, 851, 762, with range 943 − 762 = 181, again larger. Thus, 941, 852, 763 indeed minimizes the range among maximal-sum arrangements.

> Final answer: The maximal possible sum is 2556, achieved by multiple arrangements of the form 9ab, 8cd, 7ef where {a, c, e} is a permutation of {6,5,4} and {b, d, f} is a permutation of {3,2,1}. Among these, the arrangement 941, 852, 763 yields the smallest difference between the largest and smallest numbers, which is 178 [^notfound].

---

The greatest possible sum is **2556**, achieved by the numbers 941, 852, and 763. The smallest possible difference between the largest and smallest numbers is **178**. This solution balances maximizing the sum by placing the largest digits in the hundreds place while minimizing the difference by distributing the remaining digits to keep the numbers as close as possible.

---

## Strategy to maximize the sum

To maximize the sum, place the largest digits in the highest place values. The optimal approach is:

- **Hundreds place**: 9, 8, 7
- **Tens place**: 6, 5, 4
- **Units place**: 3, 2, 1

This yields a maximum sum of 2556.

---

## Strategy to minimize the difference

To minimize the difference between the largest and smallest numbers, distribute the remaining digits to keep the numbers as close as possible. The optimal distribution is:

- **941**: 9 (hundreds), 4 (tens), 1 (units)
- **852**: 8 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units)
- **763**: 7 (hundreds), 6 (tens), 3 (units)

The difference is 941 − 763 = **178**.

---

## Verification of the solution

- **Sum**: 941 + 852 + 763 = 2556
- **Difference**: 941 − 763 = 178

This solution uses each digit from 1 to 9 exactly once and achieves the maximum sum with the smallest possible difference.

---

## Alternative solutions

Other combinations can achieve the same sum but result in a larger difference. For example:

- **942, 851, 763**: sum = 2556, difference = 179
- **943, 851, 762**: sum = 2556, difference = 181

These alternatives confirm that 941, 852, and 763 provide the optimal balance of maximum sum and minimum difference.

---

The greatest possible sum is **2556**, and the smallest possible difference is **178**, achieved by the numbers 941, 852, and 763.

### Too many digits: the presentation of numerical data [^a41454ae]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Thus a decimal places rule that ignores significant digits does not work. But equally, and perhaps surprisingly, a significant digits rule that ignores decimal places does not always work either. Reporting risk ratios to three significant digits for example leads to the largest ratio below 1 being reported as 0.999 and the smallest above 1 as 1.01, with three and two decimal places, respectively. This is clearly unsatisfactory as they differ in precision by a factor of ten. In this instance a combination of significant digits and decimal places, the rule of four, works best: round the risk ratio to two significant digits if the leading non-zero digit is four or more, otherwise round to three.

The rule of four gives three decimal places for risk ratios from 0.040 to 0.399, two from 0.40 to 3.99 and one from 4.0 to 39.9. Applying it to the example of 22.68 above gives 22.7 (95% CI 7.5 to 74). Alternatively one can apply the rule with one less significant digit, giving 23 with CI 8 to 70.

Another example is the reporting of test statistics such as t or F. Specifying one decimal place would permit say t = 30.1, where 30 is clearly sufficient as it is so highly significant. Conversely specifying two significant digits would permit t = −0.13, where again the extra precision is irrelevant as it is far from significant. A suitable rule specifies up to one decimal place and up to two significant digits.

When comparing group means or percentages in tables, rounding should not blur the differences between them. This is the basis for the Hopkins two digits rule, whereby the mean has enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the SD. An analogous rule for percentages might be to use enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the range of values across groups, eg, if the range is 10% or more use whole numbers, if less than 1% use two decimal places, and otherwise one. In practice percentages are usually given along with their corresponding frequencies, so precision is less critical as the exact values can be calculated.

### Number processing induces spatial performance biases [^177809db]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Response speed in parity judgments is faster with the left hand for small numbers (e.g., 1 or 2) and faster with the right hand for larger numbers (e.g., 8 or 9). This effect suggests that number processing can induce systematic spatial biases in bisection tasks.

Method

Neurologically healthy participants bisected visually presented stimuli with a pencil. Stimuli were long strings of uniform digits (experiment 1) or lines with single digit flankers (experiment 2).

Results

Bisection performance was biased to the left of center for strings made of digits 1 or 2 and to the right of center for strings made of digits 8 or 9. Line bisection was biased toward the flanker representing the larger magnitude, regardless of its position.

Conclusions

These results extend previous findings and support the notion of an automatic association of number magnitudes with spatial response codes. The effect may be useful for an assessment of semantic number processing in special populations.

### Making sense of number words and Arabic digits: does order count more? [^10cd7b6e]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

The ability to choose the larger between two numbers reflects a mature understanding of the magnitude associated with numerical symbols. The present study explores how the knowledge of the number sequence and memory capacity (verbal and visuospatial) relate to number comparison skills while controlling for cardinal knowledge. Preschool children's (N = 140, M age-in-months = 58.9, range = 41–75) knowledge of the directional property of the counting list as well as the spatial mapping of digits on the visual line were assessed. The ability to order digits on the visual line mediated the relation between memory capacity and number comparison skills while controlling for cardinal knowledge. Beyond cardinality, the knowledge of the (spatial) order of numbers marks the understanding of the magnitude associated with numbers.

### Symbolic arithmetic knowledge without instruction [^d0ca42f7]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

Symbolic arithmetic is fundamental to science, technology and economics, but its acquisition by children typically requires years of effort, instruction and drill. When adults perform mental arithmetic, they activate nonsymbolic, approximate number representations, and their performance suffers if this nonsymbolic system is impaired. Nonsymbolic number representations also allow adults, children, and even infants to add or subtract pairs of dot arrays and to compare the resulting sum or difference to a third array, provided that only approximate accuracy is required. Here we report that young children, who have mastered verbal counting and are on the threshold of arithmetic instruction, can build on their nonsymbolic number system to perform symbolic addition and subtraction. Children across a broad socio-economic spectrum solved symbolic problems involving approximate addition or subtraction of large numbers, both in a laboratory test and in a school setting. Aspects of symbolic arithmetic therefore lie within the reach of children who have learned no algorithms for manipulating numerical symbols. Our findings help to delimit the sources of children's difficulties learning symbolic arithmetic, and they suggest ways to enhance children's engagement with formal mathematics.

### A magnitude code common to numerosities and number symbols in human intraparietal cortex [^f299ca27]. Neuron (2007). Low credibility.

Activation of the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (hIPS) has been observed in various number-processing tasks, whether numbers were conveyed by symbolic numerals (digits, number words) or by nonsymbolic displays (dot patterns). This suggests an abstract coding of numerical magnitude. Here, we critically tested this hypothesis using fMRI adaptation to demonstrate notation-independent coding of numerical quantity in the hIPS. Once subjects were adapted either to dot patterns or to Arabic digits, activation in the hIPS and in frontal regions recovered in a distance-dependent fashion whenever a new number was presented, irrespective of notation changes. This remained unchanged when analyzing the hIPS peaks from an independent localizer scan of mental calculation. These results suggest an abstract coding of approximate number common to dots, digits, and number words. They support the idea that symbols acquire meaning by linking neural populations coding symbol shapes to those holding nonsymbolic representations of quantities.

### Automatic extraction of meaning from visual number symbols detected by frequency-tagged EEG in children [^cb60d70e]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

Acquiring robust semantic representations of numbers is crucial for math achievement. However, the learning stage where magnitude becomes automatically elicited by number symbols (i.e., digits from 1 to 9) remains unknown due to the difficulty to measure automatic semantic processing. We used a frequency-tagging EEG paradigm targeting automatic magnitude processing in children (N = 33, 5-10-year-old, predominantly of White or Mixed ethnicity). A stream of digits (1–9) was presented at 10Hz with small digits as standards, and large digits as deviants at 1.25Hz (and the reverse). Frequency-tagged responses to the deviants show that magnitude is a salient semantic feature associated with digits in long-term memory. Automatic access to magnitude can be measured with EEG in children at the end of preschool.

### Numerical magnitude in the human parietal lobe; tests of representational generality and domain specificity [^c0d597a7]. Neuron (2004). Low credibility.

Behavioral evidence suggests that human adults have a single system for representing the numerical magnitude of both symbolic numbers (e.g. Arabic digits) and nonsymbolic number stimuli (e.g., dot arrays). Brain imaging studies have implicated a specific parietal region in symbolic number processing, leading to the influential hypothesis that this region is the locus of a dedicated, domain-specific number system. Here we evaluated a prediction of this hypothesis, that this region should be activated not only by symbolic but also nonsymbolic number processing. Using nonsymbolic stimuli, we tested for higher parietal activations for number than for nonnumber comparison tasks (experiment 1), fMRI adaptation for numerosity repetition (experiment 2), and greater fMRI increases with increasing task difficulty for number than nonnumber tasks (experiment 3). None of these predictions were supported by the data, posing a serious challenge to the hypothesis that a single, domain-specific parietal region underlies both symbolic and nonsymbolic number representation.

### The fibonacci sequence: relationship to the human hand [^a387acdc]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

The motion path of the digits follows the path of an equiangular spiral in which a constant angle is formed by all radial vectors along the curve. This implies that the lengths of the metacarpals, proximal, middle, and distal phalanges approximate a Fibonacci sequence in which the ratio of any 2 consecutive numbers approaches the number 1.61803 (phi). This study tested the hypothesis that the metacarpal and phalangeal bone lengths follow the Fibonacci relationship.

Methods

Standardized x-rays were taken of the hands of 100 healthy volunteers. The proximal phalanx length was subtracted from the sum of the lengths of the middle and distal phalanges and the metacarpal length was subtracted from the sum of the lengths of the middle and proximal phalanges. Confidence intervals for the quotients of the measured lengths of the adjacent bones of the hand also were used for statistical analysis.

Results

Only 1 of 12 bone length ratios contained the ratio phi in the 95% confidence interval, that of the small finger metacarpal and proximal phalanx. The largest variability was seen in the small finger phalangeal relationships.

Conclusion

The application of the Fibonacci sequence to the anatomy of the human hand, although previously accepted, is a relationship that is not supported mathematically. The difference between individual bone lengths as measured at the joint line and the center of rotation of the joints may explain our finding.

2.3.2 Numerosity comparison

Three dot arrays were presented simultaneously on the screen. The target array was presented in upper part of the screen, and two candidate arrays were presented in the lower half of the screen. Participants were asked to judge which candidate array contained the same number of dots as the target array. However, as this was not a matching task, the layout of the dots differed even when the number of dots was the same. For half of the trials, the total area taken up by the dots was the same for all three arrays. For the other half, the average area for a single dot (total area/number of dots) was the same for all three arrays. Dot size varied and dots were randomly distributed within a circle. Choices were made by pressing the "Q" (left candidate) and "P" (right candidate) keys on the keyboard. The task comprised 120 trials that were divided into two 60‐trials blocks.

2.3.3 Simple addition

We used a simple single‐digit addition task. For each trial, an addition problem was presented in the middle of the upper part of the screen and two candidate answers, one of which was correct, were presented side by side in the lower part of the screen. Participants were asked to choose the correct answer by pressing the "Q" (left candidate) and "P" (right candidate) keys on the keyboard. There are 81 possible single‐digit addition problems starting from 1 + 1 and ending at 9 + 9. To avoid repeating the same problem more than once, this test only had 81 trials.

2.3.4 Simple subtraction

The subtraction problems were the reversed calculations from the single‐digit addition. Thus, there are 81 possible problems starting from 2 to 1 and ending at 18 to 9. Again, to avoid repeating problems, this test only had 81 trials. All other aspects of the task were the same as the simple addition task.

2.3.5 Character rhyming

Two Chinese characters were presented simultaneously on the screen. Participants were asked to judge whether they rhymed or not. This test had 120 trials.

### Dyscalculia and the calculating brain [^c12edb0d]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Dyscalculia, like dyslexia, affects some 5% of school-age children but has received much less investigative attention. In two thirds of affected children, dyscalculia is associated with another developmental disorder like dyslexia, attention-deficit disorder, anxiety disorder, visual and spatial disorder, or cultural deprivation. Infants, primates, some birds, and other animals are born with the innate ability, called subitizing, to tell at a glance whether small sets of scattered dots or other items differ by one or more item. This nonverbal approximate number system extends mostly to single digit sets as visual discrimination drops logarithmically to "many" with increasing numerosity (size effect) and crowding (distance effect). Preschoolers need several years and specific teaching to learn verbal names and visual symbols for numbers and school agers to understand their cardinality and ordinality and the invariance of their sequence (arithmetic number line) that enables calculation. This arithmetic linear line differs drastically from the nonlinear approximate number system mental number line that parallels the individual number-tuned neurons in the intraparietal sulcus in monkeys and overlying scalp distribution of discrete functional magnetic resonance imaging activations by number tasks in man. Calculation is a complex skill that activates both visual and spatial and visual and verbal networks. It is less strongly left lateralized than language, with approximate number system activation somewhat more right sided and exact number and arithmetic activation more left sided. Maturation and increasing number skill decrease associated widespread non-numerical brain activations that persist in some individuals with dyscalculia, which has no single, universal neurological cause or underlying mechanism in all affected individuals.

### Number representations drive number-line estimates [^6bf63201]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

The number-line task has been extensively used to study the mental representation of numbers in children. However, studies suggest that proportional reasoning provides a better account of children's performance. Ninety 4- to 6-year-olds were given a number-line task with symbolic numbers, with clustered dot arrays that resembled a perceptual scaling task, or with spread-out dot arrays that involved numerical estimation. Children performed well with clustered dot arrays, but poorly with symbolic numbers and spread-out dot arrays. Performances with symbolic numbers and spread-out dot arrays were highly correlated and were related to counting skill; neither was true for clustered dot arrays. Overall, results provide evidence for the role of mental representation of numbers in the symbolic number-line task.

### Beginnings of place value: how preschoolers write three-digit numbers [^82ad7c0f]. Child Development (2013). Low credibility.

Place value notation is essential to mathematics learning. This study examined young children's (4- to 6-year-olds, N = 172) understanding of place value prior to explicit schooling by asking them write spoken numbers (e.g., "six hundred and forty-two"). Children's attempts often consisted of "expansions" in which the proper digits were written in order but with 0s or other insertions marking place (e.g., "600402" or "610042"). This partial knowledge increased with age. Gender differences were also observed with older boys more likely than older girls to produce the conventional form (e.g., 642). Potential experiences contributing to expanded number writing and the observed gender differences are discussed.

### DELTAguidance on choosing the target difference and undertaking and reporting the sample size calculation for a randomised controlled trial [^d8f39fa0]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Box 1
DELTA 2 recommendations for researchers undertaking a sample size calculation and choosing the target difference

Begin by searching for relevant literature to inform the specification of the target difference. Relevant literature can: relate to a candidate primary outcome or the comparison of interest, and; inform what is an important or realistic difference for that outcome, comparison, and population.
Candidate primary outcomes should be considered in turn, and the corresponding sample size explored. Where multiple candidate outcomes are considered, the choice of the primary outcome and target difference should be based on consideration of the views of relevant stakeholder groups (eg, patients), as well as the practicality of undertaking such a study with the required sample size. The choice should not be based solely on which outcome yields the minimum sample size. Ideally, the final sample size will be sufficient for all key outcomes, although this is not always practical.
The importance of observing a particular magnitude of a difference in an outcome, with the exception of mortality and other serious adverse events, cannot be presumed to be self evident. Therefore, the target difference for all other outcomes needs additional justification to infer importance to a stakeholder group.
The target difference for a definitive trial (eg, phase III) should be one considered to be important to at least one key stakeholder group.
The target difference does not necessarily have to be the minimum value that would be considered important if a larger difference is considered a realistic possibility or would be necessary to alter practice.
Where additional research is needed to inform what would be an important difference, the anchor and opinion seeking methods are to be favoured. The distribution method should not be used. Specifying the target difference based solely on a standardised effect size approach should be considered a last resort, although it may be helpful as a secondary approach.
Where additional research is needed to inform what would be a realistic difference, the opinion seeking and the review of the evidence base methods are recommended. Pilot trials are typically too small to inform what would be a realistic difference and primarily address other aspects of trial design and conduct.
Use existing studies to inform the value of key nuisance parameters that are part of the sample size calculation. For example, a pilot trial can be used to inform the choice of the standard deviation value for a continuous outcome and the control group proportion for a binary outcome, along with other relevant inputs such as the amount of missing outcome data.
Sensitivity analyses, which consider the effect of uncertainty around key inputs (eg, the target difference and the control group proportion for a binary outcome) used in the sample size calculation, should be carried out.
Specification of the sample size calculation, including the target difference, should be reported according to the guidance for reporting items (see table 1) when preparing key trial documents (grant applications, protocols, and result manuscripts).

### How 15 hundred is like 15 cherries: effect of progressive alignment on representational changes in numerical cognition [^ca3b60f3]. Child Development (2010). Low credibility.

How does understanding the decimal system change with age and experience? Second, third, sixth graders, and adults (Experiment 1: N = 96, mean ages = 7.9, 9.23, 12.06, and 19.96 years, respectively) made number line estimates across 3 scales (0–1,000, 0–10,000, and 0–100,000). Generation of linear estimates increased with age but decreased with numerical scale. Therefore, the authors hypothesized highlighting commonalities between small and large scales (15:100::1500:10000) might prompt children to generalize their linear representations to ever-larger scales. Experiment 2 assigned second graders (N = 46, mean age = 7.78 years) to experimental groups differing in how commonalities of small and large numerical scales were highlighted. Only children experiencing progressive alignment of small and large scales successfully produced linear estimates on increasingly larger scales, suggesting analogies between numeric scales elicit broad generalization of linear representations.

### The genetic relationship between educational attainment and cognitive performance in major psychiatric disorders [^fc60a14a]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Trail-Making-Test (TMT)

The TMT is a measure of visual attention and task switching and is one of several executive functioning measures. The test consists of two parts, part A assesses psychomotor speed of the participant, and part B assesses switching between two automated tasks (counting and reciting the alphabet). The time taken to complete each part of the test was measured and the difference in time needed (part B-part A) was used, as it is considered a more accurate measure of the divided attention and alternating sequencing tasks tested in part B –. In this case, a higher score meant worse cognitive performance.

Verbal digit span

The verbal digit span, from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, assesses short-term (forward digit-span) and working memory capacity (backward digit-span). Briefly, participants were asked to recall verbally a sequence of digits, with increasingly longer sequences in each trial. For each correctly recalled string of digits, one point was given. The test was ended when the participant was unable to correctly repeat two presented strings of the same length. The difference between the forward and backward task is that the latter involves mental manipulation as the participant is required to repeat the digits in backward order. A score for each task was considered.

Digit-Symbol-Test (DST)

The DST is a subset of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scaleand measures processing speed, working memory, visuospatial processing and attention. In this test, the participant was asked to use a key of numbers 1–9 with coinciding symbols to draw the appropriate symbol that matched the number given. The participant was given 120 s to fill in as many corresponding symbols as possible. In the end, the correct number of symbols drawn was totaled to get an overall score.

Verbal Learning and Memory Test (VLMT)

The VLMT is the German version of the Auditory Verbal Learning Test. This word-list learning paradigm assesses several memory parameters through serial list learning with subsequent distraction, retrieval after distraction and half-hour time delay, and through a recognition task. The test consists of two different word lists which are each 15 independent words and a recognition list which includes 30 words from the two lists and 20 similar distractor words. Four VLMT scores were rated, the first for the number of correctly recalled words from the first list, a second score for the number of words lost after distraction, a third score of words lost after a time interval, and a fourth score of correctly recalled words from the recognition list.

National drug code (NDC) reporting — manufacturers may use different NDC configurations with variation in the number of digits assigned to each of the 3 segments; to accommodate this, an 11th digit (a leading 0) may be inserted into a segment, and payers request that administered units be appended to NDC codes on claim forms. An example states that in multidose packaging 1 U equates to 1 dose and, if units are specified in milliliters for a 0.5-mL vaccine dose, one would specify 0.5 U rather than 1 U.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Participants

A total of 32 healthy voluntary children were initially recruited for this study. Three participants were excluded due to either incomplete imaging data (N = 1) or the presence of structural image anomalies (N = 2). The ART toolbox was employed to detect artifact points with two criteria: (1) frame‐to‐frame displacement > 0.5 × voxel size; (2) signal amplitude surpassing three standard deviations above the average whole‐brain signal. Subjects were eliminated when more than one‐third of the time points exhibited artifacts. Ultimately, no subject was eliminated due to measurement artifacts. Consequently, 29 participants (16 males, mean age = 8.61 ± 0.92) were included in the analyses. All participants were right‐handed, had normal or corrected‐to‐normal vision, and had no history of neurological diseases. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of all child participants, and the children themselves also gave their assent to participate in the study. Ethical approval of the study was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the Institute.

2.2 Stimuli and Experimental Design

Each participant completed the dot number comparison task in the scanner and the basic arithmetic fluency test outside the scanner.

In the dot comparison task, all stimuli consisted of arrays of black dots presented on a gray circular area against a black background (Figure 1A). The number of dots ranged from 1 to 9. The total area and density were kept constant across all stimuli, while the element size of each dot and its presentation location were randomized. The numerical distance between stimuli ranged from 1 to 6, and the magnitude of the dot pairs and their numerical distances were orthogonalized. So, 12 basic dot pairs were used: 5–6, 4–6, 5–7, 2–5, 3–6, 4–7, 1–5, 4–8, 2–7, 3–8, 2–8, and 3–9. The order in which the two dot patterns within each pair were presented was counterbalanced, resulting in 24 pairs in total. Each pair was repeated three times, yielding a total of 72 trials. These trials were randomly distributed across three runs, each consisting of four mini‐blocks of six trials. Four rest blocks were interspersed between the task blocks in each run. The stimuli were presented in a pseudo‐random sequence, ensuring that no more than four consecutive trials required the same response side, and the same pair of stimuli was not presented consecutively.

### An iterative approach for estimating domain-specific cognitive abilities from large scale online cognitive data [^07189726]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Digits Span is a cognitive task designed to measure working memory capacity. Participants are presented with a sequence of numbers that they must recall. The first sequence is always 2 numbers long, and at each trial, if the participant replies correctly, the length of the next sequence increases by one. If the participant incorrectly recalls the sequence of numbers, then another string of the same length is presented. This is repeated until the participant replies incorrectly 3 times consecutively, when the task terminates. Spatial Span has a similar design to Digits Span, but instead of digits participants recall the location of sequences of flashes on a 4 × 4 grid of squares, testing their spatial working memory capacity. As shown in Fig. 3c for Digits Span, the derived DS measure suggested that the more numbers participants must remember, the harder is the trial (correlation between sequence length and DS is r = 0.92). Similarly for Spatial Span, the more squares participants have to remember, the harder is the trial (correlation between sequence length and DS is r = 0.84) (Fig. 3d).

Words Definitions is designed to measure crystallised intelligence. Participants are presented with a word and four alternative definitions. They must select the definition that corresponds to the meaning of the word as quickly as possible. The task has multiple trials and at each trial a different word is shown. The words are characterised by different frequency of occurrence in the English language. To assess the word difficulty scale predicted by IDoCT for the Words Definitions task, the correlation between the obtained measure of difficulty DS and the frequency of occurrence in the English language of the words included in the cognitive assessment was calculated. As shown in Fig. 3a, the most frequently used words in English were assigned a lower D and DS compared to the least frequently used ones. A Spearman correlation of −0.66 and −0.64 between respectively DS and D with the log frequency measures of the words was found.

Motor Control is designed to measure motor abilities. Participants are shown a moving target, which is represented as a circular red button, and are expected to press on the target as quickly as possible, as soon as it appears, and before it changes location in the screen. According to IDoCT, the further the location of the current target from the previous location, the higher the difficulty estimate DS (Spearman correlation between the distance and D and DS was 0.91 and 0.87, respectively — Fig. 3b).

FIGURE 3
Overview of a block in the experimental (a) and control (b) conditions

Each participant was presented with a set of 150 multiplication items. A list of the items is included in the Appendix S1, Supplementary Information and on the Open Science Framework page of this project. Multiplication was chosen as arithmetic operation of interest to ensure considerable inter‐ and intra‐individual variability in performance by using items of different difficulty levels, while still using a task with which children were very familiar, and which was as ecologically valid as possible. To maximize variability in both arithmetic performance and metacognition processes (experimental condition, see below) a wide range of multiplication items was included, ranging from easy items (n = 50; i.e. single‐digit multiplications items with 0–1 and 2–9 as operands, and single times double digit items with 0–1 or 10–11 and 12–19 or 2–9, respectively, as operands) over standard multiplication tables (n = 50; i.e. single‐digit multiplications with 2–9 as operands) to hard items (n = 50; i.e. single‐ times double‐digit multiplications with 2–9 and 12–19 as operands). We did not include ties, standard single‐digit items that were considered "too easy" (i.e. 2 × 3, 2 × 4, 3 × 4 and their commutative pairs), and hard items that were considered "too difficult" (i.e. operands 17–19 combined with operands 7–9). In each run, the same number of single‐digit items as well as single‐times double‐digit items was presented. The number of times a specific operand was presented in one run was equally distributed across runs. Commutative pairs were never presented within the same run.

FIGURE 1
Illustration of the task design and decoding procedure. (A) The illustration of the dot pattern comparison procedure. Subjects needed to compare the two numerical stimuli and decide which one was larger. (B) We first divided the data into a training set with 4/5 trials and a test set with the remaining 1/5 trials. In the training phase, the pattern from 4/5 training trials and their actual labels (distance or magnitude) were used to fit a model (set of weights on each voxel). During the testing phase, the test patterns were multiplied by the weight vector to generate predicted labels (which could take on any real value). A 5‐fold cross‐validation was conducted which iteratively left out 1/5 trials. Performance was assessed by computing the correlation between the actual and predicted labels (aggregated across iterations).

During the fMRI scanning, participants viewed centrally presented dot arrays in succession. Participants were instructed to respond with one of the two buttons depending on whether the first or second number was larger; if the first number was larger, then press the leftmost button with the thumb of the left hand, and if the second number was larger, then press the rightmost one with the thumb of the right hand. The button pressed was balanced across trials. The presentation details for each trial were shown in Figure 1.

2.3 Weber Fraction Estimation

The Weber fraction estimated each participant's minimum distinguishable difference between the number of dots and which was also known as the ANS (Approximate number system) acuity. The Weber Fraction score was assessed for 29 subjects using the accuracy (ACC) of the dot comparison task. The percentage correct was modeled for each individual subject as 1 — error rate (Halberda et al.), where the error rate is defined as:where erfc (x) is the complementary error function, which is associated with the integral of the normalized Gaussian distribution. This model describes the percentage of correct responses as a function of the Gaussian approximation of number representations for the two dot sets presented in each trial, namely n₁ and n₂ (i.e. n₁ is the numerosity of the larger set, n₂ is the numerosity of the smaller set), with a single adjustable parameter, the Weber fraction (w).

### Sex-differences in network level brain dynamics associated with pain sensitivity and pain interference [^44634bf9]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

2.3 Effect of pain on a cognitive test

To define the effect of pain on a cognitive task, we performed a task which was previously described and used (Cheng et al. 2017; Erpelding & Davis, 2013; Kucyi et al. 2013; Seminowicz & Davis, 2006, 2007; Seminowicz, Mikulis, & Davis, 2004). The cognitive task is a modified version of the numerical task (Eccleston & Crombez, 1999; Windes, 1968) that has been utilized instead of the Stroop task because it has been shown to produce robust differences in reaction time (RT) between task conditions (Erpelding & Davis, 2013). Briefly, participants viewed a computer screen that displayed three boxes, each containing multiple copies of a digit from 1 to 9. Each of the three boxes contained a different number of copies of digits and unique value of digits in each box. For example, box one might have three 2 s, box two might have seven 5 s, and box three might have nine 1 s. The participant is instructed to use a numerical keypad to report the number of digits in the box that contains the most number of digits. The instructions are to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible. The outcome measure of the task was the RT for each correct trial. The value of the number and the number of digits inside each box was different across each trial. Each participant underwent 6 blocks of the task which alternated between pain and no pain blocks (3 pain blocks and 3 no pain blocks) with the no pain block always being the first block. Every block contained 24 trials with each trial lasting for 2.5 s. Between each block, there was a short interval of 20 s and a 5 s countdown was provided to indicate the start of the next block.

Health literacy definition and determinants — Health literacy is defined as "the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services they need to make appropriate health decisions". In general literacy is described as having "three components: 1) print literacy (writing and reading), 2) oral literacy (listening and speaking), and 3) numeracy (using and understanding numbers)". The abstract notes multiple contributors to understanding, including "cultural factors, a physician's health knowledge and communication skills, the demands of the situation, the environment in which the health information is being conveyed, and time constraints".

### Children's knowledge of symbolic number in grades 1 and 2: integration of associations [^064a6fdc]. Child Development (2021). Medium credibility.

How do children develop associations among number symbols? For Grade 1 children (n = 66, M = 78 months), sequence knowledge (i.e., identify missing numbers) and number comparison (i.e., choose larger number) predicted addition, both concurrently and indirectly at the end of Grade 1. Number ordering (i.e., touch numbers in order) did not predict addition but was predicted by number comparison, suggesting that magnitude associations underlie ordering performance. In contrast, for Grade 2 children (n = 80, M = 90 months), number ordering predicted addition concurrently and at the end of Grade 2; number ordering was predicted by number comparison, sequencing, and inhibitory processing. Development of symbolic number competence involves the hierarchical integration of sequence, magnitude, order, and arithmetic associations.

Analysis plan

The data from paper coding sheets were input into a spreadsheet by trained coders. This included demographic information, trial information (e.g. trial number, word used, experiment structure), and the structures participants built and their responses to the experimenter's questions. The participant structures were drawn or explained on the sheet, and we quantified them with the total number of blocks, and the maximum number of blocks in the X, Y, and Z‐dimensions. The dimensions were defined with respect to the participant and are depicted in Figure 1c. The X‐dimension was the axis parallel to the tabletop and the participant (e.g. four blocks lined up in a row from left to right is four blocks in the X‐dimension). The Y‐dimension was defined as height (e.g. four blocks stacked on top of each other in a column is four blocks in the Y‐dimension). The Z‐dimension was defined as parallel to the tabletop, but perpendicular to the X‐dimension along the table (e.g. four blocks lined up in a flat row going away from the participant is four blocks in the Z‐dimension). Because we used comparative words, their meaning is defined with respect to a baseline reference (i.e. the structure built by Experimenter 1). Thus, we also described the participant's structure with reference to how each dimension differed from that baseline structure (i.e. whether the participant's structure decreased, did not change, or increased in each dimension). The initial baseline structure was either Long (four blocks lined up in a row; 4 blocks in the X‐dimension, 1 block in the Y‐dimension, and 1 block in the Z‐dimension) or Tall (1 block in the X‐dimension, 4 blocks in the Y‐dimension, and 1 block in the Z‐dimension; see Figure 1). Most trials (89% of the final dataset) consisted of shapes that were easy to define in terms of the number of blocks in each dimension (e.g. a series of blocks lined up in a horizontal row; a series of blocks stacked in a single column). In the remaining cases, children built more creative structures (e.g. a row of blocks horizontal with an extra column of more vertical blocks at the end; pyramids). Each trial was coded independently by at least two research assistants to ensure proper data entry and agreements of interpretation of the number of blocks in each dimension. Trials where there was uncertainty about the structure were excluded.

Objective

To offer suggestions to help improve clinicians' understanding of the statistical analyses in the literature and their use of these methods in their own medical writings.

Data Sources

Literature searches began at the National Library of Medicine's online database and were traced to primary sources.

Study Selection

All referenced information in this article was cited from primary sources.

Results

Physicians should be able to determine the variables studied and how they were measured, the comparisons that were made, the difference (with 95% confidence interval) between the groups, the exact P value for the difference, the statistical test used in the analysis, whether the data conformed to the assumptions of the test, whether the study had adequate statistical power, and the clinical importance of the difference.

Conclusion

Clinicians should know how to interpret statistical results so that they can use medical science to its full extent in treating patients.

### To count and how to count, that is the question: interobserver and intraobserver variability among pathologists in lymph node counting [^d63f4a41]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Optimal cancer staging requires retrieval of a minimal number of nodes. However, variability among pathologists in counting on a slide has not been studied. To study the differences in node counting among pathologists, 10 pathologists counted nodes on 15 slides on 2 occasions. They also opined on whether selected "structures" represented countable nodes. There was no slide on which all pathologists agreed on all occasions. The greatest variability was on slides on which the number of nodes exceeded 8. There was disagreement on the size of the smallest countable node, on how to count 2 closely related structures, and when the gross disagreed with the microscopic finding. With a mean count of 5.7 nodes per slide, the 95% confidence interval was ± 2.6, which could be clinically significant when the count approaches the set minimum. Uniform criteria are necessary to allow for meaningful comparisons between studies on minimal nodal counts for cancer lymphadenectomies.

### SARS-CoV-2 is associated with changes in brain structure in UK biobank [^6973c9ce]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Cognitive analysis

Although cognitive testing offers limited measurements of cognitive function in UK Biobank, we included in our ancillary cognitive analysis 10 variables sensitive to cognitive impairment. For this, we drew these variables using a data-driven approach based on identifying out-of-sample current and future dementia cases in UK Biobank, and comparing them to matched control individuals (Supplementary Analysis 2). The top most significant variables from this out-of-sample analysis were:
Three variables from the UK Biobank Trail Making Test: both durations to complete trails A and B, as well as the total number of errors made traversing trail B.
One variable from the Symbol Digit Test: the number of symbol digit matches made correctly.
One measure of reaction time: mean time to correctly identify matches at the card game 'Snap'.
One measure of reasoning: the 'fluid intelligence' score.
One measure of numeric memory: the maximum number of digits remembered correctly.
Three variables of the pairs matching test: numbers of correct and incorrect matches, and the time to complete the test.

On the basis of these 10 variables from 6 different cognitive tests, we carried out two analyses: (1) the same group comparison between SARS-CoV-2 cases and controls of the longitudinal effect as described above, but substituting ΔCOG for ΔIDP, (2) a post hoc regression analysis, in the SARS-CoV-2 group only, of the ΔCOG showing the most significant difference between cases and controls against the top 10 most significant ΔIDPs for the hypothesis-driven approach and the top 10 for the exploratory approach. All of the results were evaluated for FWE and FDR significance, correcting for multiple comparisons across all cognitive or IDP variables where applicable.

Pediatric coding — CPT within HCPCS and National Drug Code (NDC) usage explains that the American Medical Association (AMA) maintains and annually publishes CPT, CPT is level I of HCPCS, and HCPCS level II identifies products/services not in CPT and is produced and maintained by CMS; CMS often creates G codes within level II. For medications, drug products are reported by an NDC, a "10-digit, 3-segment number"; the first segment has "4 to 5 numbers" for the labeler, the second has "3 to 4 numbers" for strength and form, and the third is a "1- to 2-digit number" for package size/types; Medicare and many payers require NDC code reporting on medication claims.

### Number development and developmental dyscalculia [^e45e7f45]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

There is a growing consensus that the neuropsychological underpinnings of developmental dyscalculia (DD) are a genetically determined disorder of 'number sense', a term denoting the ability to represent and manipulate numerical magnitude nonverbally on an internal number line. However, this spatially-oriented number line develops during elementary school and requires additional cognitive components including working memory and number symbolization (language). Thus, there may be children with familial-genetic DD with deficits limited to number sense and others with DD and comorbidities such as language delay, dyslexia, or attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder. This duality is supported by epidemiological data indicating that two-thirds of children with DD have comorbid conditions while one-third have pure DD. Clinically, they differ according to their profile of arithmetic difficulties. fMRI studies indicate that parietal areas (important for number functions), and frontal regions (dominant for executive working memory and attention functions), are under-activated in children with DD. A four-step developmental model that allows prediction of different pathways for DD is presented. The core-system representation of numerical magnitude (cardinality; step 1) provides the meaning of 'number', a precondition to acquiring linguistic (step 2), and Arabic (step 3) number symbols, while a growing working memory enables neuroplastic development of an expanding mental number line during school years (step 4). Therapeutic and educational interventions can be drawn from this model.

### Foundations of the minimal clinically important difference for imaging [^72f785d9]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

This article develops a generic conceptual framework for defining and validating the concept of minimal clinically important difference. We propose 3 approaches. The first uses statistical descriptions of the population ("distribution based"), the second relies on experts ("opinion based"), and a third is based on sequential hypothesis formation and testing ("predictive/data driven based"). The first 2 approaches serve as proxies for the third, which is an experimentally driven approach, asking such questions as "What carries the least penalty?" or "What imparts the greatest gain?" As an experimental approach, it has the expected drawbacks, including the need for greater resources, and the need to tolerate trial and error en route, compared to the other 2 models.

Sample size justification is a very crucial part in the design of clinical trials. In this paper, the authors derive a new formula to calculate the sample size for a binary outcome given one of the three popular indices of risk difference. The sample size based on the absolute difference is the fundamental one, which can be easily used to derive sample size given the risk ratio or OR.

### Spectral bias and task-model alignment explain generalization in kernel regression and infinitely wide neural networks [^f3e13d8d]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

We can visualize the complexity of the two tasks by plotting the projection of the data along the top two kernel principal components (Fig. 1 a, b). The projection for 0–1 digits appears highly separable compared to 8–9s, and thus simpler to learn to discriminate. Indeed, the generalization error for the 0–1 discrimination task falls more rapidly than the error for the 8–9 task (Fig. 1 c). Our theory is in remarkable agreement with experiments. Why is 0–1 discrimination easier for this kernel? Fig. 1 d shows that the eigenvalues of the NTK evaluated on the data are very similar for both datasets. To quantify the compatibility of the kernel with the tasks, we measure the cumulative power distribution C (ρ). Even though in this case the data distributions are different, C (ρ) is still informative. Figure 1 e illustrates that C (ρ) rises more rapidly for the easier 0–1 task and more slowly for the 8–9 task, providing a heuristic explanation of why it requires a greater number of samples to learn.

### The minimum clinically important difference: which direction to take [^f4817de8]. European Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Distribution‐based method

Distribution‐based MCID methods are built upon the statistical properties of a study's result 20. These include both the effect size, where the mean change of the individual is divided by the variability of either the whole group or the subset of stable subjects, and the reliability change index, a statistic rooted in the standard error of measurement (SEM) 21. The SEM is a measure of the variation of observed scores due to measurement error compared to the 'true' score. Any changes which are below the SEM could be due to a measurement error 'noise' rather than to a truly occurring change. The number of SEMs needed to qualify a change in a patient's score to be meaningful is not yet fully established 16, 17. The most compelling argument has been provided by Wyrwich et al. who state that the 'one‐SEM criterion holds promise for identifying clinically meaningful intra‐individual change' 21, 22.

The standard deviation (SD) is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values. In multiple studies with different outcome measures there seemed to be a universally applicable rule of thumb that the MCID is equal to 0.5 SD 23.

### Development and validation of an electronic symbol-digit modalities test for remote monitoring of people with multiple sclerosis [^f61baa4d]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Electronic Symbol‐Digit Modalities Test (eSDMT) flow diagram. Diagram depicting the flow of the Numbers and eSDMT tasks. (a) In the Numbers task, stimuli are represented by single‐digit numbers (1–9), presented serially (number of stimuli = 27, stimulus duration = maximum 10s, response–stimulus interval = 1 s). (b) In the eSDMT task, a key is displayed at the top of the screen, containing nine symbols which are associated with single‐digit numbers (1–9). Target stimuli are represented by symbols, presented serially (number of stimuli = 54, maximum stimulus duration = 10s, response–stimulus interval = 1 s). In both tasks, the presentation order is randomized so that each stimulus is presented only once per block.

Before the eSDMT, participants perform a choice reaction task (hereon referred to as 'Numbers') during which random digits (1–9) are displayed at the center of the screen, one at a time in a pseudo‐random sequence (27 stimuli; same procedure as for the eSDMT). The Numbers task was included as a baseline reaction task which could be less dependent on higher cognitive processes.

Instructions are provided in writing on the screen, and the test sequence includes a practice run before both the Numbers and eSDMT tasks, during which each possible target stimulus is presented only once.

Reaction times (RTs; in milliseconds) and keypresses are recorded for each target stimulus. Upon completion, summary results are shown, and a text box enables reporting of external disturbances that may have affected test validity (e.g. the doorbell ringing).

Neuropsychological assessment

Upon admission to the inpatient unit, all participants underwent a neuropsychological assessment with the Italian versions of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS). All neuropsychological assessments were conducted by experienced neuropsychologists as per clinical protocol.

The MoCA is a screening tool widely used to assess global cognitive functioning. The BICAMS battery consists of the oral SDMT, a verbal learning test, and a visuospatial learning test.

### The impact of learning multiple real-world skills on cognitive abilities and functional independence in healthy older adults [^c2f01534]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

Measures

A baseline assessment (Week 0) was added in Study 2, so that the participants could serve as their own control. We also included pre-test (Week 6), midpoint (Week 12), and post-test (Week 18) assessments, following Study 1. The measurement battery for Study 2 was identical to the battery in Study 1, with the exception of two additional working memory measures: the 2-back from the EXAMINER battery, and the forward and backward digit span task (Table 2). The 2-back task required participants to remember the location of a square on two trials prior to the current trial (compared with only one trial prior in the 1-back task). The forward and backward digit span task required participants to memorize 16 sequences for the forward task and 14 sequences for the backward task. There were two sequences per trial, with eight trials for the forward task and seven trials for the backward task. The number of digits in each sequence increased after each trial, starting with two digits in the sequences for the first trial and ending with eight to nine digits in the last trial. The total score was divided by 15, the total number of trials.

### Patient preferences for pharmaceutical and device-based treatments for uncontrolled hypertension: discrete choice experiment [^260b90c8]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

A random-parameters logit regression model was used to analyze the treatment choice data and estimate the attribute-level preference weights (details in). The model included effect-coded variables for each attribute level in Table 1. The estimated parameters on each attribute level are referred to as preference weights. A 2-sided chi-squared test was used to evaluate differences between preference weights. Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata Version 16 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Tex.) and NLOGIT (version 5). The estimated parameters on each attribute level were rescaled as follows. The difference between the largest and smallest parameter within each attribute was calculated. These differences were summed across attributes and the sum scaled to 100. The parameters corresponding to each attribute were scaled accordingly.

Table 1.
Attributes and Levels for the Discrete Choice Experiment Survey

The preference weights were used to calculate 3 measures of benefit–risk preferences. First, the preference weights were used to calculate the conditional relative importance of each attribute, defined as the difference between the preference weights corresponding to the most and least preferred levels of an attribute and represented as a percentage of the sum of the importance of all attributes.

Second, the preference weights were used to calculate 2 measures of risk tolerance: the maximum acceptable risk and minimum acceptable benefit. Maximum acceptable risk is the level of treatment-related risk that offsets a specific change in another attribute's levels. For example, an improvement in BP reduction increases the likelihood of choosing a treatment, which is reflected in a higher log-odds preference weight for the more preferred level. The increase in the treatment-related risk that exactly offsets that change in likelihood of treatment choice is the maximum acceptable risk. The maximum acceptable risk estimates were censored at a 20% risk of each adverse event to avoid extrapolation outside of the risk range in the DCE design. Minimum acceptable benefit is the level of reduction in office SBP that offsets an undesirable change in another treatment attribute, such as increased treatment-related risk. Each minimum acceptable benefit calculated should be interpreted as being in addition to a 1 mm Hg reduction, the minimum office SBP change evaluated for this attribute. Both measures reflect the tolerance for risk assuming respondents switch from their current treatment to another treatment, and do not reflect the tolerable level of risk for a HTN treatment over opting-out of treatment.

Skilled counters showed a linear relation between number words and nonsymbolic numerosities. Unskilled counters showed the same linear relation for smaller numbers to which they could count, but not for larger number words. Further tasks indicated that unskilled counters failed even to correctly order large number words differing by a 2: 1 ratio, whereas they performed well on this task with smaller numbers, and performed well on a nonsymbolic ordering task with the same numerosities. These findings provide evidence that large, approximate numerosity representations become linked to number words around the time that children learn to count to those words reliably.

### Cognitive performance in dialysis patients-"when is the right time to test? " [^c099248e]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

RBANS

The RBANS is a brief, individually-administered test measuring cognitive function across five domains: attention, language, visuospatial/constructional abilities, and immediate and delayed memory. Performance in each domain is measured by the subtests (12 in total) described below, which are combined to yield five scaled "index scores" gauging function in the respective domains. These five index scores are in turn combined to yield a composite score referred to as the "total scale score". Stimuli are contained in a wire-bound, easel-type booklet, making the test easily portable and allowing for bedside administration. Total administration time is 20–30 min. Normative information from the manual for the index and total scores is based on 540 healthy adults who ranged in age from 20 to 89 years.

The battery was designed to be amenable to the construction of multiple equivalent forms, and there are different, equivalent versions of the RBANS available for test-retest use.

The domains comprise the following subtests:
Immediate Memory

List Learning: immediate recall of a 10-item list of words.
Story Memory: a 12 item story, read aloud for immediate recall over two trials.

2 Visuospatial/Constructional

Figure Copy: copying a geometric figure of 10 parts.
Line Orientation: a 10 item line orientation test.

3 Language

Picture Naming: 10-line drawings which the subject must name
Semantic Fluency: the total number of examples generated for a given semantic category within 60 s.

4 Attention

Digit Span: analogous to digits forward on the WAIS. There are two strings of digits in each item, each pair increasing in length from 2 to 9 digits. The second string of a given length is only read if the first string is failed.
Coding: numbers rather than symbols were chosen for the response in order to avoid the possible detrimental effect of a constructional apraxia on performance.

5 Delayed Memory

List Recall: free recall of the words from the List Learning task.
List Recognition: yes/no recognition testing for memory of the words from the List Learning task.
Story Recall: free recall of the story from the story memory test.
Figure Recall: free recall of the figure from the figure copy subtest.

All subtests of the RBANS were scored according to standardized age-adjusted criteria. Raw scores from the 12 subtests were converted to age- adjusted scaled scores before calculating an index score for each domain. The sum of the index scores was then converted to a total scale score.

### Why is a small sample size not enough? [^7b5e6e1b]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Clinical studies are often limited by resources available, which results in constraints on sample size. We use simulated data to illustrate study implications when the sample size is too small.

Methods and Results

Using 2 theoretical populations each with N = 1000, we randomly sample 10 from each population and conduct a statistical comparison, to help make a conclusion about whether the 2 populations are different. This exercise is repeated for a total of 4 studies: 2 concluded that the 2 populations are statistically significantly different, while 2 showed no statistically significant difference.

Conclusions

Our simulated examples demonstrate that sample sizes play important roles in clinical research. The results and conclusions, in terms of estimates of means, medians, Pearson correlations, chi-square test, and P values, are unreliable with small samples.

### Association of genetic variants linked to late-onset Alzheimer disease with cognitive test performance by midlife [^6af56807]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Identifying the youngest age when Alzheimer disease (AD) influences cognition and the earliest affected cognitive domains will improve understanding of the natural history of AD and approaches to early diagnosis.

Objective

To evaluate the age at which cognitive differences between individuals with higher compared with lower genetic risk of AD are first apparent and which cognitive assessments show the earliest difference.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used data from UK Biobank participants of European genetic ancestry, aged 40 years or older, who contributed genotypic and cognitive test data from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2015. Data analysis was performed from March 10, 2020, to January 4, 2022.

Exposure

The AD genetic risk score (GRS), which is a weighted sum of 23 single-nucleotide variations.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Seven cognitive tests were administered via touchscreen at in-person visits or online. Cognitive domains assessed included fluid intelligence, episodic memory, processing speed, executive functioning, and prospective memory. Multiple cognitive measures were derived from some tests, yielding 32 separate measures. Interactions between age and AD-GRS for each of the 32 cognitive measures were tested with linear regression using a Bonferroni-corrected P value threshold. For cognitive measures with significant evidence of age by AD-GRS interaction, the youngest age of interaction was assessed with new regression models, with nonlinear specification of age terms. Models with youngest age of interaction from 40 to 70 years, in 1-year increments, were compared, and the best-fitting model for each cognitive measure was chosen. Results across cognitive measures were compared to determine which cognitive indicators showed earliest AD-related change.

Results

A total of 405 050 participants (mean [SD] age, 57.1 [7.9] years; 54.1% female) were included. Sample sizes differed across cognitive tests (from 12 455 to 404 682 participants). The AD-GRS significantly modified the association with age on 13 measures derived from the pairs matching (range in difference in mean cognition per decade increase in age for 1-SD higher AD-GRS, 2.5%-11.5%), symbol digit substitution (range in difference in mean cognition per decade increase in age for 1-SD higher AD-GRS, 2.0%-5.8%), and numeric memory tests (difference in mean cognition per decade increase in age for 1-SD higher AD-GRS, 8.8%) (P = 1.56×10⁻³). Best-fitting models suggested that cognitive scores of individuals with a high vs low AD-GRS began to diverge by 56 years of age for all 13 measures and by 47 years of age for 9 measures.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, by early midlife, subtle differences in memory and attention were detectable among individuals with higher genetic risk of AD.

### Finger counting training enhances addition performance in kindergarteners [^1dd652fd]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Out of the 328 children involved in this first experiment, there were more children who spontaneously used their fingers in an addition task (N = 197) than children who did not use their fingers at all (N = 131). As it is obvious from Figure 5 and in replication to previous studies (e.g. Dupont‐Boime & Thevenot; Jordan et al.), finger users at pre‐test presented a higher percentage of correctly solved additions (i.e. 84.1%) than non‐finger users (i.e. 38.1%). As predicted, the strategy massively used spontaneously by children was the "ALL" strategy (Table 1), the one we taught to children.

As already stated and supported by a higher increase in finger counting after the training program in the experimental than in the control group, we show in this first experiment that it is possible to teach the "ALL" strategy to kindergartners. In fact, almost 75% of the children who did not count on their fingers at pre‐test responded positively to our training or, in other words, used finger counting during the immediate post‐test (massively using the strategy taught). Moreover, we established here that our training program significatively enhanced children's arithmetic skills because the increase in performance between pre‐ and post‐test was higher in the experimental group than in the control group. This effect was created by non‐finger users at pre‐test and was even more pronounced when only children who responded positively to the training were considered (+54.1% between pre‐ and post‐test in the percentages of correctly solved additions).

### How to design efficient cluster randomised trials [^67128e6c]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

How to identify an absolute upper bound for cluster size

Although increasing cluster size can reduce the required number of clusters up to a point, doing so beyond the sample size needed under individual randomisation does not reduce it further (Appendix 3). This means that the sample size needed for each arm under individual randomisation is the absolute upper bound for cluster size. For example, the sample size needed to detect a standardised effect size of 0.25 with 90% power using a two sided significance level of 5% is about 340 people in each arm under individual randomisation. If this target difference was the minimum that could plausibly be achieved by the intervention, or the minimum clinically important difference, then cluster sizes should not exceed 340. If target differences were smaller, then larger cluster sizes might be justifiable. For example, if effect sizes of 0.1 were plausible (needing about 2100 in each arm under individual randomisation), then cluster sizes should not exceed 2100. Although this upper bound is independent of the ICC, the point of diminishing returns is frequently obtained at much smaller cluster sizes than that needed under individual randomisation (for example if the ICC is very small).

How to determine whether a small increase in the number of clusters can substantially reduce cluster size

Data in Appendix 3 show that a simple rule can help determine whether a small increase in the number of clusters can lead to a much more efficient design. Firstly, the user needs to determine the minimum number of clusters needed to detect the desired effect size at the desired power (assuming an unlimited cluster size). This is simply n×ICC, where n is the sample size for each arm under individual randomisation. Increasing the number of clusters to one more than the minimum means that the required cluster size will be at most n/1; increasing the number of clusters to two more than the minimum means that the cluster size will be at most n/2; and so on. Although this won't give the exact cluster size needed, this simple rule is a very useful guide to determining if the trial could be made more efficient, without resorting to extensive calculations.

### Hand dexterity, not handgrip strength, is associated with executive function in Japanese community-dwelling older adults: a cross-sectional study [^bec7f28f]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Neuropsychological tests for measuring executive function

The Trail Making Test (TMT)

The TMT has been widely used for assessing executive function and involves cognitive skills including visual search, perceptual/motor skills, processing speed, attention, switching, and working memory. It consists of two parts: The TMT-A, which requires the subject to draw a line connecting consecutive encircled numbers (1 to 25) randomly distributed in a sheet form, and the TMT-B, which requires the subject to alternate between numbers (1 to 13) and letters of Hiragana, a Japanese syllabary, (i.e. 1-A) as quickly and as accurate as possible. The TMT-A has been associated with cognitive skills involved in executive function such as visual search, processing speed, sustained attention and working memory, while the TMT-B requires additional executive function skills such as task switching, cognitive flexibility and greater working memory. The time (in seconds) required for the participant to complete each task was used for analysis.

Digit symbol - Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test-Revised (WAIS-R)

The Digit symbol subtest of the WAIS-R consists of a row of squares containing symbols paired with digits from 1 to 9 and another row of blank squares randomly assigned with digits from 1 to 9. After a practice session, the participant fills in the blank squares with the symbol that corresponds to each digit. The Digit symbol test has been used to evaluate executive function, where sustained attention, visuomotor coordination, and response speed contribute to the performance of the test. The total score was the number of squares correctly matched in 90 s.

### Modeling somatic and dendritic spike mediated plasticity at the single neuron and network level [^ef398a25]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

We next aimed to investigate the synaptic changes across a continuum of distances from the soma. We therefore divided our basal dendritic tree into nine different regions depending on the distance from the soma (Fig. 3m). For each distance range, we distributed synapses either randomly among the respective compartments, or they were clustered on one of the compartments in that range. The neurons were activated using Poisson spike trains with different average rates, and we stored the resulting number of unidirectional and bidirectional connections in each case. The mean of these numbers for the distributed and the clustered simulations are summed per distance range. While we ran an equal number of simulations for all distances, there were substantially fewer compartments for the smallest and largest distance ranges compared to intermediate ranges in our neuron. To compensate for this, we further multiplied the number of unidirectional and bidirectional connections by the number of compartments in the respective distance range (Fig. 3n).

### Impaired attentional modulation of sensorimotor control and cortical excitability in schizophrenia [^a7494183]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Dual-task condition

While subjects performed the force-tracking task two types of visual cues were displayed in pseudo-randomized order. (i) Distractors, consisting of white-filled shapes (square, star, triangle, 2 × 2 cm), were displayed for 500 ms (in pseudo-random positions at least 12 cm away from the cursor) in one of the four periods (Dual-DIST trials). Timing of appearance was unpredictable and in each of the four periods defined as follows: 1500 ms into REST; 380 ms before RAMP-onset; 1500 ms into HOLD; or 380 ms before RELEASE. A maximum of two distractors appeared per trial. Subjects had to focus on the tracking task and inhibit saccades toward distractors. (ii) Numbers were displayed (Dual-ADD trials; from 1 to 9, 2 × 2 cm) for 500 ms in pseudo-random positions and with onset-times identical to Dual-DIST trials. Subjects had to make a saccade toward the stimulus, mentally sum the numbers of successive trials, and report the sum after an auditory cue (given after six dual-task trials).

Thus, the dual-task condition contained trials sharing a discrimination component (subjects were required to either inhibit or exert a saccade according the type of the visual stimulus), as well as a memory retention component of the score from the added numbers, thus cognitive load was higher than in the single-task condition. Further, since the addition occurs during Dual-ADD trials only, while memory retention was required in both dual-task trials, Dual-DIST trials represent intermediate and Dual-ADD trials with highest cognitive load

The order of trials was: 36 successive single-task trials (5 min 30 s), followed by 72 pseudo-randomly intermingled Dual-DIST and Dual-ADD trials (2 × 5 min 30 s). For familiarization, all subjects performed a series of six consecutive single-task trials at 10%MVC before data recording. MVC was assessed using a power grip dynamometer. Subjects were instructed prior to the task: to accurately match their grip force to the target force at all times, to ignore (inhibit saccades to) distractors, but to make saccades to relevant visual stimuli (numbers), to mentally sum the successively appearing numbers, and to verbally report the sum after a cue. Thus, whether to inhibit (Dual-DIST trial) or make a saccade (Dual-ADD trial) to a visual extrafoveal stimulus depended on peripheral visual on-line information.

Time Course of Treatment Response

In the 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies, an effect of TRINTELLIX based on the primary efficacy measure was generally observed starting at Week 2 and increased in subsequent weeks with the full antidepressant effect of TRINTELLIX generally not seen until Study Week 4 or later. Figure 4 depicts time course of response in U.S. based on the primary efficacy measure (MADRS) in Study 5.

Digit Symbol Substitution Test in Major Depressive Disorder

Two, eight week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of TRINTELLIX on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) during the treatment of acute MDD. The DSST is a neuropsychological test that most specifically measures processing speed, an aspect of cognitive function that may be impaired in MDD. Patients are asked to match nine symbols with their corresponding number (1 to 9) according to a key; the score is the correct number of matches achieved in 90 seconds. For reference, the mean score for healthy 45 to 54 year-old subjects is 50 (SD = 15).

Study 7 randomized adult patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for recurrent MDD to receive TRINTELLIX 10 mg, TRINTELLIX 20 mg, or placebo once daily. Study 8 randomized adult patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for recurrent MDD and reporting subjective difficulty concentrating or slow thinking to receive a flexible dose of TRINTELLIX (10 or 20 mg) or placebo once daily. Neither study included patients whose MDD was in remission yet who continued to experience difficulty concentrating or slow thinking. Patients' mean age was 46 (SD = 12) and 45 (SD = 12) in Study 7 and 8, respectively. In both studies, patients in the TRINTELLIX group had a statistically significantly greater improvement in number of correct responses on the DSST (Table 6); depressed mood as assessed by change from baseline in MADRS total score also improved in both studies.

The effects observed on DSST may reflect improvement in depression. Comparative studies have not been conducted to demonstrate a therapeutic advantage over other antidepressants on the DSST.

### Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and cancer prognosis: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies [^e956f80c]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The test for excess significance (TES) was used to determine if the number of observed significant results differed significantly from the expected number, indicating reporting bias. TES results can reveal reporting bias if the number of observed studies with significant results in each meta-analysis is significantly larger than the expected number using a two-tailed binomial probability test (P < 0.10). The expected number of significant results in each meta-analysis was calculated as the sum of the statistical power estimate, or the probability that each component study will find a positive result. The estimated power for each component study was calculated in Stata 14, using the "power cox" command to calculate the power of each test given its sample size, effect size and significance level. The estimation of power for each component study also requires an estimation of the true effect size, so the effect size of the largest study was used to give an estimation of true effect with the smallest standard error. Estimates from both fixed and random effects models were included for sensitivity analysis. The "binom.test" command in R was used to assess the significance of differences in the number of observed versus expected significant studies using an exact binomial test.

Cardiac ultrasonography guideline — GRADE factors for evidence assessment and recommendation development specify that Section A categorizes the outcome factor as Critical, Important, Less important, or Not important, while Section B (factors 2–10) sets study-design starting points and quality levels with "Randomized controlled trial = 4" and "Observational studies = 2", mapping to "A = High = Four points", "B = Moderate = Three points", "C = Lowc = Two points", and "D = Very lowc = One point". Quality is lowered by the five downgraders — "Risk of bias" (−1 Serious; −2 Very serious), "Inconsistency" (−1 Serious; −2 Very serious), "Indirectness" (−1 Serious; −2 Very serious), "Imprecision" (−1 Serious; −2 Very serious), and "Publication bias" (−1 Likely; −2 Very likely) — and raised by three upgraders — "Large effect" (+1 Large; +2 Very large), "Dose response" (+1 Evidence of a gradient), and "Antagonistic bias" (+1 All plausible confounding would reduce the effect, or +1 Would suggest a spurious effect when results show no effect). "Based on the design, the evidence will qualify for four points (if randomized controlled trial) or two points (if observational) and then points will move down by one or two points (by downgraders) or up (by upgraders) if applicable as indicated in the table", and Section C (factors 11–15) lists "The five-GRADE transformers", with voting "using ninepoint Likert's scale".

### Distributed functional connectivity predicts neuropsychological test performance among older adults [^79e1903f]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

2.2.2 KSHAP neuropsychological test

To test the generalizability of the predictive model, we identified eight homologous neuropsychological tests included in the KSHAP dataset. Similarity and correspondence of administration procedures and contents were scrutinized. For the attention and working memory, Digit Span Forward, and Digit Span Backward tests included in the Elderly Memory disorder Scale (Chey, 2007) were available. The score was the sum of all correct trials were counted from 2 to 8 lengths of digits. The category fluency test asked participants to generate words from the two semantic categories (i.e. animal and supermarket) each within a minute (Kang, Chin, Na, Lee, & Park, 2000; Kang, Jang, & Na, 2012). While interference condition of the original Trail Making Test in UDSNB asks to alternate between numbers and alphabets (Reitan & Wolfson, 1993), modified Trail Making Test (mTMT) asked to alternate between numbers and symbols (triangle and rectangle) to minimize the floor effect of illiterate elderly (M. Park & Chey, 2003; Seo et al. 2006). The mTMT Part A (Trail A) consisted of 15 consecutively numbered circles arranged randomly on a sheet of paper. Participants were asked to draw a line between the circles in ascending order as quickly as possible. In mTMT Part B, they were asked to draw between triangles and squares alternately. In mTMT Part C (Trail C), participants consecutively connected lines between 8 numbers (ascending order) and 7 shapes (triangle and square) in an alternating way (1 – △ – 2 – □ – 3 – △…). Total time consumed to complete the mTMT‐A and mTMT‐C were used in the analysis, and mTMT‐B was not used in the analysis due to the variability in the possible trail options. A few participants exceeded the typical time limit of mTMT‐A (150 s, n = 1) and mTMT‐C (300 s, n = 7), but a maximum of 300 and 600 s, respectively, were allowed to finish the task due to the participants' unskilled usage of pencil. Total time (s) to complete the lines were log‐transformed and inversed. The Story Recall Test included in the Elderly Memory disorder Scale was used to assess episodic memory function. The Story Recall Test consisted of one story modified from the Logical Memory subtest in WMS‐III into a more culturally familiar content (An & Chey, 2004). The SRT required subjects to recall a paragraph containing 24 semantic units and the delayed recall subtests were administered 15–30 min after the immediate recall session.

### Scaling up molecular pattern recognition with DNA-based winner-take-all neural networks [^5dbdb790]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

From bacteria following simple chemical gradients 1 to the brain distinguishing complex odour information 2, the ability to recognize molecular patterns is essential for biological organisms. This type of information-processing function has been implemented using DNA-based neural networks 3, but has been limited to the recognition of a set of no more than four patterns, each composed of four distinct DNA molecules. Winner-take-all computation 4 has been suggested 5,6 as a potential strategy for enhancing the capability of DNA-based neural networks. Compared to the linear-threshold circuits 7 and Hopfield networks 8 used previously 3, winner-take-all circuits are computationally more powerful 4, allow simpler molecular implementation and are not constrained by the number of patterns and their complexity, so both a large number of simple patterns and a small number of complex patterns can be recognized. Here we report a systematic implementation of winner-take-all neural networks based on DNA-strand-displacement 9,10 reactions. We use a previously developed seesaw DNA gate motif 3,11,12, extended to include a simple and robust component that facilitates the cooperative hybridization 13 that is involved in the process of selecting a 'winner'. We show that with this extended seesaw motif DNA-based neural networks can classify patterns into up to nine categories. Each of these patterns consists of 20 distinct DNA molecules chosen from the set of 100 that represents the 100 bits in 10×10 patterns, with the 20 DNA molecules selected tracing one of the handwritten digits '1' to '9'. The network successfully classified test patterns with up to 30 of the 100 bits flipped relative to the digit patterns 'remembered' during training, suggesting that molecular circuits can robustly accomplish the sophisticated task of classifying highly complex and noisy information on the basis of similarity to a memory.

### Lateralized neural responses to letters and digits in first graders [^ab365260]. Child Development (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study found that 6‐year‐old children display specific neural responses to visually presented letters and digits, both arbitrary visual shapes conveying culturally acquired meaning. Remarkably, this differential brain response to letters/digits occurred in a very fast presentation mode (< 170 ms per stimulus), low‐level confounds being controlled through random changes at every stimulus onset. These results suggest that already at the beginning of first grade, letters and digits give rise to specific neural responses, directly indicating selective modes of processing for one category compared to the other.

This novel finding goes beyond previous study where categorical responses emerged between familiar letters and unfamiliar pseudofonts (Lochy et al. 2016). At this age, children have had limited reading and arithmetic instruction, but they already possess letter and number knowledge due to early sociocultural and preschool‐related exposure to print (Wright et al. 1991; for digits see also Mejias & Schiltz, 2013; Hoffmann, Hornung, Martin, & Schiltz, 2013). Our results contrast with previous studies on the neuronal substrate of (differential) letter and digit processing in children. An fMRI study with 4‐year‐old preschoolers revealed greater selectivity for symbols (letters and digits) than objects (shoes and faces) processing in the left hemisphere, but no difference for letters versus digits (Cantlon et al. 2011). In a working memory task involving letters, digits or faces, 8‐year‐old children also did not show specific activation for letters versus digits (Libertus et al. 2009). Recently, an ERP study (Park et al. 2017) did not reveal lateralized response pattern for letters versus digits in 7‐ and 10‐year‐old children. Here on the contrary, inspection of topographies indicated that letters (vs. digits) are selectively associated with left occipital responses (PO9) and digits (vs. letters) to right occipital responses (PO10). In line with neuropsychological data (Starrfelt & Behrmann, 2011), topographies and amplitude values also suggested stronger discrimination abilities for digits than letters in 6‐year‐olds. While requiring further investigation, this might be because digits contain only 10 exemplars, and all (except 0) were presented here. In contrast, letters contain 26 exemplars, and only a subset was used (among which "J" and "Z", not very frequent in French). Finally, digits might bear a meaning by themselves, already known at this age, whereas letters do not mean anything in isolation.

### Evaluation of changes in prices and purchases following implementation of sugar-sweetened beverage taxes across the US [^d406553a]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Figure 1.
Treated vs Synthetic Values of Pretreatment Sugar-Sweetened Beverage (SSB) Sales Volume and Sociodemographic Characteristics

This plot shows the scaled mean values of pretax outcomes and prognostic covariates included in the synthetic control analysis of SSB volume purchased. Mean values are scaled to be between 0 and 100 on the basis of each variable's maximum and minimum values found in the primary sample. Shaded dots correspond to the mean value for a treated city, and hollow dots correspond to its synthetic control. Other race and ethnicity, as determined by the 2010 US Census, included multiracial and Hispanic individuals.

To determine the statistical significance of the ASC average treatment effects, which are calculated as the average posttax percentage changes in SSB prices and purchases for treated units relative to that of the synthetic control units, placebo estimates were generated for each donor unit one by one, as if each of those units had been treated. Because treated localities implemented taxes at different times, this procedure was repeated for each treated locality, generating 279 × 5 = 1395 placebo estimates. To generate P values, the ratio of mean squared prediction error in the posttax vs pretax period was computed for the composite unit estimate and each placebo estimate, which were then ranked from largest to smallest. The P value was calculated as the ratio of the composite unit ranking to the total number of units (1396) and indicated statistical significance when P < .05. More details are provided in the eMethods in Supplement 1.

Cross-Border Purchasing

To fully quantify the changes following SSB taxes in treated cities, we also explored whether purchasing behavior changed in adjacent 3-digit border zip codes. The same ASC procedure was implemented, except all adjacent border localities were considered treated, and taxed cities were excluded. Because border localities tended to be semiurban or suburban, the subsample of donor pool units was modified to those featuring an urbanicity level within 1 SD (0.35) of the mean urbanicity of the 13 border localities (0.75). A total of 369 three-digit zip codes remained, including the 13 border localities. This analysis used the same Census characteristics and P value calculation approach.

Sensitivity Analysis

To assess sensitivity, 2 different urbanicity cutoffs were used to determine the donor pool subsample. Both an urbanicity level of 0.9 and 0.85 were used, reducing the donor pool of 3-digit zip codes to 204 and 226, respectively.

### Impaired kidney function is associated with lower cognitive function in the elder general population. results from the good aging in Sk å ne (G å S) cohort study [^fbe9186b]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Global cognitive function was assessed using mini mental state examination (MMSE)

Immediate memory, a subdomain to the cognitive domain learning and memory in DSM-5, was assessed using the digit span forward test. The participant was asked to repeat a number combination between 2 and 8 numbers ranging from 1 to 9. The longest correct recalled digit span was used for assessment.

Recent memory, a subdomain to the cognitive domain learning and memory in DSM-5, was assessed using the tests free recall and recognition. In the test free recall 16 unrelated words were presented to the participant. The participant then had 2 min to freely recall as many words he/she could remember. The number of correct recalled words was used for assessment. In the recognition test the 16 words from the test free recall were presented again mixed with 16 new unrelated words. The task for the participant was to identify which words had been presented in the test free recall. The number of correct recognized words minus the number of incorrect words (false hits) was used for assessment.

Expressive language, a subdomain to the cognitive domain language in DSM-5, was assessed using the tests word fluency F and A and word fluency animals and occupations. In word fluency F and A, the participant was assigned to name as many words he/she could come up with that started with the letter F and then the letter A. 1 min was given for each letter. For word fluency animals and occupations, the participants were instructed to name as many animals as possible in 1 min and then as many occupations as possible in 1 min. The mean for the number of words from F and A, and animals and occupations, was used for assessment.

The speed of processing, a subdomain to the cognitive domain complex attention in DSM-5, was assessed using the tests digit cancellation and pattern comparison. In digit cancellation, 11 rows of random numbers between 1 and 9 was presented to the participant on a piece of paper. The task was to draw a line over as many fours as possible during 30 s. The number of correct lines was used for assessment. For pattern comparison columns with figures in pairs were presented to the participant on a piece of paper. The task was, during 2 × 30 s, to decide if the figures in each pair was identical or not. The number of correct answers was used for assessment.

Sustained attention to response task (SART)

As shown in Fig. 1, the SART consisted of a 4-min 20-second session during which 225 numbers (ranging from 1 to 9) were randomly presented in varying sizes, displayed in white font on a black background. Each number was displayed for 250 ms, followed by a 900 ms fixation cross ("+") at the center of the screen. Participants were instructed to press the spacebar in response to all numbers (Go trials) except for the number 3 (NoGo trials). The task included 200 Go trials and 25 NoGo trials. Participants were instructed to prioritize both speed and accuracy equally.

Fig. 1
Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) paradigm.

The 4-min 20-s SART consists of presentation of the numbers 1–9 of various sizes 225 times randomly in white font on a black computer screen. Each number is presented for 250 ms, followed by a 900 ms duration mask composed of a cross ("+") presented in the middle of the screen. Participants are instructed to respond to the appearance of each number by pressing the spacebar (Go condition), except when presented with the number 3 (NoGo condition).

To accurately assess behavioral performance, we discarded anticipation responses with RTs < 150 ms and calculated the following indicators: OEs (the number of non-3-digit stimuli with no response within the allowed time); CEs (the number of 3-digit stimuli followed by a response); mean RTs (average response time for correct Go trials); and RTs variability (RTV), quantified as the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by the mean RTs) for correct Go trials.

### Age differences in the effort and costs associated with cognitive activity [^d71eb0e0]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

We tested the hypothesis that aging is associated with an increase in the effort and costs associated with cognitive activity using systolic blood pressure (SBP) as a measure of effort.

Method

Younger and older adults engaged in an initial task (Phase 1) for 5 min that was relatively low (adding single digits) or high (subtracting by 3 s) in cognitive demands. They then solved a series of multiplication problems for 3 min (Phase 2). Cardiovascular measures were collected throughout, and reactivity was examined as a function of age, initial task difficulty, and test phase.

Results

Older adults exhibited higher levels of reactivity than younger adults to cognitive engagement, with reactivity increasing with task difficulty. Difficulty of the initial task was also associated with greater effort and lower performance on the subsequent multiplication task, suggestive of fatigue or depletion. These fatigue effects were stronger for older adults.

Discussion

The results were consistent with expectations and provided support for the utility of SBP reactivity as a measure of cognitive effort in studies of aging.

### A cognitively enhanced online tai Ji quan training intervention for community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment: a feasibility trial [^2fdb3255]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Dual-task cost baseline = (dual-task walking – single-task walking) / single-task walking × 100

Dual-task cost 16_weeks = (dual-task walking – single-task walking) / single-task walking × 100

Change in dual-task cost = dual-task cost 16_weeks – dual-task cost baseline

Change (measured in percentage) in dual-task cost from baseline was used to define dual-task cost at week 16, with positive values indicating deteriorated dual-task performance (i.e. dual-task cost), and negative values representing an improvement in dual-task performance with respect to single-task (i.e. dual-task benefit).

The four domain-specific cognitive function measures were Trail Making Test B (TMT-B) (in seconds), Category Fluency for Animals (executive function), Forward Digit Span (attention), and Backward Digit Span (working memory). In TMT-B, participants were asked to connect numbers and letters in an alternating progressive sequence (i.e. 1-A-2-B-3-C, and so on) and scoring was expressed in terms of the time (in seconds) to completion. For Category Fluency, participants were asked to generate the names of as many animals as possible in 60 seconds. In assessing Forward and Backward Digit Span, participants were verbally presented with a series of digits (e.g. 6, 2, 9, 7) at a rate of one digit per second and were asked to repeat them verbatim. If participants succeeded, they were given a longer list (e.g. 5, 3, 8, 1, 6). The number of digits increased by one until the participant consecutively failed two trials of the same digit span length. In the Forward Digit-Span, participants were asked to repeat the digits in the given called order whereas in the Backward Digit-Span participants were asked to repeat the digits in reverse. The maximum number of points for each of these tests was 16.

### Dyscalculia and typical math achievement are associated with individual differences in number-specific executive function [^d2586ba6]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

Deficits in numerical magnitude perception characterize the mathematics learning disability developmental dyscalculia (DD), but recent studies suggest the relation stems from inhibitory control demands from incongruent visual cues in the nonsymbolic number comparison task. This study investigated the relation among magnitude perception during differing congruency conditions, executive function, and mathematics achievement measured longitudinally in children (n = 448) from ages 4 to 13. This relation was investigated across achievement groups and as it related to mathematics across the full range of achievement. Only performance on incongruent trials related to achievement. Findings indicate that executive function in a numerical context, beyond magnitude perception or executive function in a non-numerical context, relates to DD and mathematics across a wide range of achievement.

### Why is a small sample size not enough? [^a6608fcd]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our simulated example demonstrates that sample sizes play important roles in clinical research. The results and conclusions, in terms of estimates of means, medians, Pearson correlations, chi-square test, and P values, are unreliable with small samples. Even when "statistically significant", small sample size studies might provide spurious results. Thus, caution is needed when interpreting results from small studies.

### Proposing a sex-adjusted sodium-adjusted MELD score for liver transplant allocation [^935116ad]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Decompensation Measurements

Decompensation traits were defined using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for hematemesis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, ascites, jaundice, and hepatic encephalopathy (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). We required individuals to have at least 2 instances of a component code to be coded with any one of the compensation traits. In individuals with liver transplant, only ICD codes prior to the liver transplant CPT date were used. Decompensation counts were then determined by summing the number of coded decompensation traits for each individual (minimum, 0; maximum, 5) (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). Differences in group means of mean decompensation counts were assessed between male and female individuals across the entire sample and within liver transplant, liver disease, and control definitions, using t tests. To account for non-normality, sex differences in decompensation counts were also assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests (eTable 9 in Supplement 1).

Replication in the All of Us Research Program

We replicated our findings in the All of Us Research Program, a population-based cohort that contains demographic, EHR, and survey information on participants. Even though the sample size of patients who underwent transplant is small in All of Us (n = 25), the broader sample allowed us to confirm the pattern of sex differences in MELDNa laboratory values and further demonstrate pervasive sex differences even in the absence of liver transplant or disease. Detailed methods and results are in the eAppendix and eTables 5 and 7 in Supplement 1.

### Concept and location neurons in the human brain provide the 'what' and' where' in memory formation [^52be91a6]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Task

The spatial framework of the main experiment was a 3 × 3 grid on a touchscreen laptop, and each image was presented in one of the 9 squares. The task was to remember and retrieve the spatial locations of the images. Each session was limited to 35 min and was divided into runs (Fig. 1, top row), where the total number of runs varied depending on the speed and performance of the patient. Within each run, a subset of images was shown, one at a time, at different, randomly assigned locations within the grid (Fig. 1, bottom row). The participant was asked to confirm every image location by tapping it within the presentation time window (1.5–3.5 s). Whenever the correct square was tapped, a green square appeared along its outline for the remainder of the presentation duration. Trials with off-target or missing confirmation tap were considered invalid and were excluded from the analyses assessing memory effects. Those trials also triggered an immediate dissonant feedback sound and, in case of a misplaced tap, a red square around the tapped, empty square. Following the encoding trials, a random number between 80 and 100 appeared on the screen and the participant counted down vocally in steps of three until the number disappeared after 15 s. The last part of each run consisted of recall trials, where one by one the items from the beginning of the run were shown in shuffled order below an empty grid and the participant tried to recall and tap each item location. After each run, a feedback screen showed the percentage of correct answers. Retrieval trials and initiation of runs were self-paced. For each new run, a new subset of images was drawn from the item pool, evening out presentation counts, and filling remaining slots by random selection. The locations were assigned randomly. In order to obtain similar numbers of subsequently remembered and forgotten trials, we adjusted the difficulty in two ways. Each run was classified either as high-performance (> 65% correct), low-performance (< 35% correct) or medium performance (35–65% correct). Encoding presentation duration was initially 2 s and was increased following low-performance trials and decreased following high-performance trials. Values changed in steps of 0.5 s and were capped at 1.5 s and 3.5 s. Furthermore, after 3 consecutive low-performance trials of equal set size, the set size of the next run was decreased by 1 and accordingly increased by 1 after 3 consecutive high-performance trials. Whenever the set size changed, presentation duration was reset to 2 s. The minimum number of images per run was 1, the theoretical maximum was the total item pool size for the session (up to 8, details below), which was only reached in one session but was not a limiting factor. The initial set size was always 2, ensuring a low difficulty and therefore high motivation for most participants. This resulted in relatively high performance during the initial runs, and overall we recorded more correct than incorrect trials (13.3 vs. 10.7 on average).

Table 1b — Minimum sample size for detecting geometric mean (GM) ratio k with α = 0.05 and W = 0.9 — presents required sample sizes by standard deviation (S) strata and defines parameters; α is significance level, W is power, GM is geometric mean, and S is standard deviation, noting that 1.2 is the standard deviation of national viral load (VL) data. Each jurisdiction will need to assess the standard deviation of their local VL data and then determine the appropriate sample size needed to assess VL, and if the sample size is inadequate to meet the recommended case inclusion criterion, an alternate method may need to be used, such as combining multiple years of data. For k = 3, sample sizes across S = 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 are 75, 91, 108, 127, 147, 169, and Table 1b uses power = 90%; jurisdictions may also explore differences in means of viral loads, including categorical differences in the proportion with undetectable or very low VL.

### Current sample size conventions: flaws, harms, and alternatives [^f34a2bb9]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Value of information methods

Many methods have already been described in the statistical literature for choosing the sample size that maximizes the expected value of the information produced minus the total cost of the study. See for an early discussion, for recent examples, and the introduction of for additional references. These require projecting both value and cost at various different sample sizes, including quantifying cost and value on the same scale (note, however, that this could be avoided by instead maximizing value divided by total cost). They also require formally specifying uncertainty about the state of nature; although this can be criticized as being subjective, it improves vastly on the usual conventional approach of assuming that one particular guess is accurate. These methods can require considerable effort and technical expertise, but they can also produce the sort of thorough and directly meaningful assessment that should be required to justify studies that are very expensive or that put many people at risk.

Simple choices based on cost or feasibility

Recent work has justified two simple choices that are based only on costs, with no need to quantify projected value or current uncertainty about the topic being studied. Because costs can generally be more accurately projected than the inputs for conventional calculations, this avoids the inherent inaccuracy that besets the conventional approach. One choice, called n min, is the sample size that minimizes the total cost per subject studied. This is guaranteed to be more cost-efficient (produce a better ratio of projected value to cost) than any larger sample size. It therefore cannot be validly criticized as inadequate. The other, called n root, is the sample size that minimizes the total cost divided by the square root of sample size. This is smaller than n min and is most justifiable for innovative studies where very little is already known about the issue to be studied, in which case it is also guaranteed to be more cost efficient than any larger sample size. An interactive spreadsheet that facilitates identification of n min and n root is provided as Additional file 2.

A common pragmatic strategy is to use the maximum sample size that is reasonably feasible. When sample size is constrained by cost barriers, such as exhausting the pool of the most easily studied subjects, this strategy may closely approximate use of n min and therefore share its justification. When constraints imposed by funders determine feasibility, doing the maximum possible within those constraints is a sensible choice.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

For, as the function form is fixed, there is no need for algorithmic optimization. Therefore, We statistics the weighted sum values (Method Eq. (22).) and corresponding false-negative rates at different false-positive rates, as shown in Fig. 7 d. Under the different false-positive rates (0% to 20%), the thresholds are illustrated in Fig. 7 c. The maximum cost is 297.8 with a 6% false-positive rate and the numbers of false-positive and false-negative are 9 and 42. When the false-positive rate exceeds 18%, the false-positive rate will become greater than the false-negative rate. Therefore, of 3.4 s with a false-positive rate of 6% was selected as the threshold.

Monitoring results on datasets

According to the thresholds and MTL expression, an online monitor was utilized for every vehicle in the dataset. The selected vehicle was treated as the ego vehicle, whereas the other vehicles in the scenario were treated as surrounding vehicles. All the necessary information was transmitted to the online monitor by the designed data bus in a dataset sampling time sequence that contained ego vehicle parameters, traffic signs, traffic participants, and map data. According to the selected traffic-law articles, six types of violation behaviors were monitored. The statistical results are shown in Table 1. Figure 8 a presents the count of activated trigger conditions for each monitor type in a bar chart. The number of vehicles that violate the corresponding article during trigger condition activation is color-coded and accompanied by a corresponding percentage.

### How do you design randomised trials for smaller populations? A framework [^45132483]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

How should we approach trial design when we can get some, but not all, of the way to the numbers required for a randomised phase III trial?We present an ordered framework for designing randomised trials to address the problem when the ideal sample size is considered larger than the number of participants that can be recruited in a reasonable time frame. Staying with the frequentist approach that is well accepted and understood in large trials, we propose a framework that includes small alterations to the design parameters. These aim to increase the numbers achievable and also potentially reduce the sample size target. The first step should always be to attempt to extend collaborations, consider broadening eligibility criteria and increase the accrual time or follow-up time. The second set of ordered considerations are the choice of research arm, outcome measures, power and target effect. If the revised design is still not feasible, in the third step we propose moving from two- to one-sided significance tests, changing the type I error rate, using covariate information at the design stage, re-randomising patients and borrowing external information. We discuss the benefits of some of these possible changes and warn against others. We illustrate, with a worked example based on the Euramos-1 trial, the application of this framework in designing a trial that is feasible, while still providing a good evidence base to evaluate a research treatment. This framework would allow appropriate evaluation of treatments when large-scale phase III trials are not possible, but where the need for high-quality randomised data is as pressing as it is for common diseases.

### Neuropsychological test performance of cognitively healthy centenarians: normative data from the Dutch 100-plus study [^20228cd9]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Neuropsychological Tests

The neuropsychological test battery consisted of 15 tests measuring global cognition, premorbid intelligence, attention and/or concentration, language, memory, executive function, and visuospatial function. See supplementary data for more detailed information on properties of these tests. At the start of the study, the test battery was limited to the MMSE and CDT but expanded gradually over the course of the study with tests that allow the evaluation of specific cognitive domains. For this reason, not all centenarians were presented with the same battery or the same number of tests.

The MMSE was used to evaluate global cognition. 21 We addressed premorbid intelligence using the DART, 22, 23, 24 in which subjects are asked to read out loud 50 words with atypical phonemic pronunciation. These words were presented in an enlarged font size to take into account possible visual difficulties. The Digit Span was used to evaluate attention/concentration (forward condition) and working memory (backward condition). 25 The forward condition requires subjects to repeat sequences of digits that increase in length, whereas in the backward condition, sequences of digits have to be repeated in reverse order. We evaluated processing speed and attention using the TMT A, and mental flexibility using the TMT B, which respectively requires subjects to connect dots of numbers in numerical order and alternate between numbers and letters in numerical and alphabetical sequence. 26 If the centenarians were not determined to proceed after 180 seconds (TMT A) and 300 seconds (TMT B), the test was aborted and scores were extrapolated based on the last finished item (number or letter) and the time spent on the test. The Dutch version of the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (naming words from initial letters) and Category fluency (naming animals) were administered to evaluate executive functioning and language, the latter also assessing semantic memory. 27, 28 To evaluate executive functioning, we administered the Key Search subtest of the Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome Test Battery 29 involving a problem‐solving task instructing subjects to think of a strategy to find a lost key. Memory was measured with the story recall subtest of the Dutch version of the RBMT and the VAT. 30, 31, 32 The RBMT requires subjects to immediately repeat all items they remember from two stories read out loud, and again after a 15‐minute interval. When necessary, a cue was given for helping them recall the story line, which was considered when calculating the total score. We made two adaptations to the test procedure: (1) two stories were read instead of one to improve reliability; (2) during recall, all remembered items were scored, whether they belonged to the appropriate story line or not. The VAT involves subjects to name two visual items shown in one picture (eg, a hedgehog on a chair), of which one item (hedgehog) needs to be recalled afterwards while the other (the chair without the hedgehog) is used as a cue. We used naming of the items as an additional measure of language functioning. Visuospatial orientation was assessed with the Number Location subtest of the Visual Object and Space Perception Battery, 33 which required subjects to indicate a specific number that corresponded with the exact location of a dot. For evaluating visuospatial construction, subjects were instructed to draw a clock with the hands at 10 past 11 (CDT). Because of common tremors in centenarians, the CDT was offered with a predrawn circle and was scored according to a method that does not consider the drawing of the circle. 34, 35

The SART is a computerized task and participants were shown a repeated series of fixed digits from 1 to 9 on the screen. Participants were instructed to "press a key for every number that you see as fast as you can (go answer) but try not to press on the number 3 (no-go answer)". Each digit appeared for 300 milliseconds (ms), with an interval of 800 ms before the next digit appeared. The cycle of digits 1 to 9 was repeated 23 times, giving a total of 207 trials. During a pilot, we noticed that some participants had difficulties performing the SART for the whole length of the task. In order to minimize data attrition, we reduced the number of trials from 225 in the original SART to 207 trials. The task lasted approximately 4 minutes. The recorded variables were: mean reaction time (mean RT) i.e. the time taken for the key presses on digits 1, 2 and 4 to 9 across the entire task; standard deviation (variability) of reaction time (SDRT), the number of commission errors i.e. inappropriate key presses in response to the digit 3, and the number of omission errors i.e. failure to press a key in response to digits 1, 2 and 4 to 9.

A: sugar content, B: fruit size. The orchards are ordered by the median sugar content (A) and the median fruit size (B) among N = 39,679 fruits observed between mid-October (the third week of October) and late November (the fourth week of November) in the 27 orchards. The Nab orchard has the lowest median sugar content (°Bx), and the 5-number summary of its boxplot (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum) is (6.6, 9.1, 9.8, 10.6, 14.1). The Cbb orchard has the highest median sugar content, and the 5-number summary of its boxplot is (8.2, 11.3, 12.1, 12.9, 15.3). The Xab orchard has the smallest median size (mm), and the 5-number summary of its boxplot is (40.3, 42.3, 43.9, 46.3, 54.5). The Uab orchard has the largest median size (mm), and the 5-number summary of its boxplot is (55.9, 63.7, 67.6, 71.8, 80.4) where the minimum size observed Uab (55.9 mm) is greater than the maximum size observed Xab (40.3 mm).

### Men and women differ in the neural basis of handwriting [^77797ede]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

Cognitive testing consisted of sustained attention and verbal working memory tests. Sustained attention was assessed by using a cancelation test, in which participants were instructed to search and mark the target number ("3") as quickly and accurately as possible within 3 min. The score were calculated by this equation: score = attack −(false alarms+0.5×omission). A digit span task was employed for evaluating verbal working memory in which participants were asked to repeat a series of digits in forward (range 3 to 12 digits) and backward order (range 3 to 10 digits). The test was terminated when participants failed in two consecutive trials of the same length, and the working memory span was the number of digits in the last successful trials.

Finally, a visual‐motor integration test was conducted to assess low‐level visual‐motor skill in which participants were asked to copy 12 geometric symbols varying in visual complexity as accurately as possible. Two independent evaluators assessed the similarity between samples and participants' responses using a 7‐point scale, and the score was the sum of each symbol. The inter‐rater reliability of the assessment was good (intra‐class correlation coefficients [ICC] = 0.86).

There were no differences in all reading, cognitive and motor tests between males and females, suggesting that these abilities were well‐matched between groups. Detailed information of all the participants was presented in Table 1.

2.2 Stimuli and task procedure

Participants were instructed to perform a handwriting task (copying Chinese characters) and a control task (drawing nonsense symbols). Thirty characters were selected for presentation, of which one half were of "high frequency" (1,500 times per million) and the other half were of "low frequency" (< 5 times per million), according to the Modern Chinese Frequency Dictionary (1986). Visual complexity measured by the mean number of strokes was matched between high‐frequency and low‐frequency characters. To control for activation elicited by motor and basic visual processing, participants also performed a control task in which they were instructed to copy nonsense symbols. Participants were instructed to write characters and draw symbols with matched duration and size, while minimizing movements of their upper arm and forearm (thus minimizing potential head motion artifacts in the fMRI data).

### Optimizing selectivity of the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome scale by use of correction formulas, and validation of its German version [^b6494aa9]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Between patients with cerebellar stroke and their matched controls, the largest numerical differences were seen on the items semantic fluency (AD: 10%), phonematic fluency (AD: 15%), category switching (AD: 14%), and go/no-go (AD: 19%). All other items showed numerical differences below 10%. Statistically significant differences were not present on any test item (p values > 0.184; two-sided Fisher's exact test; Fig. 4 B; Table S8, supplementary material).

Based on uncorrected raw scores of single test items, the items semantic fluency [mean difference (MD); 95% CI lower bound, upper bound: − 3.7; − 4.6, − 2.89], phonematic fluency (MD: − 3.0; − 3.9, − 2.2), and category switching (MD: − 2.5; − 3.2, − 1.7) showed the largest numerical differences between patients with cerebellar degeneration and matched controls. Despite statistically significant group differences were present between patients with cerebellar degeneration and their matched controls for all test items except verbal recall (p values < 0.045, two-sided permutation t test; Table S8, supplementary material), these differences were too small to be clinically relevant, except for the above-mentioned word fluency tests. For example, patients with cerebellar degeneration were able to repeat on average 6.1 ± 1.1 digits on the digit span forward task, while controls on average were able to repeat 6.3 ± 1.2 digits. These small differences likely became statistically significant only because of the large sample size.

Between patients with cerebellar stroke and their matched controls, small numerical differences were seen on the items go/no-go (MD: − 0.7; − 1.1, − 0.3) and affect (MD: − 0.4; − 0.7, − 0.1). These differences were statistically significant (p values < 0.002; Fig. S3 and Table S8, supplementary material).

2.3.3 Digit and visuospatial running memory

Participants were presented with sequences of digits or visuospatial stimuli of varying length (Pollack, Johnson, & Knaff, 1959). In the verbal version, the sequences consisted of digits (1–9), and in the visuospatial version, the stimuli consisted of squares appearing at eight different locations. Each cross was visible in the matrix for 1,500 ms. The inter‐stimulus‐interval was 500 ms, during which the matrix was empty. The stimuli were pseudo‐randomized into 28 sequences. The sequence length varied from seven to fourteen, with the exception of two four‐unit catch sequences. Each time a sequence ended, the participants repeated the digits or squares by clicking on corresponding numbers in the screen in the correct order, or by clicking on the correct locations with the mouse. In both tasks, the participants did not know the sequence length beforehand. The dependent variables were the total number of correctly recalled location/digit sequences.

2.3.4 Digit span

In the digit span task, participants were instructed to repeat sequences of digits in the same (forward) or reversed (backward) order (Blankenship, 1938). Sequence length varied between 2 and 9 digits in the forward tasks, and 2 to 8 digits in the backward tasks. Digits were presented with the interval of one per second. Two sequences of each length were administered. When the participant answered correctly to one of the sequences, the sequence length was increased by one digit. The task ended once the participant made two errors in a row. The dependent variable was the total number of correctly reported sequences (averaged across the forward and backward versions).

2.3.5 Continuous performance test

In the continuous performance test (CPT) task, participants were presented with a sequence of letters with fixed alternating intervals (1,000, 2000, and 3,000 ms) (Rosvold, Mirsky, Sarason, Bransome, & Beck, 1956). They were required to press the space bar for each letter, except for the letter X (probability 9.7%). There were 360 trials, and the duration of the task was approximately 14 min. Two dependent variables were used, omission errors as a proxy for inattention, and commission errors, as a proxy for impulsivity.

a Distributions of the estimated measures of AS and DT, as well as of the raw summary scores RT and Number Correct (or accuracy), across all tasks. AS is characterised by a distribution with negative skew, whereas DT by a distribution with a positive askew. The distribution of AS resembles Number Correct, while the distribution of DT resembles median RT. b Trials with higher number of squares were affected by the scaling due to the original estimated difficulty scores D being exclusively based on the performance of participants with high ability. c Trials with higher number of digits were affected by the scaling due to the original estimated difficulty scores D being exclusively based on the performance of participants with high ability. d Correlation between the measures of AS, DT, D and DS estimated using the full sample in Words Definitions and using subsamples of different sizes. e Correlation between the measures of AS, DT, D and DS estimated using the full sample in Digits Span and using subsamples of different sizes. f Results of sample size analysis using simulated data. The model can successfully predict the measures of AS, DT and D with as little as 100 samples and with a drop of performance of only respectively 12%, 2% and 12%.

AS and DT have expected distributions mostly centred around 0.5

The model was separately applied to the 12 tasks and consistently converged in 10 iterations when estimating the measure of AT, which was used to estimate the measure of cognitive ability AS and visuomotor latency DT. The mean AS and DT per task are reported in Table 2, and their distributions, together with the distributions of the raw summary scores (i.e. RT and Number Correct), are shown in Fig. 4a (correlation between AS, DT and raw summary scores is available in Supplementary Table 1). The model-derived estimates of DT were generally characterised by a gamma distribution with a positive skew, which reflects that a minority of participants had delayed raw response times. Conversely, AS was generally centred around 0.5 and was characterised by a gamma distribution with a negative skew, which is more similar to the raw accuracy scores. Notably though, the AS distributions were generally smoother than raw accuracy scores, and in the case of Motor Control and Words Memory Immediate, overcame the ceiling effects evident in the raw scores.

### Mismatch amplification mutation assay-based real-time PCR for rapid detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and antimicrobial resistance determinants in clinical specimens [^52c67ba6]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Establishment of cycle threshold (C T) ranges for the detection of AMR determinants.

Detection of mutations in the target genes was based on the difference in the cycle threshold (Δ C T) values between the reference opa reaction and each AMR determinant reaction. We used thecontrol isolates (tested in duplicate) to determine the optimal Δ C T for the detection of each AMR determinant using the Youden index, which maximized the sum of sensitivity and specificity. We then rounded the value to the nearest whole number and added 1 to account for intersample variability. Adding 1 minimized the number of false-negative results when applied to the clinical samples, which tended to have Δ C T values higher than the ones observed for culture isolates (data not shown).

Establishment of the C T cutoff point for the detection ofin clinical specimens.

We used the results of the commercial NAATs as the reference standard and determined the cutoff point for the opa C T value to classify positive and negative results. In particular, we examined the distributions of C T values for specimens with positive and negative reference test results and determined the optimal cutoff point that maximized the sum of the sensitivity and the specificity for the detection of.

### Minimally important differences for patient reported outcomes measurement information system pain interference for individuals with back pain [^c6590f06]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Summary and comparisons

We computed the interquartile range (IQR) of all usable MID estimates that met a priori criteria, rounded to the nearest half-integer. We then compared results with two mean SEMs (ie, lower bound estimate was compared with the baseline SEM, and to follow-up SEM).

If the lower bound estimate was smaller than the two mean SEMs, then the lower bound would be set to the larger mean SEM and be increased to the next half-integer to make certain that MID estimates exceeded measurement error. Data management, preparation, and all statistical analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA).

### How do you design randomised trials for smaller populations? A framework [^9ac3f0db]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Exploring less common approaches to reducing sample size

We now consider some less standard approaches to bringing the sample size requirements closer to the numbers it is feasible to recruit in a reasonable time frame.

Step 3: Relaxing α by a small amount, beyond traditional values

The much-criticised 5% significance level is used widely in much applied scientific research, but is an arbitrary figure. It is extremely rare for clinical trials to use any other level. It may be argued that this convention has been adopted as a compromise between erroneously concluding a new treatment is more efficacious and undertaking a trial of an achievable size and length. Settings where traditionally sized trials are not possible may be just the area where researchers start to break this convention, for good reason.

In considering the type I error, it is critical to consider the question: 'What are the consequences of erroneously deciding to use a new treatment routinely if it is truly not better?'

Taking the societal perspective as before, we might consider the probability of making a type I error, thus erroneously burdening patients with treatments that do not improve outcomes, or even worsen them, while potentially imposing unnecessary toxicity.

First, for conditions where there are only enough patients available to run one modestly sized randomised trial in a reasonable time frame, research progress will be relatively slow, and making a type I error may be less of a concern than a type II error. In contrast, making several type I errors in a common disease could lead in practice to patients taking several ineffective treatments; for a disease area where only one trial can run at any given time, the overall burden on patients is potentially taking one ineffective treatment that does not work.

Thus, if we take the societal perspective with the trials in Table 1 then, if each trial was analysed with α = 0.05 and we see (hypothetically) 40% positive results, then the expected number of false positive trials is given in the final column. We also assumed 10% and 70% positive results, with qualitatively similar conclusions.
