## Question

Inguinal hernia in women

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about inguinal hernia management in women. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about epidemiology and diagnostic pitfalls unique to women. Then, I should verify the optimal imaging pathway. Next, I will examine sex-specific anatomy and risk of femoral or occult hernias. After that, I need to compare surgical approaches and clarify female-specific technical points. I will then review mesh selection and fixation, including any conflicting guidance and correct myself if needed. Subsequently, I should cover emergency scenarios and contaminated fields. I will also address special populations such as pediatric and elderly women. Finally, I will synthesize postoperative surveillance and key recommendations, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology and diagnostic challenges in women, because missing these sets the stage for delayed care and emergencies. Women have a much lower lifetime prevalence of groin hernia than men, but they present more often with vague pain and without a clear bulge, which increases diagnostic delay and raises the chance of emergency repair; watchful waiting that may be acceptable for some men is not recommended for nonpregnant women with symptomatic hernias, reinforcing the need for timely evaluation and referral [^111VmaKa] [^114WBYar] [^113jHLy7].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging pathway before we jump to surgery decisions. Physical examination is less reliable in women, so I need to ensure a low threshold for imaging; current appropriateness criteria endorse ultrasound as an initial test, while MRI or CT can be used when ultrasound is negative yet clinical suspicion remains high, which is particularly helpful for occult or femoral hernias that lack a visible bulge [^117FMeqv] [^111VmaKa].

> I need to check sex-specific anatomical risks next, because they change both diagnosis and repair strategy. Women have fewer direct inguinal hernias and proportionally more femoral hernias than men, so I should always include femoral hernia in the differential and exert added effort to look for synchronous occult femoral defects at the time of repair, a point repeatedly emphasized by HerniaSurge and the International Endohernia Society given the higher occult femoral rate detected during laparoendoscopic exploration in females [^116T2Lrr] [^112BYDAW] [^113vSAMk].

> Hold on, I should also consider hernia sac contents unique to females, because adnexal involvement carries fertility implications and urgency, especially in pediatrics. Ovarian and tubal herniation occur in a notable fraction of infant girls and can strangulate, necessitating prompt recognition and careful operative management; targeted preoperative imaging should assess adnexal position when suspected, and the laparoscopic approach may help prevent complications such as retroperitoneal displacement reported after open pediatric repairs [^114xx4MB] [^117XjjqQ] [^114omKsk].

> Next, I will examine surgical approach selection, but let me first confirm that guideline direction favors laparoendoscopic techniques when available. Contemporary HerniaSurge updates recommend TAPP or TEP for primary unilateral hernias due to lower postoperative and chronic pain profiles, faster recovery, and the diagnostic advantage of inspecting the femoral canal and contralateral side, though this depends on surgeon expertise and resources; the broad evidence base, including Cochrane data, supports earlier return to activity and less early pain with minimally invasive repair despite historical learning-curve concerns [^111PtSXb] [^115Aa8xg] [^111QryLr].

> But wait, what about female-specific technical considerations during laparoendoscopic repair; I should confirm these details. Coverage of the myopectineal orifice in the preperitoneal plane inherently protects the femoral canal, and division of the round ligament may be considered during laparoendoscopic repair to facilitate mesh placement while it should generally be avoided during open repairs, aligning with HerniaSurge guidance tailored to female anatomy [^117VHvXm] [^112Recct].

> Now, I need to address mesh selection and fixation, and I should double-check guideline evolution here because there may be conflicting recommendations. Initially, I noted that large-pore, macroporous monofilament meshes with adequate tensile strength were recommended and that lightweight polypropylene could reduce foreign body reaction, which was consistent with earlier IEHS and HerniaSurge statements on mesh characteristics and pore size requirements; non-fixation in TEP except for large direct defects also reduces pain and is endorsed by IEHS 2015, with emerging evidence favoring atraumatic strategies and even self-fixating meshes to lessen tack-related pain [^117VK7xY] [^1164UisS] [^116NiX97] [^111ZGWGD]. Hold on, I should verify updated guidance before concluding; the 2023 HerniaSurge update advises against lightweight meshes in laparoendoscopic repair of large and direct hernias, favoring heavyweight meshes to reduce recurrence, so I need to correct my earlier blanket preference for lightweight materials and instead individualize mesh weight to defect type while maintaining macroporosity and adequate strength [^117Q5aJX].

> I will now examine emergency presentations, because women face a higher risk of incarceration and strangulation from delayed diagnosis. Let me confirm operative choices in this setting: laparoscopy can be considered for incarcerated but stable cases, yet if strangulation with anticipated bowel resection is likely, an open preperitoneal approach is preferred; for mesh use in emergencies, updated HerniaSurge suggests macroporous synthetic mesh is acceptable in clean-contaminated fields, whereas WSES recommends primary tissue repair for small defects in contaminated or dirty fields and biological options when feasible if primary closure is not possible, while Cochrane highlights ongoing uncertainty but does not negate mesh in all emergencies [^114DMzaa] [^114NgsA5] [^111ue2zT] [^1144SNcH] [^116rRbzk].

> Let me consider special populations now, and I should confirm the nuances. In pediatric females, suspected adnexal content warrants urgent repair due to strangulation risk, and laparoscopy offers contralateral assessment and may reduce specific complications; IEHS also supports laparoscopic consideration for incarcerated pediatric hernias when expertise exists, while in elderly or thin women I need a low threshold for CT to detect femoral or obturator hernias, including De Garengeot variants with appendiceal involvement, which alter operative planning and urgency [^117XjjqQ] [^115CGYsf] [^113xYPCM] [^114dZJ6h].

> I should review postoperative surveillance and pain management to complete the care pathway. Chronic pain is more common in women and merits proactive prevention through meticulous nerve handling and atraumatic fixation choices, with a tailored neurectomy approach, with or without mesh removal, considered for refractory cases per HerniaSurge; the selection of laparoendoscopic techniques where feasible also contributes to lower chronic pain and earlier return to activities, which I should reinforce during shared decision-making [^111LhFP8] [^111PtSXb].

> Finally, let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. For women with suspected groin hernia, keep a high index of suspicion for femoral and occult defects, use ultrasound first and escalate to MRI or CT when needed, avoid watchful waiting in symptomatic nonpregnant women, prefer laparoendoscopic repair when expertise is available to visualize and cover femoral and contralateral regions, individualize mesh selection acknowledging that heavyweight meshes reduce recurrence in laparoendoscopic large/direct hernias, minimize fixation trauma where possible, and follow emergency field-specific guidance on mesh use and approach, all while recognizing adnexal risks in pediatrics and the heightened propensity for chronic pain requiring tailored follow-up and management [^117FMeqv] [^111VmaKa] [^116T2Lrr] [^112BYDAW] [^111PtSXb] [^117Q5aJX] [^114NgsA5] [^1144SNcH] [^111LhFP8].

Inguinal hernias in females are less common than in males but have a higher risk of complications, especially **incarceration and strangulation** due to the frequent presence of adnexal structures in the hernia sac [^114fYRP2] [^117XjjqQ]. Diagnosis relies on clinical examination, but **ultrasound is the first-line imaging** when the diagnosis is uncertain or to assess hernia contents [^111VmaKa] [^117FMeqv]. Early elective repair is recommended to prevent complications [^117VHvXm], with laparoscopic mesh repair preferred when expertise is available [^111PtSXb]; open mesh repair is an alternative when laparoscopy is not feasible. Watchful waiting is generally not advised in nonpregnant women due to higher risks of incarceration and strangulation [^111VmaKa].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Regarding **prevalence**, inguinal hernias are less common in females, with a lifetime risk of approximately 3% versus 27% in males [^1155Voac]. Female-specific **risk factors** include pregnancy, chronic cough, constipation, obesity, and connective tissue disorders.

---

## Clinical presentation

Common **symptoms** include a groin bulge, pain, or discomfort, often worsened by physical activity or prolonged standing [^111VmaKa]. Complications are more common in females and include **incarceration and strangulation**, often related to the presence of adnexal structures (ovary, fallopian tube) within the hernia sac [^114fYRP2] [^117XjjqQ].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

On **clinical examination**, diagnosis is based on inspection and palpation of the groin [^111RSewT]. For **imaging**, ultrasound is the first-line modality, particularly useful in females to assess hernia contents and differentiate from other groin masses [^117FMeqv]. MRI or CT may be used if ultrasound is inconclusive [^117FMeqv].

---

## Surgical management

- **Indications**: Surgical repair is recommended for symptomatic hernias or those at risk of complications [^117VHvXm]. Watchful waiting is generally not recommended in nonpregnant females due to higher risks of incarceration and strangulation [^111VmaKa].

- **Surgical techniques**: Laparoscopic mesh repair (TAPP or TEP) is preferred in females due to lower postoperative pain, faster recovery, and reduced recurrence rates. Open mesh repair (Lichtenstein technique) is an alternative when laparoscopic expertise is unavailable [^117VHvXm].

- **Special considerations**: During laparoscopic repair, division of the round ligament may be performed to facilitate mesh placement [^112Recct].

---

## Postoperative outcomes and complications

- **Recurrence**: Recurrence rates are generally low with mesh repairs, but females may have slightly higher recurrence rates compared to males [^115c4WRK].

- **Chronic pain**: Chronic postoperative pain is a significant concern [^115c4WRK], with females experiencing higher rates than males.

- **Fertility**: Incarceration or strangulation of adnexal structures can impact fertility, particularly in younger females [^113avBxV].

---

## Conclusion

Inguinal hernias in females require **careful evaluation and management** due to higher risks of complications. Early surgical intervention — particularly with **laparoscopic mesh repair** — is recommended to minimize recurrence and postoperative pain.

### Inguinal hernias: Diagnosis and management [^111VmaKa]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Groin hernias are caused by a defect of the abdominal wall in the groin area and include inguinal and femoral hernias. Inguinal hernias are more common in men. Although groin hernias are easily diagnosed on physical examination in men, ultrasonography is often needed in women. Ultrasonography is also helpful when a recurrent hernia, surgical complication after repair, or other cause of groin pain (e.g. groin mass, hydrocele) is suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging has higher sensitivity and specificity than ultrasonography and is useful for diagnosing occult hernias if clinical suspicion is high despite negative ultrasound findings. Herniography, which involves injecting contrast media into the hernial sac, may be used in selected patients.

Becoming familiar with the common types of surgical interventions can help family physicians facilitate postoperative care and assess for complications, including recurrence. Laparoscopic repair is associated with shorter recovery time, earlier resumption of activities of daily living, less pain, and lower recurrence rates than open repair. Watchful waiting is a reasonable and safe option in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. Watchful waiting is not recommended in patients with symptomatic hernias or in nonpregnant women.

### Female reproductive structures found in inguinal hernia sacs: A retrospective review [^114fYRP2]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

In female infants undergoing herniorrhaphy, there is a reported incidence of 15%-20% of prolapsed adnexal structures. Our primary aim is to confirm the incidence of adnexal tissue in hernia sacs at the time of repair and to further delineate the clinical characteristics of this population at a major pediatric institution.

- **Methods**: Retrospective chart review of all cases of herniorrhaphy in female patients less than the age of 18 from June 2009 to December 2015 in a large tertiary referral children's hospital.

- **Results**: The overall incidence of patients with gynecological findings during herniorrhaphy was 11.2%. For patients with positive findings, the average gestational age at birth was 34.07 weeks, the age at surgery was 0.99 years, and the rate of right-sided hernias was 43.2%. For patients with negative findings, the average gestational age at birth was 38.23 weeks, the age at surgery was 5.14 years, and the rate of right-sided hernias was 23.2%.

- **Conclusions**: Incidence of adnexal structures found in hernia sacs is comparable to previously reported figures. These patients had a significantly lower gestational age at birth, lower age at surgery, and lower rate of right-sided hernias compared to the general population and to those without gynecological findings during herniorrhaphy.

- **Level of evidence**: Level II.

### Update of the international HerniaSurge guidelines for groin hernia management [^111PtSXb]. BJS Open (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for inguinal hernia, specifically concerning the choice of surgical approach, the HSG 2023 guidelines recommend using a laparoendoscopic technique for patients of all sexes with primary unilateral inguinal hernia. This is due to the lower incidence of postoperative pain and a reduction in chronic pain, provided a surgeon with specific expertise and sufficient resources is available.

### Inguinal hernias: Diagnosis and management [^111RSewT]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Inguinal hernias are one of the most common reasons a primary care patient may need referral for surgical intervention. The history and physical examination are usually sufficient to make the diagnosis. Symptomatic patients often have groin pain, which can sometimes be severe. Inguinal hernias may cause a burning, gurgling, or aching sensation in the groin, and a heavy or dragging sensation may worsen toward the end of the day and after prolonged activity. An abdominal bulge may disappear when the patient is in the prone position. Examination involves feeling for a bulge or impulse while the patient coughs or strains.

Although imaging is rarely warranted, ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging can help diagnose a hernia in an athlete without a palpable impulse or bulge on physical examination. Ultrasonography may also be indicated with a recurrent hernia or suspected hydrocele, when the diagnosis is uncertain, or if there are surgical complications. Although most hernias are repaired, surgical intervention is not always necessary, such as with a small, minimally symptomatic hernia. If repair is necessary, the patient should be counseled about whether an open or laparoscopic technique is best. Surgical complications and hernia recurrences are uncommon. However, a patient with a recurrent hernia should be referred to the original surgeon, if possible.

### Laparoscopic techniques versus open techniques for inguinal hernia repair [^111QryLr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). High credibility.

Inguinal hernia repair is the most frequently performed operation in general surgery. The standard method for inguinal hernia repair had changed little over a hundred years until the introduction of synthetic mesh. This mesh can be placed by either using an open approach or by using a minimal access laparoscopic technique. Although many studies have explored the relative merits and potential risks of laparoscopic surgery for the repair of inguinal hernia, most individual trials have been too small to show clear benefits of one type of surgical repair over another.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to compare minimal access laparoscopic mesh techniques with open techniques. Comparisons of open mesh techniques versus open non-mesh techniques have been considered in a separate Cochrane review.

- **Search strategy**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Controlled Trials Registry for relevant randomized controlled trials. The reference list of identified trials, journal supplements, relevant book chapters, and conference proceedings were searched for further relevant trials. Through the EU Hernia Trialists Collaboration (EUHTC), communication took place with authors of identified randomized controlled trials to ask for information on any other recent and ongoing trials known to them. Specialists involved in research on the repair of inguinal hernia were contacted to ask for information about any further completed and ongoing trials. The World Wide Web was also searched.

### Natural history of groin hernias in women and factors leading to delay in repair: a single-institution study [^116Z2juU]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

We have found that for our population of women with groin hernias, many experience symptoms for over a year before seeking treatment. Patient anxieties regarding the operation and practical surgeon-directed delays played a role, emphasizing the imperative for earlier and more frequent referral to a surgeon. These may be addressed through educational efforts geared to primary care physicians and gynecologists about the safety of hernia repair. Much of the reasons for delay are still not known. Additionally, the incidence of non-palpable, occult contralateral, and femoral hernia defects was relatively high, supporting the application of minimally invasive techniques. Future qualitative studies are needed to more thoroughly assess the female experience with groin hernias.

### What is inside the hernia sac [^113avBxV]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

It is often said that any intra-abdominal viscera can be found inside a hernial sac, and in nearly 3% of those cases, female adnexa are encountered. Unlike men, the female inguinal canal contains only the round ligament and vessels that run to the labia majora, providing a path to the development of inguinal hernias.

The majority of these hernias occur in pediatric ages and are usually associated with congenital anomalies of the genitalia. In premenopausal women, rapid diagnosis and prompt correction are crucial to save the adnexa from torsion and infarction and, therefore, ensure fertility. In postmenopausal women, it has been hypothesized that the progressive weakness of the ligaments of the adnexa may contribute to the process of herniation. Furthermore, as these tissues have hormonal receptors, they are influenced by several hormonal stimuli throughout a woman's life, from embryogenesis to parity, and even by the effects of systemic disease on intra-abdominal pressure.

Our patient underwent two types of imaging diagnosis (US and CT); however, the diagnosis was only confirmed intraoperatively. This case serves as a reminder that attention must be at its highest when performing surgical dissection. It is known that ovarian herniation may also be associated with anomalies of the ovary and fallopian tube; for that reason, we decided to perform an oophorosalpingectomy and requested an anatomopathological examination. Although our patient was a multiparous woman with several comorbidities, there were no pathological findings in the resected specimen.

### Open anterior mesh repair vs modified open anterior mesh repair for groin hernia in women: a randomized clinical trial [^111nmVqY]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The 1-year mean (SD) follow-up time was 1.81 (0.04) years in both arms. The majority of the participants reported fewer groin symptoms than before the operation, with 92 of 97 (94.8%) and 93 of 98 (94.9%) in the control and intervention arms, respectively. Overall, the mean (SD) IPQ at 1 year was 1.53 (1.1) and 1.56 (0.94) in the control and intervention arms, respectively (absolute difference = −0.03; 95% CI, −3.2 to 2.5; p = 0.81). The mean (SD) IPQ difference (Δ IPQ) between baseline and 1 year postoperatively was 1.96 (1.5) and 1.85 (1.2) in the control and intervention arms, respectively (absolute difference = 0.11; 95% CI, −2.7 to 5.0; p = 0.56). However, 1 participant still reported severe pain (IPQ score = 7) at the 1-year follow-up. Participants with severe pain were reviewed a second time to differentiate more thoroughly between pain due to hernia and other possible causes of chronic groin pain. This assessment was conducted by A.M. P.N., and J.L. It was concluded that most complaints presented as groin pain were most likely musculoskeletal in origin.

### Global access to technologies to support safe and effective inguinal hernia surgery: Prospective, international cohort study [^112pfZFK]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing open surgery without the use of mesh were generally younger, with a median age of 49.0 years compared to 61.0 years, had fewer co-morbidities, and presented with larger hernias, as shown in Table S5. In the adjusted analysis, being operated on in a low-middle-income country was significantly associated with lower mesh use (adjusted OR 0.02, 95% c.i. 0.01 to 0.06; P < 0.001). Being female was the only other factor linked to the reduced use of mesh in open surgery (adjusted OR 0.53, 95% c.i. 0.35 to 0.81; P = 0.004). Other factors tested did not show a significant association with the use of mesh.

- **Predictors of mesh use in open surgery**:
	- Only patients undergoing open surgery (n = 11,107) were included in the model. Patients in low-middle-income countries had lowered odds of utilizing minimally invasive surgery (adjusted OR 0.11, 95% c.i. 0.07 to 0.18; P < 0.001). Conditions such as inguinal hernias limited to the scrotum or extending to the mid-thigh or beyond were associated with lower odds of undergoing minimally invasive surgery. Hospital factors significantly affecting these odds included operation in a private hospital (adjusted OR 9.20, 95% c.i. 4.84 to 17.51; P < 0.001) and in a tertiary-level hospital (adjusted OR 3.05, 95% c.i. 1.43 to 6.53; P = 0.004).

### The tip of the iceberg: lipomatous tumours presenting as abdominal or pelvic wall hernias [^116Ck5uT]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Liposarcomas are the most common soft tissue sarcomas, predominantly occurring in the thigh or retroperitoneum. Due to their size, lipomatous tumours can manifest as hernias in either the abdominal wall or the groin. The portion of the tumour that herniates represents only the "tip of the iceberg", as the primary tumour mass is not clinically detectable and often underestimated. Given their deep location, lipomatous tumours are frequently large at presentation, making surgical management challenging. Additionally, late presentation increases the risk of de-differentiation.

This pictorial review discusses different presentations of herniating lipomatous tumours, categorized by the location of abdominal wall defects. We aim to cover a wide spectrum of hernia defects including inguinal, ventral, lumbar, sciatic, and ischiorectal hernias. Furthermore, we present cases of tumours within the psoas compartment "herniating" from the pelvis into the thigh, although these are not strictly true hernias.

		- **S**: Spigelian hernia (between rectus and oblique abdominal muscles)
		- **Div**: Rectus divarication
		- **I**: Indirect inguinal hernia (lateral to the origin of the epigastric vessels)
		- **D**: Direct inguinal hernia (medial to the epigastric vessels)
		- **F**: Femoral hernia (inferior to the inguinal ligament and medial to the femoral vein)

### Update of the international HerniaSurge guidelines for groin hernia management [^117Q5aJX]. BJS Open (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for inguinal hernia and their technical considerations, the HSG 2023 guidelines recommend using a heavyweight mesh for laparoendoscopic repair, particularly in large and direct hernias, to reduce the risk of recurrence. It is advised not to use lightweight mesh, as it does not decrease the risk of postoperative pain and may increase the risk of recurrence.

### Rare presentation of De Garengeot hernia in a 77-year-old woman [^116ZwHQP]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 77-year-old woman presented to the surgical admissions unit with right-sided groin pain. She denied experiencing fevers, nausea, vomiting, bowel, or any urinary symptoms and reported no recent trauma.

On examination, she had right groin tenderness with a partially reducible femoral hernia; she was hemodynamically stable. Her blood tests revealed a white cell count of 11.2×10⁹/L and C-reactive protein level of 84, with other blood parameters within normal range. An abdominal X-ray showed faecal loading. The impression was a right-sided incarcerated femoral hernia.

### Open anterior mesh repair vs modified open anterior mesh repair for groin hernia in women: A randomized clinical trial [^113zkyGd]. JAMA Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

The 2-week follow-up was conducted for all participants with interviews and physical examination. Wound complications were reported in 20 participants (10.1%): 12 (12.1%) in the control arm and 8 (8.1%) in the intervention arm (absolute difference = 4.0 percentage points; 95% CI, −4.3 to 12.4; p = 0.33).

- **Wound healing and infections**: In total, 7 participants (3.5%) had impaired wound healing managed with wound dressing, 6 (3.0%) had superficial wound infections managed with antibiotics, and 5 (2.5%) had severe pain requiring extra analgesics. One participant with a deep infection was reoperated on to drain pus due to an infection, but the mesh was not removed.

- **Bleeding and interventions**: One participant with postoperative bleeding had 2 small vessels ligated in the operating room.

### Amyand hernia: A case of an unusual inguinal hernia [^114LUdrz]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Amyand hernia, named for the first person to describe an inguinal hernia containing the vermiform appendix, is an uncommon variant of an inguinal hernia. Presence of the appendix in the sac complicates the management of inguinal hernias. The appendix may be more prone to rupture when contained within a hernia sac, and herniation of an inflamed appendix into the scrotum can mimic an acute scrotum.

A 50-year-old man presented with right lower quadrant abdominal pain associated with chills and anorexia. Physical examination revealed right lower quadrant tenderness and a right inguinal mass without associated skin changes. Laboratories were normal. A plain abdominal computed tomography scan for acute appendicitis showed an indirect right inguinal hernia with the appendix contained within the sac, which was incarcerated. Surgical consultation was obtained. The patient was taken to the operating room, and his appendix was removed. The hernia was coincidentally repaired, and the patient was discharged soon thereafter. In cases suggestive of acute appendicitis complicating an inguinal hernia, the diagnosis of this unusual variant must be considered.

### International guidelines for groin hernia management [^116T2Lrr]. Hernia (2018). High credibility.

With regard to specific circumstances for inguinal hernia, especially concerning female patients, the HSG 2018 guidelines recommend including femoral hernia in the differential diagnosis of groin swelling in female patients.

### Update of guidelines on laparoscopic (TAPP) and endoscopic (TEP) treatment of inguinal hernia (International Endohernia Society) [^117VK7xY]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for inguinal hernia, and more specifically with respect to technical considerations for surgery and mesh repair, the IEHS 2015 guidelines recommend using a monofilament implant with a pore size of at least 1.0–1.5 mm. This usually means a low weight implant consisting of a minimum tensile strength in all directions, including a subsequent tearing force of 16 N/cm. Considering large pore polypropylene meshes for endoscopic hernia repair is recommended, as it is harmless concerning azoospermia.

### International guidelines for groin hernia management [^111LhFP8]. Hernia (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the follow-up and surveillance for inguinal hernia, particularly in the management of postoperative pain, the HSG 2018 guidelines recommend considering a tailored approach to neurectomy. This may include neurectomy with or without mesh removal, depending on the original repair method and presentation. The type of neurectomy, whether selective or triple, should be decided at the surgeon's discretion.

### Sex-based differences in inguinal hernia factors [^115c4WRK]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Low credibility.

Much of our knowledge about inguinal hernias is based on males. Meanwhile, it is established that women have worse outcomes after inguinal hernia repair, experiencing more chronic pain and higher recurrence rates. Pediatric literature shows that inguinal hernias in females are more likely to be bilateral, incarcerated, and carry a stronger genetic predisposition than those in males. We aimed to evaluate sex-based differences in inguinal hernia factors in adults to help supplement the paucity of literature in the adult population.

- **Methods**: An institutional database of patients undergoing repair of primary inguinal hernias was queried, focusing on preoperative risk factors and operative characteristics. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent variables associated with a greater number of hernia defects found intraoperatively.

- **Results**: Among 494 patients, 202 (40.9%) were female. The number of risk factors among females was significantly higher than in males (1.53 vs. 1.2, p = 0.003). Females had significantly more constipation, GERD, and asthma, and lower BMI than males. Family history of hernias was similar between both sexes. As expected, females had significantly fewer direct hernias (12.9% vs. 32.9%, p < 0.001) and more femoral hernias (38.5% vs. 12.2%, p < 0.001) than males. Bilaterality was similar. Females undergoing inguinal hernia repair averaged 1.23 prior deliveries. Regression analysis showed that age, sex, BMI, and the number of deliveries were not correlated with the number of defects.

- **Conclusions**: Females undergoing primary inguinal hernia repair had more preoperative risk factors.

### Comparison of hernia sac transection and full sac reduction for the treatment of inguinal hernias: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [^115QyLo6]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

- **Search methods for identification of studies**: We conducted searches in the following electronic databases without applying any limitations on the language of publication:
	- The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), accessible through the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO)
	- MEDLINE (OVID MEDLINE ALL from 1946 to the Daily update)
	- SCOPUS
	- Web of Science (WOS) Index

	- Additional studies were identified by searching the bibliography of selected trials using the PubMed feature "related articles". Gray literature analysis was conducted by searching on Google Books. Furthermore, we conducted a search in the subsequent databases.

- **Data collection and analysis**: After conducting bibliographic research in the predefined databases, two authors (R.C. and P.B.) independently evaluated the titles and abstracts of the selected studies. These authors obtained the full text of all potentially eligible trials and independently screened these full texts for potential inclusion. We did not find multiple publications on the same study population.

- **Data extraction and management**: Using a data extraction form developed and pilot-tested by the authors, two authors (R.C. and M.M.) independently collected data from the included studies.

### Lightweight versus heavyweight synthetic mesh for inguinal hernia repair [^115qWCtY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Inguinal hernias account for 75% of abdominal wall hernias, with lifetime risks of 27% for men and boys, and 3% for women and girls. Indirect inguinal hernias (IIHs), occurring externally or laterally, are more common than direct inguinal hernias (DIHs) at a ratio of roughly 2:1. Causes of IIHs include a patent processus vaginalis potentially stemming from cryptorchidism, lack of carbachol response, absence of cholinergic receptors or myofibroblasts, and failure of smooth muscle apoptosis. Other factors may involve catecholaminergic activity related to luteinizing and gonadotropin-releasing hormones, and deficiencies involving epithelial‐mesenchymal transition. Increased abdominal pressure, often due to obesity, constipation, and coughing, along with diabetes, smoking, collagen distribution, peritoneal dialysis, radical prostatectomy, and family history, are potential risk factors for groin hernias. Although often asymptomatic, inguinal hernias may present with dull aching or dragging discomfort in the groin. A bulge that disappears when supine raises clinical suspicion of an inguinal hernia, underscoring the importance of clinical evaluation for diagnosis. The use of ultrasound and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging may aid in diagnosis.

### Natural history of groin hernias in women and factors leading to delay in repair: a single-institution study [^114WBYar]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

This multitude of factors significantly complicates the care of women with groin hernias, leading toward a protracted preoperative clinical course for these patients. Prior reports have noted a 3–4-fold higher rate of emergency hernia repairs in women compared to men, which may be due to this delay in care. The objective of this study was to first describe our experience with the natural history of groin hernias in women at our institution, a tertiary care academic center with a high-volume experience with inguinal hernia repair. Specifically, we aimed to elucidate personal, demographic, and socioeconomic factors that may have contributed to the protracted preoperative clinical course for these patients. In addition, we assessed preoperative clinical characteristics and operative findings at elective surgical repair.

### Rare presentation of De Garengeot hernia in a 77-year-old woman [^1116oSw4]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

The patient recovered well postoperatively and was discharged the same day without any complications. She has been asymptomatic since and was discharged after her 6-week follow-up.

- **Learning points**:
	- Acute appendicitis should be considered a differential diagnosis in patients who present with right-sided groin pain.
	- It is important to recognize De Garengeot hernia preoperatively.
	- CT scanning is an important aid to lead to a diagnosis and can assist in planning surgery.
	- Obtain a well-informed consent from the patient.

### Comparison of hernia sac transection and full sac reduction for the treatment of inguinal hernias: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [^114Di9W8]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: The study protocol for this systematic review and meta‐analysis was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022306845). We conducted a systematic review of literature updated on 1 October 2022 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

- **Types of studies**: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical control studies (CCT) were included, regardless of their publishing status, language of publication, or if outcomes were provided.

- **Types of participants**: Our study encompassed both children (0–18 years) and adults with inguinal hernia who received any type of suture repair, as well as adults who underwent Lichtenstein open tension‐free repair for primary inguinal hernia. There were no limitations based on race or sex. We excluded studies that combined data from both adults and children and instead included only studies where data were reported separately for each subgroup (adults and children). We included studies of all types of inguinal hernias (direct or indirect) without considering their size or bilaterality. Irrespective of the length of follow‐up, we included all studies that reported data on the primary or secondary outcomes.

- **Types of interventions**: Patients underwent open inguinal hernia repair and sac transection with or without ligation. Only patients who had undergone elective repairs were included, whereas those who underwent emergency repairs were excluded.

- **Types of outcome measures**:
	- **Primary outcomes**: Recurrence of clinical hernia with a minimum follow-up period.

### Uterus and ovary hernia of the canal of Nuck [^112JVpKQ]. Pediatric Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

A hernia of the canal of Nuck is a rare condition that occurs in female infants. The canal of Nuck is a portion of the processus vaginalis of the peritoneum located within the inguinal canal. The processus vaginalis is an evagination of the parietal peritoneum of the embryonic lower anterior abdominal wall that extends into the inguinal canal. Typically, it loses its connection with the peritoneal cavity; however, failure to close can result in a hydrocele or hernia.

In this case, we present a 2-month-old girl with a palpable, movable mass in the right inguinal region. Ultrasonography revealed a hernia containing the uterus and ovary. Ultrasonography is the preferred examination method for female infants with a pathological mass in the groin, as its availability and accuracy facilitate proper diagnosis and surgical treatment.

### 2017 update of the WSES guidelines for emergency repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias [^111ue2zT]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for inguinal hernia, particularly with respect to indications for emergency repair in wound class III-IV, the WSES 2017 guidelines recommend performing primary hernia repair when the defect size is small (< 3 cm) in stable patients with strangulated hernias that have bowel necrosis and/or gross enteric spillage during intestinal resection (contaminated, CDC wound class III) or peritonitis from bowel perforation (dirty surgical field, CDC wound class IV). Consider using a biological mesh for repair when a direct suture is not feasible.

### Nephroptosis and ureteroinguinal incarcerated hernia mimicking acute appendicitis [^115up4xQ]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

The involvement of the kidney, perirenal fat, and ureter is a rare variant of inguinal hernia. We report a case of a 78-year-old man presenting with typical clinical signs of acute appendicitis. Ultrasonography and CT scan revealed ptosis of the right kidney, with a major part of the perirenal capsule involved in a large right-sided inguinal hernia, causing acute obstruction of the ureter and urostasis. Acute surgery was performed, involving resection of perirenal fat, liberation, resection, and neoimplantation of the ureter, and hernioplasty. The postoperative period was uneventful. This case illustrates the diagnostic unpredictability of acute appendicitis as well as the anatomic variety of inguinal hernias.

### Inguinal hernia in girls: A retrospective analysis of over 1000 patients [^117XjjqQ]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

In girls with inguinal hernia, the timing of surgical repair to prevent ovarian strangulation and screening for Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) remain controversial. This study assesses the incidence of ovarian strangulation and AIS, along with associated risk factors.

- **Methods**: Electronic patient records were used to study girls aged 0–15 years who underwent inguinal hernia repair between 2000 and 2017. Patients with incomplete data were excluded. Risk factors were identified using logistic regression.

- **Results**: This study includes 1084 girls (median [IQR] age: 133.5 [14–281] weeks) who underwent 1132 hernia repairs (1015 unilateral, 117 bilateral) within a median (IQR) time interval of 12 (6–23) days following diagnosis. The hernia sac intraoperatively contained the ovary in 235 (21.7%) patients, with the ovary being strangulated in 14 (6%). Risk factors for ovarian strangulation included younger gestational age (OR 0.49), higher birth weight (OR 32.18), and first presentation at the emergency department (OR 13.07); however, some data were missing. Ectopic testis was found in seven (0.6%) patients. Metachronous contralateral inguinal hernia and ipsilateral recurrence developed in 6.1% and 0.3% of cases, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Ovarian hernia was diagnosed in 21.7% of cases, with ovarian strangulation occurring in 6%. No definite conclusions can be drawn regarding risk factors for strangulation and the timing of surgery in girls with irreducible ovarian hernia.

- **Level of evidence**: Level III.

### Assessment and management of inguinal hernias in children [^115CGYsf]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in children. However, several controversial issues, such as the optimal timing and approach to repair, continue to be debated. This publication reviews the available data pertaining to these controversial issues and identifies best practices in the management of inguinal hernias in children.

### Hidden hernias hurt: A plea for early diagnosis and treatment of occult inguinal hernias [^1138R2Ed]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Low credibility.

Hidden or occult inguinal hernias are symptomatic hernias that do not present with a bulge. For some surgeons, if a bulge is not present, then no hernia repair is contemplated. We report preoperative findings of patients with occult inguinal hernias and outcomes after repair to assist in early detection and treatment of this special population.

- **Methods**: All patients who underwent inguinal hernia repairs from 2008 to 2019 were reviewed. Patients were classified as having occult inguinal hernias if they (a) complained of groin pain, (b) did not have bulging on examination, (c) had supportive imaging showing an inguinal hernia, and (d) were confirmed to have inguinal hernias that were repaired intraoperatively. Presentation and outcomes were compared with the non-occult group treated during the same period.

- **Results**: Of 485 patients who underwent elective inguinal hernia repairs over 10 years, 212 (44%) had occult inguinal hernias. Patients in the occult group were significantly more likely to be female, younger, and with higher BMI compared to the non-occult group. They also experienced more preoperative pain for a significantly longer time. This was associated with a higher incidence of pain medication usage, including opioids, in the occult group. On physical examination, those with occult hernias were twice as likely to have tenderness over the inguinal canal. Most hernia repairs (66%) were laparoscopic, and 94% used mesh. Postoperatively, the occult group had an 83% resolution of symptoms after hernia repair.

- **Conclusion**: Some surgeons hesitate to recommend hernia repair to patients without a visible bulge, but our findings emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and treatment for occult inguinal hernias due to the significant improvement in patient outcomes.

### Update of guidelines on laparoscopic (TAPP) and endoscopic (TEP) treatment of inguinal hernia (International Endohernia Society) [^114jVGhb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Evidence-based training for endoscopic/laparoscopic hernia repair is crucial given its advanced nature and the steep learning curve associated with the procedure.

- **Academic medical centers and clinical competence**: The effective education of medical staff in hernia repair involves comprehensive curricula that utilize computer simulation and computer-assisted instruction. Both undergraduate and graduate medical education programs are integral to this training.

- **Herniorrhaphy and laparoscopy education**: Training encompasses both female and male trainees, and emphasizes the significance of hernia surgery and retroperitoneal space procedures. The educational approach involves program evaluation, taking into account time factors and treatment outcomes in the United States.

- **General surgery and patient satisfaction**: The research considers factors such as length of stay and linear models to ensure patient satisfaction. Clinical studies highlight the importance of various educational methodologies, including the single-blind method and user-computer interfaces.

Searches were conducted using various databases including PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus. The search terms led to 46 abstracts being identified, with 24 full papers reviewed. However, seven papers were excluded due to their focus on mathematical models regarding VR simulation for hernia repair. The review included five meta-analyses and systematic reviews, two randomized controlled trials, and ten prospective cohort studies.

Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR) is recognized as an advanced procedure requiring experience in up to 250 cases to achieve proficiency.

### Inguinal hernias: Room for a better understanding [^116NM2tr]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Inguinal hernias are a common problem but often present with diagnostic dilemmas, in part due to the complex anatomy of the region. A simplified analogy is put forward in hopes of increasing the understanding of the anatomy, and guidance is given to differentiate between direct and indirect hernias, emphasizing their potential complication rates.

### Desarda versus Lichtenstein technique for primary inguinal hernia treatment: 3-year results of a randomized clinical trial [^1155Voac]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). High credibility.

Inguinal hernias, due to their frequency, remain an important medical problem. The estimated lifetime risk for inguinal hernia is 27% for men and 3% for women. Annual morbidity rates in various countries vary from 100 to 300 per 100,000 citizens. Until 2009, there were no written surgical guidelines for hernia treatment. In that year, the European Hernia Society (EHS) published its recommendations based on the analysis of literature and the results of clinical trials. According to the EHS guidelines, mesh-based techniques — the Lichtenstein technique in particular — and endoscopic methods are recommended for the treatment of symptomatic primary inguinal hernia in adult men (strength of recommendation IA). Departing from this firm opinion, the Shouldice method has been acknowledged as acceptable.

Schumpelick emphasized the effectiveness of the Shouldice technique during his presentation at the 2011 EHS Congress in Ghent. Considering these facts, some questions arise: Is the Shouldice technique the only non-mesh method that ensures good clinical results? Are other tissue-based techniques effective in inguinal hernia repair if performed correctly?

The synthetic prostheses most often used in the inguinal area can create new clinical problems such as foreign body sensation in the groin, discomfort, and abdominal wall stiffness, which may affect the everyday functioning of the patient. Surgical-site infections, often with clinical symptoms delayed for many years, are more frequent after hernia treatment using mesh. Migration of the mesh from the treatment site is another potential issue.

### Mesh versus non-mesh for emergency groin hernia repair [^116rRbzk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

A groin hernia is a collective name for inguinal and femoral hernias, which can present acutely with incarceration or strangulation of the hernia sac content, requiring emergency treatment. Timely repair of emergency groin hernias is crucial due to the risk of reduced blood supply and thus damage to the bowel, but the optimal surgical approach is unclear. While mesh repair is the standard treatment for elective hernia surgery, using mesh for emergency groin hernia repair remains controversial due to the risk of surgical site infection.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of mesh compared with non-mesh in emergency groin hernia repair in adult patients with an inguinal or femoral hernia.

- **Search methods**: On 5 August 2022, we searched the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase Ovid, as well as two trial registers for ongoing and completed trials. Additionally, we performed forward and backward citation searches for the included trials and relevant review articles. We searched without any language or publication restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mesh with non-mesh repair in emergency groin hernia surgery in adults. We included any mesh and any non-mesh repairs. All studies fulfilling the study, participant, and intervention criteria were included irrespective of reported outcomes.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methodology. We presented dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We based missing data analysis on best- and worst-case scenarios.

The findings of this systematic review provide a critical evaluation of the current practices involving mesh versus non-mesh repair for emergency groin hernia repair.

### A case of endometriosis presenting as an inguinal hernia [^115eZFVN]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a common clinical presentation for gynaecologists. Occasionally, it can present to general surgeons as a swelling in the groin or abdominal wall. This condition should be included in the differential diagnosis in female patients. A 32-year-old woman with a 2-year history of a painful persistent lump in her right groin was referred to the general surgeons by her general practitioner with a diagnosis of a suspected inguinal hernia. MRI excluded a hernia, and exploration of the groin and subsequent histology confirmed the lesion to be an endometrial deposit.

### Evidence-based change of practice in the management of unilateral inguinal hernia [^112jpkJh]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Contralateral inguinal exploration in children with unilateral inguinal hernia is still controversial. Only 20% of patients with patent processus vaginalis would develop a clinically apparent hernia [Miltenburg DM, Nutctern JG, Jaksic Tkozinetz CA. Meta-analysis of the risk of metachronous hernia in infants and children. Am J Surg 1997;174:741–4]. In 1999, our unit changed the practice of performing routine contralateral inguinal exploration of male children younger than 2 years and female children younger than 5 years to inguinal herniotomy of the symptomatic side only, based on a meta-analysis published by Miltenburg et al [Meta-analysis of the risk of metachronous hernia in infants and children. Am J Surg 1997;174:741–4]. We explored the contralateral inguinal area only in babies with a history of prematurity.

- **Methods**: A prospective study of patients subjected to unilateral inguinal herniotomy from 1999 to 2001 was performed. Age, sex, side of the hernia, and incarceration at presentation were recorded. The incidence of metachronous inguinal hernia (MIH) and its risk factors were analyzed. The follow-up ranged from 36 to 72 months.

- **Results**: Of the 409 patients who presented with inguinal hernia, 264 underwent unilateral inguinal herniotomy. The rest were either children with bilateral inguinal hernia or premature babies who were offered bilateral inguinal herniotomy. Of these 264 patients, 180 (68%) had right-sided inguinal hernia and 84 (32%) had left-sided inguinal hernia. Fourteen (5%) patients subsequently presented with MIH.

Regarding surgical interventions for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to technical considerations for surgery, the EAST 2025 guidelines recommend considering performing mesh repair over primary tissue repairs. They also suggest using laparoscopic approaches over open approaches in patients with acutely incarcerated or strangulated inguinal hernias.

### What is inside the hernia sac [^113FZw2C]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Hernias are a common problem in general surgery, with about 75% occurring in the inguinal region. An indirect inguinal hernia is the most common type of hernia irrespective of gender. Strangulation is its most severe complication, occurring in 1–3% of cases, especially at the extremes of age. However, surgeons are occasionally surprised by the intraoperative findings during a common procedure such as an inguinal hernia repair.

- **Case presentation**: An 89-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with lower abdominal pain and a lump in her left inguinal region since that morning. She had no symptoms of bowel movement changes or fever. The patient had recently been discharged from the internal medicine ward after treatment for a urinary tract infection and a perianal abscess with a 1-week course of antibiotics. She also suffered from chronic renal disease, chronic anaemia, high blood pressure, cerebral vascular disease (with left hemiparesis after an ischemic vascular accident), and dyslipidaemia.

Physical examination revealed a calm, awake but disoriented patient. She was slightly dehydrated, haemodynamically stable, and afebrile. Her abdomen was diffusely painful, with rebound tenderness, especially in the lower quadrants. In the left inguinal region, a painful, tense mass of nearly 5 cm was documented. No inflammatory signs or external genitalia anomalies were observed. Laboratory results were within normal ranges. An incarcerated inguinal/femoral hernia was the initial hypothesis, and a pelvic ultrasound was performed.

### A rare content of congenital inguinal hernia: a case report of splenogonadal fusion [^116mSXs7]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Splenogonadal fusion (SGF) is a rare congenital malformation that occurs during embryonic development. SGF typically presents as a left-sided scrotal swelling, left inguinal hernia, scrotal mass, or cryptorchidism. Therefore, it is easily misdiagnosed, and unnecessary orchiectomy may occur. This study aimed to report a rare case of SGF.

- **Case presentation**: A 5-month-old male child presented with a history of obvious left scrotal swelling for 1 month, which progressively worsened 10 hours before the hospital visit. The ultrasound examination exhibited a solid mass in the left scrotum, with an echo quite similar to that in the testicle, extending into the abdominal cavity through an identical echogenic band structure. After surgical resection, the pathological examination confirmed that the submitted tissue was spleen tissue with extensive bleeding.

- **Conclusion**: Ultrasound can provide important information regarding the diagnosis of SGF. The possibility of SGF should be considered for further differential diagnosis in similar patients.

### Retroperitoneal displacement of ovary and fallopian tube: a complication of surgical management of incarcerated inguinal hernia in female infants [^114omKsk]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Sliding indirect inguinal hernias containing the ipsilateral uterine adnexa are not uncommon in female infants. We report a case of a 12-year-old girl presenting with a benign tumor (serous cystadenofibroma) in a retroperitoneally located ovary. The patient had a history of hernia repair in the neonatal period. Displacement of the ovary and fallopian tube in the retroperitoneal space is a rarely reported complication of pediatric inguinal hernia surgery. Uncorrected, this can result in hormonal dysfunction, decreased fertility, and difficult and unclear situations during abdominal surgery in adulthood. A laparoscopic approach for hernia repair may prevent this complication.

### Update of guidelines on laparoscopic (TAPP) and endoscopic (TEP) treatment of inguinal hernia (International Endohernia Society) [^113vSAMk]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

TAPP and TEP repair in patients after previous transabdominal radical prostatectomy:

- **No new statements or recommendations**: The review found no substantial updates in the recommendations for TAPP and TEP repairs in these patients.

- **Pitfalls of TAPP and TEP repair for reinguinal hernia**: Again, there are no new statements or recommendations regarding this aspect.

- **TAPP and TEP repair and the occult synchronous hernias**:

	- **New statements**: These are identical to previous guidelines except for a newly added statement.

	- **New recommendation**: This is also identical to previous guidance, with the exception of a newly introduced recommendation.

- **Comments**:

	- Putnis et al. performed a retrospective review of 362 patients who underwent 484 TEP inguinal hernia repairs. They found 18 cases of synchronous femoral hernias, with a statistically higher incidence in females (37%) compared to males (3%) (p < 0.001). The study suggests that all women presenting with an inguinal hernia should also have a formal assessment of the femoral canal.

	- Henrikson et al. examined 461 patients undergoing laparoscopic hernia repair for the incidence of occult synchronous femoral hernia. A significantly higher incidence of unsuspected femoral hernias was found in patients undergoing repair for recurrence (23/250, 9.2%) compared to those undergoing primary repair (8/211, 3.8%), p = 0.02. Furthermore, 38.1% of women operated on for a reinguinal hernia presented with an unsuspected femoral hernia at surgery, in contrast to 6.6% of men, p = 0.003.

	- Dulucq et al. prospectively performed 337 laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs in 263 patients. All were assessed for occult concomitant hernias, with 44 unexpected hernias encountered and repaired with minimal complications.

### Crossing the canal: Looking beyond hernias - Spectrum of common, uncommon and atypical pathologies in the inguinal canal [^115fn3Us]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

The inguinal canal can present a diverse range of pathologies due to its complex anatomy and varying contents in males and females. Imaging plays a significant role in the appropriate diagnosis and management of these pathologies, as they have similar clinical presentations, such as pain and swelling. Various pathologies in the inguinal region include congenital, infectious/inflammatory, vascular, neoplastic, and iatrogenic conditions. This paper provides an overview of the role of various modalities, such as ultrasound, CT, and MRI, in the evaluation of inguinal pathologies.

### Irreducible indirect inguinal hernia containing uterus and bilateral adnexa in a premature female infant: Report of an exceptional case and review of the literature [^1179kpAf]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Indirect inguinal hernia is the most common congenital anomaly in the pediatric age group. About 15–20% of hernias in infant girls contain an ovary, sometimes with a Fallopian tube. The presence of the uterus incarcerated with the adnexa is a very unusual occurrence in female infants with a normal karyotype and phenotype, being commonly associated with several disorders of sex development. The surgical repair of this form of hernia is more difficult than a common herniorrhaphy because of the adhesions between the organs and the wall of the sac, and the risk of damage during their freeing. We present a rare case of irreducible indirect inguinal hernia containing the uterus and bilateral adnexa (fallopian tubes and ovaries) in a premature female infant, discussing the etiopathogenesis and the surgical features of this disorder.

### Ureteral inguinal hernia: An uncommon trap for general surgeons [^114jYrBt]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Ureteral hernias were first described in 1880, and fewer than 140 cases have been reported in the literature, with even fewer described with incarceration and ureteric obstruction. The majority of these cases are associated with inguinal hernias, and incarceration is relatively uncommon due to the large size of the inguinal hernia.

Ureteral inguinal hernias are more common in men, typically in the fifth and sixth decades of life. Many cases occur in patients with a history of kidney transplantation, given the anterior location of the transplanted ureter within the space of Retzius. Ureteral inguinal hernias also occur more commonly on the right side than the left side. This is because, on the left, the fascia of Toldt sits at the level of the secondary root of the sigmoid mesocolon, which appears to tighten and fix the ureter in the retroperitoneum.

Ureteral inguinal hernias are predominantly indirect rather than direct (80% vs. 20%), and can occur in two anatomical variants. A paraperitoneal type, where the ureter slides beside a peritoneal sac and constitutes part of the hernia wall, occurs in 80% of cases. Less commonly, an extraperitoneal type occurs (20%), where the ureter is accompanied only by retroperitoneal fat and no peritoneal sac is present. Bladder involvement is very rare as it is associated with direct hernia and usually presents with symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction such as urinary retention, frequency, and haematuria.

A ureteral inguinal hernia often goes undiagnosed until surgical repair is performed, during which the ureter is inadvertently injured. This highlights…

### A 3-month-old female with an inguinal mass [^116qs15A]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Inguinal masses are a common finding among infants. The differential diagnosis of these masses in infants is broad, with inguinal hernia being the most common diagnosis in both males and females. However, the evaluation and management of males versus females with inguinal masses differ due to the greater potential for gonadal involvement in males.

- **Objectives**: The pathophysiology and management of inguinal hernias are discussed, with a specific focus on inguinal hernias in females.

- **Case report**: We present a case of a 3-month-old girl with an inguinal hernia and a mass, found to be an incarcerated ovary.

- **Conclusions**: Inguinal masses in infancy are common, with inguinal hernia being the most prevalent cause by far. A female infant with a suspected inguinal hernia should be thoroughly evaluated to determine whether ovarian content is present.

### International guidelines for groin hernia management [^1164UisS]. Hernia (2018). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for inguinal hernia, specifically concerning technical considerations for surgery, the HSG 2018 guidelines recommend using large pore (1–1.5 mm) monofilament synthetic flat meshes. These should have a burst strength of 16 N/m² and a minimum tensile strength in all directions, including subsequent tearing force, of 16 N/cm².

### Laparoscopic single instrument closure of inguinal hernia in female children: A novel technique [^1115qi47]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Inguinal hernia repair is the most common operation performed by pediatric surgeons, with herniotomy through a groin incision as the gold standard. Recently, minimal access surgery (MAS) has challenged this conventional surgery. At present, cosmesis is a primary target for all MAS, especially in females. MAS techniques have evolved to become more minimally invasive, transitioning from three-port to two-port and now to the single-port technique. However, the most recent emerging techniques show a tendency toward simple extracorporeal suturing with subcutaneous knotting, which has several drawbacks. We introduce a novel technique for laparoscopic repair of inguinal hernia in female children using laparoscopic single instrument closure (LSIC) with intracorporeal knotting.

- **Patients and methods**: This prospective study was conducted at Al-Azhar University Hospital between February 2012 and August 2014. Sixty girls with 68 congenital inguinal hernias were subjected to LSIC. Criteria for enrollment included female gender and unilateral or bilateral inguinal hernia. Exclusion criteria included recurrent hernia, hernia in morbidly obese children, complicated hernia, and girls who could not tolerate pneumoperitoneum. The main outcome measurements included operative time, feasibility of the procedure, complications, and cosmesis.

- **Results**: A total of 60 girls with 68 congenital inguinal hernias were subjected to LSIC, with a mean age of 2.2 ± 2.25 years (range = 0.58–10.00 years). Complete purse-string closure of the internal inguinal ring (IIR) with intracorporeal knotting was achieved for all cases. All cases were completed laparoscopically.

### Hernia uterine inguinale: An uncommon cause of pelvic pain in the adult female patient [^1152NbFA]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Hernia uterine inguinale is a rare condition often presenting within the first few years of life as an asymptomatic palpable mass in the inguinal or groin area. This type of hernia contains uterine tissue and may include oviducts, ovaries, and rarely the bladder. We report a case of a woman with a history of pelvic pain, found to have a rudimentary uterine horn herniating through the internal inguinal ring.

A 24-year-old woman presented with noncyclic pelvic pain and irregular menses. Imaging revealed a solid 6 × 2 cm mass posterolateral to the ascending colon at the level of the pelvic brim, in addition to an absent right kidney and a suspected unicornuate uterus. Laparoscopy with excision of the pelvic mass and appendectomy was performed. Surgical findings revealed a right rudimentary uterine horn herniating through the internal inguinal ring, attached to an elongated ovary and an oviduct tightly tethered to the pelvic sidewall. The result of the pathologic study was consistent with a rudimentary uterine horn, an ovary with multiple cortical cysts, a normal oviduct, and a normal appendix.

Hernia uterine inguinale is a rare condition and an even more uncommon cause of pelvic pain, instead presenting as an asymptomatic palpable groin mass early in life. This has been reported most commonly in the literature as both persistent Müllerian duct syndrome and male pseudohermaphroditism. It is most often seen in a phenotypically normal male infant having both testes and uterine tissue present. Few cases have been documented to occur in the female sex, in the adult patient, or as a cause of pelvic pain.

### Ultrasonographic findings after laparoscopic repair of paediatric female inguinal hernias: the 'vanishing rosebud' [^113mTSB1]. Pediatric Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic surgery is a good alternative to the open technique for treating hernias in female paediatric patients. The laparoscopically inverted and sutured hernia sac forms a nodule, the long-term fate of which has not been previously studied radiologically.

- **Objective**: To describe the early and delayed US changes after laparoscopic inversion and suturing of paediatric female inguinal hernias.

- **Materials and methods**: Twenty girls (age 1.5 months to 12 years; median 4.6 years) who underwent laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair were prospectively evaluated with US the day before and the day after the procedure. Delayed scans were obtained at 1, 6, and 12 months.

- **Results**: The laparoscopic procedure involved inversion and suturing of the hernia sac, which resulted in a nodule that plugged the internal inguinal ring and resembled a rosebud laparoscopically. US detected the 'rosebud' in all cases on the first postoperative day. Initially appearing as a rounded or ovoid mass with a slightly hypoechoic texture, the 'rosebud' became progressively smaller, more hypoechoic, and more lobulated on follow-up. It disappeared in all but two cases at 6 months and in all cases at 1 year. There was no US evidence of recurrence.

- **Conclusions**: The 'rosebud' formed by this laparoscopic procedure displays typical US features and temporal changes.

### Rare presentation of De Garengeot hernia in a 77-year-old woman [^114dZJ6h]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Investigations revealed that ultrasound can show bowel contents within the hernia sac. However, given the acute presentation of the patient, CT scanning remains the gold standard for diagnosis. The patient underwent a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which demonstrated a right femoral hernia containing the appendix. Notably, the appendix was perforated at its tip within the sac, accompanied by significant local inflammatory changes and soft-tissue stranding.

### Mesh versus non-mesh for inguinal and femoral hernia repair [^116tzZXK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2001. Hernias are protrusions of all or part of an organ through the body wall that normally contains it. Groin hernias include inguinal (96%) and femoral (4%) hernias, and are often symptomatic with discomfort. They are extremely common, with an estimated lifetime risk in men of 27%. Occasionally, they may present as emergencies with complications such as bowel incarceration, obstruction, and strangulation. The definitive treatment of all hernias is surgical repair, with inguinal hernia repair being one of the most common surgical procedures performed. Mesh (hernioplasty) and the traditional non-mesh repairs (herniorrhaphy) are commonly used, with an increasing preference towards mesh repairs in high-income countries.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of different inguinal and femoral hernia repair techniques in adults, specifically comparing closure with mesh versus without mesh. Outcomes include hernia recurrence, complications (including neurovascular or visceral injury, haematoma, seroma, testicular injury, infection, postoperative pain), mortality, duration of operation, postoperative hospital stay, and time to return to activities of daily living.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases on 9 May 2018: Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (from 1950), Ovid Embase (from 1974), and Web of Science (from 1900). Furthermore, we checked the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).

### Inguinal hernia containing the uterus in the pediatric patient: A systematic review [^113ftQaC]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Inguinal hernia containing the uterus in pediatric patients with normal karyotype and phenotype is an extremely rare entity, and no consensus is available concerning diagnosis, surgical management, and follow-up.

- **Methods**: A systematic review according to the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis protocol was conducted. Studies including pediatric female patients with inguinal hernia containing the uterus were searched. Keywords and MeSH term searches were conducted on Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science. We additionally reviewed our center's clinical records and found one patient with an inguinal uterus hernia that was included in the statistical analysis.

- **Results**: Thirty-six articles and 73 patients were considered for this analysis. The median gestational age at birth was 36 weeks. The inguinal mass was first noticed at a median age of 1.5 months (0–18 months), on the left side in 61% of cases (on the right in 39%). Sixty percent of patients had no associated symptoms or signs; however, 37.5% showed symptoms and signs of an incarcerated hernia. The median age at surgery was 2 months (1–72 months). In all patients, one or both adnexa herniated with the uterus. An open approach was more frequently used (56.4%). Contralateral duct exploration and ligation were performed in seven patients (24.1%). No postoperative complications or recurrences have been described.

- **Conclusions**: The data obtained do not allow us to draw univocal conclusions on which is the best management for these patients. It is still unclear if an elective approach in an asymptomatic patient might bear long-term consequences.

### Hernias: Inguinal and incisional [^113992bY]. Lancet (2003). Low credibility.

In the past decade, hernia surgery has been challenged by two new technologies: laparoscopy, which has attempted to change the traditional open operative techniques, and prosthetic mesh, which has achieved much lower recurrence rates. The demand by healthcare providers for increasingly efficient and cost-effective surgery has resulted in modifications to pathways of care to encourage more widespread adoption of day case, outpatient surgery, and local anesthesia. Additionally, the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence has recommended strategies for bilateral and recurrent hernias. Here, we discuss these strategies and review some neglected aspects of hernia management such as trusses, antibiotic cover, return to work and activity, and emergency surgery. Many of the principles of management apply equally to inguinal and incisional hernias. We recommend that the more difficult and complex procedures be referred to specialists.

### Open mesh versus laparoscopic mesh repair of inguinal hernia [^113Yd6cZ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Repair of inguinal hernias in men is a common surgical procedure, but the most effective surgical technique is unknown.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned men with inguinal hernias at 14 Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers to either open mesh or laparoscopic mesh repair. The primary outcome was recurrence of hernias at two years. Secondary outcomes included complications and patient-centered outcomes.

- **Results**: Of the 2164 patients who were randomly assigned to one of the two procedures, 1983 underwent an operation; two-year follow-up was completed in 1696 (85.5 percent). Recurrences were more common in the laparoscopic group (87 of 862 patients [10.1 percent]) than in the open group (41 of 834 patients [4.9 percent]; odds ratio, 2.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.2). The rate of complications was higher in the laparoscopic-surgery group than in the open-surgery group (39.0 percent vs. 33.4 percent; adjusted odds ratio, 1.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.6). The laparoscopic-surgery group had less pain initially than the open-surgery group on the day of surgery (difference in mean score on a visual analogue scale, 10.2 mm; 95 percent confidence interval, 4.8 to 15.6) and at two weeks (6.1 mm; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 10.5) and returned to normal activities one day earlier (adjusted hazard ratio for a shorter time to return to normal activities, 1.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.3). In prespecified analyses, there was a significant interaction between the surgical approach (open or laparoscopic) and the type of hernia.

### Is the ovary in an inguinal hernia 'descended' like a testis or not [^116JgJbk]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to explore how ovaries appear inside an inguinal hernia since the descent of testes through the inguinal canal is well understood, but the case of ovaries remains controversial. We reviewed the literature to determine whether ovarian "descent" has been described.

The English literature from 1950 to 2014 was reviewed via PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science to identify papers describing an ovary in the hernia sac. Reports were examined to find whether the ovary prolapsed or "descended", and the anatomy of its supporting ligaments: cranial suspensory ligament (CSL) and round ligament (female gubernaculum, RL).

In forty reports of over 7,140 inguinal herniotomies and/or imaging studies in females, the hernia contains an ovary in 15–20% of cases, often with the ipsilateral fallopian tube. The RL and ovary were aligned along the same path as testicular descent only rarely in Müllerian anomalies, with an isolated uterine horn preceding the ovary into the sac. The ligament usually found inside the hernia sac was the CSL, not the RL.

The high frequency of an incarcerated ovary, along with the close proximity of the CSL to the internal ring in females, is consistent with a sliding hernia pulling the CSL (and ovary) into the hernia sac, rather than ovarian "descent" by traction on the RL.

### Reduction en masse of inguinal hernia: A review of a rare and potential fatal complication following reduction of inguinal hernia [^115FgrY8]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Reduction en masse is the reduction of a hernial sac into the pre-peritoneal space with a loop of bowel remaining incarcerated at the neck of the sac, leading to early strangulation. This is a rare complication, usually encountered with inguinal hernias, with a false reassurance to the patient and the treating physician that complete reduction has been achieved. Unless early intervention is carried out, this condition will typically present with worsening pain and the absence of an appreciable hernia bulge at the groin, and intestinal necrosis may be encountered on exploration. The outcome will depend on the severity of peritonitis/sepsis, and mortality remains high for late presentations. A case of early presentation of reduction en masse of an inguinal hernia is reported with a review of the existing literature.

### Natural history of groin hernias in women and factors leading to delay in repair: a single-institution study [^114xx4MB]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

Groin hernias are a common surgical problem, with over 20 million patients undergoing surgical repair annually worldwide. Of these surgeries, 750,000 are performed in the United States. Compared to males, who have a 27–43% lifetime risk of developing a groin hernia, females have only a 3–6% lifetime risk. Consequently, females account for only 10% of all patients undergoing herniorrhaphy.

The clinical signs and symptoms of groin hernias are variable and may be quite subtle in females. These include non-specific groin pain, paraesthesia in a specific dermatomal distribution, or more acute symptoms such as an irreducible bulge with or without features of intestinal obstruction. Some patients may also experience symptoms intermittently, becoming manifest only when in certain positions (upright > supine) or during episodes of raised intra-abdominal pressure (e.g. straining, coughing, sneezing). Furthermore, up to one-third of patients do not volunteer symptoms directly attributable to a hernia.

As a result, female patients often present to their family practitioner, non-surgical healthcare provider, gynecologist, or even psychiatrists prior to seeing a surgeon. Consequently, vague groin symptoms may be attributed to other more common pathologies, including osteoarthritis of the pelvic girdle, gastroenteritis, lymphadenopathy, diverticulitis, or constipation. This is compounded by equivocal groin examination findings, ultimately leading to a delay in care for women and exposing them to a risk for emergency complications.

### Leg pain-an unexpected twist [^116BY8Us]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Obturator hernia is a rare condition, often presenting with non-specific symptoms such as thigh pain, groin pain, nausea, or vomiting. It is most common in thin, elderly women and is often diagnosed late in the disease course, resulting in complications and high morbidity and mortality.

- **Case report**: We present the case of a 75-year-old female who presented with right thigh pain with no other symptoms. After a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, the patient was found to have an incarcerated obturator hernia complicated by a small bowel obstruction, ultimately requiring urgent surgical intervention.

- **Importance for emergency physicians**: Given the very general symptoms associated with the condition, the diagnosis of obturator hernia can easily be missed, leading to a delayed diagnosis, more complications, and a higher morbidity and mortality rate. Due to the risk associated with a delayed diagnosis, it is important for emergency physicians to maintain a high clinical suspicion for the diagnosis.

### Update of the international HerniaSurge guidelines for groin hernia management [^115Aa8xg]. BJS Open (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for inguinal hernia, specifically with respect to the choice of surgical approach, the HSG 2023 guidelines recommend considering laparoscopic hernia repair if expertise is available. Perform a flat mesh repair for inguinal hernia, individualized to the technique that provides the best possible results in the center where surgery is performed, regardless of the presence or absence of bowel strangulation.

### Natural history of groin hernias in women and factors leading to delay in repair: A single-institution study [^113jHLy7]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

Of the 1331 patients identified in the database who underwent elective inguinal hernia repair during the five-year study period, 112 (8.4%) met the initial inclusion criteria. Thirty-one patients (2.3%) who had incidental groin hernias repaired at the time of abdominal wall reconstruction and 1 (0.1%) with incomplete records were excluded. The final cohort comprised 80 (6%) female patients. The mean age of participants was 61.2 years (± 15.4, range 23–92), and the majority were Caucasian (68.8%) and non-smokers (92.5%).

- **Preoperative characteristics**: The majority of patients were overweight, with a mean BMI of 27.3 (± 5.8, range 16.4–48.9), and most were classified as ASA III (67.5%). The most common symptoms encountered included non-specific groin pain (73.8%) and an intermittent groin bulge (48.8%). Many patients (40%) experienced symptoms for more than 1 year, while 33.8% experienced symptoms for less than 3 months. Patients averaged 1.2 clinic visits regarding their hernia and waited an average of 22.6 days (range 1–90) prior to seeing a surgeon. While the majority (60%) were in-network referrals, there was no significant difference with respect to the duration of symptoms prior to surgical repair when compared with those referred out-of-network or self-referrals (p = 0.934). Sixty-three patients (78.8%) had preoperative imaging. The most common modality was Computed Tomography (CT) (56.8%), followed by Ultrasound (US) (39.2%) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (4.0%).

### Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair with self-fixated meshes: a randomized controlled trial [^111ZGWGD]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Hernia in the inguinal area is fairly common; approximately 27% of males and 3% of females develop a groin hernia during their lifetime. Hernia treatment mainly involves surgery, with more than 20 million procedures performed annually. Multiple treatment options exist for inguinal hernia surgery, including open or laparoscopic techniques. According to guidelines, usage of mesh is recommended in both open and laparoscopic procedures as it reduces hernia recurrences. However, mesh is associated with both acute and chronic post-operative pain.

Laparoscopic techniques include transabdominal preperitoneal repair (TAPP) and total extraperitoneal repair (TEP). In TAPP, the procedure is performed through the abdominal cavity, while in TEP, the preperitoneal space is entered directly. Both TAPP and TEP yield good results with low complication and recurrence rates and ensure rapid recovery after surgery. Guidelines recommend both techniques for laparoscopic hernia surgery. Both techniques have comparable results regarding chronic pain and quality of life after surgery. In laparoscopic procedures, mesh is placed in the preperitoneal space to cover the myopectineal orifice and posterior part of the inguinal area. The mesh can be fixated by tacks, glue, or sutures. Alternatively, the mesh is not fixated at all, or a self-fixating mesh can be used. Studies recommend avoiding tacks, as they appear to cause more post-operative pain than glue or non-fixation.

### Inguinal hernias containing the uterus: a case series of 7 female children [^116Dytt3]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Hernia uteri inguinale (HUI), or uterus-containing inguinal hernia, is an extremely rare condition in which the uterus and uterine adnexa are found in the inguinal hernial sac in female infants. The uterus may be free within the sac, adherent to the wall by adhesions, or a true sliding component. In true sliding-type HUI, one of the walls of the hernia sac is formed by the uterus itself.

- **Patients and methods**: The medical records for all female children with inguinal hernia who were operated on from 1999 through 2010 were reviewed retrospectively (n = 3100).

- **Results**: Among these patients, we identified seven cases of HUI in infants with a normal female karyotype. The incidence of HUI was 0.23%. Patients were discharged on the postoperative first day with no complications.

- **Conclusions**: Surgeons should be aware of the possibility of the presence of the uterus or another organ in the hernial sac in phenotypic female children, and sliding components should be replaced carefully into the abdomen to prevent any damage.

### International guidelines for groin hernia management [^112Recct]. Hernia (2018). High credibility.

For specific circumstances involving inguinal hernia in female patients, the HSG 2018 guidelines recommend considering the division of the round ligament during laparoendoscopic repair, preferably proximal to the point where the genital branch meets the fusion with the peritoneum. Avoid performing division of the round ligament during an open repair.
