## Question

How do MTHFR mutations affect mental health and psychiatric disorders?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how MTHFR mutations affect mental health and psychiatric disorders. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core biochemistry of MTHFR and one‑carbon metabolism to anchor plausibility. Then, I should review downstream neurobiological consequences relevant to psychiatry. Next, I will examine disorder-specific evidence for depression, schizophrenia, autism, and cognitive decline. After that, I should consider gene–environment and medication interactions that modify risk. Then, I will evaluate interventional and guideline implications for testing and treatment. Finally, I need to synthesize evidence quality and limitations before formulating cautious clinical conclusions and practical steps.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical foundation. MTHFR catalyzes the reduction of 5,10‑methylene‑THF to 5‑methyltetrahydrofolate, enabling remethylation of homocysteine to methionine and generation of S‑adenosylmethionine (SAM), the universal methyl donor integral to DNA methylation and monoamine synthesis pathways relevant to psychiatry, and MTHFR missense variation, notably p. Ala222Val, reduces enzyme stability and activity with attendant hyperhomocysteinemia and diminished methylation capacity, plausibly creating a functional folate deficiency even when serum folate appears normal [^115CL2Bs] [^113GYgNf] [^113zJd1J].

> Wait, let me verify the common variants and their functional impact. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism (rs1801133; Ala222Val) is highly prevalent globally and reduces enzyme thermostability and activity, with larger activity loss in TT than CT genotypes, and is consistently linked to higher plasma homocysteine, while A1298C can also contribute to a milder deficit, though its psychiatric penetrance appears less consistent across studies [^115CL2Bs] [^113zJd1J].

> I will now examine downstream mechanisms with psychiatric relevance. Elevated homocysteine is neurotoxic via oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and impaired DNA repair, and reduced SAM constrains methylation-dependent regulation of gene expression and neurotransmitter pathways, thereby plausibly impacting serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine availability and myelination, although I need to be cautious not to over-attribute specific neurotransmitter deficits directly to a single polymorphism without corroborating human data [^113GYgNf] [^11549N1z] [^117TrkZh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about major depressive disorder before checking multiple evidence layers. Association studies suggest C677T relates to vulnerability to depressive episodes in some populations, and meta-analytic data indicate individuals with depression have lower folate levels, while state effects show higher homocysteine and lower B6 during acute episodes, implying both trait and state physiology contribute, and interventional evidence is stronger: a randomized, double‑blind trial in MTHFR‑positive MDD patients found reduced B vitamin therapy lowered homocysteine in most patients and produced clinically meaningful MADRS improvements and remission, supporting a modifiable biochemical pathway in at least a subset of patients [^112oH6iy] [^113XpSkE] [^111AKQhQ] [^117Pjnbx].

> Let me consider schizophrenia next, and I should double-check consistency and effect sizes. Multiple meta‑analyses show elevated homocysteine confers higher schizophrenia risk and that C677T is modestly associated with schizophrenia across genetic models, though with heterogeneity by ancestry and sex, and primary studies in Chinese Han samples replicate higher homocysteine and T‑allele burden in cases; however, I need to emphasize small effect sizes, potential confounding by antipsychotic exposure, and population stratification when interpreting causality [^116WTdDZ] [^111Edp7i] [^116nPtkf] [^114sxaQe] [^115FZoxv].

> Next, I should review autism spectrum disorder data, and I need to check for publication bias. Several meta‑analyses associate C677T with ASD across genetic models, while A1298C findings are inconsistent and can vary by folate fortification context, with stronger signals reported in regions without mandatory fortification; nonetheless, heterogeneity and potential bias are nontrivial, so any inference should be cautious and viewed as susceptibility rather than deterministic risk [^114ww8QJ] [^116ibnLN] [^1144sKMm] [^113JiCBb] [^1111xVTX].

> I will now examine cognitive decline and dementia carefully. Prospective cohort evidence suggests a dose–response relationship between higher homocysteine and incident dementia, whereas the C677T TT genotype showed only a nonsignificant trend in that cohort, and small clinic series report high MTHFR variant prevalence in late‑onset Alzheimer's disease, but those need replication and do not establish causality, keeping with the broader mechanistic plausibility that hyperhomocysteinemia and methylation deficits may accelerate neurodegeneration in susceptible individuals [^113JVzc2] [^113DLosB] [^113GYgNf].

> But wait, what about anxiety and stress‑related disorders. The direct MTHFR–anxiety signal is less consistent, yet shared genetic architectures between depression, anxiety, and functional impairment are substantial, and Mendelian randomization around smoking and affect suggests complex bidirectionality and potential self‑medication effects, so I should avoid over‑specific claims here and frame MTHFR as a potential modifier amid polygenic liability and environmental stressors [^111fznGZ] [^115WgMHt] [^113Esi5j].

> Next, I should review gene–environment and medication modifiers to ensure clinical nuance. Associations vary by folate fortification policies, with stronger genetic signals generally reported in non‑fortified regions, sex‑specific effects have been noted for A1298C in depression cohorts, and antipsychotics may further elevate homocysteine in some patients or interact with one‑carbon metabolism, so diet, geography, sex, and pharmacotherapy meaningfully shape penetrance and phenotype expression [^1111xVTX] [^111tjKnh] [^1163YFDE] [^111AKQhQ].

> I should confirm the treatment and prevention implications and differentiate levels of evidence. For depression, 5‑MTHF and reduced B‑vitamin combinations can improve symptoms and lower homocysteine in MTHFR‑positive patients, and 5‑MTHF may be advantageous over folic acid by bypassing MTHFR; in schizophrenia, small trials suggest folate augmentation effects may depend on MTHFR genotype, though evidence remains preliminary; diagnostically, guidelines recommend assessing homocysteine and methylmalonic acid when B12/folate deficiency is suspected and considering therapeutic B12 trials, and at the population level, perinatal folate reduces neural tube defects and may influence neurodevelopmental outcomes, with some hypotheses that lifelong folate adequacy could matter more in MTHFR carriers [^117Pjnbx] [^11549N1z] [^113LJYmG] [^117XBUaq] [^116X2VPz] [^112Gfisa] [^115QA6Si].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength and limitations of this evidence and not overstate. Many polymorphism–phenotype associations are modest with heterogeneity and potential publication bias, particularly in ASD A1298C analyses, biochemical differences may reflect state effects of acute depression and stress rather than stable traits in some cohorts, and ancestry, fortification policies, and medication exposures can confound findings, so the highest‑credibility anchors here are the randomized MDD trial of reduced B vitamins and established hematology guidelines for evaluating one‑carbon deficiencies, whereas broader causal claims across all psychiatric disorders remain tentative [^113JiCBb] [^1127JRYh] [^111AKQhQ] [^117Pjnbx] [^117XBUaq] [^116X2VPz].

> Let me synthesize a cautious causal pathway and cross‑check it. A plausible chain is MTHFR variants reducing enzyme activity, elevating homocysteine and limiting SAM, thereby perturbing methylation and monoamine synthesis, which in turn increases susceptibility to depressive symptoms and may modulate risk or severity in schizophrenia and ASD, and the observation that methylated B‑vitamin repletion normalizes homocysteine and improves depressive symptoms in MTHFR‑positive patients supports clinical actionability for depression, while schizophrenia and ASD require more definitive trials to establish comparable benefit [^115CL2Bs] [^113GYgNf] [^117Pjnbx].

> Now, I should translate this into a practical clinical approach and double‑check alignment with guidelines. In patients with treatment‑resistant depression or strong family history, especially with macrocytosis, neuropathy, cognitive symptoms, or dietary risk, check B12, folate, and consider homocysteine and MMA per BSH guidance, treat any cobalamin or folate deficiency, and consider a monitored trial of 5‑MTHF or reduced B‑vitamins in MTHFR‑positive or hyperhomocysteinemic patients, while reserving broad MTHFR genotyping for cases where it would change management and counseling, and in psychosis or ASD, consider folate status optimization with acknowledgment that evidence for symptom modification remains preliminary and genotype‑dependent [^112Gfisa] [^117XBUaq] [^116X2VPz] [^11549N1z] [^113LJYmG].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also flag evidence gaps and future directions. Larger RCTs in schizophrenia and ASD, clarification of A1298C effects and COMT interactions, long‑term cognitive outcomes in carriers, and genotype‑guided dosing strategies are needed, and given polygenicity and environmental moderators, MTHFR should be framed as one contributor within a broader risk architecture rather than a solitary determinant of psychiatric disease [^111tjKnh] [^116WTdDZ] [^114ww8QJ] [^113JVzc2].

---

MTHFR mutations, especially C677T, are linked to **elevated homocysteine** and **reduced methylation**, potentially impairing neurotransmitter synthesis [^11549N1z] and brain function [^115CL2Bs]. These biochemical changes are associated with an **increased risk** of depression [^112oH6iy], schizophrenia [^111Edp7i], and autism spectrum disorders [^114ww8QJ] and may contribute to cognitive impairment and dementia [^113JVzc2]. Clinical evidence supports the adjunctive use of L-methylfolate [^11549N1z] or reduced B vitamins [^117Pjnbx] to lower homocysteine and improve depressive symptoms [^1125i56x], particularly among MTHFR variant carriers. Routine MTHFR testing is **not recommended**; targeted supplementation may benefit selected patients with psychiatric disorders and confirmed MTHFR variants.

---

## Biochemical mechanisms linking MTHFR mutations to psychiatric disorders

MTHFR catalyzes the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which is essential for remethylation of homocysteine to methionine [^113GYgNf] and for SAM-dependent methylation reactions. The C677T variant **reduces enzyme activity** [^115CL2Bs], elevates homocysteine [^111Edp7i], and impairs methylation [^113GYgNf], thereby affecting neurotransmitter synthesis [^11549N1z] and brain function.

---

## Associations with specific psychiatric disorders

### Depression

The C677T variant is **associated with an increased risk** of depressive episodes [^112oH6iy] and higher homocysteine levels. Elevated homocysteine and reduced methylation may impair serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine synthesis, contributing to depression [^11549N1z].

---

### Schizophrenia

The C677T variant has been **linked to schizophrenia** [^111Edp7i], and elevated homocysteine is observed in patients [^115ptPF5]. Hyperhomocysteinemia may cause oxidative stress, DNA damage, and neuronal apoptosis, thereby contributing to schizophrenia pathophysiology [^113GYgNf] [^115n1Sk5].

---

### Autism spectrum disorders (ASD)

The C677T variant is associated with an **increased ASD risk** [^114ww8QJ], whereas A1298C shows no significant association [^116WHjWt]. Impaired methylation and elevated homocysteine may disrupt neurodevelopmental processes, increasing ASD susceptibility [^117TrkZh].

---

### Cognitive impairment and dementia

Elevated homocysteine and the C677T variant are associated with an **increased risk** of cognitive impairment and dementia. Hyperhomocysteinemia may cause neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and impaired methylation, contributing to cognitive decline [^113GYgNf].

---

## Clinical implications and treatment considerations

### Nutritional supplementation

Supplementation with **L-methylfolate** or reduced B vitamins can lower homocysteine and improve depressive symptoms, particularly among MTHFR variant carriers [^11549N1z] [^117Pjnbx]. Folic acid may also reduce depressive symptoms, but L-methylfolate may be **more effective** in individuals with MTHFR mutations [^11549N1z] [^1125i56x].

---

### Pharmacogenomic testing

Routine MTHFR testing is **not recommended** [^11317uT3]; however, targeted testing may guide supplementation strategies in selected patients.

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **Inconsistency**: Associations between MTHFR mutations and psychiatric disorders are inconsistent across populations and studies [^111Edp7i].
- **Complexity**: Psychiatric disorders are multifactorial, involving genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors [^1159VpEK].
- **Testing**: Routine MTHFR testing is not recommended due to limited clinical utility.

MTHFR mutations, particularly C677T, are associated with psychiatric disorders via elevated homocysteine and impaired methylation. Nutritional supplementation with L-methylfolate or reduced B vitamins may benefit individuals with these mutations [^117Pjnbx], but **routine testing is not recommended** given inconsistent evidence [^113zJd1J] [^111Edp7i].

### Meta-analyses of blood homocysteine levels for gender and genetic association studies of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism in schizophrenia [^111Edp7i]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Blood homocysteine levels are influenced by genetic variations. Among these variants, one common functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, C677T (rs1801133), has been well-investigated. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism results in an amino acid substitution (Ala222Val), causing reduced enzyme activity and higher homocysteine levels. The results of previous association studies between blood homocysteine levels and schizophrenia, stratified by C677T genotypes, are inconclusive. A significant diagnostic difference in blood homocysteine levels has been found in subjects carrying the CT genotype or the TT genotype. However, Feng et al. showed a significant diagnostic difference for both CT and TT genotype carriers.

Numerous genetic case-control association studies between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and schizophrenia have been conducted across various populations, with inconsistent results. Only one study within the Japanese population reported a significant association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and schizophrenia, while three other Japanese population studies have not replicated this positive finding. However, several meta-analyses of association studies have revealed a significant association between this SNP and schizophrenia.

In this study, we first investigated whether plasma total homocysteine levels were higher in patients with schizophrenia than in non-psychiatric controls, stratified by gender and the MTHFR C677T genotype.

### Correlation of clinical response with homocysteine reduction during therapy with reduced B vitamins in patients with MDD who are positive for MTHFR C677T or A1298C polymorphism: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^117Pjnbx]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of reduced B vitamins as monotherapy in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) who were also positive for at least one methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphism associated with depression, and further test the hypothesis that reduced (metabolized) B vitamins will lower homocysteine in a majority of clinically responding patients.

Methods included enrolling 330 adult patients with MDD (DSM-5) positive for either MTHFR C677T or A1298C polymorphism in a trial conducted between August 1, 2014, and April 3, 2015. One hundred sixty patients received placebo, while 170 received a capsule containing a combination of reduced B vitamins. Plasma homocysteine levels were measured at baseline and week 8. The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to evaluate efficacy for MDD.

Results showed that 159 of 170 vitamin-treated patients and 123 of 160 placebo-treated patients completed the study. Of the active treatment group, 131 (82.4%) showed a reduction in homocysteine (with a mean reduction in this subgroup of 25%, P < .001), while 28 (17.6%) showed no significant change. Placebo patients demonstrated a small elevation in homocysteine. Active treatment patients demonstrated, on average, a 12-point reduction on the MADRS by week 8, and 42% achieved full remission (P < .001). No side effect was significantly different between groups, and no patients experienced mania.

In conclusion, a combination of reduced B vitamins and micronutrients, when used in the treatment of MDD in patients with MTHFR polymorphism, resulted in a significant improvement in clinical outcomes.

### Association between MTHFR C677T/A1298C and susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders: a meta-analysis [^114ww8QJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Upon literature search and critical screening, about 15 studies from 125 articles were included in this meta-analysis, as already discussed in the Methods section. A total of 2,609 cases and 7,496 controls were enrolled from the 15 articles published on the correlation between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and ASD susceptibility. Of those, only nine articles, which included 1,961 cases and 1,652 controls, qualified for the evaluation of the link between MTHFR A1298C and ASD as per the selection criteria.

- **Association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and ASD**: A random effect model (P h 50%) was used, and MTHFR C677T polymorphism was found to be remarkably linked to ASD susceptibility in allelic (T vs. C: OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.30–2.05, p < 0.05), heterozygote (CT vs. CC: OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.31–2.11, p < 0.05), homozygote (TT vs. CC: OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.33–3.09, p < 0.05), dominant (TT + CT vs. CC: OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.39–2.37, p < 0.05), and recessive models (TT vs. CT + CC: OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.14–2.22, p < 0.05; Table 3, Fig. 2a).

### The MTHFR C677T polymorphism is associated with depressive episodes in patients from Northern Ireland [^112oH6iy]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2004). Low credibility.

Low plasma folate and its derivatives have been linked with depressive disorders in studies dating back over 30 years. A thermolabile variant (677C > T) of the enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is associated with low serum folate. The present study aimed to explore whether the thermolabile variant of MTHFR is associated with a vulnerability to depressive episodes.

MTHFR C677T genotype frequencies in a cohort of patients (mean age 48 years) with depressive disorder (n = 100) were compared with those in age- and sex-matched controls. Serum levels of folate, homocysteine, and vitamin B(12) were also compared between groups. The thermolabile variant of MTHFR was significantly more common in the group with a history of depressive disorder (P = 0.03). Serum levels of folate, homocysteine, and vitamin B(12) did not differ significantly between groups. An MTHFR C677T genotype is associated with an increased risk of depressive episodes in this homogeneous patient population.

### Plasma homocysteine and MTHFR C677T polymorphism as risk factors for incident dementia [^113JVzc2]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Elevated total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) has been associated with an increased risk of dementia. The C677T polymorphism of the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) increases tHcy and provides a means of studying the association between tHcy and dementia while not being as susceptible to the common biases and confounding of observational studies. The authors designed this longitudinal study to determine if high tHcy and the MTHFR C677T polymorphism increase the risk of incident dementia among older men.

- **Methods**: The authors studied 4,227 men aged 70–89 years from the Health in Men Study cohort and established the diagnosis of dementia (International Classification of Diseases-10th edition) using morbidity and mortality records. Information on tHcy, MTHFR gene status, lifestyle, and clinical variables were obtained using postal and face-to-face assessments.

- **Results**: 230 men (5.4%) developed dementia during the mean follow-up period of 5.8 ± 1.6 years (range 0.1–8.2 years). The hazard of dementia increased with a doubling of tHcy concentration (adjusted HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.00) and was higher in men with tHcy > 15 μmol/l (adjusted HR 1.36 95% CI 1.03 to 1.81, p = 0.032). Men with the TT genotype had a HR of dementia of 1.25 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.92).

- **Conclusions**: The results of this prospective study are consistent with a causal link between high tHcy and incident dementia, but the study lacked power to determine an effect of the MTHFR genotype.

### Folate in depression: Efficacy, safety, differences in formulations, and clinical issues [^11549N1z]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Supplementation with folate may help reduce depressive symptoms. Folate, a naturally occurring B vitamin, is needed in the brain for the synthesis of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. Three forms of folate are commonly used: folic acid, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) (also known as methylfolate and L-methylfolate), and folinic acid. Some forms may be more bioavailable than others in patients with a genetic polymorphism and in those who take particular medications or use alcohol. Folic acid augmentation in depressed patients may reduce residual symptoms. The 5-MTHF formulation indicated efficacy as adjunctive therapy or monotherapy in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with normal and low folate levels, improving cognitive function and reducing depressive symptoms in elderly patients with dementia and folate deficiency, and reducing depressive and somatic symptoms in patients with depression and alcoholism. Adjunctive folinic acid reduced depressive symptoms in patients who were partially responsive or nonresponsive to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Evidence for the efficacy of folate in improving cognitive symptoms is equivocal, but most studies used folic acid. Although the studies reviewed have limitations and, historically, concerns have been raised about the role of folate in increasing cancer risk, masking B(12) deficiency, and worsening depressive symptoms, folate is generally well tolerated, and 5-MTHF may be less likely to incur some of these risks. Several forms of folate appear to be safe and efficacious in some individuals with major depression.

### The one-carbon-cycle and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism in recurrent major depressive disorder; influence of antidepressant use and depressive state [^111AKQhQ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

An important biological factor suggested in the pathophysiology of recurrent Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) involves a polymorphism in a gene encoding for the MTHFR enzyme of the one-carbon (1-C) metabolism. Investigating key 1-C components, such as folate, homocysteine, vitamins B6 and B12, including the possible effects of antidepressant medication and depressive state, could provide more insight into the possible association between the MTHFR polymorphism and recurrent MDD.

- **Methods**: We compared the MTHFR C677T polymorphism along with key 1-C components in clinically ascertained patients with recurrent MDD (n = 137) to age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 73).

- **Results**:
	- First, patients had lower folate (t = 2.25; p = .025) compared to controls; a difference that resolved after correction for demographics (t = 1.22; p = .223).
	- Second, patients depressed during sampling had lower vitamin B6 (t = -2.070; p = .038) and higher homocysteine (t = 2.404; p = .016) compared to those in remission.
	- Finally, use of antidepressants had no influence on the 1-C components.

- **Conclusions**: Despite investigating a specific recurrently depressed patient population, we found no clear associations with the 1-C cycle, except for higher homocysteine and lower vitamin B6 during the depressed state. This suggests that 1-C cycle alterations in MDD are state-associated, possibly resulting from high levels of acute psychological stress, and may provide a treatment target to reduce cardiovascular risk in this population.

### The association of folate and depression: A meta-analysis [^113XpSkE]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2017). Low credibility.

Previous research suggested that folate levels play an important role in the etiology and course of depression. However, the literature has been inconsistent with regard to differences in folate levels between individuals with and without depression. The present meta-analysis synthesized the results of previous studies to examine whether individuals with depression had lower levels of folate than individuals without depression.

- **Methods**: Meta-analytic procedures were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Studies evaluating folate levels in individuals with and without depression via red blood cell folate, serum folate, or dietary intake of folate methods were identified via PsycINFO and PubMed. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted using Hedge's g, and moderation analysis was used for both folate measurement method and population type. Study heterogeneity was assessed with I², and publication bias was qualitatively assessed via a funnel plot and quantitatively assessed with the trim-and-fill method and Begg's adjusted rank test.

- **Results**: We found a significant, small effect size, such that individuals with depression had lower folate levels than those without depression, Hedge's g = -0.24 (95% CI = -0.31, -0.16), p < 0.001. Study heterogeneity was high (I² = 84.88%), and neither folate measurement method nor population accounted for study heterogeneity.

- **Conclusions**: Individuals with depression have lower serum levels of folate and dietary folate intake than individuals without depression. Given that previous literature suggested folate supplementation could be beneficial, further research into this intervention is warranted.

### Mthfr: Addressing genetic counseling dilemmas using evidence-based literature [^113zJd1J]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2016). Low credibility.

The 5, 10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) enzyme is a catalyst in the folate metabolism pathway, the byproducts of which are involved in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Methionine is a precursor for a major DNA methyl donor and is important for DNA methylation and gene regulation. Rare mutations in the MTHFR gene have been associated with autosomal recessive MTHFR deficiency, leading to homocystinuria. Additionally, two polymorphic variants in this gene (C677T and A1298C) have been implicated in a mild form of MTHFR deficiency associated with hyperhomocysteinemia.

Mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia has been previously implicated as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, the presence of these variants, with and without mildly elevated levels of homocysteine, has been studied in relation to several multifactorial disorders. These include pregnancy loss, neural tube defects and congenital anomalies, cancer, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Given this wide spectrum of purported clinical implications and the prevalence of these polymorphisms, genetic counselors may encounter questions regarding the significance of MTHFR polymorphisms in a variety of settings.

Here we present a brief background of the MTHFR polymorphisms, a review of the literature regarding clinical considerations, and a discussion of relevant genetic counseling aspects through case vignettes. Educational resources for patients and providers are also included.

### Has prenatal folate supplementation established an at-risk population for age-related cognitive decline [^115QA6Si]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Nutrition exerts a pervasive impact on both normal and pathological conditions of the nervous system throughout life. Maternal folate supplementation during pregnancy has been shown to reduce developmental disorders of the nervous system. However, it may have also increased the number of individuals with genetic polymorphisms that compromise folate utilization. These individuals may require additional dietary folate throughout their lives, a requirement often unmet beyond peri/postnatal periods. An increased prevalence of such polymorphisms has been detected in individuals with autism. Prenatal nutritional supplementation may have inadvertently established latent conditions that, without continued supplementation, could lead to age-related cognitive decline.

### Genetic overlap between functional impairment and depression and anxiety symptom severity: Evidence from the GLAD study [^111fznGZ]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Functional impairment in daily activities, such as work and socializing, is part of the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder and most anxiety disorders. Despite evidence that symptom severity and functional impairment are partially distinct, functional impairment is often overlooked. To assess whether functional impairment captures diagnostically relevant genetic liability beyond that of symptoms, we aimed to estimate the heritability of, and genetic correlations between, key measures of depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and functional impairment.

- **Methods**: In 17,130 individuals with lifetime depression or anxiety from the Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study, we analyzed total scores from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (depression symptoms), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (anxiety symptoms), and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (functional impairment). Genome-wide association analyses were performed with REGENIE. Heritability was estimated using GCTA-GREML and genetic correlations with bivariate-GREML.

- **Results**: The phenotypic correlations were moderate across the three measures (Pearson's r = 0.50–0.69). All three scales were found to be under low but significant genetic influence (single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability [h²_SNP] = 0.11–0.19) with high genetic correlations between them (r_g = 0.79–0.87).

- **Conclusions**: Among individuals with lifetime depression or anxiety from the GLAD Study, the genetic variants that underlie symptom severity largely overlap with those influencing functional impairment.

### Genetics of anxiety disorders: The complex road from DSM to DNA [^113Esi5j]. Depression and Anxiety (2009). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders, affecting one in four individuals over a lifetime. Although our understanding of the etiology of these disorders is incomplete, familial and genetic factors are established risk factors. However, identifying the specific causal genes has been difficult. In the past several years, advances in molecular and statistical genetic methods have made the genetic dissection of complex disorders a feasible project.

Here we provide an overview of these developments, with a focus on their implications for genetic studies of anxiety disorders. Although the genetic and phenotypic complexity of anxiety disorders present formidable challenges, advances in neuroimaging and experimental animal models of anxiety and fear offer important opportunities for discovery. Real progress in identifying the genetic basis of anxiety disorders will require integrative approaches that make use of these biological tools as well as larger-scale genomic studies. If successful, such efforts may yield novel and more effective approaches for the prevention and treatment of these common and costly disorders.

### Pharmacogenomic testing and depressive symptom remission: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective, controlled clinical trials [^112KiH7f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). High credibility.

- **Risk of bias**: The risk of bias assessments for the 10 RCTs and three open-label trials are summarized in the study. Among the RCTs, selection and attrition biases were judged to be low. However, performance bias was found to be high for all RCTs, as participants were blinded to the results, but the physicians were not. Additionally, two RCTs did not blind raters of the primary outcome, leading to a high risk of detection bias. A high risk of reporting bias was noted for the Bradley et al. trial given that remission status was reported only for a subset (n = 93) of participants with moderate to severe depressive symptoms (HDRS ≥ 25). Furthermore, with the exception of the Shan et al. and Oslin et al. trials, all studies were industry-sponsored, an attribute often linked to more favorable outcomes in drug and device studies.

- **Open-label trials**: For the three open-label trials, pre-intervention selection, at-intervention information, and post-intervention confounding biases were judged to be low. However, post-intervention information and industry biases were judged as high for two out of three trials. A moderate risk of post-intervention reporting bias was noted for the Hall-Flavin et al. 2012 trial, whereas pre-intervention confounding and post-intervention selection biases were judged as moderate for the Hall-Flavin et al. 2013 trial.

### MTHFR: Genetic variants, expression analysis and COMT interaction in major depressive disorder [^111tjKnh]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genetic variations have been widely studied in major depressive disorder (MDD) and antidepressant outcomes. An interaction with catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) has also been shown to affect depression. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of the most commonly studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the MTHFR gene in MDD and in treatment response mechanisms, along with the impact of the interaction with COMT.

- **Methods**: A total of 613 MDD patients, of whom 389 were classified as having treatment-resistant depression (TRD), and 463 controls were enrolled. The A1298C, C677T, and COMT Val158Met were genotyped. Genetic data were integrated with a transcriptional level analysis in peripheral blood cells (PBCs) and fibroblasts.

- **Results**: The A1298C CC homozygotes were more frequent in MDD patients compared to controls in women, increasing the genetic risk of developing depression twofold. Moreover, this genotype resulted in epistasis with COMT Met carriers in association with MDD. No significant effects were obtained concerning response to treatment. Transcriptional analyses highlighted a strong correlation between the mRNA levels of MTHFR in fibroblasts and COMT genotypes, whereas no significant association with MDD was found. PBC results revealed relevant influences of environmental factors.

- **Limitation**: We did not measure folate and homocysteine levels.

- **Conclusion**: This study showed the involvement of A1298C, Val158Met, and their interaction in MDD. The transcriptional analyses supported the participation of COMT in these processes.

### Meta-analyses of blood homocysteine levels for gender and genetic association studies of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism in schizophrenia [^111bu8nd]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

Subjects of the association study between the plasma total homocysteine levels and schizophrenia consisted of 381 patients with schizophrenia (225 men, mean age: 58.2 ± 9.3 years; 156 women, mean age: 59.4 ± 9.7 years). These patients were recruited from Tokushima University Hospital in Japan. The diagnosis of schizophrenia was made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV criteria by at least two expert psychiatrists, based on extensive clinical interviews and a review of medical records. None of the patients had any psychiatric comorbidity or cardiovascular diseases. All patients were treated with various antipsychotic drugs, with a mean chlorpromazine equivalent dose of 689.6 ± 581.3 mg/day.

In the control group, 998 subjects were included (331 men, mean age: 38.3 ± 12 years; 667 women, mean age: 43.0 ± 11.9 years). Control participants were selected from volunteers recruited among hospital staff, students, and company employees documented to be free from psychiatric problems and past histories of mental illness. All subjects in this study were of Japanese origin and provided written informed consent approved by the institutional ethics committees of the University of Tokushima Graduate School. Of the 1,379 subjects used in this association study, 1,357 with genomic DNA (377 patients and 980 controls) were used in the subsequent genetic association study.

### Genetics of smoking and depression [^117TL1f7]. Human Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Smoking and depression are significant public health problems with multiple etiological dimensions and outcomes. Although each condition is important by itself, they are also pivotal because they often potentiate each other. Consequently, understanding the nature of their relationship is essential. This representative review focuses on the genetic etiology of their relationship by first examining the epidemiology of depression and smoking. It then explores behavioral and molecular genetic studies, as well as other psychiatric and medical comorbidities.

At this point, epidemiological evidence for a relationship between depression and smoking/nicotine dependence is compelling. Although behavioral genetic results differ somewhat by gender and in accordance with specific definitions of depression and smoking variables, recent studies show converging evidence for common genetic factors underlying the relationship, often in addition to non-shared environmental factors. The search for underlying genes and genetic mechanisms is at an early stage, but it shows promising candidate genes and genetic approaches for future studies.

### Perinatal folate-related exposures and risk of psychotic symptoms in the ALSPAC birth cohort [^117E5upj]. Schizophrenia Research (2010). Low credibility.

MTHFR C677T variation has been related to a wide spectrum of phenotypes, including neural tube disorders (NTD) and cognition. Evidence from recent meta-analyses on schizophrenia suggests that MTHFR 677T, in particular the TT genotype, confers susceptibility to psychosis, although there appears to be considerable study heterogeneity (Allelic odds ratio (OR): I² = 52% to 57%).

Within the developing child, the internal folate status is also influenced by nutritional exposures, particularly in utero and during early postnatal development. A deficiency of dietary folate has been associated with impaired DNA methylation. Low internal folate status has been suggested as a risk factor for cognitive impairment and appears to contribute to the etiology of neural tube disorders (NTD). The latter is of particular interest as NTD and schizophrenia may share underlying risk factors, strengthening positions that implicate folate status within the etiology of psychosis.

Our study aimed to investigate relationships between non-clinical psychotic symptoms in adolescence and key determinants of fetal folate status. These include maternal folate supplementation and dietary folate intake during pregnancy, as well as maternal and child MTHFR C677T genotypes.

### Global and population-specific association of MTHFR polymorphisms with preterm birth risk: a consolidated analysis of 44 studies [^116x4nXC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene is essential for folate metabolism, which is critical for DNA synthesis, repair, and neurotransmitter production. This gene's role becomes particularly significant during pregnancy, as adequate folate levels are vital for fetal development and maternal health, especially concerning hyperhomocysteinemia. Variants in the MTHFR gene can impair enzymatic function, leading to altered folate levels and potential adverse outcomes, such as preterm birth (PTB), preeclampsia, and pregnancy loss. Common polymorphisms, notably C677T and A1298C, have been extensively studied, with the C677T variant being particularly impactful on enzymatic activity. Individuals with the TT genotype typically exhibit reduced enzyme activity, resulting in elevated homocysteine and decreased folate levels.

However, research on the association between MTHFR polymorphisms and PTB has produced mixed results. While some studies suggest a significant correlation between the MTHFR C677T variant and increased PTB risk, others report inconsistent outcomes, often due to small sample sizes and diverse populations. These inconsistencies can arise from variations in study design, population genetics, environmental factors, and gene-environment interactions. Methodological differences, such as demographic variations and sample sizes, can produce divergent findings, especially among ethnic groups; for instance, the A1298C polymorphism is significantly linked to PTB risk in Asian populations but not elsewhere. The prevalence of MTHFR variants varies between populations.

### Association between MTHFR C677T/A1298C and susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders: A meta-analysis [^116ibnLN]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Relevant literature published prior to January 26, 2020, was selected to examine the correlation between MTHFR polymorphism (C677T and A1298C) and ASD risk in this meta-analysis. The findings of this study indicate that while the MTHFR C677T polymorphism is a susceptibility factor for ASD, the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is not linked with ASD susceptibility.

Several meta-analytic studies on the correlation between the C677T polymorphism of MTHFR and ASD risk have been conducted. Frustaci et al. studied six articles, which included 877 cases and 939 controls, mainly Caucasians, and found a significant correlation between the C677T polymorphism of MTHFR and ASD risk. Pu et al. investigated eight articles involving 1672 cases and 6760 controls, also mainly Caucasians, and evidenced a significant risk associated with the T allele mutation of MTHFR C677T in ASD. Rai et al. analyzed 1978 cases and 7257 controls (Caucasians: 1355 cases and 6460 controls; Asians: 623 cases and 797 controls) across 13 studies and concluded that the C677T polymorphism of MTHFR is a risk factor for ASD susceptibility as well. Similarly, the meta-analysis enrolled 2609 cases and 7496 controls (Caucasians: 1786 cases and 6499 controls; Asians: 823 cases and 997 controls) from 15 selected studies, which further confirmed the association between the C677T polymorphism of MTHFR and ASD susceptibility.

A previous meta-analysis on the correlation between the A1298C polymorphism of MTHFR and ASD risk included five studies with 1470 cases and 1060 controls (Caucasians: 1332 cases and 922 controls).

### Homocysteine metabolism and various consequences of folate deficiency [^113GYgNf]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Homocysteine is a neurotoxic, non-proteinogenic amino acid, an abnormal increase of which in plasma has been implicated in many pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and neural tube defects, and is now recognized in relation to Alzheimer's disease. Homocysteine elimination is regulated by the transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways and is modulated by folate, a member of the B-vitamin family. A metabolic product of folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, provides a methyl group that is used to reconvert homocysteine back to methionine through the transmethylation pathway.

The efficiency of folate metabolism impacts the availability of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a compound known to activate homocysteine flux through the transsulfuration pathway. SAM is also necessary for the utilization of the antioxidant glutathione via glutathione S-transferase. This review will elaborate on different biochemical reactions implicated in regulating homocysteine elimination through the transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways, as well as various consequences of folate deficiency on homocysteine metabolism.

### Association between MTHFR C677T/A1298C and susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders: a meta-analysis [^113JiCBb]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

The stability of the findings was evaluated through a sensitivity analysis conducted by sequentially omitting each study, demonstrating that this meta-analysis is relatively stable and credible. To evaluate publication bias, Begg's funnel plot and Egger's tests were carried out. No significant publication bias was detected in the correlation between MTHFR C677T polymorphisms and ASD risk in the five genetic models: allelic (P B = 0.029, P E = 0.017), heterozygote (P B = 0.017, P E = 0.008), homozygote (P B = 0.048, P E = 0.053), dominant (P B = 0.021, P E = 0.010), and recessive (P B = 0.033, P E = 0.053). However, publication bias was detected among the studies on the correlation between MTHFR A1298C polymorphisms and ASD risk in the following genetic models: allelic (P B = 0.210, P E = 0.010), heterozygote (P B = 0.001, P E = 0.049), homozygote (P B = 0.025, P E = 0.152), dominant (P B = 0.000, P E = 0.049), and recessive models (P B = 0.081, P E = 0.152).

### Meta-analyses of blood homocysteine levels for gender and genetic association studies of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism in schizophrenia [^116WTdDZ]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric disorder with a median lifetime prevalence rate of 0.7%–0.8%. Accumulating evidence has shown that alterations in one-carbon metabolism might play an important role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. A number of studies have been conducted to evaluate the association between blood homocysteine levels and schizophrenia. The majority of these studies have demonstrated elevated blood homocysteine levels in patients with schizophrenia compared with controls. However, several studies have reported no significant diagnostic differences in the blood homocysteine levels between the two groups.

At the time of writing, one study examined an association between blood homocysteine levels and schizophrenia by conducting a meta-analysis of eight case-control studies (a total of 812 cases with schizophrenia and 2113 control subjects) and demonstrated that a 5 μmol/L increase in homocysteine concentration was associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia (OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.27–2.29). However, this meta-analysis was performed without consideration of the effect of gender. Higher blood homocysteine levels in men than in women have been reported, and the results of the previous association studies between blood homocysteine levels and schizophrenia with stratification by gender are inconclusive. In some studies, elevated blood homocysteine levels were observed in only male patients with schizophrenia and not in female patients, whereas other studies have demonstrated that both male and female patients with schizophrenia had increased blood homocysteine levels.

### Association between MTHFR C677T/A1298C and susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders: a meta-analysis [^1144sKMm]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

To conclude, this meta-analysis confirms that the C677T polymorphism of MTHFR is remarkably linked with ASD risk. Nevertheless, the findings agree that the A1298C polymorphism of MTHFR is not significantly correlated with ASD. Exploring gene-gene and gene-environment interactions could provide more insight into the genetic link between MTHFR variants and ASD risk.

### Meta-analyses of blood homocysteine levels for gender and genetic association studies of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism in schizophrenia [^116nPtkf]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

The meta-analysis involved six association studies on Japanese subjects, including the two data sets from this study. Genotypic distributions and allelic frequencies of rs1801133 in each study were analyzed. The diagnosis of schizophrenia was determined according to DSM-IV criteria in five studies and DSM-III criteria in one study. A total of 4,316 cases and 6,062 controls were included.

The genotypic distribution of this SNP did not deviate significantly from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in any control group across the six studies (P > .05). Significant heterogeneity was not detected at this SNP among the studies for the five genetic models (P > .05). Funnel plot analysis indicated no evidence of publication bias across all genetic models (P > .05).

- **Results**: The odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) analyzed by the fixed-effects model for all genetic models indicate significant associations in four out of five models. The highest OR was observed in the codominant model (CC vs. TT genotypes; OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.03–1.31, P = 1.4 × 10^-2, in the fixed-effects model).

The detailed results of OR and 95% CI for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T are found in Table 1. Further visual representation is provided in Figure 3.

### Cardiovascular disease, genetic susceptibility, and risk of psychiatric disorders and suicide attempt: A community-based matched cohort study based on the UK Biobank [^1125uBvh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Psychiatric disorders involve various degrees of impairment in cognition, emotion, behavior, and other mental activities due to disturbances in brain function. These disorders mainly include anxiety, depression, stress-related disorders, substance misuse, and psychotic disorders. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders is increasing worldwide, with a noted increase of 25.6% in anxiety and 27.6% in depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This rise has resulted in a substantial disease burden and social influence, attracting growing research interest.

Moreover, studies indicate that individuals with psychiatric disorders might experience a series of physiological alterations, leading to risks of developing major somatic diseases such as autoimmune disease, infection, neurodegenerative disease, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Similarly, suicide behavior, including intentional self-harm or life-threatening attempts, represents a major public health issue, resulting in approximately 1 million suicide-related deaths worldwide per year. Therefore, enhancing medical and disease care for individuals diagnosed with psychiatric disorders and those who attempt suicide, alongside early identification and timely prevention for at-risk populations, is crucial.

### Association between depressive symptoms and serum concentrations of homocysteine in men: A population study [^1138tNbp]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Results of studies on the association between blood concentrations of homocysteine and depression in general populations and among psychiatric patients are inconsistent.

- **Objective**: The objective was to study the association between depression and serum concentrations of total homocysteine (tHcy).

- **Design**: A cross-sectional study of a sample of 924 men aged 46–64 years was conducted as part of the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study. Those with a history of psychiatric disorders (6.0%) were excluded. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the 18-item Human Population Laboratory Depression Scale. Those who scored greater than or equal to five at baseline or at the four-year follow-up were considered to have a tendency toward depression.

- **Results**: The participants were ranked according to their blood tHcy concentration and divided into tertiles. Those in the upper tertile for serum tHcy had a more than twofold (odds ratio: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.35, 3.90; P = 0.002) higher risk of being depressed than those in the lowest tertile for serum tHcy. The results remained significant after adjustment for the month of study, history of ischemic heart disease, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, marital status, education, and socioeconomic status in adulthood (odds ratio: 2.23; 95% CI: 1.30, 3.83; P = 0.004).

- **Conclusion**: High serum concentrations of tHcy may be associated with depression in middle-aged men.

### Association between MTHFR C677T/A1298C and susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders: a meta-analysis [^116WHjWt]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is becoming increasingly prevalent. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) has a significant role in folate metabolism. Due to inconsistencies and inconclusiveness regarding the association between MTHFR single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and ASD susceptibilities, a meta-analysis was conducted to address these inconsistencies.

- **Methods**: For this meta-analysis, a total of 15 manuscripts published up to January 26, 2020, were selected from PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline, WangFang, and CNKI databases using search terms "MTHFR" OR "methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase" AND "ASD" OR "Autism Spectrum Disorders" OR "Autism" AND "polymorphism" OR "susceptibility" OR "C677T" OR "A1298C".

- **Results**: The findings of the meta-analysis indicated that MTHFR C677T polymorphism is remarkably associated with ASD in five genetic models: allelic, dominant, recessive, heterozygote, and homozygote. However, the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism was not found to be significantly related to ASD in these models. Subgroup analyses revealed significant associations of ASD with the MTHFR (C677T and A1298C) polymorphism. Sensitivity analysis showed that this meta-analysis was stable and reliable. No publication bias was identified in the associations between MTHFR C677T polymorphisms and ASD in these genetic models, except regarding the associations between MTHFR A1298C polymorphisms and ASD.

- **Conclusion**: This meta-analysis showed that MTHFR C677T polymorphism is a susceptibility factor for ASD.

### MTHFR gene mutations: A potential marker of late-onset Alzheimer's disease [^113DLosB]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Recent epigenome-wide association studies have confirmed the importance of epigenetic effects mediated by DNA methylation in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Metabolic folate pathways and methyl donor reactions facilitated by B-group vitamins may be critical in the pathogenesis of LOAD. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations were studied in consecutive Alzheimer's Disease & Memory Clinic patients up to December 2014. DNA analyses of MTHFR-C667T and A1298C homozygous and heterozygous polymorphisms in 93 consecutive elderly patients revealed a high prevalence of MTHFR mutations (92.5%). These findings require confirmation in a larger series, but MTHFR mutations may become a LOAD marker, opening novel possibilities for prevention and treatment.

### Meta-analyses of blood homocysteine levels for gender and genetic association studies of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism in schizophrenia [^11497X5t]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis explores the association between blood homocysteine levels and the MTHFR C677T polymorphism in individuals with schizophrenia. Specifically, it examines gender differences and the genetic associations related to this polymorphism. This research aims to clarify whether there is a significant correlation that can contribute to understanding the complex genetic and biochemical underpinnings of schizophrenia. By analyzing existing data from various studies, the paper attempts to provide comprehensive insights and potential implications for future research in psychiatric genetics.

### Using Mendelian randomisation to infer causality in depression and anxiety research [^115WgMHt]. Depression and Anxiety (2013). Low credibility.

Bjorngaard and Gunnell used the same variant to investigate symptoms of depression and anxiety and their relationship to cigarette smoking in a large Norwegian cohort. In a sample of 53,601 people, they found self-reported smoking to be associated with depression and anxiety, assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale in a questionnaire. A threshold of ≥ 8 was applied to identify likely clinical case status. The rs1051730 variant was associated with being a smoker, and within smokers, the number of cigarettes smoked. They hypothesized that if smoking was causally related to anxiety or depression, an association with the genetic variant would only be seen in smokers. However, their results showed no association between the genetic variant and depression in smokers and a modest association with anxiety only in former and never smokers, which is the opposite pattern than would be expected if smoking was causally related to anxiety. Their results, like those of Lewis and colleagues, therefore appear to be more consistent with a self-medication hypothesis. If genetic variants are found that are associated with anxiety and depression, Mendelian randomization (MR) on allelic risk scores could be used here to ascertain whether the association between tobacco and depression is indeed due to self-medication.

Bidirectional MR is possible when genetic instruments are available for both the hypothesized exposure and outcome and are helpful where the direction of causation is unknown. If these instruments are independent, then simultaneous MR can be carried out using each of them.

### Association between MTHFR C677T/A1298C and susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders: A meta-analysis [^1127JRYh]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

There are several limitations to this study. First, the subgroup analyses of environmental risk factors, sex, and gene-environment interactions were not performed due to insufficient information. Second, this meta-analysis was mainly focused on Caucasians and Asians, limiting the generalization of the findings to other ethnicities. Third, in agreement with the findings of Frustaci et al, Pu et al, and Rai et al, heterogeneity exists in this exploration. Fourth, publication bias was found in the association between MTHFR A1298C polymorphisms and ASD risk.

### Folic acid supplementation for prevention of mood disorders in young people at familial risk: A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial [^113iGLkQ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical mood disorders often manifest in the later teenage years and early twenties, and they can be associated with a poor long-term prognosis. The primary prevention of these disorders would therefore hold significant public health value. Nutritional supplements are a feasible intervention for primary prevention, and several epidemiological studies have indicated links between low folate status and depressive symptomatology in the general population.

- **Method**: A randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. Participants aged 14–24 years, at increased familial risk of mood disorder, were randomised to receive folic acid (2.5 mg daily) or an identical placebo liquid for a maximum of 36 months. Primary outcome data, specifically the onset of a DSM-IV mood disorder, were collected from 112 participants, with 56 per group.

- **Results**: The incidence of mood disorder in the folic acid and placebo groups was 14.3% and 17.9%, respectively, a non-significant difference. However, there was post-hoc evidence suggesting that folic acid delayed the time to onset of mood disorder in those participants who became unwell.

- **Limitations**: The study was limited by a small sample size and a lower than expected rate of onset of mood disorders.

- **Conclusions**: Although long-term folic acid supplementation was well tolerated with high levels of adherence, there was no evidence that it reduced the incidence of mood disorder compared to those taking the placebo.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^117XBUaq]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the diagnostic investigations for vitamin B12 deficiency, specifically with respect to serum homocysteine and MMA, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining further evaluation with MMA, serum total homocysteine, or holotranscobalamin in patients with serum cobalamin levels greater than 148 pmol/L in the presence of a strong clinical suspicion of cobalamin deficiency. It is also recommended to administer a trial of hydroxocobalamin to ascertain any clinical improvement.

### Genetic overlap between functional impairment and depression and anxiety symptom severity: Evidence from the GLAD study [^111oCAvs]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

This study is the first to conduct SNP-based genetic analyses of the relationship between depression and anxiety symptoms and functional impairment. It is one of the few genetic studies of functional impairment, an outcome of considerable clinical relevance. The measures used are widely employed in both clinical and research settings and have been validated across a range of cultures and patient groups, as shown in Mughal et al.

However, several limitations should be noted when interpreting these results. First, our analyses were restricted to individuals with lifetime depression or anxiety from the GLAD Study, a sample characterized by high rates of depression recurrence, treatment receipt, and comorbidity (Davies et al.). Given that depression and anxiety are influenced by both genetic and environmental risk factors, individuals who experience them will generally have higher levels of disorder-related genetic variants than unaffected controls. As such, although phenotypic scores were approximately normally distributed, the sample likely overrepresents individuals at the upper end of the genetic risk distribution. This restricted range of relevant genetic variation limits the generalizability of our findings to a broader population.

It likely also underlies the unexpectedly weak genetic correlations we observed with several external phenotypes, including case–control GWAS of psychiatric conditions and population-based traits such as neuroticism, which capture a broader spectrum of genetic liability.

### The translation of psychiatric genetic findings to the clinic [^1143yLFX]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Low credibility.

Mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders are highly heritable and can significantly affect morbidity and mortality. A large, growing body of evidence has implicated both common and rare genetic variations in the risk of these disorders. Testing for rare variants, such as copy number variants, has been available in clinical practice for some time, particularly in the context of developmental disorders. However, until recently, individuals with mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders in the UK have not generally accessed genetic counselling and testing.

We describe the development of the All Wales Psychiatric Genomics Service, a collaborative effort between psychiatric and clinical genetics services and the first of its kind in the UK. We provide an overview of the structure and function of the service, our referral criteria, a summary of the 40 referrals we have received at the time of writing, and our future plans.

### Association of plasma homocysteine and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T gene variant with schizophrenia: A Chinese Han population-based case-control study [^115FZoxv]. Psychiatry Research (2009). Low credibility.

This study examined the association of plasma homocysteine levels and the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism with schizophrenia in the Han population residing in northern China. The MTHFR C677T genotype was detected in 123 schizophrenia patients and compared with the genotype of 123 controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). In addition, the plasma homocysteine concentration in 62 schizophrenia patients was determined using the cyclophorase method and then compared with that in 62 controls. These 62 patients and 62 controls were a subset of the 123 patients and 123 controls.

The study found that homocysteine levels in the patients were significantly higher than those in the controls. The frequency of homozygosity for the 677T allele of the MTHFR gene was higher in the patient group than in the control group. This difference was statistically significant for both the MTHFR genotype and the frequency of allele homozygosity. Additionally, a significant difference was observed in the plasma homocysteine levels among the different genotypes in the patient and control groups. In conclusion, both elevated plasma homocysteine levels and variation in the MTHFR 677C→T gene are related to increased rates of schizophrenia and are risk factors for the condition.

### Disease clusters subsequent to anxiety and stress-related disorders and their genetic determinants [^1159VpEK]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Anxiety and stress-related disorders are among the most common mental disorders, with a regional variation in prevalence globally (i.e. from 5.3% to 10.4%) and a pooled lifetime prevalence of approximately 12.9%. With shared clinical symptoms and neurobiological features, anxiety and stress-related disorders are considered highly correlated. Historically, they fall under the same diagnostic category, reflecting similarities in genetic architecture demonstrated through familial coaggregation and genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) studies.

Individuals with anxiety and stress-related disorders typically experience intermittent, recurring episodes throughout life. As a result, they face impaired mental and physical functioning, elevated disability rates, and higher-than-expected mortality. The causes of excess disability and mortality encompass a wide range of medical conditions, including other psychiatric disorders (e.g. depression), metabolic diseases, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, and infections. However, previous studies have predominantly concentrated on specific disease groups. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive assessment of disease clusters arising subsequent to anxiety and stress-related disorders has been conducted.

Although research is still in its early stages, limited literature suggests a role of stress-related genetic loci in the development of cardiovascular disease and mortality after exposure to terrorist attacks or social adversity. Likewise, a recent GWAS study revealed that both anxiety and stress-related disorders are genetically correlated with various outcomes, further underscoring the need for comprehensive exploration in this domain.

- **Search strategy and identification of studies**: Scientific literature published before January 26, 2020, in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, WanFang database, and CNKI database was searched using specific search terms (see Supplement file 1). Equivalent Chinese terms were used in the Chinese databases. Additionally, we retrieved related articles from the selected literature references to replenish data that had not been identified in the initial search. All full-text literature was scrutinized to determine whether the papers should be included.

- **Selection criteria**: To be incorporated in this meta-analysis, studies had to satisfy the following criteria: (1) Original studies on the correlation between MTHFR polymorphism (C677T/A1298C) and ASD; (2) Cohort or case-control designs; (3) Availability of all genotype frequency information; (4) Diagnostic criteria of ASD described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th or 5th edition), and/or Childhood Autism Rating Scale. Certain earlier papers referred to the Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd edition). The exclusion criteria comprised the following: (1) Non-original research on the correlation between MTHFR polymorphism (C677T/A1298C) and ASD; (2) Studies lacking data and complete information; (3) Replicated studies; (4) Review studies.

- **Data extraction**:

Two investigators, Yan Li and Shuang Qiu, extracted all the relevant data using a standardized protocol and data collection form. From every qualified study, data such as the name of the first author and the year was extracted.

### Meta-analyses of blood homocysteine levels for gender and genetic association studies of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism in schizophrenia [^114sxaQe]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of association studies between blood homocysteine levels and schizophrenia according to gender, and we demonstrated elevated blood homocysteine levels in both male and female subjects with schizophrenia. The meta-analysis of genetic association studies using the Japanese subjects provided stringent evidence of association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and schizophrenia. Our MR analysis using the Japanese subjects suggests that increased plasma total homocysteine levels may be associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia.

### Association between MTHFR C677T/A1298C and susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders: a meta-analysis [^1111xVTX]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

The random effect model showed significant results (P < 0.05; see Table 4, Fig. 2b). Subgroup analyses indicated that the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism was associated with ASD susceptibility, particularly in regions without mandatory folate fortification. The allelic model (C vs. A) showed an odds ratio (OR) of 1.84 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.08–3.14 and a significance level of P < 0.05 (as detailed in Table 4).

- **Meta-analysis of MTHFR A1298C polymorphism to ASD risk under the five genetic models**:
	- *Random effect* and *fixed effect* models were considered in the analysis.
	- Noteworthy findings were identified across various genetic models, underscoring the potential impact of genetic variation on ASD risk.

### Genetic variants within the serotonin transporter associated with familial risk for major depression [^116rdJgn]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

The role of the serotonin transporter promoter-linked polymorphism (5HTTLPR) in depression, despite much research, remains unclear. Most studies compare persons with and without depression to each other. We show offspring at high (N = 192) as compared to low (N = 101) familial risk for major depressive disorder were almost four times as likely to have two copies of the short allele at 5HTTLPR, suggesting that incorporation of family history could be helpful in identifying genetic differences.

### Meta-analyses of blood homocysteine levels for gender and genetic association studies of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism in schizophrenia [^1163YFDE]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Many studies have indicated the potential contributions of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This risk SNP has been associated with schizophrenic negative symptoms, aggressive behavior, and various phenotypes related to schizophrenia, such as cognitive function, episodic memory, gray matter density, and prefrontal function. Interestingly, pharmacogenetic studies have demonstrated that this risk SNP has also been involved in the antipsychotic drug response and metabolic syndrome treated with antipsychotics in schizophrenia.

There are some limitations to this study. First, we did not obtain genomic DNA from all participants in the association study between the plasma total homocysteine levels and schizophrenia. Second, all patients were treated with various antipsychotic drugs, and these medications might influence the outcome. When we examined the relationship between equivalent dose and the plasma total homocysteine levels in subjects with schizophrenia by a univariate linear regression model, a positive correlation was observed in female subjects (P = .03). However, it did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons. Third, there was heterogeneity among the studies in the meta-analysis for blood homocysteine, while significant heterogeneity was not observed in the meta-analysis for genetic association studies. This heterogeneity might be caused by other genetic variations, the clinical heterogeneity of the patients included, medications, and environmental factors, such as folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12.

### Using Mendelian randomisation to infer causality in depression and anxiety research [^116oLK3h]. Depression and Anxiety (2013). Low credibility.

The genetic variants in question are associated with the quantity smoked, rather than smoking initiation, which is both a strength and a limitation. The potential for the variant to have a direct effect on the outcome of interest can be tested directly. If the variant has a direct effect on the outcome, there will be a relationship between genotype and outcome in non-smokers. As long as this is not the case, researchers can be confident that any change in the outcome is due to the variant's association with the exposure, rather than a direct effect of the gene. However, this also means that the causal effects of smoking initiation cannot be explored, at least using this particular genetic instrument.

The hope is that other genetic instruments will emerge as the GWAS project for smoking phenotypes continues. For example, recent research has suggested that smoking initiation is likely to be heritable, and some of this heritability may be independent from that of other smoking phenotypes.

### The effect of polygenic liability to mental disorders on COVID-19 outcomes in people with depression: The mediating role of anxiety [^113nQdDm]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Individuals with depression are particularly susceptible to pandemic stressors, such as disrupted access to mental health services and reduced social networks, which increases their risk of relapse or worsening existing mental conditions. Indeed, they experienced higher levels of COVID-related stress, burnout, and mental health symptoms compared to the general population. The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also vary depending on genetic predispositions to depression and other mental disorders. One study found that a polygenic risk score (PRS) for a general psychopathology factor, based on the aggregation of 12 PRSs for mental disorders, predicted being assigned to an acute dysfunction group (those showing an increase in mental health symptoms during lockdown but a decrease in symptoms once lockdown ended) rather than a resilient group (those not presenting alterations in mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic). Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no study has yet assessed if genetic predisposition to mental disorders predicts COVID-related stress and burnout in individuals with depression.

Anxiety symptoms are common in individuals with depression and can worsen the psychological toll of the pandemic, leading to increased worry, fear, and uncertainty. Indeed, anxiety symptoms have been linked to increased COVID-related stress. Conversely, individuals with higher resilience levels are better equipped to cope with pandemic challenges.

### Genetic influences on eight psychiatric disorders based on family data of 4 408 646 full and half-siblings, and genetic data of 333 748 cases and controls [^116KNZCW]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Although each study design has its own strengths, they also have study-specific biases and assumptions, which are listed in Table 1. For instance, in the national register data we use, not all affected individuals seek help or are correctly diagnosed. The sibling method also relies on certain assumptions, such as a 100% shared environment despite age differences between siblings, and despite the fact that half-siblings might live in two families (with the biological mother and with the biological father) and thus spend potentially less time together than full siblings. However, confounding with shared environmental factors is likely excluded in the h 2-SNP design. In contrast to sibling studies that assume to capture all possible genetic effects, the h 2-SNP analysis is based on genome-wide variation that is derived from a selection of common genetic variants only. By including a large number of observations from both study designs, our study is adequately powered to robustly estimate heritability in each design, despite relying on different sets of assumptions and methodologies.

- **Strengths, limitations, and assumptions**:
	- The aim of this study is to provide a test of the homogeneity in heritability estimates between family-based data (h 2-national) and SNP-based data for eight psychiatric conditions.
	- Our hypothesis is that h 2-SNP is lower but correlates positively with the family-based estimates.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^112Gfisa]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for folate deficiency, specifically concerning serum folate and cobalamin, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining cobalamin and folate assays concurrently, given the close relationship in their metabolism.

### Meta-analyses of blood homocysteine levels for gender and genetic association studies of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism in schizophrenia [^115ptPF5]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

In this study, we performed an association study between plasma total homocysteine and schizophrenia, with stratification by gender and the MTHFR C677T genotypes. We demonstrated significantly elevated plasma total homocysteine levels in patients with schizophrenia compared to controls, in both male and female subjects. The subsequent meta-analysis for gender supported this finding. To our knowledge, this is the first study to conduct a meta-analysis according to gender.

The significant decrease in plasma total homocysteine levels with age in our multivariate linear regression analysis was not consistent with a previous finding. This discrepancy might be caused by the disease status and gender of the subjects analyzed. When we examined the relationship between age and plasma total homocysteine levels in a univariate linear regression model, a significant negative correlation was observed only in male subjects with schizophrenia. Consistent with this finding, Levine et al. reported that the difference in plasma total homocysteine levels between patients and controls was attributable to young male patients with schizophrenia.

### Using Mendelian randomisation to infer causality in depression and anxiety research [^116FLN7w]. Depression and Anxiety (2013). Low credibility.

Depression and anxiety co-occur with substance use and abuse at a high rate. Ascertaining whether substance use plays a causal role in depression and anxiety is difficult or impossible with conventional observational epidemiology. Mendelian randomisation uses genetic variants as a proxy for environmental exposures, such as substance use, which can address problems of reverse causation and residual confounding, providing stronger evidence about causality.

Genetic variants can be used instead of directly measuring exposure levels, in order to gain an unbiased estimate of the effect of various exposures on depression and anxiety. The suitability of the genetic variant as a proxy can be ascertained by confirming that there is no relationship between the variant and outcome in those who do not use the substance.

At present, there are suitable instruments for tobacco use, so we use that as a case study. Proof-of-principle Mendelian randomisation studies using these variants have found evidence for a causal effect of smoking on body mass index. Two studies have investigated tobacco and depression using this method, but neither found strong evidence that smoking causes depression or anxiety; evidence is more consistent with a self-medication hypothesis. Mendelian randomisation represents a technique that can aid understanding of exposures that may or may not be causally related to depression and anxiety. As more suitable instruments emerge (including the use of allelic risk scores rather than individual single nucleotide polymorphisms), the effect of other substances can be investigated.

### Folate supplementation in schizophrenia: A possible role for MTHFR genotype [^113LJYmG]. Schizophrenia Research (2011). Low credibility.

Folate deficiency and the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C > T polymorphism have been linked to negative symptoms in schizophrenia both independently and synergistically. This study examined the effect of folate supplementation on negative symptoms overall and in relation to MTHFR 677C > T genotype.

- **Method**: Forty-six stable adult schizophrenia outpatients were enrolled, and 32 were randomised in a double-blind, parallel-group, twelve-week add-on trial of folate 2mg/d or a matching placebo. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline to week 12 on the modified SANS total score using a mixed-model analysis. In addition, we measured the effect of the MTHFR genotype on treatment effects and changes in serum folate by grouping participants with the T/T genotype together with those with the C/T genotype and comparing their interactions to patients with the C/C genotype.

- **Results**: Twenty-eight participants completed the trial. Folate supplementation did not significantly affect negative symptoms compared to placebo across the entire cohort. However, there was a significant genotype×treatment effect on negative symptoms (F = 7.13, df = 1,39, p = 0.01). In addition, MTHFR status significantly moderated the relationship between change in serum folate and change in negative symptoms: among participants with at least one copy of the T allele, negative symptoms were more likely to improve with increased serum folate (p = 0.03).

- **Conclusion**: We did not detect a therapeutic benefit of folate supplementation in a sample of patients with residual negative symptoms. However, a possible association was noted.

### Implications of the use of genetic tests in psychiatry, with a focus on major depressive disorder: A review [^11317uT3]. Depression and Anxiety (2013). Low credibility.

Advances in technology have enabled research to link many genetic markers to specific disease risk. This has led to the commercialization of genetic tests across a wide range of medical disorders. Public interest in one's own future health and an increasing desire for autonomy over one's health care have facilitated a large and growing market for such genetic tests to be sold direct to the consumer (DTC). Amidst a plethora of tests for a broad range of medical conditions, DTC genetic tests currently include a number of tests related to the risk for various psychiatric illnesses, including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and also for the prediction of individual responses to psychotropic medication.

Although a large number of studies show that there is strong public interest in genetic susceptibility testing for psychiatric disorders, little is known about the impact on individuals of receiving the results of genetic tests. Moreover, the low predictive power and uncertain clinical validity and utility of DTC genetic tests for psychiatric disorders have led to both controversy and difficulties of interpretation of results. This review summarizes the rationale for using genetic risk tests in psychiatry, as an intervention for protective cognitive and behavioral change, and to predict medication response, with a focus on MDD. Since genetic risk information has the potential to influence major life-changing health decisions, there is an imperative to ensure that there is an appropriate evidence base to support their use.

### Folate for depressive disorders: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1125i56x]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness, adverse effects, and acceptability of folate in the treatment of depression. Electronic databases, including the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register, were searched. Reference lists were examined, and authors, experts, and pharmaceutical companies were contacted to identify randomized controlled trials that compared treatment with folic acid or 5'-methyltetrahydrofolic acid to an alternative treatment for patients with a diagnosis of depressive disorders.

Three randomized trials, involving 247 participants, were included. Two studies assessed the use of folate in addition to other treatment and found that adding folate reduced Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores on average by a further 2.65 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38–4.93). Fewer patients treated with folate experienced a reduction in their HDRS score of less than 50% at 10 weeks (relative risk 0.47, 95% CI 0.24–0.92). The remaining study found no statistically significant difference when folate alone was compared with trazodone.

The identified trials did not find evidence of any problems with the acceptability or safety of folate. The limited available evidence suggests folate may have a potential role as a supplement to other treatments for depression. However, it is currently unclear if this is the case for both people with normal folate levels and those with folate deficiency.

### Shifting landscapes of human MTHFR missense-variant effects [^111kQ74Z]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

In order to model each variant's dependence on folinate and p. Ala222Val status, we used a parsimonious linear model allowing extrapolation to other folinate concentrations. However, the linear model undoubtedly simplifies true behavior and should only be applied within the range of folinate levels tested.

Our complementation assay only assesses MTHFR variants at the level of overall activity. Reduced overall activity could stem from reduced protein stability that lowers total activity while maintaining specific activity or from reduced specific activity without lowered protein abundance. Thus, observation of decreased functionality does not, by itself, provide a mechanistic explanation. Although resolving folate responsiveness and genetic interactions provided additional clues as to these mechanisms, more concrete explanations could be found through the use of additional sub-functional assays, e.g. of protein-protein interaction, protein stability, or responses to regulatory stimuli.

Few variant effect maps have been previously reported, and here we explored an atlas of dynamic functionality landscapes across combinations of environments and genetic backgrounds. It is worth noting that the most useful map for predicting pathogenicity was measured in 25 μg/mL folinate in the p. Ala222Val background. It would have been impossible a priori to predict which of the contexts we examined would be optimal, highlighting the value for future variant effect mapping studies to consider a range of environmental and genetic factors relevant to variant penetrance.

### Using Mendelian randomisation to infer causality in depression and anxiety research [^111uAoMs]. Depression and Anxiety (2013). Low credibility.

These polymorphisms allow for the testing of the dose-response relationship between cigarette smoking and anxiety and depression, given their strong association with the heaviness of smoking, which enables their use as an instrumental variable. If chronic exposure to tobacco leads to neurobiological changes that increase the risk of anxiety and depression, then we should observe a dose-dependent association between the rs1071730/rs16966968 genotype and anxiety or depression in smokers, but not in non-smokers.

Since these variants correlate with the quantity of smoking, rather than smoking initiation, there is additional benefit in testing the specificity of the gene. This means the gene affects outcomes only via exposure to smoking, not directly. If a relationship is causal and the gene does not directly influence the outcome, a relationship will be seen between the genotype and outcome only in smokers. The gene will not affect those who have never smoked.

More genetic variants with clear associations with smoking phenotypes, such as CYP2A6 and heaviness of smoking, and DBH and cessation, are emerging through ongoing GWAS efforts. The opportunities for implementing Mendelian randomisation (MR) to assess the consequences of cigarette smoking on various outcomes are likely to increase rapidly. This includes using allelic risk scores rather than individual genetic signals to capture a greater proportion of phenotypic variance and further increase understanding of these complex relationships.

### Shifting landscapes of human MTHFR missense-variant effects [^115CL2Bs]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

Here, we examine the human gene MTHFR, encoding 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, a key enzyme in the one-carbon metabolism pathway that includes the essential folate and methionine cycles. Severe MTHFR deficiency, the most common inherited disorder of folate metabolism, has been described in more than 200 individuals, most of whom were diagnosed in infancy. Primarily a disease of the central nervous system, it can also result in thromboembolism or eye disease. In older individuals, ataxic gait, psychiatric disorders, and symptoms related to cerebrovascular events have been reported.

Biochemically, severe MTHFR deficiency is associated with massive accumulation of homocysteine in the blood (hyperhomocysteinemia), where plasma homocysteine is elevated up to 60–320 μM (reference range typically 5–15 μM) together with low or low-normal plasma methionine. In contrast to severe deficiency, some variants in MTHFR yield mild hyperhomocysteinemia (15–30 μM), which increases the risk of neural-tube birth defects and has been reported to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, although the latter association is controversial, and of neural-tube birth defects. Dietary supplementation with folinate can remediate symptoms for mild hyperhomocysteinemia cases.

MTHFR is most widely known because of the common variant p. Ala222Val, which is carried by roughly half of all humans (global allele frequency 31%, gnomAD). This variant, which corresponds to c.665C > T (sometimes noted as "c.677C > T" on the basis of outdated coding sequence annotation), decreases MTHFR's thermostability.

### Folate-responsive neurologic diseases [^117TrkZh]. Pediatric Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Folate is a water-soluble vitamin of the B complex group, and is required for optimal health, growth, and development. In humans, it cannot be synthesized de novo. As a cofactor or coenzyme, folate plays key biological roles in a variety of physiological processes: maintenance and repair of the genome, regulation of gene expression, amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and the formation of myelin. Dietary folates must undergo multiple, tightly regulated absorption and metabolic processes before their cellular utilization occurs.

Clinical conditions associated with abnormal body folate status are very diverse. They range from genetic syndromes defined prior to conception, to malformations that develop during embryogenesis (neural tube defects), to disorders that are postnatally acquired and progressive, such as cerebral folate deficiency or folinic acid-responsive seizures. Central nervous system folate deficiency or impaired availability can occur in the settings of normal or decreased systemic folate levels. Because the majority of patients respond to treatment with folinic acid, pediatric neurologists should remain vigilant to the possibility of folate deficiencies in patients with unexplained neurologic disorders. The deleterious outcomes of untreated patients underscore the importance of making an early diagnosis.

### Cumulative effect of the plasma total homocysteine-related genetic variants on schizophrenia risk [^115n1Sk5]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

Previous studies suggest that elevated total homocysteine levels and the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism, which correlates with plasma total homocysteine levels, are risk factors for schizophrenia (SCZ). Recently, a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) of plasma total homocysteine levels in individuals of European ancestry identified many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (n = 13,974). The primary purpose of this study was to examine the association between these plasma total homocysteine-related SNPs and SCZ in the Japanese population.

First, we investigated associations between six SNPs and plasma total homocysteine levels in non-psychiatric subjects in the Japanese population (n = 1030). Then, we evaluated the cumulative effects of three SNPs on SCZ risk by calculating the Genotype Risk Score (GRS) (1120 cases, 2643 controls). Of the six SNPs examined, we replicated similar associations with the European GWAS at four loci (CENPQ, CPS1, MTHFR, and MUT). GRS based on three SNPs (CENPQ, CPS1, and MTHFR) was significantly associated with SCZ. Our findings suggest that common polygenic variations, which are associated with the plasma total homocysteine levels, may contribute to the risk of SCZ.
