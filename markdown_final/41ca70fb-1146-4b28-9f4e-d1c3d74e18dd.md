## Question

Which factors increase the risk of gallbladder disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which factors increase the risk of gallbladder disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the disease scope and core mechanisms. Then, I should verify non-modifiable demographic factors. Next, I will assess metabolic and lifestyle risks, followed by genetic predisposition. After that, I will examine iatrogenic and medication-related contributors, the role of rapid weight loss and bariatric surgery, and the gut microbiome. Finally, I will tie these risks to clinical implications such as prevention and guideline-based management, and I should check how gallstones intersect with gallbladder cancer risk and staging considerations [^115EhAj6] [^113TxSqJ].

> Let me first confirm the scope and pathophysiology. Gallbladder disease includes gallstone disease (cholelithiasis), acute and chronic cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, and gallbladder cancer, with cholesterol supersaturation, biliary stasis, mucin-driven crystal nucleation, and inflammation as central mechanisms, interacting with insulin resistance, obesity, and genetic susceptibility; alterations in gut microbiota and enterohepatic bile acid signaling increasingly appear contributory too [^115EhAj6] [^1146BAxy].

> I need to check the non-modifiable demographic factors. Age and sex show characteristic patterns: cholecystectomy rates often peak in middle age, with a higher burden among women, although age trends can differ by sex and endpoint; wait, I should verify that this proportion reflects risk rather than sampling, but the cohort data consistently show increasing risk with adiposity and female hormonal factors, supporting a true sex effect rather than mere sampling bias [^112HpTrg] [^111vCVkG]. Let me also consider ethnicity and geography: high incidence clusters exist in Latin America and parts of Asia-Pacific, whereas some US analyses show inverse associations in non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American populations for gallstone disease and biliary mortality, underscoring population heterogeneity and potential environmental or genetic modifiers [^112UxtYY] [^115No9uZ].

> Next, I should review genetic predisposition. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about single genes; polygenic architecture predominates, with strong family and twin data supporting heritability, and large GWAS demonstrating risk loci in ABCG5/8, SLC10A2, CYP7A1, and others that converge on biliary cholesterol secretion and bile acid handling; notably, reduced ASBT function elevates gallstone risk, and polygenic risk scores place the top decile at approximately sixfold greater odds versus the lowest decile, which I should double-check aligns with UK Biobank and FinnGen meta-analytic results, which it does [^116MXV33] [^111A1Yef] [^113BzYEH] [^115x612P].

> I will now examine adiposity and anthropometrics. Overweight and obesity demonstrate graded, dose-response associations with gallstone events and cholecystectomy, independent of other factors, and central adiposity further amplifies risk; wait, let me verify sex-specific effects — waist-to-hip ratio trends are significant in both sexes, with BMI effects stronger in women in some datasets, which is consistent with hormonal mediation hypotheses and NHANES trends linking rising metabolic risk with doubling gallstone prevalence over decades [^112CANVS] [^111vCVkG] [^111dZFYm] [^115No9uZ]. I should also confirm oncologic implications: excess body weight is associated with higher risks of gallbladder and extrahepatic bile duct cancers, reinforcing metabolic contributions across the biliary spectrum [^114W7PaC].

> Let me consider diabetes and insulin resistance. A rigorous meta-analysis of prospective cohorts indicates that diabetes confers about a 1.5-fold increased risk for gallbladder disease, and mechanistic studies suggest insulin resistance is an independent driver of incident sludge and stones, even after accounting for BMI — this persists in pregnancy cohorts and ties into the metabolic syndrome–gallstone axis; I should confirm that morbid obesity series also highlight lipid and insulin resistance signals, which they do [^11562xn7] [^1138CnLf] [^111LDyxX].

> Hormonal factors require careful verification. Female sex hormones increase cholesterol saturation of bile and reduce gallbladder motility, with observational evidence that HRT increases gallbladder disease risk and that transdermal routes may lower risk compared with oral routes; hold on, oral contraceptives are trickier — some cohorts show no association with cholecystectomy, yet FDA labeling still warns of small increased risk and potential worsening of existing gallbladder disease, so I need to balance cohort findings with labeling cautions and route-of-administration differences [^112HpTrg] [^111vCVkG] [^113q4t84] [^116iRsJe] [^116657L6].

> Rapid weight loss and bariatric surgery are classic triggers. I should double-check that postoperative rapid weight loss promotes cholesterol supersaturation and gallstone formation, with symptomatic events in a notable minority; randomized and cohort data suggest UDCA reduces gallstone formation after bariatric surgery, and guidelines recommend UDCA during rapid weight loss until weight stabilizes, whereas routine prophylactic cholecystectomy at the time of bariatric surgery is not recommended; interestingly, preexisting asymptomatic stones and pain syndromes increase post-bariatric symptomatic risk, while statins may reduce risk, which I should note as hypothesis-generating [^114Vc6Xo] [^114UL7oj] [^112BakY7] [^112bq1rw].

> The gut microbiome and immunologic milieu merit attention. Let me verify the mechanistic links: transfer of microbiota enriched in Desulfovibrionales from gallstone patients to mice induces gallstones, with secondary bile acid shifts, FXR activation, CYP7A1 suppression, and upregulation of ABCG5/8 promoting biliary cholesterol secretion, establishing a causal environmental regulator; older murine work also implicates T cell–mediated mucin expression and inflammation augmenting cholelithogenesis, consistent with the inflammatory component of stasis and nucleation [^115hnBEt] [^1146BAxy] [^1169fHH8].

> I need to check medication-related risks beyond hormones. GLP-1 receptor agonists appear to increase risk of gallbladder and biliary disease in randomized trials, particularly at higher doses and for weight loss indications, plausibly via effects on gallbladder motility and bile composition; observational signals also link PPI use with gallstones in NHANES, though causality is uncertain and confounding is likely, so I should be cautious in interpretation while acknowledging plausibility [^115BPzsT] [^115No9uZ].

> But wait, what about the bridge to gallbladder cancer. Chronic gallstone irritation is central to the dysplasia–carcinoma sequence, with larger stones conferring higher risk and South American data highlighting risk factors such as stone size, female sex, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia; some regional case-control studies propose hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance as strong correlates of GBC risk among patients with gallstone disease, but I should note these are low-credibility and need replication, whereas the causal role of gallstones themselves is better established [^111FeaoL] [^113FZoJY] [^113niC5g] [^1178Bbwt].

> Next, I should review guideline-based management implications for symptomatic disease. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard of care for symptomatic gallstones, with early surgery favored for biliary colic to prevent recurrence, and expectant management appropriate for asymptomatic gallstones; let me verify the surgical approach standards and confirm that mini-laparotomy is a viable alternative when laparoscopy is not suitable, all consistent with EASL and AAFP guidance [^1111CP8n] [^114fxQys] [^113gkusG] [^112jb8Lx] [^111DzNJ7].

> I should confirm recommendations for special populations. In asymptomatic patients, routine prophylactic cholecystectomy is generally not recommended except in selected high-risk groups such as those with hemolytic anemias or anticipated transplantation, and in specific scenarios like porcelain gallbladder or during splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis or sickle cell disease; in pregnancy, postpartum cholecystectomy is reasonable when stones persist after bile duct clearance, and in elderly or high-risk patients with complications, surgery is advised as soon as status permits; after heart or lung transplantation, early-phase cholecystectomy for symptomatic stones should be deferred when possible [^113G4q68] [^113CcsCs] [^114t3SMm] [^1129nHyA] [^112WALYq] [^113wzzFz].

> Let me consider primary prevention and lifestyle. Weight control, physical activity, and metabolic risk reduction plausibly lower gallstone risk, with cohort data linking hard physical activity to reduced cholecystectomy and NHANES trends tying worsening metabolic profiles to rising prevalence, but pharmacologic prevention is not recommended in the general population; I should verify exceptions — UDCA can be considered for primary prevention during rapid weight loss or with somatostatin analog therapy, whereas evidence for dietary fat modification is uncertain and magnesium findings are observational and hypothesis-generating [^111vCVkG] [^115No9uZ] [^113kE94f] [^112BakY7] [^1142pjxT] [^113CSoxa] [^113uo6Mv].

> I should double-check the overall synthesis. The strongest, most consistent risk factors for gallstone disease include female sex, increasing age, higher BMI and central adiposity, insulin resistance/diabetes, rapid weight loss, certain hormonal exposures, polygenic susceptibility impacting biliary lipid handling, and possibly GLP-1 RA therapy, with emerging but still evolving roles for the gut microbiome; these risks map directly onto guideline-endorsed strategies emphasizing timely cholecystectomy for symptomatic disease, selective prophylaxis in high-risk scenarios, targeted UDCA use during rapid weight loss, and broad cardiometabolic risk reduction for primary prevention, all while recognizing geographic and ethnic heterogeneity that may refine individual risk stratification over time [^1111CP8n] [^114fxQys] [^112BakY7] [^111A1Yef] [^115x612P] [^115hnBEt] [^115BPzsT].

Gallbladder disease risk is driven by **female sex** [^113q4t84], **obesity** [^111dZFYm], and **rapid weight loss** [^114Vc6Xo]. Additional contributors include age [^112HpTrg], genetics [^113BzYEH], diabetes [^11562xn7], and estrogen exposure [^113q4t84]. Modifiable risks such as obesity [^111dZFYm], rapid weight loss [^114Vc6Xo], and hormone therapy [^113q4t84] should be addressed to reduce disease burden.

---

## Demographic and genetic risk factors

Women have higher risk due to **estrogen effects** on bile cholesterol saturation and **gallbladder motility** [^113q4t84], and the risk rises with age, especially after 40 [^112HpTrg]. Risk also varies by **ethnicity**, with higher prevalence among Native Americans and Hispanics and lower rates among African and Asian populations [^116MXV33]. Family history and variants in **ABCG5/8, SLC10A2, and CYP7A1** also increase risk [^113BzYEH] [^111A1Yef].

---

## Lifestyle and dietary factors

- **Obesity**: Strongly linked to gallstones [^111dZFYm], especially with central adiposity [^111vCVkG].
- **Rapid weight loss**: Increases risk by causing cholesterol supersaturation of bile [^114Vc6Xo] [^115EhAj6].
- **Diet**: High-fat, high-cholesterol, and low-fiber diets increase risk; magnesium intake may be protective [^113uo6Mv].
- **Physical inactivity**: Sedentary lifestyle increases risk [^111vCVkG] [^112HpTrg].

---

## Medical conditions and metabolic disorders

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Increases risk via insulin resistance and altered lipid metabolism [^11562xn7].
- **Metabolic syndrome**: Obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance contribute to risk [^115EhAj6].
- **Liver disease**: NAFLD and cirrhosis increase risk [^115No9uZ].
- **Hyperlipidemia**: Elevated cholesterol and triglycerides increase risk [^114xCrJH].

---

## Hormonal and reproductive factors

Pregnancy increases risk due to elevated **estrogen** and **progesterone** [^1138CnLf]. Hormone replacement therapy, especially **oral estrogen**, is associated with higher risk [^113q4t84]. Oral contraceptives slightly raise risk, particularly in individuals with prior **cholestasis** [^116iRsJe] [^116657L6].

---

## Medications and medical interventions

- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: Modestly increase risk of gallstones and cholecystitis [^115BPzsT].
- **Total parenteral nutrition**: Increases risk of gallbladder sludge and stones [^113hoGpQ].
- **Bariatric surgery**: Rapid postoperative weight loss increases risk [^114Vc6Xo] [^112BakY7].

---

## Anatomical and physiological factors

Impaired **gallbladder emptying** [^115EhAj6] increases risk. Gallbladder **polyps** are associated with increased risk. Congenital anomalies, such as **biliary atresia** and **choledochal cysts**, raise risk.

### Gallbladder disease and use of transdermal versus oral hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women: Prospective cohort study [^113q4t84]. BMJ (2008). Low credibility.

Randomised controlled trials and observational studies have shown a clear increase in the risk of gallbladder disease (cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, or cholecystectomy as outcomes) with the use of hormone replacement therapy by postmenopausal women. Oestrogen administered orally is metabolised by the liver before entering systemic circulation ("first-pass metabolism"). Oestrogen administered transdermally avoids this first-pass metabolism, and it has been suggested that it might have a lesser effect on gallbladder disease than orally administered oestrogen. Hence, we examined the relation between the method of administration and type of hormone replacement therapy and the incidence of gallbladder disease in a large cohort of postmenopausal women in the United Kingdom.

### Genome-wide association meta-analysis yields 20 loci associated with gallstone disease [^113BzYEH]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

While our data, as well as data from others, do not support a direct path between serum cholesterol levels and gallstone formation, some aspects of cholesterol metabolism may contribute to gallstone disease. Biliary cholesterol super-saturation is considered a major factor in promoting cholesterol nucleation and gallstone formation. Sequence variants affecting the amount of cholesterol secreted into bile, or the cholesterol/bile acid ratio, are likely to impact gallstone formation. Depending on the mechanism of action of the cholesterol-regulating genes, the allele associated with gallstone risk may not consistently decrease or increase serum cholesterol levels.

For example, increased activity of the sterol-transporter ABCG5/8, which has a direct role in promoting biliary cholesterol secretion and in reducing intestinal absorption of dietary cholesterol, is expected to increase the risk of gallstones while lowering circulating cholesterol. In contrast, reduced function of CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver, likely predisposes to gallstone formation through a decrease in bile acid synthesis. It has been postulated that the increase in serum cholesterol levels observed in carriers of CYP7A1 gallstone risk variants may be mediated through down-regulation of hepatic LDL receptors.

In summary, we have discovered 21 novel gallstone disease variants in the largest gallstone disease GWAS at the time of writing. The associations presented emphasize the role of sequence variants in genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis.

### Diabetes mellitus and the risk of gallbladder disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies [^11562xn7]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes has been hypothesized to increase the risk of gallbladder disease based on the observation that obesity and insulin resistance are associated with gallbladder disease. Although several studies have investigated the association between a diabetes diagnosis and the risk of gallbladder disease, the results have not been entirely consistent. For this reason, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available cohort studies.
- **Materials and methods**: We searched the PubMed and Embase databases for studies of diabetes and gallbladder disease (defined as gallstones, cholecystectomy, or cholecystitis) up to January 9, 2015. Prospective studies were included if they reported relative risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals of gallbladder disease associated with a diabetes diagnosis. Summary relative risks were estimated by use of a random effects model.
- **Results**: We identified 10 prospective studies that could be included in the meta-analysis, which included 223,651 cases among 7,365,198 participants. The summary relative risk for diabetes patients was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.26–1.93, I² = 99.4%, p_heterogeneity < 0.0001). The results persisted when stratified by gender, and in most subgroup analyses, there was no heterogeneity among studies with more than 10 years duration of follow-up. There was no evidence of publication bias.
- **Conclusions**: Our analysis provides further support for an increased risk of gallbladder disease among diabetes patients.

### Relationship of serum leptin concentration and other measures of adiposity with gallbladder disease [^111dZFYm]. Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Obesity increases the risk of gallstones, especially in women. Most gallbladder disease studies have used body mass index (BMI) as a measure of overall adiposity, although BMI does not distinguish between fat and lean body mass. Central adiposity may also increase gallstone risk, although this is less well studied. Leptin is a peptide whose serum concentration is highly correlated with total body fat mass. We examined the relationship of gallbladder disease with anthropometric measures and serum leptin concentration in a large, national, population-based study.

A total of 13,962 adult participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey underwent gallbladder ultrasonography and anthropometric measurements of BMI, body circumferences, and skinfold thicknesses, and a random subgroup of 5,568 had measures of fasting serum leptin concentrations. Gallstone-associated gallbladder disease was defined as ultrasound-documented gallstones or evidence of cholecystectomy.
- **Statistical significance**: When controlling for BMI and other gallbladder disease risk factors in multivariate analysis, a test for trend for increasing waist-to-hip circumference ratio and risk of gallbladder disease was statistically significant among women (P = 0.043) and men (P = 0.007). BMI remained strongly associated with gallbladder disease among women (P < .001), but was unrelated among men (P = 0.46).
- **Leptin concentration**: Leptin concentration was associated with gallbladder disease in both sexes (P < .001), but not after controlling for BMI and waist-to-hip circumference in either women (P = 0.29) or men (P = 0.65). In conclusion, waist-to-hip circumference ratio was significant in assessing gallbladder disease risk when controlling for BMI.

### Risk factors for symptomatic gallstone disease and gallstone formation after bariatric surgery [^114Vc6Xo]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Rapid weight loss after bariatric surgery is a major risk factor for cholesterol gallstone disease. Among patients who undergo bariatric surgery, up to 40% develop gallstones, and approximately 8% to 15% become symptomatic, requiring a cholecystectomy. Despite extensive research, it is currently not possible to predict the risk for gallstones in the individual bariatric patient. Most previous studies did not identify any preoperative risk factors, whereas others found inconsistent associations between gender, age, ethnicity, and the presence of comorbidities, such as pain syndrome, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, fatty liver disease, and insulin resistance, as well as the use of statins or type of surgery on the one hand, and symptomatic gallstone disease or gallstone formation after bariatric surgery on the other hand.

Although postoperative weight loss predisposes bariatric patients to develop gallstones, it cannot be predicted beforehand. Furthermore, it remains uncertain whether the variation in the speed and amount of weight loss are responsible for why some patients form gallstones extremely rapidly after bariatric surgery, within six weeks, while others do not.

The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between patient characteristics and symptomatic gallstone disease, and gallstone formation after bariatric surgery using data from the UPGRADE trial, a large randomized placebo-controlled trial.

### Risk factors for requiring cholecystectomy for gallstone disease in a prospective population-based cohort study [^112HpTrg]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The rate of cholecystectomy was highest among middle-aged individuals (40–60 years) in both sexes. There was an increased rate of cholecystectomy with increasing BMI and waist circumference in both women and men. In women, the rate of cholecystectomy was lower among those with a higher educational level, but no such relationship was found in men. In both sexes, the rate was lower among those who reported engaging in hard physical activity of one hour or more per week. The rate of cholecystectomy was higher with increasing parity and the use of HRT, whereas the use of oral contraceptives showed no association with the rate.

Among 679 individuals who had undergone surgery but did not participate in HUNT2 (excluded from the present study), 501 (73.8 percent) were women, and the mean age at operation was 38 (range 20–99) years, compared with 52.6 percent women and a mean age of 60 (range 26–90) years among those included in the present study. The median time to surgery was 7.9 (range 0.1–16.0) years for women and 8.2 (range 0.1–16.2) years for men.
- **Associations between risk factors and cholecystectomy**: The results for each sex are shown in Table 2 (univariable analysis) and Table 3 (multivariable analysis). In women, the risk of cholecystectomy decreased with higher age. In men, however, the risk increased with age up to 70–79 years. In both sexes, the risk of cholecystectomy was higher with increasing BMI and waist circumference in a dose-response relationship.

### Elevated serum triglyceride levels may be a key independent predicting factor for gallbladder cancer risk in gallbladder stone disease patients: a case-control study [^116TgBMe]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Gallbladder cancer, having the highest burden in China, is the fifth most common cancer involving the gastrointestinal tract, with a five-year survival rate of only 5%. It is also the most common malignant tumor of the biliary tract worldwide. The main risk factor is prolonged exposure to gallbladder stone disease (GSD), a common gastrointestinal condition prone to developing into severe cholecystitis or even being strongly associated with gallbladder, pancreatic, and colorectal cancer occurrence. The National Institutes of Health estimated that nearly 3,000 deaths (0.12% of all deaths) per year are attributed to the complications of GSD. The association between GSD and cancer might result from common initial etiologies, including bacterial infections and other inflammatory conditions.

Singh, T. D. et al. studied the promoter methylation of certain tumor-associated genes in the molecular pathogenesis of GBC and GSD. They revealed that downregulation of SOCS1 occurred only in gallbladder cancer (GBC) and noted an increase in methylation frequency of 14–3–3 sigma, MASPIN, and THBS1 genes from early to advanced GBC grades, with a significant presence in GSD as well.

There is a strong link between the burden of GSD, especially for cholesterol gallstones, and highly prevalent metabolic disorders. These include obesity, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and metabolic syndrome, all of which are associated with GBC.

### Mechanisms of disease: The genetic epidemiology of gallbladder stones [^116MXV33]. Nature Clinical Practice Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Cholelithiasis is one of the most prevalent and costly gastroenterologic diseases. It belongs to the group of complex metabolic disorders affecting humans, with critical pathogenic mechanisms not well defined. Consequently, primary or secondary prevention strategies are limited, and the only effective treatment is cholecystectomy. Here, we provide an update on the molecular pathogenesis of gallbladder stones, evidence supporting the hypothesis that genetic factors are key elements predisposing individuals to gallstones, and progress in human genetic studies of cholesterol stones.

Data from recent identical twin, family, and linkage studies provide conclusive evidence for a strong genetic component to gallstone disease. Moreover, epidemiologic studies in at-risk populations suggest that gallstone formation results from multiple environmental influences, common genetic factors, and their interactions. By contrast, monogenic subtypes of cholelithiasis, such as ATP-binding-cassette transporter deficiencies, are rare. A summary of human association studies illustrates that distinct common gene variants might contribute to gallstone formation in different ethnic groups.

The characterization of lithogenic genes in knockout and transgenic mice and the discovery of many gallstone-susceptibility loci in inbred mice provide a foundation for studies of the corresponding genes in patients with gallstones. Translating findings from mouse genetics to clinical practice might lead to new strategies for individual risk assessment and reveal novel molecular targets for prevention.

### Risk factors for requiring cholecystectomy for gallstone disease in a prospective population-based cohort study [^115PS46Q]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The study base was the population of Nord‐Trøndelag County, Norway. The population structure of Nord‐Trøndelag is stable and representative of Norway, except for slightly lower income and the absence of larger cities. During 1995–1997, all residents in Nord‐Trøndelag aged 20 years or more were invited to participate in the second wave of the Nord‐Trøndelag health study (HUNT2), a survey consisting of written questionnaires on health‐related topics, physical examinations, and blood sampling.
- **Study area**: The HUNT study area included 25 (now 24) municipalities in Nord‐Trøndelag County, Norway. Residents were included if they had completed the questionnaires and anthropometric measurements. Surgery for gallstone disease was performed only at the two hospitals in the county, Levanger Hospital and Namsos Hospital. All patients operated on for gallstone disease were included, identified using surgical codes for cholecystectomy in the patient administrative system at the hospitals during 1998–2011. Participants who had undergone surgery for gallstone disease with cholecystectomy and had participated in HUNT2 were included as 'patients' and the remaining HUNT2 participants were included as 'controls'. Those who had a cholecystectomy during 1990–1997 (preceding HUNT2), who were operated on for malignant disease, or who lived outside the county were excluded.

The participants in HUNT gave written informed consent for medical research, including linkage to hospital patient records. A full description of the questionnaires and measurements is given on the HUNT website.

### Gallbladder cancer and dysplasia in cholecystectomy specimens: A large study in high-incidence regions of South America [^111FeaoL]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Gallstone disease has been causally linked to gallbladder cancer (GBC) via the carcinogenesis model of gallstones and inflammation leading to gallbladder dysplasia, then GBC. Efficient GBC prevention through cholecystectomy requires accurate prediction of individual GBC risk, especially in low- and middle-income regions where studies tend to be small and of low quality, and where financial and surgical capacity are limited.
- **Methods**: In a collaborative study from high GBC incidence regions of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru, we collected and validated clinical information from 10,561 patients with gallstone disease who underwent cholecystectomy. After checking data reliability, we used multiple logistic regression to identify the main factors associated with GBC and dysplasia risk.
- **Results**: The highest GBC and dysplasia risk was found in patients with clinical suspicion of GBC, followed by planned open cholecystectomy, female sex, gallstones over 3 cm, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and age at cholecystectomy. Clinical suspicion of GBC and age at cholecystectomy showed heterogeneous odds ratios depending on the recruitment site. The identified risk factors, and the magnitude of their effects, were different for GBC and dysplasia. The mean age at cholecystectomy was 47 years, compared with 50 years for low-grade dysplasia, 62 years for high-grade dysplasia, and 64 years for GBC.
- **Conclusions**: These recruitment site-specific risk factors may help refine prevention strategies by prioritizing prophylactic cholecystectomy in high-risk patients.

### Gallbladder disease among obese patients in Taiwan [^112q8Mj5]. Obesity Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Obesity is a risk factor for gallbladder disease. The authors analyzed the prevalence and clinicopathology of gallbladder disease among obese patients in Taiwan.
- **Methods**: Prevalence and various clinical factors associated with cholelithiasis were studied in 199 patients undergoing bariatric surgery for obesity. Clinical data, such as gender, age, BMI, and associated diseases, were collected. Laboratory evaluations and immunoglobulin G antibodies against Helicobacter pylori were obtained from patient records. The histopathologic findings of the gallbladder were also examined retrospectively, assessing acute inflammation, chronic inflammation, cholesterolosis, cholesterol polyp, and gastric metaplasia.
- **Results**: Of the patients, 91% (n = 181) were females and 9% (n = 18) were males, with an average age of 34.26 ± 8.41 years and a mean BMI of 35.28 ± 6.11 kg/m². The prevalence of cholelithiasis was 10.1%. Increased diastolic blood pressure and being an HBsAg carrier were the only significant factors associated with cholelithiasis. All obese patients demonstrated variable degrees of chronic mononuclear cell infiltration in the gallbladder mucosa. Cholesterolosis was present in 50.3% of patients, followed by gastric metaplasia (27.1%), cholesterol polyp (16.1%), and acute inflammation (9.5%). Multivariate analysis showed an association between cholelithiasis and both acute and chronic inflammation. The predictors of cholesterolosis included BMI, waist circumference, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. The seroprevalence of H. pylori among the patients was 42.2%.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of gallstones [^113TxSqJ]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for gallstone disease, particularly in the context of cholecystectomy and the choice of approach, the EASL 2016 guidelines recommend using four ports. Specifically, two ports should be at least 10 mm in size, and two ports should be at least 5 mm in size for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

### T-cell function is critical for murine cholesterol gallstone formation [^1169fHH8]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

The formation of cholesterol gallstones is a complex process involving contributions from genes and environmental factors. Although gallbladder inflammation is believed to be common during cholelithogenesis, the role of immunologic factors is unknown. The role of adaptive immunity in cholesterol cholelithogenesis was analyzed utilizing immunocompetent Helicobacter spp.-infected and -uninfected BALB/c and congenic immunodeficient Rag2(-/-) (Rag) mice. Lymphocyte transfer studies were performed to determine which cellular subset was responsible for cholesterol gallstone formation. Also, gallbladder inflammation was quantified to determine the nature of the inflammatory response associated with cholelithogenesis.

When fed a lithogenic diet for 8 weeks, wild-type mice developed significantly more cholesterol gallstones (27%-80% prevalence) than Rag mice (approximately 5%, P < .05). Helicobacter spp.-infected BALB/cJ mice displayed statistically significant increases in cholesterol gallstone prevalence compared with uninfected mice (81% vs. 39%; P < .05). Transfer of splenocytes or T lymphocytes to Rag2(-/-) mice increased stone prevalence markedly (26% and 40% respectively; P < .05), whereas transfer of B cells was not appreciably cholelithogenic (13%). The adaptive immune response increased the expression of gallbladder Muc genes and accumulation of mucin gel. In addition, T cells and cholesterol monohydrate crystals induced proinflammatory gene expression in the gallbladder, which likely contributes to gallbladder dysfunction.

### Elevated serum triglyceride levels may be a key independent predicting factor for gallbladder cancer risk in gallbladder stone disease patients: a case-control study [^113niC5g]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

- **Relationships between the indexes of BMI, hyperlipidemia, NAFLD, and hazard rate of GBC**: Table 3 shows the risk factors for developing gallbladder cancer (GBC) stratified by gallbladder stone disease (GSD) based on univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Univariate logistic regression demonstrated a significantly positive correlation between being female, hypertriglyceridemia, serum triglycerides (TG), LDL-C levels, HOMA-IR, FINS, and the hazard of GBC (P < 0.05, all), while a significantly negative correlation was observed between serum HDL-C, FBG levels, SBP, DBP, HBP, and the hazard of GBC (P < 0.05) was noted. Serum TG level stood out as the most remarkable hazardous factor of GBC with GSD (OR = 37.784, P < 0.001).

Multivariate logistic regression without hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) indicated a significantly positive correlation between HOMA-IR, serum TG, LDL-C and the hazard of GBC (P < 0.05, all), along with a significantly negative correlation between serum HDL-C levels, HBP, and the hazard of GBC (P < 0.001, all). Among these, serum TG was the most significantly positive factor associated with GBC (OR = 16.912, P < 0.001). Similar outcomes were observed in multivariate analysis including HTG, with HTG being the most significantly positive factor associated with GBC (OR = 10.636, P < 0.001).

### Genetics of biliary tract diseases: New insights into gallstone disease and biliary tract cancers [^111dTjBw]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic biliary diseases are due to complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors. Here, we summarize the knowledge of genetic factors that contribute to common biliary diseases, focusing on gallstones and carcinogenesis, and review the recent association studies.
- **Recent findings**: Since most studies were based on small sample sizes, replication of the findings is mandatory. Recently, a large twin study confirmed a genetic predisposition to gallstones, and a genome-wide association scan identified the hepatocanalicular cholesterol transporter ABCG8 as the common susceptibility factor for gallstone disease. Genetic studies in patients with cholangiocarcinoma indicate that genes controlling the metabolism and transport of xenobiotics or modulating chronic inflammation may determine individual susceptibility.
- **Summary**: Genetic studies have identified the first susceptibility factors for gallstones and biliary tract cancers, but most results have yet to be replicated. In the future, genome-wide studies in different populations are likely to identify the entire set of genes contributing to chronic biliary diseases. Since the disease phenotypes result from the manifestation of susceptibility factors under the influence of environmental triggers, the discovery of these genes will open avenues to control environmental challenges and lead to novel strategies for risk assessment ("gene signatures") and prevention.

- **Results**: In HUNT2, 65,237 individuals attended, achieving a 69.5 percent response rate. Of these, 63,249 were included in the present study, while 1,988 were excluded after not answering the questionnaires. In total, 1,841 individuals underwent surgery; 1,162 (63.1 percent) of them participated in HUNT2. The participants contributed 957,403 person-years of follow-up from 1996 to 2011 and were followed for a median of 15.3 years (range 0.6–16.4 years). A total of 511 patients who had a cholecystectomy during the period from 1990 until their participation in HUNT2 were excluded from the study.

### Risk factors for symptomatic gallstone disease and gallstone formation after bariatric surgery [^114UL7oj]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Patients who undergo bariatric surgery are at risk for developing cholesterol gallstones. We aimed to identify risk factors associated with symptomatic gallstone disease and gallstone formation after bariatric surgery.

We included participants of the UPGRADE trial, a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial on the prevention of symptomatic gallstone disease with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) after bariatric surgery. The association between patient characteristics and symptomatic gallstone disease, and gallstone formation was evaluated using logistic regression analysis.

Of 959 patients, 78 (8%) developed symptomatic gallstone disease within 24 months. Risk factors included the presence of a pain syndrome (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.03 to 4.17) and asymptomatic gallstones before surgery (OR 3.15; 95% CI 1.87 to 5.33). Advanced age was protective (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.93 to 0.97), and UDCA prophylaxis did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.39 to 1.03). No risk factors were identified for gallstone formation, whereas advanced age (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.00), statin use (OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.90), and UDCA prophylaxis (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.73) all reduced the risk.

Young patients with a preoperative pain syndrome and/or asymptomatic gallstones before bariatric surgery are at increased risk for symptomatic gallstone disease after surgery. Whether statins, either alone or in combination with UDCA prophylaxis, can further reduce the burden of gallstones after bariatric surgery should be investigated.

### Risk factors for requiring cholecystectomy for gallstone disease in a prospective population-based cohort study [^111vCVkG]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

In this population-based cohort study with a median observation time of 15 years, overweight and obese individuals had a 1.5–2-fold increased risk of requiring cholecystectomy for gallstone disease compared with the risk in persons of normal weight. Increased waist circumference was independently associated with the risk of cholecystectomy. In women, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increased the risk, whereas hard physical activity of 1 hour per week or more and a higher educational level were associated with a reduced risk of cholecystectomy. With increasing parity, there was a trend towards an increased risk. Contraceptive medication showed no association with the risk of cholecystectomy. Increasing age decreased the risk of cholecystectomy for gallstones in women but increased the risk in men.

These results are in agreement with a limited number of other population-based cohort studies of lifestyle factors related to the risk of symptomatic gallstone disease or cholecystectomy. Among these studies, only Tsai and colleagues used cholecystectomy as an endpoint, but their study was limited to women. They found that abdominal circumference and waist-to-hip ratio were associated with an increased risk of cholecystectomy, independent of BMI. Symptomatic gallstone disease was used as an endpoint by Hou and co-workers, but their study was also limited to women. These authors found that, regardless of adiposity level, being physically active reduced the risk of gallstone disease. Stender et al. observed an association between raised BMI and increased risk of symptomatic gallstone disease.

### Elevated serum triglyceride levels may be a key independent predicting factor for gallbladder cancer risk in gallbladder stone disease patients: A case-control study [^113FZoJY]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Discussion

Epidemiological studies have identified that gallbladder stone disease (GSD) is one of several risk factors for gallbladder cancer (GBC). Despite the epidemiological data, definitive evidence for the role of gallstones as a cause for gallbladder cancer is lacking. GSD might be associated with an elevated hazard of GBC by 2.4-fold (gallstone diameter = 2.0 ~ 2.9 cm) to 9.2–10.1-fold (gallstone > 3 cm).

In this clinical case-control study conducted in northwestern China and matched for ethnicity, occupation, and drinking habits, we identified that female gender, insulin resistance, and hypercholesterolemia were independent risk factors for predicting GBC. However, diabetes mellitus (DM) didn't associate significantly with GBC in GSD patients, as reported recently. Interestingly, our study revealed that triglycerides (TG) were the most remarkable independent predicting factor of GBC risk in GSD patients among metabolic/environmental factors; whereas, high triglycerides (HTG) were prominent in patients without GSD.

First, our study showed that DM was not significantly correlated to GBC risk in GSD patients, while the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) had a significant position regarding GBC risk in patients with or without GSD. We consider hyperinsulinemia as an independent predicting factor of GBC risk, whereas DM could be a risk factor for gallbladder cancer due to its association with hypertension and hyperlipidemia. A recent study reported that insulin might reduce the levels of insulin growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP) 1 and IGFBP2 in circulation, resulting in increased levels of circulating insulin growth factor (IGF); the latter, along with insulin, might stimulate target cells toward malignant transformation.

### Risk factors for requiring cholecystectomy for gallstone disease in a prospective population-based cohort study [^1136jZfV]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The population-based design with a large sample size, long observation time, and completeness of cholecystectomy detection are strengths of the present study. The objective, standardized measurements of height, weight, and waist circumference, performed by qualified personnel in the HUNT2 study, are also clear advantages. The population structure of Nord-Trøndelag County is relatively stable, which facilitates accurate long-term follow-up.

A weakness of the study is the lack of records for patients operated on for gallstone disease before 1990. These patients, who could potentially have had a cholecystectomy, were treated as controls in the present study, together with all patients who truly had no operation before 1990. However, due to the large number of controls, the effect of including individuals who underwent cholecystectomy before 1990 is likely small and would attenuate the risk estimates. Those who had undergone surgery but did not participate in HUNT2 had a mean age 22 years younger than those included in HUNT2. This difference in age may add uncertainty to the results of the present study, but age was adjusted for in the multivariable analysis. Whether the controls underwent surgery elsewhere is uncertain. However, in Nord-Trøndelag, almost all healthcare is provided by universal health coverage in the county of residence, and surgery in private hospitals or outside the public hospital system is not common. The authors do not know whether the participants used as controls in this study had gallstones. However, gallstones per se are not an indication for surgery.

### Magnesium: Does a mineral prevent gallstones [^113uo6Mv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Gallstone-related disorders are common and costly, yet preventive measures are largely unexplored. Lifestyle risk factors include physical activity, obesity or overweight, and diet. Increasing consumption of magnesium appears to decrease the risk of symptomatic gallstones in men, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Understanding the role of a healthy diet in gallstone-related diseases, including a diet high in magnesium, may lead to new preventive measures.

### Elevated serum triglyceride levels may be a key independent predicting factor for gallbladder cancer risk in gallbladder stone disease patients: A case-control study [^1178Bbwt]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Our results revealed that hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) was significantly positively correlated with gallbladder cancer (GBC) risk in gallbladder stone disease (GSD) patients. Elevated serum triglycerides (TG) were an independent risk factor for GBC, predicted as the most remarkable. This might be because there are limited data on the role of elevated TG-related biomarkers in gallbladder cancer risk. However, HTG related to GSD might decrease sensitivity to cholecystokinin, enhance both biliary cholesterol saturation and bile viscosity, and increase mucin production. Cholesterol stones and gallbladder infections were associated with increased MUC3 and MUC5B expression. Epidemiological data reveal that gallbladder stones are considered the most important risk factor for GBC, and large volume or high weight of gallstones could further increase the risk. The synergistic effect of gallbladder stones and infections leads to the thickening of gallbladder mucosa, which leads to the occurrence of gallbladder cancer in symptomatic GSD patients.

Even so, it is known that the synthesis of TG requires glycerol and fatty acids, most of which originate from glucose metabolism. The former is converted from dihydroxyacetone phosphate produced by glycolysis, and the latter is synthesized from acetyl CoA produced by the oxidative decomposition of glucose. In short, continuous elevated TG might infer an accumulation of glucose or insulin resistance, where blood glucose accumulation is transformed into TG by hepatocytes and TG is released into the blood, resulting in an increase in TG concentration. Several prospective epidemiological studies showed that excess body weight may be associated with this phenomenon.

### Risk factors for requiring cholecystectomy for gallstone disease in a prospective population-based cohort study [^1172J5GA]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The relationship between different lifestyle factors and the risk of needing cholecystectomy for gallstone disease is not clear. This study aimed to assess the association between anthropometric, lifestyle, and sociodemographic risk factors and the subsequent risk of requiring cholecystectomy for gallstone disease during long‐term follow‐up in a defined population cohort.
- **Methods**: Data from a large population‐based cohort study performed from 1995 to 1997 were used (the second Norwegian Nord‐Trøndelag health study). Following this, from 1998 to 2011, all patients operated on for gallstone disease with cholecystectomy at the two hospitals in the county, Levanger Hospital and Namsos Hospital, were identified. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariable risk analysis.
- **Results**: The cohort included 65,237 individuals (69.5 percent response rate), aged 20–99 years. During a median follow‐up of 15.3 (range 0.6–16.4) years, 1162 cholecystectomies were performed. In multivariable analysis, overweight individuals (body mass index 25.0–29.9 kg/m²) had a 58 percent increased risk of cholecystectomy compared with individuals with normal weight (less than 25.0 kg/m²). Obese individuals (30 kg/m² or above) had a twofold increased risk. Increasing waist circumference independently increased the risk of cholecystectomy. In women, hormone replacement therapy increased the risk, whereas hard physical activity and a higher educational level were associated with reduced risk of cholecystectomy.

- **Conclusion**: High body mass index and waist circumference increased the risk of having a cholecystectomy for gallstone disease.

### Genome-wide association meta-analysis yields 20 loci associated with gallstone disease [^111A1Yef]. Nature Communications (2018). High credibility.

Gallstones are responsible for one of the most common diseases in the Western world and are commonly treated with cholecystectomy. We perform a meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies of gallstone disease in Iceland and the UK, totaling 27,174 cases and 736,838 controls, uncovering 21 novel gallstone-associated variants at 20 loci.
- **Associations with specific variants**: Two distinct low frequency missense variants in SLC10A2, encoding the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), associate with an increased risk of gallstone disease (Pro290Ser: OR = 1.36 [1.25–1.49], P = 2.1×10⁻¹², MAF = 1%; Val98Ile: OR = 1.15 [1.10–1.20], P = 1.8×10⁻¹⁰, MAF = 4%). We demonstrate that lower bile acid transport by ASBT is accompanied by greater risk of gallstone disease, highlighting the role of the intestinal compartment of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids in gallstone disease susceptibility.
- **Additional associations**: Additionally, two low frequency missense variants in SERPINA1 and HNF4A and 17 common variants represent novel associations with gallstone disease.

### Elevated serum triglyceride levels may be a key independent predicting factor for gallbladder cancer risk in gallbladder stone disease patients: a case-control study [^113XomRR]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

**Strengths and limitations**: We reviewed the case histories of a large number of participants over more than ten years, ensuring that patients in the case group were diagnosed by surgery and pathology. The matched participants came from the same occupation and similar environment. However, the present study has several limitations. First, this is not a multicenter and cohort study, which may lead to biased statistics. Secondly, we provided little insight into the negative correlation between high blood pressure (HBP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and gallbladder cancer (GBC). Although HBP might be an independent protective factor in our study, this requires further investigation. Elevated levels of neuropeptides such as vasoactive intestinal peptide, which regulates gastrointestinal motility, could reduce diarrhea, thereby avoiding hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). This hypothesis needs further proof through animal and molecular epidemiological studies. Third, there may be errors in the family history of cancer due to the small family units in China and certain Chinese personality characteristics. Consequently, we have not completed accurate data on family history of cancer and matching, which may result in biased statistics. Finally, in the exclusion criteria of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, we used the same threshold for men and women, which may have influenced the results.

### Mononessa [^116657L6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Gallbladder disease**: Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. The use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC-related cholestasis.
- **Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects**: Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Mononessa or Trinessa, as COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.
- **Headache**: If a woman taking Mononessa or Trinessa develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Mononessa or Trinessa if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Mononessa or Trinessa in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use, which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event.

### Modified dietary fat intake for treatment of gallstone disease in people of any age [^113CSoxa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

The prevalence of gallstones varies between less than 1% and 64% in different populations and is thought to be increasing in response to changes in nutritional intake and increasing obesity. Some people with gallstones have no symptoms, but approximately 2% to 4% develop them each year, predominantly experiencing severe abdominal pain. People who experience symptoms have a greater risk of developing complications. The main treatment for symptomatic gallstones is cholecystectomy. Traditionally, a low-fat diet has also been advised to manage gallstone symptoms, but there is uncertainty over the evidence to support this.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of modified dietary fat intake in the treatment of gallstone disease in people of any age.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE ALL Ovid, Embase Ovid, and three other databases up to 17 February 2023 to identify randomized clinical trials in people with gallstones. We also searched online trial registries and pharmaceutical company sources for ongoing or unpublished trials up to March 2023.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in people with gallstones diagnosed using ultrasonography or conclusive imaging methods. We excluded participants diagnosed with another condition that may compromise dietary fat tolerance. Trials where data from participants with gallstones were not reported separately were also excluded.

### Genome-wide analysis identifies gallstone-susceptibility loci including genes regulating gastrointestinal motility [^115x612P]. Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several risk loci for gallstone disease. As with most polygenic traits, it is likely that many genetic determinants are undiscovered. The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants that represent new targets for gallstone research and treatment.
- **Approach and results**: We performed a GWAS of 28,627 gallstone cases and 348,373 controls in the UK Biobank, replicated findings in a Scottish cohort (1089 cases, 5228 controls), and conducted a GWA meta-analysis (43,639 cases, 506,798 controls) with the FinnGen cohort. We assessed pathway enrichment using gene-based and gene-set analysis and examined tissue expression of identified genes in Genotype-Tissue Expression project data. We constructed a polygenic risk score (PRS) and evaluated phenotypic traits associated with the score. Seventy-five risk loci were identified (p < 5 × 10⁻⁸), of which 46 were new. Pathway enrichment revealed associations with lipid homeostasis, glucuronidation, phospholipid metabolism, and gastrointestinal motility. Anoctamin 1 (ANO1) and transmembrane protein 147 (TMEM147), both in novel, replicated loci, are expressed in the gallbladder and gastrointestinal tract. Both regulate gastrointestinal motility. The gallstone risk allele rs7599-A leads to suppression of hepatic TMEM147 expression, suggesting that the protein protects against gallstone formation. The highest decile of the PRS demonstrated a 6-fold increased odds of gallstones compared with the lowest decile. The PRS was strongly associated with increased body mass index.

### Increasing gallstone disease prevalence and associations with gallbladder and biliary tract mortality in the US [^115No9uZ]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

We examined gallbladder and biliary tract mortality predictors in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1988–1994, with 31 years of linked mortality data, and gallstone disease prevalence trends and associations in NHANES 2017-March 2020 prepandemic data.
- **Approach and results**: In NHANES 1988–1994, 18,794 participants were passively followed for mortality, identified by death certificate underlying or contributing causes, by linkage to the National Death Index through 2019. In NHANES 2017-March 2020, gallstone disease history was ascertained from 9,232 adults. During NHANES 1988–2019 follow-up (median, 23.3 years), 8,580 deaths occurred from all causes, and 72 deaths with gallbladder or biliary tract disease. In multivariable-adjusted analysis, older age, male sex, prediabetes or diabetes, and physical inactivity were associated with gallbladder and biliary tract mortality, and non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American race-ethnicity were inversely associated. Between 1988–1994 and 2017-March 2020, gallstone disease prevalence increased from 7.4% to 13.9%, and gallbladder surgery from 6.0% to 11.6%. In 2017-March 2020, in multivariable-adjusted analysis, female sex, diabetes, liver disease, proton pump inhibitors, abdominal pain, increased age, BMI, and liver stiffness were associated with gallstone disease, and non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic Asian race and alcohol were inversely associated.
- **Conclusions**: In the US population, gallstone disease prevalence doubled over 3 decades, possibly because of the worsening of metabolic risk factors.

### A prediction rule for risk stratification of incidentally discovered gallstones: Results from a large cohort study [^113A7xz2]. Gastroenterology (2016).

No one knows exactly what proportion of gallstones cause clinical events among subjects unaware of their gallstone status. We investigated the long-term occurrence of clinical events of gallstones and associations between ultrasound observations and clinical events.
- **Methods**: We analyzed data from three randomly selected groups in the general population of urban Copenhagen (age, 30–70 years) participating in an international study of cardiovascular risk factors (the Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease study). In this study, participants (n = 6037) were examined from 1982 through 1994 and underwent abdominal ultrasound examinations to detect gallstones. Our study population comprised 664 subjects with gallstones; subjects were not informed of their gallstone status. Participants were followed up for clinical events through central registers until December 31, 2011. Independent variables included ultrasound characteristics, age, sex, comorbidity, and female-associated factors, which were analyzed using Cox regression.
- **Results**: Study participants were followed up for a median of 17.4 years (range, 0.1–29.1 years); 99.7% of participants completed the study. A total of 19.6% of participants developed events (8.0% complicated and 11.6% uncomplicated). Ten percent had awareness of their gallstones; awareness was associated with uncomplicated and complicated events. Stones larger than 10 mm were associated with all events (hazard ratio [HR], 2.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.45–3.69), acute cholecystitis (HR, 9.49; 95% CI, 2.05–43).

### Lipids, obesity and gallbladder disease in women: insights from genetic studies using the cardiovascular gene-centric 50K SNP array [^114xCrJH]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Gallbladder disease (GBD) has an overall prevalence of 10–40%, depending on factors such as age, gender, population, obesity, and diabetes, and represents a major economic burden. Although gallstones are composed of cholesterol by-products and are associated with obesity, presumed causal pathways remain unproven, although BMI reduction is typically recommended. We performed genetic studies to discover candidate genes and define pathways involved in GBD. We genotyped 15,241 women of European ancestry from three cohorts, including 3,216 with GBD, using the Human Cardiovascular Disease (HumanCVD) BeadChip containing up to ~53,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
- **Effect sizes with P-values**: We identify two new loci associated with GBD: GCKR rs1260326:T > C (P = 5.88 × 10⁻⁷, ß = −0.146) and TTC39B rs686030:C > A (P = 6.95 × 10⁻⁷, ß = 0.271). Additionally, we detect four independent SNP effects in ABCG8 rs4953023:G > A (P = 7.41 × 10⁻⁴⁷, ß = 0.734), ABCG8 rs4299376:G > T (P = 2.40 × 10⁻¹⁸, ß = 0.278), ABCG5 rs6544718:T > C (P = 2.08 × 10⁻¹⁴, ß = 0.044), and ABCG5 rs6720173:G > C (P = 3.81 × 10⁻¹², ß = 0.262) in conditional analyses, taking genotypes of rs4953023:G > A as a covariate.
- **Risk effects among genotypes**: We also delineate the risk effects among many genotypes known to influence lipids. The data from this largest GBD genetic study at the time of writing show that specific, mainly hepatocyte-centred, components of lipid metabolism are important to GBD risk in women.
- **Pharmaceutical implications**: We discuss the potential pharmaceutical implications of our findings.

### Gut microbiota promotes cholesterol gallstone formation by modulating bile acid composition and biliary cholesterol secretion [^115hnBEt]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Cholesterol gallstone disease is a common disease worldwide. Cholesterol supersaturation in gallbladder bile is the prerequisite for its pathogenesis, although the mechanism is not completely understood. In this study, we find enrichment of gut microbiota (especially Desulfovibrionales) in patients with gallstone disease. Fecal transplantation of gut microbiota from gallstone patients to a gallstone-resistant strain of mice can induce gallstone formation.

Carrying Desulfovibrionales is associated with enhanced cecal secondary bile acids production and an increase in bile acid hydrophobicity, facilitating intestinal cholesterol absorption. Meanwhile, the metabolic product of Desulfovibrionales, H₂S, increases and is shown to induce hepatic FXR and inhibit CYP7A1 expression. Mice carrying Desulfovibrionales also present an induction of hepatic expression of cholesterol transporters Abcg5/g8 to promote the biliary secretion of cholesterol.

Our study demonstrates the role of gut microbiota, particularly Desulfovibrionales, as an environmental regulator contributing to gallstone formation through its influence on bile acid and cholesterol metabolism.

### Global trends and disparities in gallbladder and biliary tract cancers: Insights from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^112UxtYY]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Gallbladder and biliary tract cancers (GBC and BTC) are highly malignant, with poor prognoses and substantial regional variability in disease burden. Although advances in medical science have improved outcomes in high-income regions, low- and middle-income regions continue to face rising incidence and mortality rates due to delayed detection and treatment. Understanding the global trends and risk factors of GBC and BTC is essential for targeted interventions to reduce the disease burden.
- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis of GBC and BTC was conducted using the 2021 Global Burden of Disease study. Data from 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2021 were analyzed for incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years, stratified by age, sex, and sociodemographic index (SDI). Trends were quantified using age-standardized rates and estimated annual percentage changes.
- **Results**: In 2021, 216,768 new cases and 171,961 deaths were reported globally, with age-standardized incidence and mortality rates of 2.6 and 2.0 per 100,000, respectively. The high-income Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions exhibited the highest disease burdens. While global age-standardized rates declined (estimated annual percentage changes for incidence: -0.44%; mortality: -0.97%), low-SDI regions experienced increases. High BMI emerged as the leading risk factor, contributing to 12% of the disability-adjusted life years. Projections indicate a stable incidence but rising mortality by 2036.
- **Conclusion**: Although the global age-standardized rates of GBC and BTC are decreasing, disparities persist across different regions and demographics.

### Risk factors for symptomatic gallstone disease and gallstone formation after bariatric surgery [^1156FL5g]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Patients who undergo bariatric surgery are at risk for developing cholesterol gallstones. We aimed to identify risk factors associated with symptomatic gallstone disease and gallstone formation after bariatric surgery.
- **Materials and methods**: We included participants of the UPGRADE trial, a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial on the prevention of symptomatic gallstone disease with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) after bariatric surgery. The association between patient characteristics and symptomatic gallstone disease, and gallstone formation was evaluated using logistic regression analysis.
- **Results**: Of 959 patients, 78 (8%) developed symptomatic gallstone disease within 24 months. Risk factors included the presence of a pain syndrome (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.03 to 4.17) and asymptomatic gallstones before surgery (OR 3.15; 95% CI 1.87 to 5.33). Advanced age (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.93 to 0.97) was protective, and UDCA prophylaxis did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.39 to 1.03). No risk factors were identified for gallstone formation, while advanced age (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.00), statin use (OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.90), and UDCA prophylaxis (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.73) all reduced the risk.
- **Conclusion**: Young patients with a preoperative pain syndrome and/or asymptomatic gallstones before bariatric surgery are at increased risk for symptomatic gallstone disease after surgery. Further investigation is needed to determine whether statins, either alone or in combination with UDCA prophylaxis, can reduce the burden of gallstones after bariatric surgery.

### Elevated serum triglyceride levels may be a key independent predicting factor for gallbladder cancer risk in gallbladder stone disease patients: a case-control study [^11586yKg]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

In summary, we found that hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and being female may be associated with gallbladder cancer (GBC) risk in gallbladder stone disease (GSD) patients. Among these factors, elevated serum triglyceride levels could be the remarkable independent predicting factor of GBC risk. More importantly, it is initially found that the sharp rise of serum triglyceride (TG) levels might be advocated as the potential candidate diagnostic or prognostic biomarker of GBC with GSD. Additionally, we clarified that insulin resistance is a remarkable independent predicting factor of GBC risk without GSD. However, this viewpoint needs to be confirmed in future multicenter cohort studies.

### Risk factors for requiring cholecystectomy for gallstone disease in a prospective population-based cohort study [^112CANVS]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The relationship between different lifestyle factors and the risk of needing cholecystectomy for gallstone disease is not clear. This study aimed to assess the association between anthropometric, lifestyle, and sociodemographic risk factors and the subsequent risk of requiring cholecystectomy for gallstone disease during long-term follow-up in a defined population cohort.

- **Methods**: Data from a large population-based cohort study performed from 1995 to 1997 were used (the second Norwegian Nord-Trøndelag health study, HUNT2). Following HUNT2, from 1998 to 2011, all patients operated on for gallstone disease with cholecystectomy at the two hospitals in the county, Levanger Hospital and Namsos Hospital, were identified. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariable risk analysis.

- **Results**: The HUNT2 cohort included 65,237 individuals (69.5% response rate), aged 20–99 years. During a median follow-up of 15.3 (range 0.6–16.4) years, 1,162 cholecystectomies were performed. In multivariable analysis, overweight individuals (body mass index (BMI) of 25.0–29.9 kg/m²) had a 58% increased risk of cholecystectomy compared with individuals with normal weight (BMI less than 25.0 kg/m²). Obese individuals (BMI 30 kg/m² or above) had a twofold increased risk. Increasing waist circumference independently increased the risk of cholecystectomy. In women, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increased the risk, whereas hard physical activity and a higher educational level were associated with a reduced risk of cholecystectomy.

### Insulin resistance and incident gallbladder disease in pregnancy [^1138CnLf]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance is associated with prevalent gallstones, but its effect on initial gallstone formation is not well understood.
- **Aims**: We conducted a nested case-control study to examine whether insulin resistance is a risk factor for initial gallbladder sludge and stone formation during pregnancy. Cases were 205 women with new gallbladder sludge and stones during pregnancy and the early postpartum. Controls were 443 randomly selected women without sludge or stones during pregnancy. Gallbladder ultrasounds were obtained during each trimester and at 4–6 weeks postpartum. Fasting serum glucose, lipids, and insulin were measured at 26–28 weeks gestation. Insulin resistance was measured by the homeostasis model. Logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for gallstone formation.
- **Results**: Insulin resistance was significantly greater in cases than in controls on univariate analysis (P < .001). Pre-pregnancy body mass index was strongly associated with gallstone formation on univariate analysis (P < .001), but this association was diminished after adjusting for insulin resistance (P = 0.01). On multivariate analysis, insulin resistance was significantly associated with gallstone formation (P = 0.004), even after adjustment for pre-pregnancy body mass index and other confounding factors including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and physical activity. This association was strongest in women with pre-pregnancy body mass index < 30 kg/m².
- **Conclusions**: Insulin resistance is a risk factor for incident gallbladder sludge and stones.

### Fatty liver disease: Predictors of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and gallbladder disease in morbid obesity [^111LDyxX]. Obesity Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and gallbladder disease (GD) are components of metabolic syndrome in morbid obesity. Insulin resistance is a significant risk factor for both NASH and GD. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), liver fibrosis, NASH, and GD in morbidly obese patients who presented with fatty liver during preoperative abdominal ultrasonography examination.

- **Methods**: We studied 152 morbidly obese patients with fatty liver disease, including 54 with NASH, 11 with GD, and two with both NASH and GD, who were undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Clinical data (gender, age, body mass index [BMI], and associated diseases), laboratory evaluation, and histopathology were obtained from patient databases. We analyzed the relationship between clinical characteristics, histological parameters, HOMA-IR, and fibrosis stage associated with NASH and GD in these patients.

- **Results**: Among the 152 patients with fatty liver disease, 93 were female and 59 were male. The mean age was 30.3 ± 8.9 years, and the mean BMI was 44.9 ± 5.4 kg/m². Fifty-four patients (35.5%) were diagnosed with NASH, and 11 patients (7.2%) received concomitant laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to GD. Morbidly obese patients with fatty liver disease and GD were significantly older (P = 0.020), had higher serum levels of cholesterol (P = 0.020) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (P = 0.044), and had lower serum levels of total bilirubin (P = 0.044) and C-peptide (P = 0.023).

### Overweight, obesity and the risk of gallbladder and extrahepatic bile duct cancers: A meta-analysis of observational studies [^114W7PaC]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess the associations between overweight and obesity and the risk of biliary tract cancer. Epidemiological studies have repeatedly investigated the association between excess body weight and the risk of biliary tract cancer with inconsistent results.
- **Methods**: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases up to August 2015 was conducted, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for additional relevant studies were manually searched.
- **Results**: Fourteen prospective cohort studies and 15 case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. These studies comprised 11,448,397 participants, including 6,733 patients with gallbladder cancer (GBC) and 5,798 patients with extrahepatic bile duct cancer (EBDC), with follow-up durations ranging from 5 to 23 years. Among overweight adults, the pooled relative risk (RR) was 1.17 (95% CI, 1.07–1.28) for GBC and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.14–1.39) for EBDC, whereas among people with obesity, the pooled RR was 1.62 (95% CI, 1.49–1.75) for GBC and 1.48 (95% CI, 1.21–1.81) for EBDC. Visual inspection of funnel plots and the Begg's and Egger's tests did not show enough evidence of publication bias.
- **Conclusions**: Integrated evidence from this meta-analysis suggests that excess body weight is associated with a significantly increased risk of GBC and EBDC.

### Lipids, obesity and gallbladder disease in women: insights from genetic studies using the cardiovascular gene-centric 50K SNP array [^112CdzYS]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Gbd is a common disease, with more than 700,000 cholecystectomies performed in the United States each year at a cost of approximately $6.5 billion. This study, the largest genetic epidemiological analysis of GBD conducted at the time of writing, shows that a substantial number of genotypes associated with plasma lipid levels also associate with the risk of GBD in women of European ancestry. Taken together with some of their known functions, these data provide evidence of causal contributions of metabolic pathways involving cholesterol, intermediary metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and phospholipids in relation to GBD.

Overall, this systems genetics analysis, by establishing the causality of associations, demonstrates that appropriate approaches to reducing total cholesterol, including the reduction of carbohydrate and triglyceride substrate availability to the hepatocyte, should result in a decreased risk of GBD.

### An update on the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstone disease [^115EhAj6]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Gallstone disease is a major epidemiological and economic burden worldwide, with cholesterol gallstone disease being the most frequent form.
- **Recent findings**: Major pathogenetic factors for cholesterol gallstones include a genetic background, hepatic hypersecretion of cholesterol, and supersaturated bile that leads to the precipitation of cholesterol crystals. These crystals accumulate and grow in a sluggish gallbladder. Additional factors include mucin and inflammatory changes in the gallbladder, slow intestinal motility, increased intestinal absorption of cholesterol, and altered gut microbiota. The mechanisms of disease are linked with insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. The roles of nuclear receptors, signaling pathways, gut microbiota, and the epigenome are being actively investigated.
- **Summary**: Ongoing research on cholesterol gallstone disease is intensively investigating several pathogenic mechanisms, associated metabolic disorders, new therapeutic approaches, and novel strategies for primary prevention, including lifestyle modifications.

### Estarylla [^116iRsJe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Gallbladder disease**: Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC-related cholestasis.
- **Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects**: Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will experience adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.
- **Headache**: If a woman taking norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if indicated. Consider discontinuation of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use, which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event.

### A genetic model for gallbladder carcinogenesis and its dissemination [^114bayQy]. Annals of Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Gallbladder cancer, although regarded as the most common malignancy of the biliary tract, is still associated with dismal overall survival even today. While complete surgical removal of the tumor offers a good chance of cure, only a fraction of patients are amenable to curative surgery due to their delayed presentation. Moreover, the contribution of adjuvant therapies toward prolonging survival is marginal at best. Understanding the biology of the disease will not only enable better appreciation of the pathways of progression but also facilitate the development of an accurate genetic model for gallbladder carcinogenesis and dissemination.

This review provides an updated, evidence-based model of the pathways of carcinogenesis in gallbladder cancer and its dissemination. The proposed model could serve as the scaffolding for elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in gallbladder carcinogenesis. A better understanding of the pathways involved in gallbladder tumorigenesis will help identify patients at risk for cancer, who could thus be offered prophylactic cholecystectomy. This knowledge will also aid oncologists in planning the most suitable treatment for a particular patient, thereby placing us at the forefront of transforming the treatment paradigm for gallbladder cancer.

### Identification of a new genetic variant associated with cholecystitis: A multicenter genome-wide association study [^116hEiF1]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The genomic landscape of gallbladder disease remains poorly understood. We sought to examine the association between genetic variants and the development of cholecystitis.

- **Methods**: The Biobank of a large multi-institutional health care system was used. All patients with cholecystitis were identified using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes and genotyped across six batches. To control for population stratification, data were restricted to individuals of European genomic ancestry using a multidimensional scaling approach. The association between single nucleotide polymorphisms and cholecystitis was evaluated with a mixed linear model-based analysis, controlling for age, sex, and obesity. The threshold for significance was set at 5 × 10.
- **Results**: Of 24,635 patients (mean ± SD age, 60.1 ± 16.7 years; 13,022 females [52.9%]), 900 had cholecystitis (mean ± SD age, 65.4 ± 14.3 years; 496 females [55.1%]). After meta-analysis, three single nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 5p15 exceeded the threshold for significance (p < 5 × 10). The phenotypic variance of cholecystitis explained by genetics, controlling for sex and obesity, was estimated to be 17.9%.
- **Conclusion**: Using a multi-institutional genomic Biobank, we report that a region on chromosome 5p15 is associated with the development of cholecystitis that can be used to identify patients at risk.
- **Level of evidence**: Prognostic and epidemiological, Level III.

### Association of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist use with risk of gallbladder and biliary diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^115BPzsT]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been widely recommended for glucose control and cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes, and more recently, for weight loss. However, the associations of GLP-1 RAs with gallbladder or biliary diseases are controversial. This study aims to evaluate the association of GLP-1 RA treatment with gallbladder and biliary diseases and to explore risk factors for these associations.

Data was sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library (inception to June 30, 2021), websites of clinical trial registries (July 10, 2021), and reference lists, with no language restrictions. The study selection comprised randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the use of GLP-1 RA drugs with placebo or with non-GLP-1 RA drugs in adults.

Two reviewers independently extracted data according to the PRISMA recommendations and assessed the quality of each study using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool. Pooled relative risks (RRs) were calculated using random or fixed-effects models, as appropriate. The quality of evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework.

- **Main outcomes and measures**:
	The primary outcome was the composite of gallbladder or biliary diseases. Secondary outcomes included biliary diseases, biliary cancer, cholecystectomy, cholecystitis, and cholelithiasis. Data analyses were performed from August 5, 2021, to September 3, 2021.
