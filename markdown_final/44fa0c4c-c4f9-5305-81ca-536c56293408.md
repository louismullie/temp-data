## Question

What are the treatment options for onycholysis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment options for onycholysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and identifying the underlying etiology. Then, I should verify general supportive measures that apply across causes. Next, I will examine etiology-specific treatments for onychomycosis, psoriasis, bacterial infections, and drug-induced onycholysis. After that, I should consider procedural options and when to escalate to systemic therapy. Finally, I will outline monitoring, expectations, and a practical decision framework, making sure I double-check guideline nuances and evidence quality at each step.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic approach, because onycholysis is a sign, not a disease, and treatment hinges on cause. I need to check for trauma, medications, infections, and inflammatory diseases, and I should confirm suspected onychomycosis with KOH, culture, PAS, or PCR before committing to antifungals, as recommended by contemporary primary care and dermatology guidance [^10fb8681] [^aa7bb584].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should also distinguish mimics and contributors such as Pseudomonas (green discoloration), Candida in psoriatic nails, and drug-induced photo-onycholysis, because misclassification leads to ineffective therapy and delays recovery. Pseudomonas onycholysis often shows green chromonychia and responds to topical gentamicin, whereas Candida colonization in psoriasis may be secondary and improve with antipsoriatic therapy rather than antifungals alone [^2f71173e] [^7ac302c2].

> Next, I should review universal supportive measures that apply regardless of etiology. I need to ensure nails are kept short, gently trimmed, and cleaned; avoid trauma, prolonged water exposure, and irritants; and consider protective measures like gloves and emollients to reduce mechanical stress and maintain barrier function, especially in patients on targeted therapies or with chronic disease [^5d5b474b] [^a4f9ac9d].

> For onychomycosis, I should confirm severity and then align therapy accordingly. Let me think about first-line systemic therapy: terbinafine 250 mg daily for 6 weeks for fingernails and 12–16 weeks for toenails, with baseline and symptom-guided LFTs, given its superior efficacy in high-quality evidence and guideline endorsement [^94a315d4] [^60b1954e]. If terbinafine is contraindicated or not tolerated, itraconazole pulse therapy is reasonable, though relapse may be higher than with terbinafine in severe disease, so I should counsel on expectations and adherence [^2f342c8e] [^60b1954e].

> Wait, let me verify topical options and when they fit. For mild distal disease or when systemic therapy is undesirable, efinaconazole 10% once daily for 48 weeks is guideline-supported and has favorable penetration and safety, with better responses in milder disease and when tinea pedis is treated concurrently. I should also remember that ciclopirox 8% lacquer remains an option, particularly when systemic therapy is contraindicated, though efficacy is lower and monthly debridement is integral to outcomes [^b3bf1663] [^f8954f48] [^f4c5376a] [^95cb70ea]. I should double-check that combination therapy is considered for poor responders or those at high risk of failure, as supported by guidelines and expert consensus [^79b056a0] [^74be3c11].

> For nail psoriasis, I need to tailor therapy to severity and patient preference. Topical tazarotene 0.1% gel can reduce onycholysis and pitting over 24 weeks and is a reasonable first-line option for limited disease. Calcipotriol plus betamethasone combinations can also improve onycholysis and pain, and I should avoid mixing salicylic acid with calcipotriene due to pH inactivation [^788e3865] [^048f39dc]. For severe or refractory nail disease, I should consider systemic therapy such as methotrexate, acitretin, or biologics, recognizing that nails lag skin in response due to slow growth and that TNF-α inhibitors and IL-17/IL-23 pathway agents have evidence for nail improvement, including in psoriatic arthritis contexts [^f659e62c] [^1852f0ce] [^0c00e917].

> But wait, what if the onycholysis is bacterial, particularly Pseudomonas. I should confirm green discoloration and consider dermoscopy to support the diagnosis, then treat with topical gentamicin 0.3% nightly for about 3 months, which has shown high resolution rates in small series. If there is suspected coinfection or refractory disease, I should broaden evaluation and consider combined regimens or culture-directed therapy [^2f71173e] [^0ac0b1c3].

> For drug-induced onycholysis, I need to identify and, when feasible, modify the offending agent. Taxanes, EGFR inhibitors, and FGFR inhibitors commonly cause onycholysis and related nail toxicities; preventive strategies include cryotherapy, minimizing trauma, and meticulous nail care, and in severe cases dose reduction or interruption may be necessary. I should confirm that cryotherapy evidence is mixed but generally supportive for taxane-induced nail changes, and counsel on sun protection to mitigate photo-onycholysis from photosensitizing agents [^61614f71] [^5d5b474b] [^10631f38] [^1a105b6b].

> I will now examine procedural options for refractory cases or when pathology is structural. Mechanical debridement to remove detached nail and reduce fungal burden is recommended alongside pharmacotherapy; I should avoid debridement alone as a treatment for onychomycosis, reserving it as an adjunct. For painful hematoma or abscess under the nail, partial nail avulsion may be indicated, and in select scenarios matrixectomy can be considered for recurrent dystrophy, balancing cure against cosmetic sequelae [^ea0496ad] [^5d5b474b] [^4fdf727a].

> Let me reconsider device-based therapies. Lasers and photodynamic therapy have been explored for onychomycosis, but current guideline appraisals conclude evidence is insufficient to recommend routine use; I should not overstate their role outside of trials or carefully selected cases, and I should emphasize that any such use should be combined with evidence-based pharmacotherapy when appropriate [^ebc4586d] [^b15b9246] [^55f61966].

> Next, I should review monitoring and expectations. Nail growth is slow, so visible improvement can take 6–12 months for fingernails and 12–18 months for toenails. I need to set expectations, reinforce adherence, and plan periodic debridement and clinical reassessment. For onychomycosis, I should confirm mycologic cure when feasible and watch for recurrence, especially if tinea pedis is untreated or footwear and hygiene are suboptimal [^aa7bb584] [^068e245b].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical decision framework. First, confirm diagnosis and etiology. Second, implement universal nail care and trauma avoidance. Third, choose etiology-specific therapy: terbinafine or itraconazole for onychomycosis based on severity and tolerance, topical tazarotene or calcipotriol-steroid combinations for psoriasis, gentamicin for Pseudomonas, and drug modification plus supportive care for drug-induced disease. Fourth, escalate to combination therapy or systemic agents for refractory or severe disease. Fifth, consider procedural adjuncts for structural contributors or persistent symptoms. And sixth, monitor longitudinally with realistic timelines and prevention counseling to reduce recurrence risk [^10fb8681] [^94a315d4] [^788e3865] [^2f71173e] [^61614f71] [^ea0496ad].

Onycholysis treatment centers on **identifying and addressing the underlying cause** (trauma, infection, medications, systemic disease) while protecting the nail unit [^4a9e309d]. Core measures include **gentle nail care** (trimming, avoiding trauma, keeping nails dry) [^a072efb6], topical antifungals or antibiotics for confirmed infections [^f4c5376a] [^2f71173e], and stopping or adjusting causative drugs when possible [^a4f9ac9d]. For refractory or severe cases, consider systemic antifungals, intralesional or systemic corticosteroids for psoriasis, or surgical options such as partial nail avulsion or matrixectomy [^94a315d4] [^f659e62c] [^4fdf727a]. Recovery is slow (6–12 months) and recurrence is common without ongoing prevention, so patient education and follow-up are essential [^aa7bb584].

---

## General measures and patient education

Regardless of etiology, **gentle nail care and patient education** are foundational:

- **Trimming and debridement**: Regularly trim the detached nail to the point of separation to prevent further lifting and reduce trauma [^4a9e309d].

- **Avoidance of trauma**: Minimize mechanical stress, avoid tight shoes, and use protective gloves for wet work [^5d5b474b].

- **Moisture control**: Keep nails dry; use absorbent powders and avoid prolonged water exposure [^5d5b474b].

- **Cosmetic precautions**: Limit use of nail polish, hardeners, and removers; avoid aggressive manicures [^5d5b474b].

---

## Treatment by underlying cause

### Traumatic onycholysis

For traumatic onycholysis, **remove the detached portion** and counsel on trauma avoidance; most cases resolve spontaneously over months as the nail grows out [^4a9e309d].

---

### Infectious onycholysis

#### Fungal infections (onychomycosis)

- **Topical antifungals**: First-line for mild distal disease; options include efinaconazole 10% once daily [^b3bf1663], ciclopirox 8% lacquer once daily [^f4c5376a], or tavaborole 5% once daily [^9e4e2250].

- **Systemic antifungals**: Terbinafine 250 mg daily for 6 weeks (fingernails) or 12–16 weeks (toenails) is first-line for moderate-to-severe disease [^94a315d4]; itraconazole pulse therapy is an alternative [^2f342c8e].

- **Combination therapy**: Consider topical plus systemic therapy for severe or refractory cases [^79b056a0] [^5c2e7284].

---

#### Bacterial infections (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa)

For Pseudomonas onycholysis, **topical gentamicin 0.3% nightly for 3 months** is effective [^2f71173e]; if refractory, consider oral fluoroquinolones or culture-directed therapy [^0ac0b1c3].

---

### Inflammatory onycholysis (e.g. psoriasis, lichen planus)

- **Topical corticosteroids**: High-potency agents (e.g. clobetasol) applied to the nail bed and matrix can reduce inflammation and onycholysis [^notfound].

- **Intralesional corticosteroids**: Triamcinolone acetonide injections into the nail matrix or bed for refractory cases [^f659e62c].

- **Systemic therapy**: Methotrexate, acitretin, or biologics (e.g. etanercept, infliximab) for severe or refractory nail psoriasis [^f659e62c] [^0c00e917].

---

### Drug-induced onycholysis

For drug-induced onycholysis, **discontinue or adjust the offending agent** when feasible (e.g. chemotherapeutics, EGFR inhibitors, tetracyclines) [^a4f9ac9d] [^1a105b6b]. Provide supportive care with gentle nail care, emollients, and pain control; consider cryotherapy or regional cooling to prevent taxane-related nail toxicity [^61614f71].

---

### Systemic disease-associated onycholysis

Treat the **underlying systemic condition** (e.g. thyroid disease, anemia, autoimmune disorders) with appropriate medical management, and use supportive nail care while the systemic disease is controlled.

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is reserved for **refractory cases or significant deformity**:

- **Partial nail avulsion**: Remove the affected nail segment to allow healing and reduce recurrence [^5d5b474b].

- **Matrixectomy**: Chemical or surgical destruction of the nail matrix for chronic, recurrent onycholysis with dystrophy [^4fdf727a].

- **Sterile matrix grafting**: Rarely used for severe matrix scarring causing persistent onycholysis [^fcad7356].

---

## Adjunctive and emerging therapies

Adjunctive options include **pulsed dye laser** for nail psoriasis-related onycholysis [^39ecd35f], **photodynamic therapy** as an investigational approach for onychomycosis [^d6da30a4], and **nutritional supplements** such as biotin, zinc, and silicon, which may support nail growth, though evidence is limited.

---

## Prevention of recurrence

Prevention focuses on **ongoing gentle nail care**, moisture control, and prompt treatment of infections or inflammation. Patient education on trauma avoidance and early recognition of recurrence is essential [^a4f9ac9d].

---

## Prognosis and follow-up

Onycholysis **resolves slowly** as nails grow (6–12 months), and recurrence is common without sustained prevention. Regular follow-up every 3–6 months helps monitor progress, reinforce adherence, and adjust therapy [^aa7bb584].

---

Onycholysis treatment is **multimodal and cause-specific**, anchored by gentle nail care and patient education. Addressing the underlying etiology — infection, inflammation, drugs, or systemic disease — while protecting the nail unit yields the best outcomes, with surgery reserved for refractory cases.

### The future of onychomycosis therapy may involve a combination of approaches [^795cf6a2]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit, most commonly caused by the anthropophilic dermatophyte fungi. It is generally accepted that this disease is increasing in prevalence despite the introduction of new and efficacious antifungal drugs. Several studies have documented health-related quality-of-life issues associated with onychomycosis and it is clear that patient treatment is both necessary and desirable. The aetiology and pathogenesis of onychomycosis is coming under increasing scrutiny and work in this field has grown substantially in recent years. This is reflected by the increased assurance with which clinicians can now prescribe treatment and be confident of improvement in a majority of their patients. However, a significant proportion of patients, perhaps as many as 25-40% of those encountered in clinical practice, are classified as treatment failures. Clinical indicators for poor prognosis include the development of residual foci of subungual fungal growth, onycholysis and severe disease. These observations have led to a resurgence of interest in combination treatments for use in patients at risk of failure/relapse. Several types of combination can be considered, including the use of oral or topical drugs and the concomitant use of surgical techniques, all of which have a place in the treatment of onychomycosis.

### Unilateral onycholysis in a patient taking erlotinib (tarceva) [^02cc6f21]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated signalling pathways has become routine practice in the treatment of lung cancer. Erlotinib is an oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, licensed for maintenance monotherapy treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after first-line chemotherapy. The authors present the case of a 51-year-old patient who had an excellent response to erlotinib, but developed unilateral onycholysis as an unusual side effect. The authors discuss erlotinib-induced skin and nail changes and have provided a brief literature review on the available evidence for their management.

### Tips to treat the 5 most common nail disorders: brittle nails, onycholysis, paronychia, psoriasis, onychomycosis [^a072efb6]. Dermatologic Clinics (2015). Low credibility.

Nail disorders are difficult to treat and often frustrating both for patients and clinicians. Because of the slow growth rate of the nail plate and the difficulty of getting the drug actives to penetrate the nail tissues, it is usually necessary to wait several months before seeing the results of treatments. This delay often leads to discontinuation of therapy by the patients. This article therefore helps clinicians to find the right treatment of the 5 most common nail disorders (brittle nails, onycholysis, paronychia, psoriasis, and onychomycosis) and provides practical tips that might improve patients' compliance.

Nail Changes

Counseling and education on the potential for nail changes are essential before initiation of treatment with FGFR inhibitors. Preventive strategies include avoidance of prolonged contact with water, repeated trauma, friction, and pressure on nails and nail beds. The use of protective gloves and limiting use of nail polish removers and nail hardeners is also helpful. Patients are also advised to avoid biting nails or cutting nails too short and to use topical emollients and loose‐fitting socks and footwear. Preventive correction of nail curvature may be considered.

Paronychia

Recommended treatments for grade 1 paronychia include topical povidone iodine 2%–10% applied twice daily [58] or daily nail soaking in 1:1 vinegar:water for 15 minutes a day. Patients with grade 2 or 3 paronychia should be treated with a 14‐day course of oral antibiotics in addition to daily nail soaking in 1:1 vinegar:water; bacterial cultures should be obtained to confirm sensitivity to antimicrobial agents. Dermatology consultation is recommended for grade ≥ 2 paronychia, given the potential chronicity of this event.

Onycholysis

Recommended management options for onycholysis consist of trimming the raised distal nails, clipping of the nails, and application of topical povidone iodine 2%–10% b.i.d. solution [58] around and under the nails. Oral antibiotics should be started if infection is suspected (bacterial cultures and sensitivities should be obtained prior to initiating antibiotics), and nail avulsion may be needed if the patient has painful hematoma or subungual abscess.

Alopecia

Preventive measures normally considered for patients undergoing traditional chemotherapy regimens, for example, scalp compression, scalp cooling, and medications, are not applicable to patients receiving FGFR inhibitors, and the health care provider's attention should be focused on early identification and management of symptoms.

Management of alopecia consists of prophylactic or reactive topical minoxidil 5% applied once daily to the scalp to encourage hair regrowth, and a high‐potency topical corticosteroid (e.g. fluocinonide 0.05% solution). In addition, hair camouflaging methods, which create the appearance of naturally thicker, fuller hair, may be considered. Alopecia typically reverses when treatment is discontinued.

### Interventions for ingrowing toenails [^42f30dbf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrowing toenails are a common problem in which part of the nail penetrates the skinfold alongside the nail, creating a painful area. Different non-surgical and surgical interventions for ingrowing toenails are available, but there is no consensus about a standard first-choice treatment.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of non-surgical and surgical interventions in a medical setting for ingrowing toenails, with the aim of relieving symptoms and preventing regrowth of the nail edge or recurrence of the ingrowing toenail.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to January 2010: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We also updated our searches of CINAHL, WEB of SCIENCE, ongoing trials databases, and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of non-surgical and surgical interventions for ingrowing toenails, which are also known by the terms 'unguis incarnatus' and 'onychocryptosis', and those comparing postoperative treatment options. Studies must have had a follow-up period of at least one month.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data from selected studies. We analysed outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This is an update of the Cochrane review 'Surgical treatments for ingrowing toenails'. In this update we included 24 studies, with a total of 2826 participants (of which 7 were also included in the previous review). Five studies were on non-surgical interventions, and 19 were on surgical interventions.The risk of bias of each included study was assessed; this is a measure of the methodological quality of several characteristics in these studies. It was found to be unclear for several items, due to incomplete reporting. Participants were not blinded to the treatment they received because of the nature of the interventions, e.g. surgery or wearing a brace on the toe. Outcome assessors were reported to be blinded in only 9 of the 24 studies.None of the included studies addressed our primary outcomes of 'relief of symptoms' or 'regrowth', but 16 did address 'recurrence'. Not all of the included studies addressed all of our secondary outcomes (healing time, postoperative complications - infection and haemorrhage, pain of operation/postoperative pain, participant satisfaction), and two studies did not address any of the secondary outcomes.Surgical interventions were better at preventing recurrence than non-surgical interventions with gutter treatment (or gutter removal), and they were probably better than non-surgical treatments with orthonyxia (brace treatment).In 4 of the 12 studies in which a surgical intervention with chemical ablation (e.g. phenol) was compared with a surgical intervention without chemical ablation, a significant reduction of recurrence was found. The surgical interventions on both sides in these comparisons were not equal, so it is not clear if the reduction was caused by the addition of the chemical ablation.In only one study, a comparison was made of a surgical intervention known as partial nail avulsion with matrix excision compared to the same surgical intervention with phenol. In this study of 117 participants, the surgical intervention with phenol was significantly more effective in preventing recurrence than the surgical intervention alone (14% compared to 41% respectively, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.69).None of the postoperative interventions described, such as the use of antibiotics or manuka honey; povidone-iodine with paraffin; hydrogel with paraffin; or paraffin gauze, showed any significant difference when looking at infection rates, pain, or healing time.

Authors' Conclusions

Surgical interventions are more effective than non-surgical interventions in preventing the recurrence of an ingrowing toenail.In the studies comparing a surgical intervention to a surgical intervention with the application of phenol, the addition of phenol is probably more effective in preventing recurrence and regrowth of the ingrowing toenail. Because there is only one study in which the surgical interventions in both study arms were equal, more studies have to be done to confirm these outcomes.Postoperative interventions do not decrease the risk of postoperative infection, postoperative pain, or healing time.

### What's new in nail disorders [^3f709814]. Dermatologic Clinics (2019). Medium credibility.

Various advancements in the diagnosis and management of nail diseases have transpired in recent years. To provide the best care for patients with nail complaints, it is essential that physicians be updated on new diagnostic and treatment modalities. The purpose of this article is to discuss new and oncoming diagnostic and management options for nail disorders, including nail psoriasis, retronychia, brittle nails, onychotillomania, trauma, trachyonychia, and pyogenic granulomas.

### What is new in fungal pharmacotherapeutics? [^2ebdb4d1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Approximately 20-25% of the population worldwide is affected by superficial cutaneous mycoses (SCM). SCM are cutaneous fungal infections with a wide array of systemic and topical treatment options. However, successful therapeutic outcomes are limited by patient non-adherence, medication side effects, potential drug interactions, antifungal resistance and disease recurrence. Advances in formulation technology have allowed for the development of more effective and safer therapies. In this article we will review several new and emerging pharmacotherapeutics for onychomycosis and tinea pedis.

### Toenail onychomycosis: current and future treatment options [^fc6ca74f]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disease affecting as much as 8% of the general population. Treatment of onychomycosis is challenging, complicated by low cure rates and relatively high relapse rates. This paper reviews the efficacy of current oral, topical, and surgical treatment options. Currently, the treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis is oral terbinafine because of its high efficacy, low relapse rates, and cost-effectiveness. Oral itraconazole or fluconazole could be considered for infections caused by Candida. Topical therapies may be a useful adjunct to these systemic therapies, but are less effective when used alone. More research is needed to determine the best measures for preventing reinfection.

### Efinaconazole in onychomycosis [^f8954f48]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection that causes nail discoloration, nail plate thickening, and onycholysis. Efinaconazole 10% topical solution is an FDA-approved treatment for onychomycosis patients aged 6 years and above. The drug functions as an antifungal by disrupting ergosterol synthesis in the fungal cell membrane. It exhibits higher in vitro activity against dermatophytes than other available antifungals such as ciclopirox and itraconazole, and the activity is comparable to amorolfine and terbinafine. Efinaconazole also provides enhanced nail penetration compared with other topical antifungals due to low surface tension, poor water solubility, and low keratin affinity. The pharmacokinetic studies suggest that the efinaconazole topical delivery to the nail bed is not markedly affected by the presence of disease. There is a subset of onychomycosis patients who are more likely to respond to efinaconazole 10% solution: female patients, those with lower BMI, mild onychomycosis, a short disease duration, no infected non-target toenails (large toenail disease only), and when concomitant tinea pedis is treated. Experts recommend efinaconazole 10% topical solution as the first line for mild-to-moderate onychomycosis, pediatric onychomycosis, those with liver or kidney disease, and as maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. The side effects of topical efinaconazole are minimal: most commonly ingrown toenails, dermatitis, vesicles, and pain at the application site. Altogether, phase I and phase III clinical trials, and post-hoc analyses indicate that efinaconazole 10% topical solution is a safe and effective treatment for adult and pediatric onychomycosis, with a satisfactory mycological and clinical cure.

### Onychomycosis therapy: past, present, future [^d1f84f14]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Methods to treat onychomycosis are varied, using therapies that can be categorized as topical, oral or device-related. Since their development, oral therapies have represented the gold standard for treatment over other methods. However, efficacy with oral therapies remains limited, and safety may be an issue, leaving many patients requiring alternative treatments. With research advances, topical therapies as alternatives for onychomycosis are being investigated with greater interest as new technologies are overcoming previous limitations of topical treatments, such as lack of nail penetration. New device-related topical therapy methods are particularly noteworthy, as they may allow for shorter, more convenient treatments for patients, reducing issues with topical compliance, and, in cases of non-drug light-based therapies, they will avoid potential for drug reactions. Research in these fields is preliminary, and the impact these methods may have on the future of onychomycosis remains to be seen.

### A review of lasers and light for the treatment of onychomycosis [^55f61966]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Onychomycosis is a common fungal infection that affects many individuals. Systemic therapies are effective, but are limited by their side effects and potential for hepatotoxicity. Topical therapies have less serious side effects, yet provide only limited efficacy due to their inability to penetrate the nail plate. These limitations have led to the investigation of laser and light-based modalities as alternative treatment options for onychomycosis. This article will provide an overview and critical assessment of the field of laser and other energy-based treatments for onychomycosis.

Study Design/Materials and Methods

A literature search was conducted on laser and light-based treatments for onychomycosis.

Results

Early data are promising, however, many of these studies are small or poorly designed.

Conclusion

Further evaluation and larger studies are needed to determine the optimal light source, pulse duration, and treatment schedule for long-term success.

### Nail toxicities induced by systemic anticancer treatments [^5cc0cd91]. The Lancet: Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Patients treated with systemic anticancer drugs often show changes to their nails, which are usually well tolerated and disappear on cessation of treatment. However, some nail toxicities can cause pain and functional impairment and thus substantially affect a patient's quality of life, especially if they are given taxanes or EGFR inhibitors. These nail toxicities can affect both the nail plate and bed, and might present as melanonychia, leukonychia, onycholysis, onychomadesis, Beau's lines, or onychorrhexis, as frequently noted with conventional chemotherapies. Additionally, the periungual area (perionychium) of the nail might be affected by paronychia or pyogenic granuloma, especially in patients treated with drugs targeting EGFR or MEK. We review the nail changes induced by conventional chemotherapies and those associated with the use of targeted anticancer drugs and discuss preventive or curative options.

### Improved efficacy in onychomycosis therapy [^5c2e7284]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The success rate of onychomycosis treatment is limited by several factors, including the access of the therapeutic agent to the fungal mass, the presence of conidia, and the susceptibility of the different infectious agents to the antifungals. Different strategies used to improve efficacy of the currently available antifungal treatments, their rationale, and the published evidence of their beneficial effects are reviewed. An improved efficacy was demonstrated for some of these strategies, such as combined oral and topical antifungal therapies, whereas most of them lack clear and direct evidence of an increase in therapeutic success.

### Pulsed dye laser in the treatment of nail psoriasis [^5077b897]. Dermatologic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment options for nail psoriasis have been limited, and the management of nail psoriasis has been challenging for physicians.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of pulsed dye laser (PDL) in the treatment of nail psoriasis.

Methods

Psoriatic nails of five patients were treated using PDL (595 nm) once monthly for 3 months. The pulse duration was 1.5 ms, the beam diameter was 7 mm, and the laser energy was 8.0 to 10.0 J/cm(2). Clinical efficacy was statistically evaluated according to Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) score differences before and after the treatment.

Results

Statistical analysis of NAPSI scores before and after treatment showed significant difference (p<.05, paired t-test). The nail bed lesions, particularly onycholysis and subungual hyperkeratosis, responded best to the treatment.

Limitations

Limitations include the lack of blinding and comparison and the small number of patients.

Conclusion

PDL might be an alternative treatment for nail psoriasis. The authors have indicated no significant interest with commercial supporters.

### At-home technique for debridement of nail plate thickening [^0bbf4cbf]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Nail plate thickening presents a common clinical challenge across a broad range of onychodystrophies, impacting patient quality of life and causing discomfort. Current treatment options, including topical urea 40% cream and surgical interventions, often yield unsatisfactory outcomes, are invasive, or costly. An at-home nail drill offers a promising alternative as a noninvasive, cost-effective solution for nail thickening.

### Onychomycosis: diagnosis and definition of cure [^9dff4da9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Until now, there has been no agreement on criteria defining resolution of onychomycosis. Most published reports use clinical and mycological cure, which comprises a completely normal-appearing nail plate, and negative nail culture and microscopy results, as the end point for defining success of therapeutic intervention. Reported here is the definition of onychomycosis, which delineates both primary and secondary criteria for diagnosis of onychomycosis and identifies clinical and laboratory parameters to define a resolved fungal nail infection. Onychomycosis cure is defined by the absence of clinical signs or the presence of negative nail culture and/or microscopy results with one or more of the following minor clinical signs: (1) minimal distal subungual hyperkeratosis; and (2) nail-plate thickening. Clinical signs indicative of persistent onychomycosis at the end of the observation period include (1) white/yellow or orange/brown streaks or patches in or beneath the nail plate; and (2) lateral onycholysis with subungual debris. Although nail appearance will usually continue to improve after cessation of therapy, the nails may have a persistent abnormal appearance even in cases where treatment has been effective.

### Clinical evaluation of safety and efficacy of a new topical treatment for onychomycosis [^48641fa4]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical study assessed the safety and efficacy of an investigational topical product for the treatment of onychomycosis (nail fungus).

Method

A prospective, multi-center, single-arm, self-controlled clinical investigation was done with adult subjects that met the inclusion criteria, primarily culture-confirmed dermatophyte infection of at least one great toe. Subjects self-treated in a weekly regimen of topical application for six months, with clinical assessment at one, three, and six months. Primary efficacy endpoint was clearance of fungal nail infection after six months of weekly treatment. Primary safety endpoint was freedom from product-related adverse events for the duration of the treatment term.

Results

Fifty males and 13 females, ages 24 to 65, infected with Trichophyton (n=62) or Epidermophyton (n=1) were enrolled; 53 completed six months of assessment. Sixty percent showed improvement in clinical parameters (nail color, nail plate involvement, onycholysis, thickness, and hyperkeratosis) at six months. Cumulative rates of dermatophyte-negative culture results (test of cure) were 28, 36, and 62 percent of subjects after one, three, and six months of treatment, respectively. Three minor adverse events were device-related, with no unanticipated or serious adverse events.

Limitations

This study was single-arm and self-controlled; 53 of 63 enrolled subjects completed the study.

Conclusion

This study describes a new topical medical device with safety and efficacy profiles that compare favorably to results reported for topically applied onychomycosis drug treatments.

### Onycholysis in doxorubicin-treated patients (...) [^44dc836a]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — Six cases of onycholysis associated with doxorubicin have been reported to Adria Laboratories, Columbus, Ohio, since 1987. The reactions were occasionally accompanied by fingertip erythema, palmar erythema, or nail discoloration, and proceeded to the loss of one or more nails in three patients. Nail loss did not occur in the other three patients. Of the three patients experiencing no nail loss, one had an intercurrent fungal infection of the nails. Coagulase-positive Staphylococcus and α-hemolytic Streptococcus were isolated from clear drainage in the second patient. The last patient showed nail loosening in the absence of any pathogen. Mean onset of onycholysis was 15 weeks following initiation of doxorubicin therapy. Doxorubicin was the sole form of chemotherapy used in three patients, and was combined with cyclophosphamide in three patients.

Dexamethasone pretreatment was used in all patients in this series, and was discontinued in five Curran CF. Onycholysis in Doxorubicin-Treated Patients. Arch Dermatol. 1990; 126:

### Acrodermatitis continua of hallopeau: is apremilast an efficacious treatment option? [^5333b7e3]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau (ACH) is considered a form of chronic and relapsing localized pustular psoriasis, initially affecting the tips of fingers and/or toes with an unknown pathogenesis.ACH strongly affects the quality of life of patients and it is characterized by a sterile pustular eruption with a slow growth, which can lead to atrophy, onychodystrophy and osteolysis, hence requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment.

Herein we describe a case of a 72‐year‐old man referring to our department for nail dystrophy, painful pustules and periungual erythema of the right third fingernail, refractory to topical corticosteroids. Patient's medical history was positive for hepatitis C, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, latent tuberculosis and psoriasis. Clinical examination showed the presence of erythemato‐desquamative plaques and pustules at the right third finger with associated onycholysis (Figure 1A). Nail mycological culture was negative and X‐ray examination did not show the presence of osteolysis of the distal phalanx of the right third finger. Histological examination confirmed the clinical suspect of ACH showing sub corneal neutrophilic and spongiform pustules with moderate lymphocytic infiltrate and thinning of the epidermis with atrophy of the papillary dermis.

### Bimekizumab complete clearance of both skin and nail psoriasis: comparative efficacy in phase III / IIIb studies [^1852f0ce]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complete skin clearance, or 100% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 100), is becoming an increasingly achievable treatment goal with new biologics for patients with plaque psoriasis. However, the PASI does not include an assessment of nail psoriasis clearance. Importantly, psoriasis of the nails is highly visible and can have a substantial negative impact on both the physical and emotional well-being of patients, relative to the small area of the body affected. Moreover, compared to patients without, patients with nail involvement have higher work absence, more healthcare resource use, higher stress, and a lower health-related quality of life.

In patients with psoriasis, nail involvement has a prevalence of approximately 40–60% and, across their lifetime, an estimated 80–90% of patients with plaque psoriasis will experience nail involvement. The nail is connected to underlying bone in the finger through an enthesis network fused with the extensor tendon, which crosses the distal interphalangeal joint. As a result of the anatomical connection between the nail and the musculoskeletal system, nail psoriasis can be an early indicator and independent risk factor for psoriatic arthritis (PsA); therefore, patients with psoriasis who experience nail involvement are three times more likely to develop PsA. Considering prevalence and that approximately one third of patients with psoriasis progress to PsA over the course of their disease, there is a need for awareness and understanding of nail disease among healthcare professionals to improve the identification and early management of patients at high risk of progression to PsA.

Systemic treatment, including biologic therapies, is recommended for nail psoriasis when it is severe (sometimes defined as involvement on four or more fingernails, or onycholysis/onychodystrophy affecting at least two fingernails) or when there is a large impact on patient health-related quality of life. However, because of their structure and growth rate, nails are often more difficult to treat than skin and can take 6–9 months to completely regrow. Complete resolution of multiple domains of psoriatic disease beyond skin has become an increasingly important treatment goal in patients with psoriasis, as highlighted by the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA). Therapies that can effectively treat these domains of psoriatic disease at the same time, including resolving an independent risk factor and controlling underlying inflammation associated with disease progression to PsA, are therefore highly desirable.

### Toxic side effects of targeted therapies and immunotherapies affecting the skin, oral mucosa, hair, and nails [^1cb95759]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Fig. 4 
a Painful onycholysis with docetaxel. b Diffuse paronychia secondary to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy

Patients treated with MEKIs, EGFRIs, and mTOR inhibitors can also develop mild to moderate changes of the nail bed and matrix. These lesions are characterized by mild onycholysis, brittle nails, and a slower nail growth rate.

Selective pan-FGFR 1–4 inhibitors are a new class of targeted therapy drugs currently under development for a large range of solid tumors. More than 35% of patients receiving these drugs experience very severe nail toxicities 1–2 months after starting the treatment, with onycholysis, onychomadesis, and nail bed superinfection occurring. These dose-dependent adverse events are similar to taxane-related nail changes. Ibrutinib is a first-in-class, oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase that is now approved in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and cell mantle lymphoma. Nail changes including brittle nails (23–67% of patients), onychoschizia, onychorrhexis, and onycholysis have been described. These nail changes become apparent after several months of treatment (median 6–9 months) and are commonly associated with hair changes.

Preventive Strategies for Targeted Therapy-Induced Nail Toxicities

To prevent nail adverse effects of targeted therapies, it is recommended that patients be counselled and properly educated with clear and detailed information, and offered appropriate preventive strategies (avoid repeated trauma or friction and pressure on nails and nail beds; use protective gloves; avoid prolonged contact with water; do not use nail polish removers and hardeners; trim nails regularly; apply topical emollients daily and US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-approved nail lacquers; wear comfortable, wide-fitting footwear and cotton socks) upon initiation of the treatment, particularly for patients treated with EGFRIs. Clinicians should be proactive and aggressive when addressing very severe toxicities such as painful onycholysis or pyogenic granuloma.

### Medical devices for the treatment of onychomycosis [^62ebee9f]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Device-based therapies are the most rapidly expanding area of onychomycosis treatment. Traditional pharmacotherapy of onychomycosis has a low to moderate efficacy and is associated with adverse reactions and drug interactions that limit its use in many patients. These new therapies include laser systems, photodynamic therapy, iontophoresis, and ultrasound. Device-based therapies are procedures conducted in the clinic by a trained professional, which mitigates the requirement for long-term patient compliance. In addition, the drug component of these therapies is topical, preventing the adverse events associated with systemic antifungal administration, and potentially allowing for the treatment of individuals who were previously excluded due to drug interactions. Device-based therapy is a nascent field, so clinical data is still in an emergent stage; however, preliminary clinical trials of laser, photodynamic therapy, and iontophoresis suggest that some devices may have a degree of efficacy. More studies are required to better determine their ability to treat onychomycosis.

### Onycholemmal carcinoma: a morphologic comparison of 6 reported cases [^1f6a8afb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

We report 6 new cases of onycholemmal carcinoma, a rare, often misdiagnosed, subcategory of squamous cell carcinoma. All reported cases to date have been treated with amputation of the affected digit.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to present the clinical and pathological features of each new case and to discuss treatment options that spare digit functionality.

Methods

Hematoxylin-eosin stains were performed on tumor sections and examined using light microscopy. In situ hybridization using probes against human papillomavirus were examined in 1 case.

Results

The female to male ratio was 1:1 with involvement of fingers in 3, thumb in 1, and toe in 1. Among the symptoms were onycholysis, periungual erythema, and pain; symptom duration ranged from 6 months to 2 years. Histologically, all cases showed a well-differentiated atypical infiltrative squamous proliferative lesion exhibiting a lobulated and cystic pattern of growth in the dermis. Abrupt keratinization reminiscent of trichilemmal keratinization was noted. Mohs micrographic surgery and radiation therapy were used as primary treatment modalities, maintaining digit functionality and achieving remission.

Limitations

Limitations of this study included the small number of cases, the infrequency with which this tumor has been reported in the literature, and the inability to obtain follow-up on an older archival case.

Conclusions

Onycholemmal carcinoma is a distinct type of squamous cell carcinoma arising from the nail isthmus; its natural clinical course is indolent. In this regard less aggressive digit-sparing treatment modalities such as radiation or Mohs micrographic surgery should be considered.

### Underdiagnosed and undertreated psoriasis: nuances of treating psoriasis affecting the scalp, face, intertriginous areas, genitals, hands, feet, and nails [^eb3beceb]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

The strategy for treatment of palmoplantar psoriasis varies based on the presence of pustular psoriasis. In the absence of pustular psoriasis, potent topical steroids, hand and foot ultraviolet therapy, bath psoralen plus ultraviolet A, tar‐based soaps (liquor carbonis detergens), and compounded products (e.g. keratolytic with a potent steroid) are all considered effective treatment options. Vitamin D analogs may be prescribed, but are less effective in thick‐skinned areas such as the hands and feet. More severe cases of palmoplantar psoriasis may require traditional systemic treatments such as methotrexate or acitretin, or newer biologic therapies such as secukinumab. The PDE4 inhibitor, apremilast is also efficacious toward palmoplantar psoriasis (Bissonnette et al. 2016). In addition to these treatment options, recalcitrant cases of pustular palmoplantar psoriasis can be treated with oral or topical dapsone (Sheu, Divito, Enamandram, & Merola, 2016).

2.6 Nail

Nail involvement is found in 23–27% of patients with psoriasis (Merola, Li, et al. 2016). The most common symptoms are pitting and onycholysis with subungual hyperkeratosis, nail‐bed discoloration, nail‐plate abnormalities, and, less frequently, splinter hemorrhages (Baran, 2010). Nail psoriasis is associated with significant pain and physical impairment (including from psoriatic arthritis, which may be more common with nail involvement), as well as issues such as: self‐image and cosmetic concerns, difficulty with tasks involving manual dexterity, anxiety and/or depression, an increased number of missed work days relative to patients without nail involvement, and substantial impairments in QoL (Augustin et al. 2010 ; Klaassen, van de Kerkhof, & Pasch, 2014 ; Langley, Saurat, Reich, & Nail Psoriasis Delphi Expert Panel, 2012 ; Ortonne, Baran, et al. 2010).

Treatment options for PP remain limited. Conventional approaches, including topical keratolytics, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators, frequently yield suboptimal responses. Systemic retinoids, such as acitretin, can reduce hyperkeratosis, although relapses are common after discontinuation.Newer interventions, including ablative laser therapy, cryotherapy, and photodynamic therapy, show promise but lack substantial long-term efficacy data.In persistent lesions or those with malignant change, surgical excision may be necessary. Overall, vigilant surveillance with periodic dermatologic evaluations and serial biopsies remains essential for timely detection of malignant transformation.

### Treatment of retronychia: a systematic review and suggested treatment algorithm [^4fdf727a]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Retronychia is an inflammatory disorder typical of the great toes characterized by arrested nail growth, ingrowth of the nail plate into the proximal nail fold and paronychia. There is no standardized treatment for retronychia, and its management should be weighed based on the severity stage, treatment modality, and clinical outcome. In this paper, a systematic review of the literature was performed to assess all published data regarding the treatment of retronychia. A total of 231 patients from 24 studies were included in the analysis. Conservative management was adopted in mild-intermediate forms, consisting of medical (topical or intralesional high-potency corticosteroids) and podiatric treatment (taping, clipping back the onycholytic plate, orthosis), leading to a global cure rate of 41.2%, with no reported side effects. Non-conservative management, that is, chemical or surgical avulsion of the nail plate, proved resolutive in 71.2% of cases. Surgical avulsion of the nail plate produced the highest cure rate (78.2%), but was burdened by 9.6% of long-term sequelae, mainly nail dystrophies. A decision-making algorithm was designed to give clinicians treatment indications based on the severity stage of retronychia, treatment invasiveness, and possible clinical outcomes.

### Ciclopirox (Ciclodan) [^091ef718]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Patients should have detailed instructions regarding the use of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), as a component of a comprehensive management program for onychomycosis in order to achieve maximum benefit with the use of this product.

The patient should be told to:

Use Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), as directed by a health care professional. Avoid contact with the eyes and mucous membranes. Contact with skin other than skin immediately surrounding the treated nail(s) should be avoided. Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), is for external use only.
Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be applied evenly over the entire nail plate and 5 mm of surrounding skin. If possible, Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be applied to the nail bed, hyponychium, and the under surface of the nail plate when it is free of the nail bed (e.g., onycholysis). Contact with the surrounding skin may produce mild, transient irritation (redness).
Removal of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, by a health care professional is needed with use of this medication. Inform a health care professional if they have diabetes or problems with numbness in your toes or fingers for consideration of the appropriate nail management program.
Inform a health care professional if the area of application shows signs of increased irritation (redness, itching, burning, blistering, swelling, oozing).
Up to 48 weeks of daily applications with Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), and professional removal of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, are considered the full treatment needed to achieve a clear or almost clear nail (defined as 10% or less residual nail involvement).
Six months of therapy with professional removal of the unattached, infected nail may be required before initial improvement of symptoms is noticed.
A completely clear nail may not be achieved with use of this medication. In clinical studies less than 12% of patients were able to achieve either a completely clear or almost clear toenail.
Do not use the medication for any disorder other than that for which it is prescribed.
Do not use nail polish or other nail cosmetic products on the treated nails.
Avoid use near heat or open flame, because product is flammable.

### Retrospective case series on risk factors, diagnosis and treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa nail infections [^2f71173e]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common pathogen causing bacterial nail infections, producing a classic blue-green pigment, known as chloronychia. Clinical examination and dermoscopic findings, as well as diagnosis and treatment, have not been well characterized.

Objective

The aim was to characterize the clinical and dermoscopic findings of P. aeruginosa infection of the nails and assess treatment efficacy.

Methods

This is a retrospective study of patients with P. aeruginosa nail infection diagnosed between January 27, 2017 and May 28, 2019. Demographics, history, clinical and dermoscopic findings, diagnostics tests, and treatment were documented and analyzed.

Results

Twenty-six patients with P. aeruginosa nail infections were analyzed, with 21 patients completing treatment, two lost to follow-up, and three still undergoing treatment. Clinical examination findings were notable for onycholysis in 76.9% of patients. Green discoloration was seen in 38.5% of patients and green-brown discoloration in 30.8%. A majority of the patients had only one nail involved (73.1%). Dermoscopic findings were significant for greenish pigmentation in 37.5% of patients and 88.9% of cases presenting with a fading border. Wound cultures of nail plates were more sensitive (40%) than dermatopathology (16.7%), but the difference was not statistically significant (p value=0.1596). All patients were treated with ophthalmic 0.3% gentamicin topical solution nightly for a 3-month period and those who completed therapy had complete resolution of their infection.

Limitations

The limitations of the study were the retrospective design and the small cohort size.

Conclusion

Clinical examination findings of onycholysis coupled with a green or green-brown discoloration involving one or more digits and dermoscopic findings of greenish discoloration with a fading border are consistent with a diagnosis of Pseudomonas nail infection. Gentamicin topical solution is an effective, inexpensive, easy-to-use treatment for this condition. Larger randomized clinical trials are necessary to compare efficacy with other therapeutic options.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapy and alternative medicine modalities for psoriasis severity measures [^048f39dc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Vitamin D analogue combinations and precautions—drug interaction and special-site guidance are provided. Simultaneous use of salicylic acid with calcipotriene should be avoided because the acid pH of salicylic acid will inactivate calcipotriene and reduce its effectiveness. Topical vitamin D analogues combined with betamethasone dipropionate can be used for nail psoriasis to reduce nail thickness, hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, and pain. Topical maxacalcitol (not available in the US) ointment can be considered as an initial treatment for palmoplantar psoriasis, including palmoplantar pustulosis. Calcipotriene ointment combined with topical tacrolimus is more efficacious than tacrolimus alone, and combination products with calcipotriene and topical nicotinamide are effective for the treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis.

### Regional limb cooling for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced toxicities: a narrative review [^61614b71]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Nail changes

Nail toxicities, including onycholysis (Figs. 2 and 3), discoloration, and nail bed hemorrhages, are notable side effects of chemotherapy, particularly taxane-based regimens. These nail changes can impact the quality of life in cancer patients and affect their chemotherapy dosage and scheduling. Studies on regional limb cooling to prevent and reduce chemotherapy-induced nail changes have shown promise. This section reviews recent studies evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cooling techniques to prevent nail toxicity.

Fig. 2 
Bilateral onycholysis of the toe nails in a cancer patient on docetaxel

Fig. 3 
Bilateral onycholysis of the thumb nails in a cancer patient on pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel

Studies generally support the efficacy of regional limb cooling in reducing chemotherapy-induced nail toxicity. Johnson et al. used the Hilotherapy machine to cool patients’ dominant hand and foot to approximately 10–12 °C. They observed reduced nail toxicity in the cooled extremities, although nail changes were not entirely prevented. Nonetheless, the extremities that were cooled exhibited less severe symptoms, supporting the efficacy of regional cooling. Mazzega-Fabbro et al. employed a more straightforward method, applying disposable ice packs to the hands and feet. This intervention significantly reduced grades 1 and 2 nail toxicity, demonstrating that even basic cryotherapy can protect against nail changes. Likewise, Peyton and Fischer-Cartlidge reported on studies utilizing frozen gloves and socks, which consistently reduced nail toxicity compared to uncooled extremities. In a separate approach, Morrison et al. studied massage-based interventions and found reduced nail issues compared to cryotherapy. Morrison et al. proposed that the massaging stimulated certain vascular elements of the nail matrix, which helped mitigate nail changes; however, the exact mechanism is still in question. Huang et al. conducted a meta-analysis of cryotherapy studies, highlighting a statistically significant reduction in nail toxicity among those receiving cryotherapy, reinforcing the efficacy of these interventions. Gilbar et al. reference a phase II matched case–control study and found a significant decrease in onycholysis in patient hands that underwent frozen glove therapy, with grade 2 onycholysis occurring in 0% of frozen glove-protected hands compared to 21% of control hands. Additionally, 89% of cooled hands had no onycholysis versus 49% in the control group. This study, and subsequent studies, further supports frozen gloves as an effective preventive measure against taxane-induced nail changes.

Onychomycosis can have a significant impact on quality of life and will progress if left untreated.
20. ORAL THERAPY Oral therapy is the most effective treatment for onychomycosis of any severity. 21Oral antifungals have higher cure rates and shorter treatment periods than topical therapy. 19, 22–31 Terbinafine is the most effective oral agent based on its high clinical cure rate and mycologic cure rate and should be recommended as first-line therapy. Continuous itraconazole therapy is FDA approved for toenail onychomycosis, and a pulse-dosing regimen is approved for fingernail onychomycosis. According to a five-year double-blind prospective study with 144 patients, mycologic and clinical relapse rates are significantly higher with itraconazole than with terbinafine in patients who have severe disease (53% vs. 23% and 48% vs. 21%, respectively; .

TOPICAL THERAPY Although topical therapy is less effective and more expensive than oral therapy, it can be used as an alternative first-line treatment in patients with superficial onychomycosis or early distal lateral subungual onychomycosis because of low risks of adverse effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. SURGICAL THERAPY Nail trimming and debridement can be used with oral or topical pharmacologic therapy to increase treatment effectiveness. Surgical and nonsurgical nail removal may be indicated for severe infection or when medical therapy fails.

NEW TREATMENT OPTIONS Although photodynamic and plasma therapies have been explored for the treatment of onychomycosis, larger randomized trials are needed to determine their effectiveness and feasibility for use in the clinical setting. 4 Plasma therapy creates air using pulses of strong electric field that ionize air molecules, generating ozone, hydroxyl radicals, and nitric oxide, which have antifungal properties. A pilot study of 19 participants without a control group showed an overall clinical cure rate of 53. 8%.

### Subungual exostosis of the toes: a systematic review [^98371126]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Subungual exostosis is a relatively common benign bone tumor that occurs in the distal phalanges of the toes and can be a source of pain and nail deformity. There is controversy about the treatment of these lesions and there are few studies that have synthesized what is known and provided meaningful information on treatment.

Questions/Purposes

We performed a systematic review to address the following questions: (1) What is the best surgical approach for excising these lesions? (2) What is the age range, sex distribution, and presenting symptoms of subungual exostoses and which toe is most frequently affected? (3) What complications arise from treatment?

Methods

Two authors independently searched multiple databases (Medline, 1950-May 2013; Cochrane EBM database, and EMBASE, 1980-May 2013 provided by OVID; ACP Journal Club, 2003-May 2013; CINAHL by EBSCO, 1937-May 2013; and PubMed by NLM, 1940-May 2013), and key words were chosen to achieve a broad search strategy. We included studies on the management of toe exostoses with > 10 cases and we excluded studies that reported on upper extremity exostoses or osteochondromas. Demographic and treatment data were collected from each article by two independent authors and collated. A total of 124 abstracts were screened, and 116 articles were reviewed in full, of which 13 met the inclusion criteria.

Results

Complete marginal excision through a fish mouth incision protecting the nail led to a recurrence rate of 4% and satisfactory clinical results, defined as no requirement for postoperative intervention and a satisfactory clinical appearance in 73%. Most studies provided incomplete descriptions of specific surgical techniques used. Fifty-five percent of the patients were younger than 18 years of age. A history of toe trauma before diagnosis was present in approximately 30% of the cases. Delayed diagnosis occurred in approximately 10% of the cases and onychodystrophy occurred in more than 10%.

Conclusions

There is weak evidence to guide management of subungual exostosis. Adequate wound management postexcision aiming to minimize disruption to the nail bed and matrix may prevent onychodystrophy, which is a common complication of treatment.

### Onycho-pachydermo periostitis: ixekizumab as a therapeutic option [^c44f9d0b]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 66-year-old man presented with a 1-year history of painful nail changes affecting both his fingers and toes. The condition was unresponsive to antifungal therapy. He had no personal history of dermatological conditions, and there was no family history of psoriasis or other skin diseases. On physical examination, he presented with tender, drumstick-like swelling of almost all fingers and toes, characterized by diffuse, fusiform enlargement of the digits, along with xanthonychia, subungual hyperkeratosis, and onycholysis (Fig 1, A - D).

No psoriatic lesions were found on the remaining skin. Laboratory tests, including the autoimmune panel, were within normal limits, except for a positive HLA-B27 antigen. Mycological examination of the nails was negative. A biopsy of a hyperkeratotic periungual lesion revealed regular epidermal acanthosis, areas of parakeratosis in the stratum corneum, Munro microabscesses, hypogranulosis, and a lymphocytic infiltrate in the upper and mid-dermis (Fig 2). These findings were consistent with psoriasis.

### Clinical insights about onychomycosis and its treatment: a consensus [^74be3c11]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, experience and knowledge have been gained using effective topical treatment for onychomycosis, a difficult-to-treat infection.

Methods

This project aims to help understand and improve patient-focused quality of care for fungal nail infections. A panel of dermatologists who treat onychomycosis convened on several occasions to review and discuss recent learnings in the treatment of onychomycosis. The panel developed and conducted a survey on diagnosis, treatment and prevention, discussed the results, and provided recommendations.

Results

The survey was sent out digitally to the Canadian Dermatology community. Ninety-two dermatologists completed the questionnaires, which were included in the analysis. The survey respondents and panel members agreed that the diagnosis of toe onychomycosis should be confirmed with a positive microscopic examination for fungus or a positive mycological culture when oral therapy and/or topical treatment is prescribed, except when it is not clinically feasible, in which case topical therapy could be started based on clinical presentation. The panel and survey respondents also agreed that treatment is to be based on percentage of nail involvement: less than 20%=topical efinaconazole; 20%-60%=topical efinaconazole±oral terbinafine (for greater than 3 nails); greater than 60%=oral terbinafine±topical therapy.

Conclusions

The current treatment paradigm for onychomycosis may have shifted from mainly oral antifungals to topical treatment, improving patient-focused quality of care. <em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(3):253-262.</em>.

### Nail psoriasis: a review [^f659e62c]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Nail psoriasis is common, occurring in up to half of patients with psoriasis and in 90% of patients with psoriatic arthritis. Left untreated, it may progress to debilitating nail disease, which leads to significant functional impairment. The most common clinical signs of nail psoriasis are nail plate pitting and onycholysis. Other classical signs include oil drop discoloration, subungual hyperkeratosis, and splinter hemorrhages. The modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) can be used to grade the severity of nail psoriasis, while the Nail Psoriasis Quality of Life Scale (NPQ10) is a questionnaire that evaluates the impact of nail psoriasis on the patient's functional status and quality of life. Treatment of nail psoriasis should be individualized according to the patient's preferences, severity of nail changes, and presence of skin and/or joint involvement. Both topical and intralesional therapies are safe and effective treatment modalities for nail disease, but are limited by poor adherence and pain, respectively. Systemic therapy such as oral retinoids may be considered for widespread nail disease causing significant morbidity. Among biologic agents, tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors and T-cell-targeted therapies such as ustekinumab may be useful for refractory severe nail psoriasis.

### Severe onycholysis and eyelash trichomegaly in a patient treated with erdafitinib [^8f07aaee]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the last 2 decades, persistent advancements in anticancer treatment have resulted in the development of an armory of targeted therapies that interfere with specific oncogenic molecular aberrations foundational to tumorigenesis. These individualized therapeutics improve overall patient outcomes through superior anticancer efficacy as well as maintained quality of life with minimization of generalized, morbid toxicities common to conventional chemotherapeutics. Representation of such success of a novel targeted agent was recently demonstrated by erdafitinib, a potent pan–fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor that prevents angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and antiapoptotic signaling in FGFR pathway–activated cancer cell lines.In phase I studies, erdafitinib proved efficacious for the treatment of advanced or recurrent urothelial carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma with clonal FGFR mutations.The most common erdafitinib-related adverse events are hyperphosphatemia, dry mouth, and asthenia; however, dermatologic toxicities are also frequent and make up 11% of treatment-related adverse events. Skin toxicities include xerosis and hand-foot syndrome, whereas nail toxicities include onycholysis or nail dystrophy. Although common, dermatologic toxicities are almost exclusively grade 1/2 and only require conservative management.

We present a case of erdafitinib-induced grade 3 dermatologic toxicities including onycholysis, nail bed superinfection, and paronychia as well as eyelash trichomegaly and eyebrow hypertrichosis that severely diminished quality of life and required temporary drug discontinuation and subsequent dose reduction. We hope this case brings awareness to the potential severity of FGFR inhibitor–associated dermatologic toxicities and encourages mindfulness of available prophylactic measures to limit their occurrences.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^13102c61]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

EGFR inhibitor-associated paronychia and periungual lesions—patients receiving epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors are at risk for nail changes that typically develop after two or more months of chemotherapy exposure, most commonly nail fold inflammation (paronychia) and periungual pyogenic granuloma-like lesions, with possible resultant onycholysis or onychodystrophy. Paronychia is characterized by tender, edematous, often purulent inflammation of the nail folds, affecting fingernails and toenails with the first digits most commonly affected; precedent trauma is not believed to be causative but rather an aggravating factor, and morbidity is high with significant pain, functional limitation, and impairment of activities of daily living; periungual pyogenic granulomata are characterized by friable vascular tissue overgrowths on lateral nail folds.

### Causes and management of acute oncological pain: a narrative review [^3f51347d]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment‐related pain: chemotherapy

Systemic anticancer treatment, namely chemotherapy, is classically associated with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy, a chronic, cumulative sensory neuropathy which develops over the course of chemotherapy. Some chemotherapy drugs can be associated with more acute pain. Oxaliplatin, a platinum analogue used widely in gastrointestinal cancers, is associated with an unpleasant acute cold‐sensitive neuropathy affecting the hands, feet and oropharynx in 80–90% of patients. This can arise within hours of receiving oxaliplatin and may last up to 72 h. The underlying mechanism is thought to relate to oxaliplatin modulating the transcription of distinct ion channels that shape sensory neuronal cold responses. The presence of this phenomenon is a marker for the development of more severe longer‐term chemotherapy‐induced peripheral neuropathy.

Due to the rapid turnover of the cells of the nail matrix, toe and fingernails are particularly vulnerable to damage from chemotherapy. Certain nail toxicities may be acutely painful. Onycholysis, the separation of the nail plate from the nail bed, is associated with taxane‐based chemotherapy and, when haemorrhagic, can cause severe pain. Other painful nail toxicities include subungual haematomas and paronychia. Specialist dermatological input to assist with the management of patients presenting with painful nail toxicity is advised.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^f1ae87ab]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The study clarifies the new efficacy of EFCZ in subjects with onychomycosis and warrants higher safety. These properties may possibly expand the potentiality of EFCZ as a good treatment option for patients with various lesions and backgrounds.

On the other hand, a certain number of patients are resistant to treatment with EFCZ; thus, combination therapy with oral drugs or other surgical treatments would be considered. In fact, reports have described improved cure rates after using a topical preparation in combination with an oral drug or nail debridement, 20, 21, 22 and that EFCZ in combination with laser therapy enhances the therapeutic efficacy. 23 Further studies on such cases will be expected. Topical treatment of onychomycosis may be currently at a turning point in the world. From the results of this study, we predict EFCZ to become a practical option for the treatment of onychomycosis.

### Oral antifungal medication for toenail onychomycosis [^60b1954e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal infection of the toenails, also called onychomycosis, is a common problem that causes damage to the nail's structure and physical appearance. For those severely affected, it can interfere with normal daily activities. Treatment is taken orally or applied topically; however, traditionally topical treatments have low success rates due to the nail's physical properties. Oral treatments also appear to have shorter treatment times and better cure rates. Our review will assist those needing to make an evidence-based choice for treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral antifungal treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to October 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We sought to identify unpublished and ongoing trials by correspondence with authors and by contacting relevant pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing oral antifungal treatment to placebo or another oral antifungal treatment in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by one or more positive cultures, direct microscopy of fungal elements, or histological examination of the nail.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 48 studies involving 10,200 participants. Half the studies took place in more than one centre and were conducted in outpatient dermatology settings. The participants mainly had subungual fungal infection of the toenails. Study duration ranged from 4 months to 2 years.We assessed one study as being at low risk of bias in all domains and 18 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain. The most common high-risk domain was 'blinding of personnel and participants'.We found high-quality evidence that terbinafine is more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (risk ratio (RR) 6.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.96 to 9.08, 8 studies, 1006 participants) and mycological cure (RR 4.53, 95% CI 2.47 to 8.33, 8 studies, 1006 participants). Adverse events amongst terbinafine-treated participants included gastrointestinal symptoms, infections, and headache, but there was probably no significant difference in their risk between the groups (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.47, 4 studies, 399 participants, moderate-quality evidence).There was high-quality evidence that azoles were more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (RR 22.18, 95% CI 12.63 to 38.95, 9 studies, 3440 participants) and mycological cure (RR 5.86, 95% CI 3.23 to 10.62, 9 studies, 3440 participants). There were slightly more adverse events in the azole group (the most common being headache, flu-like symptoms, and nausea), but the difference was probably not significant (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.12; 9 studies, 3441 participants, moderate-quality evidence).Terbinafine and azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared, individually, to placebo (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.38, 1 study, 35 participants; RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07, 1 study, 26 participants, respectively; both low-quality evidence).There is moderate-quality evidence that terbinafine was probably more effective than azoles for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95, 15 studies, 2168 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.88, 17 studies, 2544 participants). There was probably no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.17; 9 studies, 1762 participants, moderate-quality evidence) between the two groups, and there may be no difference in recurrence rate (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.79, 5 studies, 282 participants, low-quality evidence). Common adverse events in both groups included headache, viral infection, and nausea.Moderate-quality evidence shows that azoles and griseofulvin probably had similar efficacy for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.96, 5 studies, 222 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.51, 5 studies, 222 participants). However, the risk of adverse events was probably higher in the griseofulvin group (RR 2.41, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.73, 2 studies, 143 participants, moderate-quality evidence), with the most common being gastrointestinal disturbance and allergic reaction (in griseofulvin-treated participants) along with nausea and vomiting (in azole-treated participants). Very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain about this comparison's impact on recurrence rate (RR 4.00, 0.26 to 61.76, 1 study, 7 participants).There is low-quality evidence that terbinafine may be more effective than griseofulvin in terms of clinical cure (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.72, 4 studies, 270 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.90, 5 studies, 465 participants), and griseofulvin was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, although this was based on low-quality evidence (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.82, 2 studies, 100 participants). Common adverse events included headache and stomach problems (in griseofulvin-treated participants) as well as taste loss and nausea (in terbinafine-treated participants). No studies addressed recurrence rate for this comparison.No study addressed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We found high-quality evidence that compared to placebo, terbinafine and azoles are effective treatments for the mycological and clinical cure of onychomycosis, with moderate-quality evidence of excess harm. However, terbinafine probably leads to better cure rates than azoles with the same risk of adverse events (moderate-quality evidence).Azole and griseofulvin were shown to probably have a similar effect on cure, but more adverse events appeared to occur with the latter (moderate-quality evidence). Terbinafine may improve cure and be associated with fewer adverse effects when compared to griseofulvin (low-quality evidence).Only four comparisons assessed recurrence rate: low-quality evidence found that terbinafine or azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared to placebo, but there may be no difference between them.Only a limited number of studies reported adverse events, and the severity of the events was not taken into account.Overall, the quality of the evidence varied widely from high to very low depending on the outcome and comparison. The main reasons to downgrade evidence were limitations in study design, such as unclear allocation concealment and randomisation as well as lack of blinding.

### Subungual neuroma masquerading as green nail syndrome [^0ac0b1c3]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Traumatic neuromas are benign tumors of the peripheral sensory nerve tissue that develop secondary to injuries at sites such as the palmar aspect of the hand, upper and lower extremities, and the tongue.Their etiology may be explained by a disorganized repair of disunited nerve endings.Traumatic neuromas may also arise from chronic stimulation and friction.To date, only 2 cases of traumatic subungual neuromas have been reported. In both cases, subungual growth was suspected due to an obvious painful subungual nodule or band-like onychodystrophy. In our patient, the mass effect of the subungual neuroma led to chronic distal onycholysis, allowing for the development of persistent green nail syndrome and candidal onychomycosis.

Green nail syndrome, most commonly caused by P aeruginosa, is a nail disease of infectious etiology that causes green chromonychia, onycholysis, and chronic paronychia.It is challenging to treat, and recommended therapeutic regimens vary. First-line treatment options consist of topical therapies, such as Dakin solution (0.5%-2% sodium hypochlorite) soaks, followed by 2 weeks of a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, if these fail. Fungal and bacterial coinfections are common, and may further complicate treatment. In a study by Ohn et alin 2020, 65% of patients with green nail syndrome had fungal coinfection. In such cases, an extended course of antibiotics and antifungals has been used.

In cases of persistent green nail syndrome, a full spectrum of potential underlying causes of onycholysis should be considered. Examination of subungual lesions can be challenging, especially when there is overlying discoloration of the nail plate. Thus, nail unit biopsy may be considered in refractory cases. Potential treatment options for traumatic neuromas include surgical excision, corticosteroid injection, neurolysis, or expectant management. In this case, observation was recommended, as the green nail syndrome resolved following the nail biopsy. If the onycholysis does not fully resolve in the future, however, the patient would be at risk of recrudescence of green nail syndrome.

Nail disorders

A total of 127 patients (27.1%) in the overall population, including 94 patients (29.6%) in the 20-mg every day population had nail disorders (Table 2), most of which were treatment related in both populations (96.9% and 96.8% of patients, respectively). Common diagnoses of nail disorders (preferred terms) in the overall population included onycholysis (8.1%), nail disorder (7.9%), paronychia (5.8%), and nail discoloration (5.5%). Five (1.1%) patients in the overall population had a grade 3 nail disorder [reported as nail disorder, onychalgia, onychomadesis (all n = 1), and paronychia (n = 2); all treatment related]. In the overall population, median times to onset for any-grade and grade ≥3 nail disorders were 78 and 127 days, respectively (Fig. 1A and B ; Table 3). In the 20-mg every day population, median times to onset were 85 and 156 days, respectively. Of the 5 patients with a grade 3 nail disorder, events resolved to grade ≤2 in three cases, and to grade 1 in two cases. Median time to resolution to grade ≤2 and grade 1 was 28 days and not reached, respectively.

Management of nail disorders involved dose modifications, patient education on preventive nail care strategies, and the use of topical steroids, antibacterials, and emollients. In the 20-mg every day population, 74 (23.3%) patients received ≥1 supportive medication for nail disorders (Table 4), including analgesics (n = 52, 16.4%), systemic antibacterials (n = 25, 7.9%), topical corticosteroids (n = 17, 5.3%), topical antifungals (n = 17, 5.3%), and emollients (n = 14, 4.4%). Dose interruptions and reductions for the management of nail disorders were reported in 4.1% and 3.1% of patients, respectively, in the 20-mg every day population (Table 4). One patient discontinued treatment due to grade 2 onycholysis.

### Therapeutic recommendations for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis in the US [^aa7bb584]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis affects around 14% of individuals in North America and Europe and is undertreated. Treatment is challenging as toenail growth can take 12&ndash;18 months, the nail plate may prevent drug penetration, and disease recurrence is common. National guidelines/consensus documents on onychomycosis diagnosis and treatment were last published more than 5 years ago and updated medical guidance is needed.

Methods

This document aims to provide recommendations for the diagnosis and pharmaceutical treatment of toenail onychomycosis following a roundtable discussion with a panel of dermatologists, podiatrists, and a microbiologist specializing in nail disease.

Results

There was a general consensus on several topics regarding onychomycosis diagnosis, confirmatory laboratory testing, and medications. Onychomycosis should be assessed clinically and confirmed with microscopy, histology, and/or culture. Terbinafine is the primary choice for oral treatment and efinaconazole 10% for topical treatment. Efinaconazole can also be considered for off-label use for maintenance to prevent recurrences. For optimal outcomes, patients should be counseled regarding treatment expectations as well as follow-up care and maintenance post-treatment.

Conclusions

This article provides important updates to previous guidelines/consensus documents to assist dermatologists and podiatrists in the diagnosis and treatment of toenail onychomycosis. J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(10):1076-1084. doi:10.36849/JDD.6291.

### The role of dermocosmetics in the management of cancer-related skin toxicities: international expert consensus [^a4f9ac9d]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Photosensitivity

Sun exposure and ultraviolet (UV) light can exacerbate skin toxicities, including rash and xerosis. UVA has a major role in this setting, and it is important to educate patients about the need to use broad-spectrum sunscreen with UVA (covering long UVA wavelengths: 330–450 nm) and UVB filters along with good sun protection (clothing, hats, UV films on windows). In addition, sun exposure can lead to pigmentation changes in dark-skinned patients. If the patient finds sunscreen irritating, sunscreens with physical blocks such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide can be used.

Skin/nail changes

Anticancer treatments can cause nail changes by affecting the rapidly dividing matrix cells of the nail plate. Nail changes are common with cytotoxic therapy, EGFR inhibitors, and radiotherapy (Table 1); they are usually—but not always—transient and resolve with discontinuation of therapy. They often occur after 1–2 months of treatment and can include onycholysis, paronychia, and changes in pigmentation/texture. While some nail changes have primarily a cosmetic aspect, others may cause significant pain. This toxicity has a high psychological impact and can be difficult to treat. Patients should be educated about the potential for nail changes, including a discussion about preventive measures such as minimizing pressure, trauma, and friction on the nails. Irritants such as frequent or prolonged water exposure, aggressive manicures, nail biting, and artificial nails should be avoided during treatment. Generally, nail toxicities are managed conservatively and do not require drug withdrawal. However, discontinuation may be needed in severe cases. Application of a nail polish to protect the nails as well as liquid bandages have been used to prevent nails from breaking.

### Tavaborole [^9e4e2250]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy and safety of tavaborole topical solution was evaluated in two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled trials. Tavaborole topical solution or vehicle was applied once daily for 48 weeks in subjects with 20% to 60% clinical involvement of the target toenail, without dermatophytomas or lunula (matrix) involvement.

A total of 1194 subjects (795 tavaborole topical solution, 399 Vehicle) 18 to 88 years of age, 82% male, 84% white, participated in these two trials. Efficacy assessments were made at 52 weeks following a 48-week treatment period.

The Complete Cure efficacy endpoint included negative mycology (negative KOH wet mount and negative fungal culture) and Completely Clear Nail (no clinical evidence of onychomycosis as evidenced by a normal toenail plate, no onycholysis, and no subungual hyperkeratosis). Efficacy results from the two trials are summarized in Table 2.

### A head-to-head comparison of ixekizumab vs. guselkumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: 24-week efficacy and safety results from a randomized, double-blinded trial [^f3d975b1]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Head‐to‐head studies are valuable in understanding the differences between therapies. Both interleukin (IL)‐17 and IL‐23p19 inhibitors are highly effective treatments for moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis. 1, 2 The interim 12‐week results of the IXORA‐R head‐to‐head study demonstrated that patients treated with the IL‐17A inhibitor ixekizumab showed more rapid achievement of fully clear skin than patients treated with the IL‐23p19 inhibitor guselkumab. 3 More rapid relief of itch and skin pain, the most bothersome symptoms indicated by patients, was noted in patients on ixekizumab vs. guselkumab. 3, 4

Twenty‐five per cent of patients with psoriasis have coexisting nail psoriasis with pitting, onycholysis, subungual hyperkeratosis, splinter haemorrhages and/or dystrophy. 5 More than a cosmetic concern, nail psoriasis can be painful and physically impairing. 5, 6 Nail psoriasis is also strongly associated with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), occurring in 80% of patients with PsA. 7 Given their structure and rate of growth, nails are often more difficult to treat than skin, taking longer to respond to therapy. 5, 8 With total skin clearance as the treatment goal, this status should include clearance in all types of psoriasis and conditions associated with it, as residual psoriasis in visible areas can negatively impact quality of life. 9 Here, we build on the initial 12‐week report of IXORA‐R, 3 presenting not only the 24‐week skin and nail clinical outcomes but also patient‐reported outcomes and safety results from this study.

### Onychomycosis: treatment and prevention of recurrence [^068e245b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, nondermatophytes, and yeast, and is the most common nail disorder seen in clinical practice. It is an important problem because it may cause local pain, paresthesias, difficulties performing activities of daily living, and impair social interactions. The epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation and diagnosis of onychomycosis were discussed in the first article in this continuing medical education series. In this article, we review the prognosis and response to onychomycosis treatment, medications for onychomycosis that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and off-label therapies and devices. Methods to prevent onychomycosis recurrences and emerging therapies are also described.

### Congenital malalignment of the great toenail and onychomadesis in monozygotic twins [^7958836e]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Most nail pathologies are slow healing and can be complicated to treat. Beau lines occur when the matrix ceases to produce nail keratin and the nail moves distally, resulting in depressions or breaks in the integrity of the nail plate. Complete shedding of the nail occurs when the nail plate distal to the Beau line separates from the nail bed (Fig 2).

Fig 2 
Deep sulci and complete matrix arrest were associated with onychomadesis.

Onychomadesis of various causes is related to the arrest of nail matrix growth (Table I). In CMGT, lateral displacement of the nail apparatus causes recurrent, shearing microtrauma to the nail matrix that would not occur in properly aligned toenails. As such, CMGT increases the risk of various forms of nail dystrophy, including paronychia, retronychia, onycholysis, onychogryphosis, and onychocryptosis. We report that the identical genetically determined malalignment of the 4 toenails in the twins that was associated with weight gain and activities of daily living during pubescence, increases the strain on the nail matrix causing recurrent arrest of the matrical growth. This results in horizontal nail depressions (Beau lines) and, ultimately, onychomadesis.

Table I 
The causes of onychomadesis and their relationship with temporary stunting of nail matrix growth

Efforts to prevent onychomadesis include minimization of trauma, treatment of any underlying systemic disease, and discontinuation of inciting medications such as chemotherapy. In CMGT, the shearing forces produced with normal ambulation probably cannot be prevented by measures such as avoiding ill-fitted shoes and choosing shoes with a wide toe box. Despite this, careful attention to properly sized and fitted footwear is mandatory to reduce the risk of secondary complications. Surgical options include removal and reimplantation of the nail matrix.In adults with recurrent onychomadesis and onychogryphosis, complete phenol nail matrixectomy may be required. Generally, surgical options become a priority only when patients become symptomatic with recurrent infection and painful onychocryptosis.

This rare case shows a clear association between CMGT and onychomadesis. The extended period of the necessary treatment window and the imperfect nature of the available preventive treatment make it difficult to establish whether the patients will benefit from our suggestions.

### Severe onycholysis and eyelash trichomegaly in a patient treated with erdafitinib [^67abaab2]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Increasing use of FGFR inhibitors will likely be seen, as 7.1% of all cancer types harbor mutations in this pathway,and knowledge of their class-specific side effects will be essential for optimized patient treatment. Fortunately, these toxicities are akin to those seen with other anticancer therapeutics, and management can be modeled as such. For instance, eyelash hypertrichosis, hirsutism, and trichomegaly are characteristic of targeted therapies such as epidermal growth factor receptor, B type rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma kinase, and multikinase (MKI) inhibitors.Although these changes typically regress after treatment termination, inward lash curling puts patients at risk for keratitis, and eyelash trimming may be required.Interestingly, classical targeted therapy–associated nail changes such as paronychia and pyogenic granuloma are less archetypal of FGFR -induced nail toxicities, and these more closely resemble chemotherapy-related, specifically taxane-related, changes including onycholysis, onychomadesis, and nail bed superinfection.Antiseptic soaks are recommended in both prophylaxis and management, with the addition of topical or systemic antibiotics or antifungals if superinfection is present.

Aside from clinical trial data, to our knowledge, there are no similar reports of erdafitinib-induced dermatologic toxicities. However, 2 cases of patients on alternative FGFR inhibitors with analogous dermatologic manifestations have been described.Additionally, a case of erdafitinib-induced hyperphosphatemia and resultant calcinosis cutis was reported,and awareness of this drug-specific cutaneous manifestation remains of equal importance. This case enriches the spectrum of dermatologic toxicities associated with targeted anticancer therapies and continued documentation of drug-specific manifestations remains important as use of erdafitinib increases.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy and safety of tavaborole topical solution was evaluated in two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled trials. Tavaborole topical solution or vehicle was applied once daily for 48 weeks in subjects with 20% to 60% clinical involvement of the target toenail, without dermatophytomas or lunula (matrix) involvement.

A total of 1194 subjects (795 tavaborole topical solution, 399 Vehicle) 18 to 88 years of age, 82% male, 84% white, participated in these two trials. Efficacy assessments were made at 52 weeks following a 48-week treatment period.

The Complete Cure efficacy endpoint included negative mycology (negative KOH wet mount and negative fungal culture) and Completely Clear Nail (no clinical evidence of onychomycosis as evidenced by a normal toenail plate, no onycholysis, and no subungual hyperkeratosis). Efficacy results from the two trials are summarized in Table 2 .

### Nail cosmetics: a dermatological perspective [^8ea7d1cb]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Nail cosmetics are used by millions worldwide and the variety of products available is expanding. They are relatively safe, but complications can occur, and patients experiencing complications may present to dermatologists. The physical processes can cause nail thinning and onycholysis, poor technique can promote infection, and consumers may develop allergic contact dermatitis. Ultraviolet nail lamps are widely used for curing gel nails, but their use is unregulated and they are readily accessible in salons or for home use. There is concern about potential carcinogenesis; however, the risk is negligible and can be further reduced with the use of sunscreen. Despite the potential complications, nail cosmetics may be a useful adjunct in treating nail disorders. Familiarity with the procedures will enable the dermatologist to recognize problems and advise on safe use.

### Challenge of nail psoriasis: an update review [^e861e1ac]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Nail psoriasis is a refractory disease that affects 50-79% skin psoriasis patients and up to 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The pathogenesis of nail psoriasis is still not fully illuminated, although some peculiar inflammatory cytokines and chemokines seems to be the same as described in psoriatic skin lesions. Psoriatic nail involving matrix can cause pitting, leukonychia, red spots in lunula, and nail plate crumbling, while nail bed involvement can result in onycholysis, oil-drop discoloration, nail bed hyperkeratosis, and splinter hemorrhages. The common assessment methods of evaluating nail psoriasis includes Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), Nail Assessment in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (NAPPA), Nail Psoriasis Quality of life 10 (NPQ10), and so on. Treatment of nail psoriasis should be individualized according to the number of involving nail, the affected site of nail and presence of skin and/or joint involvement. Generally, topical therapies are used for mild nail psoriasis, while biologic agents such as etanercept are considered for severe nail disease and refractory nail psoriasis. Even though the current literature has shown some support for the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, or therapies of nail psoriasis, systemic review of this multifaceted disease is still rare to date. We elaborate recent developments in nail psoriasis epidemiology, pathogenesis, anatomy, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and therapies to raise better awareness of the complexity of nail psoriasis and the need for early diagnosis or intervention.

### Ciclopirox (Ciclodan) [^2270672f]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be used as a component of a comprehensive management program for onychomycosis. Removal of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, by a health care professional, weekly trimming by the patient, and daily application of the medication are all integral parts of this therapy. Careful consideration of the appropriate nail management program should be given to patients with diabetes (see PRECAUTIONS).

Nail Care By Health Care Professionals

Removal of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, trimming of onycholytic nail, and filing of excess horny material should be performed by professionals trained in treatment of nail disorders.

Nail Care By Patient

Patients should file away (with emery board) loose nail material and trim nails, as required, or as directed by the health care professional, every seven days after Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), is removed with alcohol.

Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be applied once daily (preferably at bedtime or eight hours before washing) to all affected nails with the applicator brush provided. The Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be applied evenly over the entire nail plate.

If possible, Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be applied to the nail bed, hyponychium, and the under surface of the nail plate when it is free of the nail bed (e.g., onycholysis).

The Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should not be removed on a daily basis. Daily applications should be made over the previous coat and removed with alcohol every seven days. This cycle should be repeated throughout the duration of therapy.

### A prospective randomized controlled trial of hydrating nail solution for prevention or treatment of onycholysis in breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant / adjuvant docetaxel chemotherapy (...) [^54db723a]. ASCO (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract 10108 Background: Onycholysis and other nail toxicities occur in approximately 20-30% of breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel chemotherapy. Onycholysis, the separation of the nail plate from nail bed, is also often associated with painful paronychia decreasing patients’ the efficacy of a hydrating nail solution for the prevention and treatment of D-induced onycholysis and nail toxicities. Methods: This study is a prospective randomized controlled study of hydrating nail solution for prevention or treatment of onycholysis in patients with BC receiving neo/adjuvant 3-weekly D after doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide. In experimental arm, each patient painted hydrating nail solution on nails and periungual areas once a day till developing onycholysis grade 2 or more. After Gr 2 onycholysis development, patients painted EVONAIL twice a day regardless of treatment arms.

The primary endpoint is the incidence of onycholysis Gr 2 or more and recovery rate from Gr2 onycholysis. The secondary endpoints include: the incidence of all grade onycholysis; duration from first docetaxel treatment until onycholysis symptom appearance; degree of pain from nail toxicities; the incidence of other nail toxicities. Results: Since Aug 2015 to May 2016, 103 patients were enrolled and completed this study: 51, control arm: 52). Of 103 patients, 25 cases of Gr1 and 22 of Gr2 onycholysis were observed ): 8 and 7 in E, 17 and 15in C, respectively). Hydrating nail solution resulted in statistically significant reduction of Gr2 onycholysis compared to C and all grade onycholysis decreased in experimental arm with statistical significance. However, the effect of onycholysis treatment was not observed.

### Sterile matrix grafting for onycholysis in the setting of valproic acid use [^fcad7356]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Patients with nail deformities seek treatment of both cosmetic and functional deformities. The nail not only contributes to the overall aesthetics of the hand but is also involved in function, including fine pinch, pulp stability, and dorsal protection.

Anticonvulsant medications, including VPA, have been linked to various nail deformities including hyperpigmentation and onychodystrophy.One such deformity, onycholysis, or separation of the nail plate from the nail bed, in association with VPA use has been described in several case reports.The authors speculate that onycholysis formed secondary to a disturbance of zinc metabolism caused by a combination of sodium valproate–induced malabsorption and systemic chelation of zinc.A second such deformity is onychomadesis, or separation of the nail plate from the proximal nail fold with shedding of the nail plate. A study by Poretti et aldescribes onychomadesis 4 years after initiation of VPA. Lastly, changes in nail pigment have been found in association with VPA therapy.

Although the aforementioned nail deformities have been said to resolve after discontinuation of VPA, treatment of these deformities is challenging when the cessation of VPA is not medically advisable.

Previous attempts to replace the nail matrices with skin or dermal grafts have been unsuccessful.A large body of literature supports good functional and cosmetic outcomes of free nail matrix grafts in the treatment of nail avulsion injuries.The use of a sterile matrix graft from the great toe has been found to help the nail regain the smooth and adherent qualities of a normal-appearing nail.

Our patient presented with a thickened and scarred sterile matrix, which resulted in formation of a dorsal pterygium and onycholysis, findings that have been substantiated in the literature.Our surgical approach stemmed from the principle that a normal sterile matrix is required for nail adherence and growth. Therefore, we first excised the area of scarred sterile matrix and subsequently harvested a sterile matrix graft from the great toe for use in reconstruction of our defect. This surgical approach follows the central plastic surgery tenant of replacing like tissue with like tissue while inflicting little donor site morbidity.

### Onychotillomania: diagnosis and management [^2bb0876a]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Onychotillomania, defined as self-induced trauma to the nail unit, either by picking or pulling at the nails, affects 0.9% of the population. It may lead to severe irreversible nail dystrophy, melanonychia, or infections. Although no large clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of treatments, cognitive-behavioral therapy, physical barrier methods, and pharmacological treatments have shown some benefits in case reports. The objective of this article is to review the prevalence, diagnostic criteria, etiology, historical and physical examination findings, pathological features, and current treatment methods. Onychotillomania remains a clinical challenge to dermatologists, pediatricians, internists, and psychiatrists in practice, as there are no evidence-based treatment methods.

### Foot care in epidermolysis bullosa: evidence-based guideline [^1f1b1b88]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

This guideline was designed to provide service providers and users with an evidence‐based set of current best practice guidelines for people and their families and carers, living with epidermolysis bullosa. A systematic literature review relating to the podiatric care of patients withwas undertaken. Search terms were used, for which the most recent articles relating to podiatric treatment were identified from as early as 1979 to the present day, across seven electronic search engines:, Wiley Online Library, Google Scholar, Athens, ResearchGate, Net and PubFacts.com. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodology was used. The first guideline draft was analysed and discussed by clinical experts, methodologists and patients and their representatives at four panel meetings. The resulting document went through an external review process by a panel of experts, other healthcare professionals, patient representatives and lay reviewers. The final document will be piloted in three different centres in the U.K. and Australia. Following ancommunity international survey the outcomes indicated six main areas that the community indicated as a priority to foot management. These include blistering and wound management, exploring the most suitable footwear and hosiery for, management of dystrophic nails, hyperkeratosis (callus), maintaining mobility and fusion of toes (pseudosyndactyly). The evidence here is limited but several interventions currently practised by podiatrists show positive outcomes.

### Onychomycosis to fungal superinfection: prevention strategies and considerations [^97f52011]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is the most common fungal skin infection, and it is frequently seen in the setting of other concomitant fungal infections, the most common being tinea pedis. Infected nails become a reservoir of fungal organisms that may infect the skin, and vice versa. Early, effective treatment of the nails is necessary for preventing not only permanent structural damage but also the spread and superinfection of the surrounding skin and soft tissue. Moreover, treatment of the skin is important for preventing re-infection of the nails.

### Onychodystrophy associated with dupilumab therapy for atopic dermatitis [^5cdf8c7f]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Many inflammatory diseases of the skin, including psoriasis, lichen planus, vitiligo, and alopecia areata, have associated nail changes. The reported nail abnormalities in AD include those involving the nail matrix, such as transverse grooves, nail pitting, trachyonychia, leukonychia, onychoschizia, onychomadesis, and melanonychia secondary to melanocytic activation. Additionally, nail dystrophy affecting the nail bed, including onycholysis, koilonychia, and brachyonychia, has also been reported. Regional eczematous changes of the skin around the nails may contribute to nonspecific inflammation of the nail matrix, which interrupts nail matrix formation. Thus, periungual inflammation may contribute to nail dystrophy in addition to the isolated inflammation of the nail unit.

Among the thousands of patients treated with dupilumab in clinical trials, there are no reports of any associated nail changes, although a case of dupilumab-associated resolution of median canaliform dystrophy of Heller has been reported.Future real-world phase IV studies may reveal a small subset of AD patients with nail dystrophy that is affected by dupilumab intervention as both a potential cause of the nail dystrophy and therapy for the nail changes associated with AD. It is difficult to determine from our single patient whether dupilumab therapy resulted in a tissue-specific adverse event or whether dupilumab altered the local cytokine milieu, leading to a transient upregulation of type 1 helper cytokines, resulting in psoriasiform nail changes. We hypothesize that dupilumab therapeutically reduced the nail unit inflammation, resulting in acute nail changes that eventually resolved with the continued dupilumab therapy, allowing the nail to grow out normally. Thus, in this 1 patient, dupilumab may have both initiated the nail changes due to a transient alteration of the local cytokine milieu and treated the nail changes by reducing the nail unit inflammation over time. Dupilumab may be a biologic therapy that treats eczematous nails, just as biologics can be used to treat nail psoriasis. It is important to include a broad differential diagnosis when examining an AD patient with nail changes, including, but not limited to, trauma, local nail infections, and systemic infections associated with the nail changes, which were not evident in our patient. More work is needed to characterize the nail changes in AD patients and determine whether the nail changes are due to type 2 inflammation and whether therapeutic intervention in AD results in improved nail outcomes.

### Subungual exostosis of the hand: a case report in a 5-year-old boy and literature review [^9bca647d]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

The treatment for SE is surgical removal, with the most common complications after removal being onycholysis or recurrence. Recurrence is thought to occur when too much of the lesion is left behind, while onycholysis occurs when the nail bed has been overly violated. There is not an agreed-upon method of removal, although several techniques have been described in the literature. Malkoc et aldescribed the removal of the nail and an “L” shaped incision through the nail bed with the removal of the mass and suturing the nail bed and nail back down. They did not report any cases of onycholysis or recurrence. Others have reported using different surgical approaches based on the appearance of the lesion. A fish-mouth approach is used for lesions that did not destroy the nail bed, and a direct approach with nail plate removal was used if the lesion involved the nail bed. Basar et aldid not report any recurrences or cosmetic defects with this dichotomous approach to surgical removal. On the other hand, Suga et alreported that most of their patients who received a direct approach sustained onycholysis postoperatively, while two of their fish-mouth approaches had recurrence of their SE.De Cambra et aldescribed a case report in which they performed a direct approach to remove an SE lesion followed by negative pressure therapy to aid in healing the surgical wound. They described no onycholysis or recurrence. In this case report, we also used a more direct approach to the SE lesion, given its protruded position and placement over the nail plate. The patient ended with a good cosmetic result, without onycholysis, and did not have a recurrence of the lesion at their most recent follow-up. However, 6 weeks is a short period for recurrence to occur in a slowly growing mass, and the literature is sparse on the rate of recurrence. However, it was observationally noticed by Miller-Breslow et althat most of their recurrences occurred within the first year. Given that the patient did not return for a follow-up after 6 weeks, a phone call was made at approximately 10 months post-operatively. Per the mothers report, there was no recurrence and still a good cosmetic result.

### Onycho-pachydermo periostitis: ixekizumab as a therapeutic option [^f5509da5]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Psoriatic onycho-pachydermo periostitis (POPP) is an uncommon form of psoriasis characterized by psoriatic nail abnormalities, connective tissue thickening, and periostitis of the distal phalanges, leading to a “drumstick” deformity. A diagnosis requires the presence of all 3 of these features. POPP can be highly painful and often leads to significant functional impairment.Treatment remains a challenge. We report the first documented case of POPP that demonstrated a partial clinical response to adalimumab, with further improvement following treatment with ixekizumab.

### Advances in topical and systemic antifungals [^81e471cd]. Dermatologic Clinics (2007). Low credibility.

Topical antifungal agents are generally used for the treatment of superficial fungal infections unless the infection is widespread, involves an extensive area, or is resistant to initial therapy. Systemic antifungals are often reserved for the treatment of onychomycosis, tinea capitis, superficial and systemic candidiasis, and prophylaxis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. With the development of resistant fungi strains and the increased incidence of life-threatening invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, some previously effective traditional antifungal agents are subject to limitations including multidrug interactions, severe adverse effects, and their fungistatic mechanism of actions. Several new antifungal agents have demonstrated significant therapeutic benefits and have broadened clinicians' choices in the treatment of superficial and systemic invasive fungal infections.

In several trials, SC demonstrated efficacy in preventing chemotherapy-induced hair loss and may work better for patients receiving certain chemotherapies such as anthracyclines. Additionally, prolonged post-infusion SC has been associated with better outcomes.

A few other studies investigated techniques such as the use of topicals and hair washing practices to prevent hair loss during chemotherapy. A study in patients with alopecia secondary to chemotherapy demonstrated that topical 2% minoxidil significantly reduced the period of baldness. A novel topical containing a blend of four botanical ingredients (citrus, cocoa, guarana, and onion) was shown to increase hair density and thickness compared to baseline after 6 months of use. Various hair washing techniques have not demonstrated any significant difference in hair loss compared to control. Although avoidance of hair dye is a common recommendation, we did not find any articles that referenced hair dye or other chemicals.

Nail care

Nail toxicity has been a well-documented complication of chemotherapy, particularly that of taxane use, causing both functional impairment and psychological distress. Two studies investigated the use of cryotherapy to prevent docetaxel-induced hand and nail toxicity with conflicting results. While one trial with 41 patients found that onycholysis and skin toxicity were significantly reduced in the frozen glove protected hand, another trial with 21 patients found no significant difference between cutaneous hand toxicity in the gloved and non-gloved hands. Further studies are needed to investigate whether cryotherapy can be used as an effective intervention to reduce taxane-induced nail and skin toxicity.

Morrison et al. investigated 2 interventions compared to standard of care for taxane-induced nail toxicity in women with early breast cancer. Standard of care included lifestyle and hand hygiene practices aimed to prevent nail infection and damage including wearing household gloves when using chemicals, nail filing rather than cutting, and moisturizing hands around the fingernails. Two interventions included nail coverings (painting nails with dark nail varnish thought to prevent UV-induced damage) and Onicolife, a nail-specific medical advice consisting of anti-inflammatory and antiseptic compounds to protect tender and fragile nails). Compared to the use of dark nail varnish, standard care and the specialized Onicolife nail drops and nail oil were significantly associated with less nail toxicity.

### Onycholysis (...) [^4a9e309d]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

A classification of onycholysis has been reviewed. It is suggested that etiology be appended where possible, and the term ``idiopathic onycholysis'' be used in its true sense. Cultural studies revealed that similar organisms were found under normal as well as abnormal nails with the possible exception of Candida albicans. Histologic studies of nail clippings were feasible in determining the presence or absence of microbial invasion of the nail plate. Therapy consisting of clipping away the affected nail, cleansing, and applying an antimicrobial and antifungal agent was successful in healing 16 of 27 cases. The present study recognizes that other antimicrobial agents of sufficiently wide range could be equally successful when combined with thorough debridement and cleansing of the involved nail areas.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^7ac302c2]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Candida colonization is not rare in intertriginous regions of patients with psoriasis. Practitioners should also be aware that symptoms of intertriginous psoriasis can be similar to those of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and both of these conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with vulval pruritus, inflammation, and erythema. Notably, it is prudent to consider intertriginous psoriasis in prepubescent girls because chronic VVC is uncommon in this population. In a chart review of prepubertal girls with chronic vulvitis, Fischer observed that 71 % (27/38) had signs of psoriasis on skin examination, and no patients had evidence of VVC.

Nail onycholysis is a common finding in patients with Candida infections, and also in patients with plaque or pustular psoriasis. Patients who develop psoriatic nail deformities (e.g. pitting, oil spots, or thickening/crumbling of the nail plate) are at increased risk for developing comorbid opportunistic onychomycosis because the compromised nail bed creates an environment where fungi can thrive. Zisova and colleagues found that 62 % (141/228) of patients with psoriasis-related nail changes tested positive for fungal agents and, in 24 % (34/141) of these cases, Candida spp. were identified as causative agents (predominantly C. albicans). Patients with the highest Nail Psoriasis Severity Index scores were most likely to test positive for Candida colonization. However, anticandidal treatment has not been shown to eliminate fingernail onycholysis, and the frequent isolation of Candida from onycholytic nails in patients with psoriasis may be due to the close functional proximity of the fingers to the vaginal and gastrointestinal tract, which commonly harbor C. albicans. In these patients, nail onycholysis may be most effectively improved by treating the underlying nail psoriasis. Typically, specific treatment for onycholytic nails is not necessary unless the patient experiences functional disability.

### Therapies for psoriatic nail disease. A systematic review [^5c580283]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Nail involvement is common in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, affecting 80%-90% of patients at some time. It also has significant effects on quality of life. Psoriatic nail disease can be refractory to treatment, and different features may respond variably to different therapies. The lack of standardized outcome assessments hinders the interpretation of available data. In this systematic evidence-based review of the literature, we assess various treatments for psoriatic nail disease.

### Baseline nail disease in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and response to treatment with infliximab during 1 year [^0c00e917]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Although nail psoriasis occurs frequently in patients with psoriatic skin lesions, effective treatments are limited.

Objective

Occurrence of nail psoriasis by type and incidence of nail clearance using the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index were evaluated.

Methods

This was a 50-week, phase III study in which 378 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis were randomized 4:1 to infliximab (5 mg/kg) or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 6, and every 8 weeks through week 46, with placebo crossover to infliximab at week 24.

Results

Of the 373 evaluated patients, 305 (81.8%) had baseline nail psoriasis. The right thumbnail was most often the worst involved nail, and pitting and onycholysis were the most common lesions. Among patients with baseline nail psoriasis, 6.9%, 26.2%, and 44.7% in the infliximab group had nail disease clearance at weeks 10, 24, and 50, respectively, versus 5.1% in the placebo group at week 24 (P < .001). Mean percent improvements in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index score at weeks 10 and 24 were 26.8% and 57.2%, respectively, in the infliximab group versus -7.7% and -4.1%, respectively, in the placebo group (both P < .001). At week 24, mean percent improvements in nail matrix and nail bed features were 52.9% and 69.2%, respectively (vs -1.9% and 18.4% for placebo; P < .001).

Limitations

The study did not evaluate nail response beyond 1 year.

Conclusions

Patients with psoriasis receiving infliximab experienced marked and sustained nail improvement.
