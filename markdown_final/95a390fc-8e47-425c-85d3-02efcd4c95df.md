## Question

Non rebreather mask

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the non-rebreather mask, specifically its mechanism, performance, indications, limitations, and how it compares with alternatives across settings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the device's design and intended function. Then, I should verify the delivered FiO2 and how it varies with flow and fit. Next, I will review validated indications and guideline-backed protocols. After that, I need to examine limitations, safety issues, and aerosol considerations. Finally, I will compare the NRB with alternatives like HFNC, BVM, and NIV, and close with practical, setting-specific recommendations and a concise synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism and construction. A non-rebreather mask is a low-flow, high-concentration oxygen delivery system with a one-way valve that prevents exhaled gas from entering the reservoir, and side valves that allow room air entrainment only if the reservoir empties. The reservoir bag must remain inflated to maintain high FiO2, which requires adequate oxygen flow and a reasonably tight seal, so I need to ensure both are present during use [^111z8g1z] [^116B8kgz].

> I should double-check the delivered oxygen concentration. With a tight seal and flows around 10–15 L/min, an NRB can deliver approximately 60–80% FiO2, and in some bench and volunteer studies, even higher fractions approaching 85–97% have been observed when using a three-valve design, tight fit, and 15 L/min. However, in real-world patients with variable leaks, measured FiO2 averages closer to 65%, so I need to be cautious not to overestimate performance in clinical practice [^111z8g1z] [^113ScYgE] [^116eDSwW] [^114QZY39].

> Next, I should review validated indications. For cluster headache, high-quality guidelines recommend 100% oxygen at greater than 12 L/min for about 15 minutes via a non-rebreather mask as first-line abortive therapy, and this is consistently reflected in neurology guidance as well, so I can confidently anchor this indication [^114d22yY] [^113QAXup] [^114jgnGs]. For acute hypoxemia without hypercapnic risk, emergency oxygenation should start with a reservoir mask at 15 L/min and then be titrated down to maintain SpO2 94–98% once stabilized, which aligns with BTS guidance and supports the NRB as initial high-concentration therapy in critical illness [^111uzeny]. For preoxygenation before intubation, NRB with high or flush-rate oxygen is acceptable, though NIV may outperform it in hypoxemic patients; I should confirm that NRB achieves adequate denitrogenation in about 90 seconds in healthy volunteers, which supports its practicality when NIV is unavailable [^114nM4DU] [^114SwJLB]. In carbon monoxide poisoning, 100% oxygen via NRB is standard to accelerate COHb dissociation, even when pulse oximetry appears misleadingly normal, so I should not rely on SpO2 alone in that context [^1125RzCV] [^111oLrvW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal superiority. I need to check limitations and safety. The NRB is less effective than BVM or NIV for preoxygenation in many studies, particularly when leaks occur; in a randomized volunteer study, BVM achieved higher FeO2 than NRB, and in a large RCT of critically ill adults, NIV preoxygenation reduced hypoxemia during intubation compared with an oxygen mask strategy, so device choice should be individualized to hypoxemia severity and resources [^113ptrfS] [^114nM4DU]. For ongoing hypoxemic respiratory failure, HFNC generally provides more consistent FiO2, better comfort, and may reduce intubation rates compared with conventional oxygen masks in some contexts, so I should consider HFNC when available and appropriate, while recognizing that NRB remains a viable alternative when HFNC is not accessible [^112oHXH1] [^111b1EFe] [^111nBYHT]. Regarding aerosolization, I initially thought NRB might be high risk, but wait, let me verify; mannequin and volunteer studies suggest minimal added aerosol with NRB compared with ambient levels, though real infectious risk depends on fit, leaks, and local ventilation, so standard precautions and source control remain essential [^116B8kgz].

> I will now examine comparative performance across devices. In sealed bench models, NRB generally delivers higher FiO2 than simple or partial rebreather masks, but a double-trunk mask can outperform NRB, especially with leaks. In volunteer studies, oropharyngeal FiO2 with NRB sits around 76–86% depending on sampling location and seal, reinforcing that real-world performance is device- and fit-dependent [^115b12Bu] [^1163jiRY] [^116eDSwW]. For preoxygenation, NRB with flush-rate oxygen reaches adequate end-tidal oxygen in about 90 seconds in healthy subjects, but BVM and NIV can achieve higher FeO2 and may better protect against desaturation during intubation, so I should tailor the method to patient risk and available equipment [^114SwJLB] [^113ptrfS] [^114nM4DU].

> Let me consider setting-specific guidance. In resource-limited environments, NRB is a practical high-concentration option that consumes substantial oxygen. Pairing with awake prone positioning can improve oxygenation without increasing oxygen demand, and careful titration to SpO2 92–96% helps conserve supply while avoiding both hypoxemia and hyperoxia, so I should integrate these strategies when HFNC or NIV are unavailable [^114QgkNX] [^116B8kgz]. In prehospital care, NRB is standard for trauma, suspected CO poisoning, and hypoxemia, with escalation to BVM or advanced airways as needed, and prehospital guidelines emphasize early high-flow oxygen while minimizing interruptions to compressions during cardiac arrest, which supports NRB use as an initial bridge [^117ASE1f] [^111oLrvW] [^112mHsr2].

> But wait, what if the patient is at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure. I should confirm that NRB can worsen CO2 retention in susceptible patients due to high FiO2 and limited ventilatory support; in such cases, a Venturi mask with controlled FiO2 or NIV is preferred to balance oxygenation and ventilation, so I need to screen for COPD or other hypoventilation risks before committing to high-concentration oxygen via NRB [^111uzeny].

> Next, I should review practical operational details. To maximize FiO2 with an NRB, I need to ensure the reservoir bag remains fully inflated, set flows at least 10–15 L/min, and achieve the best feasible facial seal. If the bag collapses during inspiration, I should increase the flow or check for leaks, and if prolonged use causes dryness or discomfort, I should consider humidification or an alternative interface when appropriate [^116B8kgz] [^116iKg7e]. For preoxygenation, leaving the oxygen device in place until the moment of apnea helps preserve oxygen reserves, as removal leads to rapid loss of preoxygenation within roughly 20–40 seconds, so I should avoid premature disconnection [^1141gknQ].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing critical is missing. The non-rebreather mask is a low-flow, high-concentration oxygen delivery device that, with adequate flow and a good seal, typically delivers 60–80% FiO2 and can approach higher fractions under ideal conditions; it is first-line for cluster headache abortive therapy, initial high-concentration oxygenation in acute hypoxemia, and an acceptable preoxygenation method when NIV is unavailable, but it is generally outperformed by BVM or NIV for preoxygenation and by HFNC for ongoing hypoxemic respiratory support, so device selection should be individualized to indication, severity, and resources [^114d22yY] [^111uzeny] [^114nM4DU] [^112oHXH1].

The non-rebreather mask (NRB) delivers **high FiO2 (up to ~90%)** [^113ScYgE] at 10–15 L/min [^1163jiRY] and is indicated for **severe hypoxemia** [^111uzeny], cluster headache [^114d22yY], and preoxygenation before intubation [^114SwJLB]. It is not appropriate for hypercapnic respiratory failure because of the risk of CO2 retention [^111uzeny]. Key limitations include variable FiO2 with leaks [^1163jiRY], discomfort, and aerosol generation [^notfound]; use a tight seal, keep the reservoir bag inflated, and monitor for CO2 retention. For hypoxic COVID-19 patients, NRB is a viable alternative when HFNC is unavailable [^111nBYHT], but HFNC may offer better oxygenation and comfort [^112ppHAV].

---

## Design and function

- **Structure**: The NRB consists of a face mask with one-way valves, a reservoir bag, and tubing connected to an oxygen source [^111z8g1z].

- **Mechanism**: The one-way valves prevent exhaled gases from re-entering the reservoir, allowing delivery of high-concentration oxygen [^111z8g1z].

- **Oxygen delivery**: Typically delivers 60–90% FiO2 at flow rates of 10–15 L/min, depending on mask fit and patient factors [^111z8g1z] [^116B8kgz].

---

## Clinical indications

- **Severe hypoxemia**: Used in acute respiratory distress, trauma, and other critical conditions requiring high-concentration oxygen [^111uzeny].

- **Cluster headache**: High-flow oxygen via NRB is a first-line acute treatment [^114d22yY] [^113QAXup].

- **Preoxygenation**: Used before intubation to increase oxygen reserves and prolong safe apnea time [^1132tqmi] [^114SwJLB].

---

## Advantages

Advantages include **high FiO2 delivery** — achieving 60–90% oxygen concentration [^notfound] — and **rapid correction of hypoxemia**, making it effective for severe cases [^111uzeny]. The device is **simple to use**, requiring minimal training, and is widely available in most healthcare settings [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and risks

- **Variable FiO2**: Leaks or improper fit can significantly reduce delivered oxygen concentration [^1163jiRY].

- **Discomfort**: Tight-fitting masks can cause discomfort, skin irritation, and claustrophobia [^116iKg7e].

- **Aerosolization**: Risk of aerosol generation, particularly concerning in infectious diseases like COVID-19 [^116B8kgz].

- **Hypercapnia**: Not suitable for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other hypercapnic conditions due to risk of CO2 retention [^111uzeny].

## Comparison with other oxygen delivery devices

| **Attribute** | **Non-rebreather mask** | **High-flow nasal cannula (hfnc)** | **Bag-valve mask (bvm)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| FiO2 delivery | 60–90% [^notfound] | 21–100% | 40–60% |
| Comfort | Moderate discomfort [^notfound] | High comfort [^112ppHAV] | Moderate discomfort |
| Aerosolization risk | Moderate [^notfound] | Low [^116Afv6q] | High |
| Clinical use | Severe hypoxemia, cluster headache, preoxygenation [^111uzeny] [^114d22yY] [^1132tqmi] | Acute respiratory failure, COVID-19 [^111b1EFe] | Cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **BTS guidelines**: Use reservoir masks at 15 L/min for severe hypoxemia, adjusting to maintain target saturations [^111uzeny].

- **Cluster headache guidelines**: Recommend high-flow oxygen via NRB for acute treatment [^114d22yY] [^113QAXup].

- **Preoxygenation**: NRB is acceptable for preoxygenation, but bag-valve mask or non-invasive ventilation may be superior in certain scenarios [^114SwJLB] [^114nM4DU].

---

## Special considerations in COVID-19

In COVID-19, NRB is a viable alternative when HFNC is unavailable, with **similar short-term oxygenation outcomes** [^111nBYHT]. HFNC may offer **better oxygenation and comfort** than NRB [^112ppHAV] [^111b1EFe]. Aerosolization risk necessitates strict infection control measures [^116B8kgz].

---

## Practical tips for effective use

- **Proper fit**: Ensure a tight seal to minimize leaks and maximize FiO2 delivery [^113ScYgE].

- **Reservoir inflation**: Keep the reservoir bag inflated at all times [^116B8kgz].

- **Flow rate**: Use 10–15 L/min, adjusting based on patient response and oxygen saturation [^111uzeny].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and signs of CO2 retention [^notfound].

---

The non-rebreather mask is a valuable tool for delivering high-concentration oxygen in acute care settings, particularly for severe hypoxemia, cluster headache, and preoxygenation. While effective, it requires careful attention to fit, flow, and patient factors to minimize risks and maximize benefits.

Management

Management of cluster headache is broadly divided into acute and preventive; furthermore, there are novel neuromodulation devices that can be used for either (figure 1).

Acute treatment for cluster headache attacks

The evidence-based acute treatments for cluster headaches are subcutaneous sumatriptan, intranasal sumatriptan and zolmitriptan, high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask and, in episodic cluster alone, non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS). Double-blinded randomised control studies are effective in stopping attacks within 15 min have found the following for subcutaneous sumatriptan, high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask and nVNS, and within 30 min for intranasal sumatriptan and zolmitriptan(see table 1 for cost comparison). Oxygen is especially useful in patients who have more than two attacks a day, although is sometimes less convenient than sumatriptan. In the UK, prescribing oxygen prescription requires completion of a home oxygen order forms; part A is for static cylinders and part B is a restricted document for home oxygen assessment and review services, paediatric and other specialist teams and is used to order ambulatory oxygen. Before submitting the home oxygen order form part A, you must obtain patient consent using the initial home oxygen risk mitigation tool and home oxygen consent form.

### Please wear a mask: a systematic case for mask wearing mandates [^115fpi14]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

3.3 The objection from indeterminate risk holds that MWM are unjustified on the alleged ground that policy makers typically lack the information required to determine what risks are imposed by maskless (vs masked) interactions and so are unable to assess the justifiability of engaging in maskless (vs masked) interactions. The objection proceeds as follows. The justifiability of engaging in maskless interactions in indoor settings where physical distancing is infeasible crucially depends on what risks are imposed by such activity compared with the available alternatives (eg, engaging in masked interactions). However, the risks that maskless (vs masked) interactions impose on the involved individuals plausibly vary depending on what reference class one uses to characterise these individuals (objective accounts of probability) and on those individuals' assessments of such risks (subjective accounts of probability). Moreover, policy makers lack non-arbitrary criteria to identify privileged reference classes and individuals' assessments. Hence, policy makers lack the information required to determine what risks are imposed by maskless (vs masked) interactions. As a result, policy makers are unable to assess the justifiability of engaging in maskless (vs masked) interactions.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) titration — nasal airflow obtained from a thermistor or thermocouple under the PAP mask is not acceptable for apnea/hypopnea detection. The recommendation states: "Nasal Airflow Obtained from a Thermistor or Thermocouple Placed Under the PAP Mask is not an Acceptable Method for Detecting Apneas or Hypopneas (Consensus)". Supporting context notes, "An oronasal thermal sensor is the preferred primary sensor to detect absence of airflow for identification of an apnea during diagnostic (non-PAP) PSG", and that "the placement of this sensor under a PAP mask for detection of airflow is not recommended".

Administer high-flow oxygen via NRB (non-rebreather) as a precaution, consider an oral airway if the patient is unable to maintain the airway, and avoid a nasal airway with significant facial injury or possible basilar skull fracture. Use BVM (bag-valve-mask) ventilation if HFO/NRB is inadequate, and place a supraglottic airway or perform endotracheal intubation if BVM ventilation is ineffective or the airway is continually compromised. Endotracheal intubation (ETI)/supraglottic airway (SGA) should only be used in systems that have continuous EtCO2 monitoring.

### Oxygenation thresholds for invasive ventilation in hypoxemic respiratory failure: a target trial emulation in two cohorts [^116m4Kht]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design, setting, and oversight

This retrospective cohort study was structured as a target trial emulation (Additional file 1: Table e1). The study incorporated two deidentified patient-level databases of intensive care unit admissions: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) and the Amsterdam University Medical Centers database (AmsterdamUMCdb). MIMIC-IV includes 76,540 ICU admissions from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre (BIDMC) in Boston, USA (2008–2019), and AmsterdamUMCdb includes 23,106 ICU admissions from Amsterdam University Medical Centers (Amsterdam UMC) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands (2003–2016). MIMIC-IV included more patients and a more comprehensive set of potential confounders, so it was used for the primary analysis while AmsterdamUMCdb was used for the secondary analysis. The University of Toronto research ethics board approved the protocol (#42,081). The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist is in the Additional file 1: (§1).

Cohort

Patients became eligible when they were first documented to be receiving oxygen with inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) of 0.4 or more via non-rebreather mask, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV), or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), within 24 h of ICU admission. We excluded patients with prior invasive ventilation during the same ICU admission, goals of care precluding invasive ventilation, ICU admission from the operating room, or a tracheostomy. Patients were also excluded when equipoise was less certain at the moment of eligibility, defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) motor component of less than 4, or a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 60 or more with pH of 7.20 or less. Patients were not excluded if these characteristics developed during the follow-up period, after initial inclusion. Wherever oxygen flow was available but FiO2 was not (for example, non-rebreather masks), FiO2 was estimated using the validated equation: FiO₂ = 0.21 + (oxygen flow in liters per minute)×0.03. Further details are available in Additional file 1: (§4, Table e2).

### Use of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and risk factors for high-flow nasal cannula oxygen failure in critically-ill patients with COVID-19 [^116c9Sgz]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This retrospective study was conducted in a 24-bed ICU of a French university hospital. The study was approved by the Ethics committee of the Société de Réanimation de Langue Française (CE SRLF 20–72). Informed consent was waived but all patients or next of kin were informed about the study. The study complied with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement guidelines.

We included all consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 pneumoniae admitted to our ICU in the first (March–May 2020) and second (August 2020- February 2021) French pandemic waves. All patients required at least 5 L/min of oxygen flow rate to achieve an arterial oxygen saturation ≥ 92%, delivered through a non-rebreather face mask. All patients had a positive real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs or pulmonary samples. Vaccination against COVID-19 had not yet started during the study period. All patients with a decision to withdraw life-sustaining therapy, including do-not-intubate orders, were excluded.

Ventilatory management and respiratory measurements

In patients with HFNC (Optiflow®, Fisher and Paykel, Healthcare), oxygen was humidified by a heated humidifier and then applied continuously through large-bore binasal prongs. The gas flow rate was set at 60 L/min. The FiO 2 was initially set at 100% and then adjusted to maintain SpO 2 ≥ 92% and not higher than 96%. HFNC was always used as first-line ventilatory support and was administered all day long until recovery or patients met criteria of intubation. The ROX index was calculated six hours after HFNC initiation, as it has been shown that patients with a 6-h ROX index ≥ 4.88 were less likely to be intubated, while patients with a 6-h ROX index < 3.47 were more likely to had HFNC failure.

### Comprehensive clinical phenotyping of nitroglycerin infusion induced cluster headache attacks [^115vf44F]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Phenotypic characterisation

Every 5 minutes, subjects were asked to rate their pain level from a scale from no pain, mild, moderate to severe, where severe equates to their most severe attack, and they were asked a questionnaire of non-headache symptoms and cranial autonomic symptoms (CAS) (Figure 1). If the subject experienced pain, further details were obtained regarding the location and characteristic. Beyond the cluster headache attack, subjects were asked to report any other headache types and in particular NTG headache, which has been well described from migraine studies. The NTG headache was assessed for severity, phenotype, accompanying non-headache symptoms and duration. Subjects were actively encouraged to report any symptoms as and when they developed. Following the infusion, at 10 minute intervals, any developments in pain, non-headache symptoms and CAS were recorded for a total of 120 minutes after the infusion, based on the latency period reported from previous studies (Table 1).

Figure 1.
Questionnaire for non-headache and cranial autonomic symptoms.

B: bilateral; R: right-sided; L: left-sided.

Single-blinded NTG and placebo infusions

During the two single-blinded visits, subjects either received intravenous nitroglycerin at 0.5 µg/kg/min over 20 minutes or an equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride at the same rate over 20 minutes, followed by the same 120 minutes of observations (Figure 2). The sequence was pre-determined using the randomise function in Excel; however, the investigator was able to amend this in certain situations if the subject was episodic and due to finish their bout.

Figure 2.
Outline of events from open unblinded nitroglycerin visit.

BP: blood pressure; CAS: cranial autonomic symptoms; NTG: nitroglycerin; IV: intravenous.

Treatment of acute attacks

Acute treatment was administered at 20 minutes from the start of attack either with sumatriptan 6 mg subcutaneous injection (Imigran 6 mg/0.5 mL solution for injection pre-filled syringes, GlaxoSmithKline UK Ltd, or sumatriptan 6 mg/0.5 mL solution for injection pre-filled pens, Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Europe B.V.) or with 15 L/min oxygen via a non-rebreather mask (O2Star™ non-rebreather oxygen mask M/L, Dräger). The visit was concluded only when the subject was pain free.

### A review of the current and potential oxygen delivery systems and techniques utilized in cluster headache attacks [^116xnazf]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Despite oxygen therapy being one of the foremost acute treatments for cluster headache (CH) attacks, little is known about the different techniques and systems.

Objectives

In this review we will examine the efficacy of the standard non-rebreather mask (NRM) with room temperature oxygen in relieving pain in CH, and try to compare it with the diversity of other oxygen gas conditions and interfaces like partial rebreathers, simple masks, nasal cannulas, tusk masks, demand valve oxygen, hyperbaric and cooled oxygen.

Method

We searched non-structured Pubmed, Medline, the Cochrane online database and instruction protocols from various oxygen delivery devices.

Conclusions and Implications

Interfaces like demand valves and tusk masks are already proving to be superior or at least similar to the standard NRM in terms of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), though the demand valve only showed better results than the NRM in a single study in only four participants. Furthermore, new research shows how lower temperatures of the gas may be an essential part of effective pain relief and hyperbaric treatments show potential in preventing night time attacks.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of adult patients with oxygen in the acute care setting [^116iKg7e]. Respiratory Care (2022). High credibility.

Humidification of oxygen and comfort outcomes — there is a lack of high-level evidence that humidity impacts patient outcomes or adverse events, and most evidence centers on patient comfort. In a prospective crossover study comparing high-flow face mask with bubble humidification versus heated humidification (HH), subjects reported less discomfort when HH was used, and the oxygen delivery system using HH scored more favorably on the dryness scale and was preferred. One study (N = 30) measuring nasal airway caliber by acoustic rhinometry failed to document a difference between HFNC and conventional oxygen therapy; blinded evaluation showed significantly greater nasal dryness in the standard oxygen group, subjects judged nasal dryness better with HFNC, other domains (mouth/throat dryness, dysphagia, throat pain) were not significantly different, and subjects noted a significant overall subjective preference for HFNC despite device noise. In randomized adults after cardiac surgery, HFNC at 45 L/min versus a non-rebreathing mask at 15 L/min yielded more satisfaction (P < .001), less mucus dryness (P = 0.003), and fewer instances of nasal bleeding (P = 0.36).

Oxygen delivery interfaces.

A non-rebreather mask is a safe interface in supplemental oxygen therapy in COVID-19 patients as these masks help limit the dispersion of droplets. Human mannequin studies show that the maximum exhaled dispersion distance at 10 L/minute is < 10 cm, suggesting that this modality generates the least dispersed aerosols. Non-rebreather masks can reach FiO 2 of > 85% at flow rates approaching 15 L/minute. To prevent hypercapnia, the reservoir bag must remain inflated at all times; this requires flow rates of at least 8–10 L/minute. The use of non-rebreather masks usually requires oxygen via a piped system within the hospital.

High flow nasal oxygen, characterized as devices providing oxygen with flows from 20 to 70 L/minute, and NIV may reduce the need for intubation, and could improve outcome in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. In LMICs where the options for respiratory support can be severely limited, especially the first interface could be the best alternative. Several practical considerations need to be mentioned, though. First, patients should be closely monitored so that they can be intubated quickly when gas exchange worsens, or in case of increased work of breathing. Delayed intubation was associated with adverse outcomes and high failure rates in patients with the Middle East respiratory syndrome. Second, there may be more aerosol formation, which could increase the risk of viral transmission, although this may be limited when correct interfaces are used. Simulation studies suggest that surgical masks placed over the HFNO interface may reduce exhaled air dispersion (Figure 1). Also, during NIV, strict control of any air leak is recommended, and if a single limb circuit is used, a viral filter should be placed on the exhalation port of the mask (Figure 1).

### Oropharyngeal oxygen concentration is dependent on the oxygen mask system and sampling location [^116eDSwW]. Respiratory Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous oxygen delivery systems are used to treat hypoxemia. It is unknown if F IO2 at the lips predicts oropharyngeal F IO2 for various oxygen mask systems. We tested whether F IO2 measurements differed between the lips and oropharynx, and whether this difference depends on the mask system.

Methods

Ten healthy volunteers had one sampling catheter positioned at the lips and another catheter in the oropharynx. F IO2 was sampled at each location while the subjects breathed normal tidal volumes with oxygen at 15 L/min via 4 delivery devices: a simple mask, a non-rebreather mask, a face mask with a diffuser that concentrates and directs O 2 toward the mouth and nose (mask with diffuser), and a closed mask with a Jackson-Rees circuit. Data were analyzed by using a linear mixed model to account for subject crossover in the repeated measures design.

Results

F IO2 levels differed significantly for the 4 delivery mask systems (P < .001) and by sampling catheter location (P < .001). Differences in mean F IO2 between the lips and the oropharynx were observed for the mask with diffuser (difference 0.30, 95% CI 0.25–0.36; P < .001), and non-rebreather mask (difference 0.09, 95% CI 0.04–0.15; p = 0.001). The mean F IO2 at the oropharynx was highest for the closed mask (0.97, 95% CI 0.92–1.00), followed by the non-rebreather mask (0.76, 95% CI 0.72–0.81), simple mask (0.62, 95% CI 0.58–0.67), and the mask with diffuser (0.51, 95% CI 0.46–0.56). At the lips, the mean F IO2 was highest for the closed mask (0.97, 95% CI 0.92–1.00), followed by the non-rebreather mask (0.86, 95% CI 0.81–0.90), OxyMask (0.81, 95% CI 0.76–0.86), and simple mask (0.67, 95% CI 0.62–0.71).

Conclusions

With high oxygen flows and normal tidal volume breathing, F IO2 measurements obtained at the oropharynx or at the lips depended on the device used, with the mask with diffuser showing the most significant discrepancies. F IO2 measures at the oropharynx and the lips were only consistent for the closed mask system. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT02523586.).

### Comparison of pharyngeal oxygen delivery by different oxygen masks… [^111z8g1z]. ClinicalTrials (2015). Low credibility.

Study Overview The intent of this study is to determine the difference in pharyngeal oxygen concentration in patients who have a natural airway using commonly available oxygen delivery systems. The simple mask is commonly used in the immediate postoperative setting for supplemental oxygen. Several small holes on either side of the mask as well as the imperfect seal allow room air to be entrained and exhaled air to escape from the mask. Simple masks can provide 35–50% FiO2 at flow-rates 5–10 L/min. 1 Long-term use of masks can lead to skin irritation and pressure sores. The partial rebreather consists of a simple mask with a reservoir bag, and provides 40–70% FiO2 at flow-rates 6–10 L/min. 1 The partial rebreather is no longer used at many hospitals because the range of oxygen delivery can be encompassed by the simple mask and the non-rebreather.

The non-rebreathing mask is similar to the partial rebreather but includes one-way valves that prevent exhaled air from returning to the reservoir bag. The non-rebreather can deliver 60–80% FiO2 at 10–15 L/min.

1. **Measurement of FiO2**: It has been established that FiO2 achieved with nasal cannula does not differ significantly whether the subject breathes through their mouth or nose. This property has not been established for masks. With a closed mask, FiO2 achieved would also be the same regardless of mouth or nose-breathing. The subject will not be instructed whether to use their nose or mouth to breathe, since patients in the hospital typically not instructed which way to breathe. Afterward, testing of the various oxygen masks will be performed with oxygen set at high flow through simple mask, non-rebreather mask, OxyMask, and anesthesia mask with headstrap and Jackson Rees circuit.

Exclusion Criteria:

- Acute cardiopulmonary disease, as defined by blood pressure greater than 150/90, HR greater than 120 and room air oxygen saturation less than 92.
- Allergy to lidocaine or adhesive tape
- History or physical exam finding of nasal polyps
- Currently taking oral or parenteral anticoagulant medications
- History of frequent nose bleeds
- Current symptoms of nasal congestion
- Physical examination findings of rales or wheezing
- Facial hair that prevents forming a seal with an anesthesia mask.

### High-flow oxygen therapy versus facemask preoxygenation in anticipated difficult airway management (PREOPTI-DAM): an open-label, single-centre, randomised controlled phase 3 trial [^1161ZTHn]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

This is the first randomised clinical trial comparing HFNC with facemask for the preoxygenation of adults with anticipated difficult intubation. This trial has some limitations. During COVID-19 pandemic, physicians preferred not to use HFNC to avoid virus aerosolization. The recruitment period was therefore longer than expected, raising financial issues. Hence, the interim analysis which was planned to adjust the sample size according to the incidence of the primary outcome, was cancelled. Consequently, the incidence of the primary outcome which is poorly reported in the literature was lower than expected in the control group and therefore altered the power of the study. Moreover, the hypothesis of a 12% reduction of the primary outcome in the HFNC group may have been overestimated. The sample size and the single-centre design may have underestimated the treatment effect and could limit generalisation of the results. The unblinded preoxygenation device could have interfered with the results. Nevertheless, blinding would have required combining both of the devices which was not feasible, especially in the fiberoptic stratum. The choice of the primary outcome is questionable: current guidelines advise interrupting the intubation attempt to focus on oxygenation (i.e. bag-mask ventilation) as soon as SpO 2 drops below 95% during intubation. In order not to underestimate the primary outcome, bag-mask ventilation which could avoid desaturation, regardless of the preoxygenation device, was also included in the primary outcome. Bag-mask ventilation for rescue oxygenation can lead to serious complications (i.e.g.astric insufflation, regurgitation). Oxygen desaturation below 95% or rescue bag-mask ventilation during difficult intubation is therefore a patient-centred outcome. This parameter is not as accurate as the measurement of oxygen partial pressure (PaO 2) to assess patient oxygenation, especially because the reduction of EtCO 2 in the HFNC group could have shifted to the right the haemoglobin saturation curve and bias SpO2. However, it is a non-invasive and a mandatory standard of monitoring during all anaesthesia, available worldwide. Given the limitations of SpO 2 measurement, an external observer was specifically dedicated to SpO 2 monitoring to improve data collection. In addition, systematic arterial catheterisation to measure PaO 2 could not be ethically justified for scheduled non-bleeding surgery. In the HFNC group, EtO 2 monitoring at the end of the preoxygenation was not feasible (i.e. non-occlusive device) which hindered the comparison of patients between groups at the end of the preoxygenation period. Moreover, the incidence of leakage during preoxygenation in the HFNC may have been underestimated since it could only be objectively quantified in the facemask oxygen group. The mechanism of the expected benefit of HFNC during laryngoscopic and fiberoptic intubation is different. Hence, analysing these 2 strata together could limit interpretation of results. However, the risk of unbalancing groups was limited by stratification of the randomisation.

### Non-rebreather mask and low-flow nasal cannula vs high-flow nasal cannula in severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the emergency department [^111nBYHT]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

To assess the effectiveness of non-rebreather mask combined with low-flow nasal cannula (NRB + NC) compared to high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in improving oxygenation in patients with COVID-19-related hypoxemic respiratory failure (HRF).

Methods

This retrospective study was conducted in emergency departments of two tertiary hospitals from June 1 to August 31, 2021. Consecutive patients aged > 18 years admitted for COVID-19-related HRF (World Health Organization criteria: confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia with respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, or peripheral oxygen saturation < 90% on room air) requiring NRB + NC or HFNC were screened for enrollment. Primary outcome was improvement of partial pressure arterial oxygen (PaO 2) at two hours. Secondary outcomes were intubation rate, ventilator-free days, hospital length of stay, and 28-day mortality. Data were analyzed using linear regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) based on propensity score.

Results

Among the 110 patients recruited, 52 (47.3%) were treated with NRB + NC, and 58 (52.7%) with HFNC. There were significant improvements in patients' PaO 2, PaO 2 /F IO2 ratio, and respiratory rate two hours after the initiation of NRB + NC and HFNC. Comparing the two groups, after IPTW adjustment, there were no statistically significant differences in PaO 2 improvement (adjusted mean ratio [MR] 2.81; 95% CI -5.82 to 11.43; p = .524), intubation rate (adjusted OR 1.76; 95% CI 0.44 to 6.92; p = .423), ventilator-free days (adjusted MR 0.00; 95% CI -8.84 to 8.85; p = .999), hospital length of stay (adjusted MR 3.04; 95% CI -2.62 to 8.69; p = .293), and 28-day mortality (adjusted OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.15 to 2.98; p = .608).

Conclusion

HFNC may be beneficial in COVID-19 HRF. NRB + NC is a viable alternative, especially in resource-limited settings, given similar improvement in oxygenation at two hours, and no significant differences in long-term outcomes. The effectiveness of NRB + NC needs to be investigated by a powered randomized controlled trial.

### Effects of supplemental oxygen on cardiovascular magnetic resonance water proton relaxation time constant measurements (T, tand T*) [^113CQRoD]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To study, the effects of supplemental oxygen on the measurement of native cardiovascular water proton relaxation time constants using commercially available protocols.

Methods

T 1, T 2 and T 2 * relaxation time constant mapping were performed in twelve volunteers at 1.5 T breathing room air and supplemental oxygen supplied by nasal cannula and a non-rebreather mask. Regions-of-interest were drawn for quantitative measurements in the bloodpool of each ventricle and atria as well as septal myocardium. The effects of supplemental oxygen were investigated statistically using a mixed model analysis of variance. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility were assessed using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient and Coefficient of Variation.

Results

Blood T 1 relaxation time constants in the left ventricle (T 1 change = -241.0 ms) and left atrium (T 1 change = -247.0 ms) decreased significantly in every subject after oxygen inhalation with a non-rebreather mask (p < 0.001). No significant changes of T 1 in the right side of the heart were detected after oxygen inhalation with the non-rebreather mask (p = 0.345). Oxygen inhalation with nasal cannula did not significantly change blood T 1 in the study (p = 0.497). No significant changes in myocardial T 1 (p = 0.390), T 2 (p = 0.960) or T 2 * (p = 0.438) were observed with supplemental oxygen supplied by nasal cannula or the non-rebreather mask. Results were similar in mid-short-axis and horizontal long-axis acquisitions.

Conclusion

Supplemental oxygen does not affect myocardial relaxation time constant measurements with current protocols. On the other hand, blood T 1 measurements with the inhalation of supplemental oxygen supplied by a non-rebreather mask change significantly and could affect myocardial tissue characterization if used for the calculation of extracellular volume. Additionally, current relaxation time constant mapping protocols do not reproducibly detect myocardial T 1 changes with supplemental oxygen inhalation.

### A recruitment maneuver increases oxygenation after intubation of hypoxemic intensive care unit patients: a randomized controlled study [^111zck6F]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Study design

The design of the study is shown in Figure 1. During the pre-inclusion period (at least 10 minutes to a maximum of 30 minutes), each patient wore a high FiO 2 mask, driven by 10 to 15 L/min oxygen, and was randomly assigned to the control or RM group. Preoxygenation was performed for a three-minute period before standardized rapid-sequence intubation. Preoxygenation employed a non-rebreather bag-valve mask driven by 15 L/min oxygen. Patients were allowed to breathe spontaneously, with occasional assistance (the usual preoxygenation method). For patients who had received ineffective treatment with NIV before enrolment in the study, preoxygenation was performed with NIV. Standardized rapid-sequence intubation (ketamine 2 mg/kg; succinylcholine 1 mg/kg; laryngoscopy with a Macintosh size 3 or 4 blade, and cricoid pressure to secure the airway) was performed by a senior physician. For patients who had been preoxygenated with NIV, pressure support ventilation was delivered by an ICU ventilator (Evita II Dura ventilator; Dräger, Lübeck, Germany; or a Servo 300 instrument; Siemens, Solna, Sweden). Intubation conditions were reported using an intubation difficulty scale. After oral intubation, each patient was mechanically ventilated, with a tidal volume of 6 to 8 mL/kg, a respiratory rate of 20 to 25 breaths/minute, a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH 2 O, and an FiO 2 of 100%.

### Managing cluster headache [^113amBKw]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Is the demand-valve oxygen system useful?

The demand-valve oxygen system has a valve that allows oxygen to flow when the patient inhales and closes after inhalation. The device has the benefit of supporting hyperventilation. In a single-blind, semirandomised, placebo controlled, crossover study, the primary end point of pain relief at 15 min was not significant, when compared with the simple mask and the O 2 ptimask (a specialised non-rebreather mask with a 3 L reservoir, where dilution of oxygen is minimised). Patients, however, preferred the demand-valve oxygen system and one can argue lower oxygen consumption with it. While more research is clearly needed, many patients are very clear about its benefit and we see no downside to its use.

Interim treatment options

Patients may use interim measures while waiting for a preventive treatment to have therapeutic effect; such measures may also help patients with episodic cluster headache with short bouts. Although oral prednisolone is often used, this should be with caution given its long list of side effects and the cyclical pattern of cluster headache. Patients with episodic cluster headache require at least annual or biannual courses for a long period of time.

To avoid the cumulative side effects of corticosteroid, we prefer to perform a unilateral greater occipital nerve block, using 80 mg of methylprednisolone with 2 mL of 2% lidocaine. This reduces frequency, severity of headaches, sometimes sufficient to carry patients through their bout. On average, the effects can last 4 weeksand a greater occipital nerve injection can be repeated in 3 months.

### Oxygen therapy in suspected acute myocardial infarction [^112XKgeu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study DETO2X-AMI was published by Hofmann R and colleagues in 2017 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In the DETO2X-AMI study, the trial question was: what is the effect of routine oxygen therapy in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction who do not have hypoxemia at baseline? In the DETO2X-AMI study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the DETO2X-AMI study, the population was: 6629 patients (2023 female, 4606 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction and an oxygen saturation of ≥ 90% on pulse oximetry. The key exclusion criteria were patients receiving ongoing oxygen therapy, presenting with cardiac arrest or had a cardiac arrest between presentation and enrollment. In the DETO2X-AMI study, the interventions were: n = 3311 oxygen therapy (supplemental oxygen at 6 L/min for 6–12 hours through an open face mask) n = 3318 no supplemental oxygen. In the DETO2X-AMI study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in all-cause death at 1 year (5% vs. 5.1%; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.21). In the DETO2X-AMI study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the rate of rehospitalization with myocardial infarction within 1 year (3.8% vs. 3.3%; HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.46). In the DETO2X-AMI study, the conclusion was: in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction and an oxygen saturation of ≥ 90% on pulse oximetry, oxygen therapy was not superior to no supplemental oxygen with respect to a all-cause death at 1 year.

### Oxygenation thresholds for invasive ventilation in hypoxemic respiratory failure: a target trial emulation in two cohorts [^111MtJSu]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

The primary analysis included 3,357 patients from MIMIC-IV (Additional file 1: Figure e9). The median age was 65 (interquartile range (IQR) 58 to 79) years and 45% (1,500) were women (Table 1). Most (63%) were admitted to a medical or surgical ICU. At eligibility, 16% (536) were using HFNC, 14% (483) NIV, and 70% (2,338) non-rebreather masks. The median baseline SF was 148 (IQR 136 to 174). Within 28 days, 896 patients (26.7%) received invasive ventilation and 745 patients (22.2%) died. Mortality was 17.7% in patients who did not receive invasive ventilation and 34.5% in patients who received invasive ventilation.

### Non-invasive oxygenation support in acutely hypoxemic COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU: a multicenter observational retrospective study [^114cf2bU]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-invasive oxygenation strategies have a prominent role in the treatment of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While the efficacy of these therapies has been studied in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the clinical outcomes associated with oxygen masks, high-flow oxygen therapy by nasal cannula and non-invasive mechanical ventilation in critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients remain unclear.

Methods

In this retrospective study, we used the best of nine covariate balancing algorithms on all baseline covariates in critically ill COVID-19 patients supported with > 10 L of supplemental oxygen at one of the 26 participating ICUs in Catalonia, Spain, between March 14 and April 15, 2020.

Results

Of the 1093 non-invasively oxygenated patients at ICU admission treated with one of the three stand-alone non-invasive oxygenation strategies, 897 (82%) required endotracheal intubation and 310 (28%) died during the ICU stay. High-flow oxygen therapy by nasal cannula (n = 439) and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (n = 101) were associated with a lower rate of endotracheal intubation (70% and 88%, respectively) than oxygen masks (n = 553 and 91% intubated), p < 0.001. Compared to oxygen masks, high-flow oxygen therapy by nasal cannula was associated with lower ICU mortality (hazard ratio 0.75 [95% CI 0.58–0.98), and the hazard ratio for ICU mortality was 1.21 [95% CI 0.80–1.83] for non-invasive mechanical ventilation.

Conclusion

In critically ill COVID-19 ICU patients and, in the absence of conclusive data, high-flow oxygen therapy by nasal cannula may be the approach of choice as the primary non-invasive oxygenation support strategy.

### Evidence-based guideline for prehospital airway management [^115ZpRQo]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2024). High credibility.

NASEMSO Model Clinical Guideline — general steps in airway management: Implement airway management interventions in an escalating fashion to meet patient-centered goals of care, recognizing that situations are often dynamic and that reassessments and decisions must be iterative, and that attention to foundational steps may be effective and remove the need for more advanced techniques. For oxygenation, administer oxygen for hypoxemia and titrate to a target SpO2 of 94–98%, which depending on patient presentation may be accomplished with nasal cannula, non-rebreather, BVM, or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV); even in apneic patients with a pulse, starting passive oxygenation while escalating interventions are implemented may be useful, and maximal oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula or face mask at highest flow should be provided during CPR and pre-oxygenation prior to invasive airway management attempts. For airway patency, open, position, and maintain a patent airway as needed: patients with severe dyspnea should be left in their position of comfort whenever possible; provide head tilt/chin lift or jaw thrust if concern for potential spinal injury unless contraindicated; and recognize that patient positioning can significantly impact respiratory mechanics.

### Personal protective effect of wearing surgical face masks in public spaces on self-reported respiratory symptoms in adults: pragmatic randomised superiority trial [^1177An43]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Primary outcome

Overall, 163 (8.9%) participants in the intervention arm and 239 (12.2%) in the control arm self-reported respiratory symptoms. In the intention-to-treat analysis, which used the prespecified multiple imputation via chained equations analysis and included data from 4575 participants, the estimated effect on the primary outcome of self-reported respiratory symptoms was in favour of the face mask intervention (odds ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.87; P = 0.001; absolute risk difference −3.2%, 95% CI −5.2% to −1.3%; P < 0.001) (table 3). The complete case analysis (n = 3801) supported the findings of the main analysis (odds ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87; P < 0.001; absolute risk difference −3.3, 95% CI −5.2 to −1.3; P < 0.001). Supplementary material, tables 5 and 6 provide details of the adjusted analysis and relative risks. The results from the adjusted analysis were essentially identical to those of the main unadjusted analysis. The non-prespecified sensitivity analyses comparing different scenarios of the missing outcome data (table 3) suggest that the intervention was effective in scenarios 1 and 2 (odds ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.92; P = 0.006 and 0.79, 0.65 to 0.95; P = 0.01, respectively) but not in scenario 3 (0.85, 0.70 to 1.03; P = 0.08). The Manski-type bounds (table 3) covered all possible missingness mechanisms and therefore included large beneficial and detrimental effects.

### Rapidly improving acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19: a multi-centre observational study [^1152JeCr]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Data collection and study groups

We collected data on demographics, comorbidities, usage (and its duration) of high-flow nasal oxygen and non-rebreather mask prior to intubation, usage of non-invasive mechanical ventilation prior to intubation, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on day of intubation [the respiratory component of SOFA was calculated after the intubation, while the remaining SOFA components (namely, coagulation, hepatic, cardiovascular, neurologic and renal) were calculated prior to intubation], ventilator settings and lung mechanics on the day of intubation as well on the first day and second day following intubation. We also gathered information on variables, which might affect trajectory of hypoxemia, such as level of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and fluid balance along with general management of patients with ARDS (namely, steroids, prone positioning, neuromuscular blockade, inhaled nitric oxide and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation).

We categorized study patients into three groups. In accordance with previously reported definitions, the "rapidly improving ARDS" group consisted of patients extubated or having a PaO 2 :FiO 2 greater than 300 on the first day following intubation. The "persistent severe ARDS" group consisted of patients having a PaO 2 :FiO 2 of equal to or less than 100 on the second day following intubation as well as of patients who were not alive on the second day following intubation. The remaining patients comprised the "intermediate" group.

Study outcomes

Prevalence and ICU-mortality associated with rapidly improving ARDS and persistent severe ARDS among patients with COVID-19 were the primary outcomes of our study. Secondary outcomes were usage of vasopressors, vasopressor-free days, usage of continuous renal replacement therapy, continuous renal replacement therapy-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation among survivors, ventilator-free days and ICU-free days. Outcomes other than duration of mechanical ventilation were censored at day 28 following intubation. Patients discharged from ICU with unassisted breathing before 28 days considered to be alive at 28 days without needing vasopressors or continuous renal replacement therapy. Vasopressor-free days, continuous renal replacement therapy-free days, ventilator-free days and ICU-free days were calculated by the number of days in the first 28 days following intubation that a patient was alive and not receiving vasopressors, not receiving continuous renal replacement therapy, not on a ventilator or not in the ICU, respectively.

### Knowledge translation tools to guide care of non-intubated patients with acute respiratory illness during the COVID-19 pandemic [^112qu6o4]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive ventilation

Where experience exists, delivery of NIV using a helmet interface may offer reduced droplet spread, improved patient tolerance and efficacy over an oronasal mask. The helmet is connected to an ICU ventilator using conventional respiratory circuitry joining two port sites to allow inspiratory and expiratory flow. High flow and short inspiratory time are necessary to pressurize the helmet rapidly. As shown in Table 1, second generation helmets have negligible exhaled air dispersion due to a better seal at the neck.

Where helmets and/or expertise utilizing them are not available, an oronasal non-vented mask (rather than nasal interface) should be used. Proper mask fitting and seal is important for oronasal non-vented masks, to minimise droplet dispersion and maximize effectiveness. Where possible, use a ventilator with a dual limb circuit plus heat and moisture exchanger (HME) filter with a non-vented mask (no anti-asphyxia valve is needed) (see Fig. 2 a). Sequence of actions: put NIV interface on patient; then turn ventilator on; and turn ventilator off before removing NIV interface. If possible, do not use the device humidifier. Patients will require enhanced mouth care for dryness given increased airflow without humidification. If the patient has secretions with strong cough or is expected to require NIV for a prolonged period, device humidification may be needed and may be used with a dual limb circuit. Increased risk of aerosolization of virus-containing water droplets must be weighed against the risk of mucous plugging.

A single-circuit bi-level ventilator may need to be used if a dual circuit ventilator is not available or not tolerated. In this case, use a fitted oronasal non-vented mask plus anti-asphyxia valve with combined HME-viral/bacterial filter plus exhalation port. An anti-asphyxia valve is mandatory for use with a non-vented mask. The anti-bacterial/viral filter should be placed in the circuit between the mask and the exhalation port (see Fig. 2 b). Anti-bacterial/viral filters should be changed every 24 h or sooner if soiled as this may increase resistance to flow. Blocked filters can be mistaken for clinical deterioration, and this issue is remedied by changing filters. An external humidifier should not be used.

### High-flow nasal oxygen therapy compared with conventional oxygen therapy in hospitalised patients with respiratory illness: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111b1EFe]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Methods and materials

Search strategy and study selection

A comprehensive search was performed on 29 June 2021, and subsequently updated on 22 March 2023, for articles within the last 50 years across Embase, Medline via Ovid and CENTRAL databases. The full search strategy and keywords employed can be found in online supplemental table 1A–F. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021264837).

To meet inclusion criteria, studies had to evaluate HFNO in hospitalised adult patients (≥ 18 years) with acute respiratory illness necessitating oxygen therapy, indicating ARF. RCTs, cross-over studies and observational studies with an intervention and comparator group were included. Hospitalisation was defined as ED presentation or admission to an ICU or ward. HFNO was defined as flow rates > 20 L/min delivered via specialised high-flow devices and nasal cannulae. COT was defined as flow rates ≤ 15 L/min delivered via standard nasal cannulae, simple face mask, non-rebreather reservoir mask or venturi mask. Illnesses causing ARF (as defined by study authors and with or without hypercapnia) included upper and lower respiratory tract infections, COVID-19, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute exacerbations of a chronic respiratory illness, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, acute lung injury and transfusion-related acute lung injury. Studies examining patients with stable, chronic respiratory illnesses (without a concurrent acute exacerbation), with patients under 18 years old, comparing HFNO to non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) only or written in languages other than English were excluded.

The primary outcome for this review was hospital mortality rate, with secondary outcomes including short-term mortality (≤ 30 days), long-term mortality (> 30 days), escalation to IMV, escalation to NIV, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), changes in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) levels, disability as defined by study authors (eg, dyspnoea scores) and inpatient admission rates for studies evaluating patients in ED.

### A prospective, randomised trial of pre-oxygenation strategies available in the pre-hospital environment [^113ptrfS]. Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Pre-oxygenation before tracheal intubation aims to increase safe apnoea duration by denitrogenation of the functional residual capacity of the lungs, and increasing oxygen stores at the onset of apnoea. Pre-oxygenation options in the pre-hospital environment are limited due to oxygen availability and equipment portability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies available in this setting. This was a prospective, randomised, crossover study of 30 healthy volunteers who underwent 3-min periods of pre-oxygenation by tidal volume breathing with a non-rebreather mask, a bag-valve-mask and a portable ventilator. The primary outcome measure was fractional expired oxygen concentration of the first exhaled breath after each technique. The secondary outcome measure was ease of breathing, assessed using a visual analogue scale. The mean (95%CI) fractional expired oxygen concentrations achieved with the non-rebreather mask were 64 (60–68)%, bag-valve-mask 89 (86–92)% and portable ventilator 95 (94–96)%. Pre-oxygenation efficacy with the non-rebreather mask was significantly worse than with either the bag-valve-mask (p < 0.001) or ventilator (p < 0.001). No significant difference in ease of breathing was identified between the bag-valve-mask and ventilator, but both were perceived as being significantly more difficult to breathe through than the non-rebreather mask. We conclude that, in healthy volunteers, the effectiveness of pre-oxygenation by bag-valve-mask and portable ventilator was superior to pre-oxygenation with a non-rebreather mask, although the non-rebreather mask was easier to breathe through than the other pre-oxygenation devices.

### Non-invasive oxygenation support in acutely hypoxemic COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU: a multicenter observational retrospective study [^115sh3Kp]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has generated an unprecedented demand for intensive care resources to deliver supportive care using non-invasive oxygenation support and invasive mechanical ventilation. Large studies have provided data regarding baseline clinical characteristics of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU), the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients.

During the pandemic, patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure admitted to the ICU and not in need of emergent intubation of the trachea have mainly been treated with non-invasive oxygenation strategies. These methods include standard non-rebreather oxygen masks (oxygen mask), high-flow oxygen therapy administered through large-bore nasal cannulas (HFT), and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) techniques. The choice for using one type of oxygenation support over another has likely been based on local recommendations, personal experience, and availability of devices.

The difference of opinions regarding the optimal technique for non-invasive oxygenation support is ample, but the consequences and relevant clinical outcomes of the various usual care strategies in critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to an ICU remain unclear. Thus, our main objective was to evaluate the impact of three stand-alone non-invasive oxygenation strategies on intubation rates and ICU mortality at 90 days after admission of critically ill patients with COVID-19-associated acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. We hypothesized that the various non-invasive oxygenation support strategies had no impact on intubation and ICU mortality rates.

### Frequency and risk factors for failed weaning from supplemental oxygen therapy after general anesthesia at a postanesthesia care unit: a retrospective cohort study [^115KUeNF]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Protocol for weaning from supplemental oxygen and definition of failed weaning

During emergence from general anesthesia, neuromuscular blockade was reversed with pyridostigmine when the train-of-four count were 3 or greater, or sugammadex when the train-of-four counts were 2 or less. The attending anesthesiologist performed extubation after confirming the patient restored consciousness, muscle power, and spontaneous breathing. After successful extubation, patient was transferred to the PACU without oxygen administration.

Upon arrival at the PACU, the patient received supplemental oxygen at 10 L·min − 1 through a non-rebreather mask (Hudson RCI® High-Concentration Oxygen Mask, Teleflex, Morrisville, NC, USA) (Fig. 1). If the SpO 2 was maintained at > 98% for 10 min without any evidence of oxygenation impairment, we decreased the flow of supplemental oxygen to 5 L/min and maintained it for 10 min. If a patient showed sufficient oxygenation (SpO 2 > 98%) and stable hemodynamics, supplemental oxygen was discontinued. If the SpO 2 decreased below 92% in room air after the discontinuation of supplemental oxygen, the attending nurse encouraged the patient to perform forced deep breathing. If the SpO 2 was not maintained at over 92% despite more than three attempts to encourage forced breathing, the anesthesiologist in charge of the PACU resumed oxygen administration at a flow of ≥ 5 L/min through a non-rebreather mask. Patients who failed to wean from supplemental oxygen therapy were transferred to the general ward or the intensive care unit with oxygen supplementation and SpO 2 monitoring.

Fig. 1
Non-rebreather oxygen mask

We defined failed weaning from supplemental oxygen therapy as when SpO 2 was not maintained over 92% in room air after the discontinuation of supplemental oxygen administration.

Study outcome and measurements

The primary endpoint was the frequency of failed weaning from supplemental oxygen therapy in the PACU in adult patients who underwent general anesthesia. Potential cases of failed weaning from supplemental oxygen were identified through an electronic search of PACU medical records. All potential electronically identified cases were reviewed by two independent investigators (Y. J. B. and I. H. P.). All discrepancies were resolved by consensus between the two investigators. We calculated the frequency of failed weaning from supplemental oxygen and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for adult patients who underwent general anesthesia.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^116WR5ed]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Cyanide exposure — prehospital treatment and interventions state there is no widely available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test and many hospitals will not be able to rapidly assess cyanide levels; therefore, treatment decisions must be made on the basis of clinical history and signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication. For patients with appropriate history and one or more significant cyanide exposure signs or symptoms, treat with 100% oxygen via non-rebreather mask, CPAP, or bag valve mask and collect a pre-treatment blood sample in the appropriate tube for lactate and cyanide levels, if feasible. Administer one of the following medication regimes: Hydroxocobalamin (the preferred agent) with adult initial dose 5 g administered over 15 minutes slow IV; each 5 g vial is reconstituted with 200 mL of LR, NS, or D5W (25 mg/mL) and administered at 10–15 mL/minute; an additional 5 g dose may be administered with medical consultation; pediatric dosing is 70 mg/kg (reconstitute concentration is 25 mg/mL) and maximum single dose is 5 g. OR administer sodium thiosulfate with adult dosing 12.5 g IVF (50 mL of 25% solution) or pediatric dosing 0.5 g/kg IV (2 mL/kg of 25% solution). If seizure, treat per Seizures Guideline.

### Effect of heliox on end-tidal CO ₂ measurement in healthy adults [^111rfoX3]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Therapeutic gases and other modalities delivered by inhalation may affect the accuracy of capnographic measurements in 2 ways. First is the specificity of the measurement of CO2 within the device, and second is the dilution effect of supplemental gases in the ambient air during CO2 sampling by the device. Our goal was to determine if variables such as inhaled gas composition, gas flows delivered via non-rebreather mask, and mouth open or closed affect measurements of end-tidal CO2 pressure (PETCO2) measured with the Capnostream 20 capnograph.

Methods

We measured PETCO2 and breathing frequency by capnography in 20 adult normal subjects, with coaching to maintain respiratory frequency between 10 and 20 breaths/min. SpO2 was monitored to detect hypoxemia. A 6 min wash-out period occurred between each 6 min level of testing.

Results

A mixed models analysis revealed that the mean ± SD PETCO2 for all subjects and flows while breathing heliox (37 ± 5 mm Hg) was not different (P = 0.50) from the value while breathing room air (36 ± 5 mm Hg). Repeated measurements with given subjects over 6 min periods of breathing spontaneously 0 L/min, with 10 L/min, and with 15 L/min of either air or heliox showed no difference in PETCO2 related to flow: P = 0.97 for 0 L/min vs 10 L/min, P = 0.87 for 0 L/min vs. 15 L/min.

Conclusions

In normal subjects, PETCO2 measurements with the Capnostream 20 were not affected by heliox or gas flow at 10 or 15 L/min through a non-rebreathing mask.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for prevention and management of avalanche and nonavalanche snow burial accidents [^113Ha5xG]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Avalanche asphyxia — mechanisms, extrication time, and gas dynamics: Asphyxiation during avalanche burial occurs by 3 primary mechanisms (physical blockage of the upper airway caused by inhaled snow, ice mask formation, and oxygen deprivation due to rebreathing expired air), and complete obstruction results in hypoxia in < 10 minutes with acute asphyxiation during the first 30 to 60 minutes; according to Swiss data, completely buried victims had > 90% chance of survival if extricated within about 15 minutes but only a 30% chance if extricated after approximately 30 minutes; survival after more than 30 minutes requires a patent airway and an air pocket; inspired air contains 21% oxygen and less than 0.03% carbon dioxide, while expired air contains about 16% O2 and 5% CO2, and rebreathing leads to progressive decrease in FiO2 and increase in FiCO2.

Table 1.
Candidate Definitions for Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia in Nonventilated Patients a

Abbreviations: NA, not applicable; WBC, white blood cell.

SI conversion factor: To convert WBC count to ×10 9 per liter, multiply by 0.001.

We defined worsening oxygenation as 2 or more days of stable or improving oxygenation followed by 2 or more days of any of the following: (1) a decrease in daily maximum oxygen saturation from 95% or higher in a patient on ambient air to less than 95% on ambient air, (2) the initiation of supplemental oxygen, (3) an increase in daily median oxygen flow rate of at least 3 L/min for a nasal cannula and at least 4 L/min for a simple face mask, or (4) an escalation in oxygen delivery device (nasal cannula → shovel mask → simple face mask → oxygen conservation device → high-flow oxygen → non-rebreather → noninvasive positive pressure ventilation → intubation and mechanical ventilation). The criteria for escalation of supplemental oxygen for different baseline states of oxygenation are further described in eTable 1 in the Supplement.

We defined fever as a daily maximum temperature higher than 38 °C and abnormal WBC count as more than 12 000/μL or less than 4000/μL (to convert to ×10 9 per liter, multiply by 0.001). We counted both plain chest radiographs and computed tomography of the chest as eligible radiographic criteria. We defined new antibiotic start as antibiotics administered on hospital day 3 or later that were not given on the previous 2 calendar days. We required at least 3 days of new antibiotics to focus surveillance on the subset of potential pneumonias that clinicians deemed serious enough to merit sustained treatment. Antibiotics were limited to agents used to treat pneumonia (eTable 2 in the Supplement). New antibiotics started and continued for only 1 or 2 days were acceptable if the patient died before receiving a 3-day course. Antibiotic changes on the second or third day of treatment were permitted as long as there were no gaps of a calendar day or more in antibiotic administrations.

### Treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning: high-flow nasal cannula versus non-rebreather face mask [^1158buBB]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

In this study, the aim was to compare the rate of decrease in carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) values at consecutive time points and calculate the half-life of COHb (COHb t ½) in patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) with carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and treated with either high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) or non-rebreather face mask (NRFM).

Methods

This retrospective, cohort study with historical controls was performed over a 2-year period and included adult patients with CO poisoning, whose COHb values were checked. The HFNC group consisted of patients admitted to the ED with CO poisoning when HFNC was available in the hospital, while the NRFM group consisted of patients who presented to the ED with CO poisoning before the availability of HFNC. The primary outcome of the study was to detect the COHb t ½.

Results

A total of 71 patients were enrolled in the study. While 35 patients received oxygen with NRFM, 36 patients received HFNC. The mean COHb t ½ in the HFNC group was 41.1min (95% CI: 31.0–58.4) and 64.0min (95% CI: 43.5–114.4) in the NRFM group. We did not find a significant difference in the COHb t ½ between the HFNC group and NRFM group (p = 0.099). COHb levels between treatment arms at serial time points showed a statistically significant difference at 60min (p = 0.048). We compared the decay constant and half-life of COHb between groups according to gender. In both genders, COHb t ½ was significantly different between groups, and COHb t ½ was lower in the patients treated with HFNC.

Conclusion

HFNC was effective in reducing the half-life of COHb values in patients with carbon monoxide poisoning. Prospective studies to be conducted in larger groups are needed to fully understand the effect of HFNC on carbon monoxide poisoning.

### High-flow nasal oxygen vs. conventional oxygen therapy in patients with COVID-19 related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and a do not intubate order: a multicentre cohort study [^112S8WLq]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcomes, data collection, and preparation

The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, the secondary outcome was hospital length of stay (LOS) in days, and the tertiary outcome was the cause of death. The outcome of prediction was in-hospital mortality in patients treated with HFNO.

Data was prospectively collected and supplemented with data collected retrospectively specific for the current analysis using predefined similar definitions (Supplementary Table 2). The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score was categorized as fit (CFS 1–3), vulnerable (CFS 4–5) and frail (CFS 6–9). Respiratory parameters (respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (SpO 2) and details regarding the oxygen therapy modality and flow) were recorded at multiple time points: just prior to and after HFNO initiation (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 12 and 24 h). Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) on COT was estimated using the equation: FiO₂ = 21% + oxygen flow rate in L/min × 3, and further categorized into: group 1) room air, group 2) nasal oxygen 1–6 L/min or air-entrainment mask 10 L/min, group 3) air-entrainment mask 15 L/min or non-rebreathing mask 10 L/min and group 4) non-rebreathing mask 15 L/min (Supplementary Table 3).

Statistical analyses

A convenient sample approach was used. Categorical variables were reported as numbers (percentages) and continuous variables as medians [25th–75th percentile]. Differences between patients on HFNO vs. COT, and between survivors and non-survivors among HFNO patients, were analysed using the Mann–Whitney U-test for continuous variables and the Chi-squared test for categorical variables. A p -value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. If < 5% of the variables were missing, complete case analyses were performed. Otherwise, missing data were imputed 10 times, and results were pooled following the Rubin's rules.

Mask and respirator use in additional observational studies — All other identified studies demonstrated a consistent trend toward a protective effect when mask or N95 respirator was used. A web-survey comparative cross-sectional study analyzed 16,397 adults and found consistent N95 wearing associated with lower infection than sometimes wearing (adjusted OR [aOR]: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.95), with similar findings for surgical facemasks 'all the time' versus 'sometimes' (aOR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.98). In a study of close contacts among 105 HCP, 18 were seropositive (10 wore disposable non-surgical face masks) and 87 were seronegative (68 wore disposable non-surgical face masks) with aOR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.97. Another study of 903 HCP reported 115 positives, of whom 50 (44%) used surgical masks, and among 788 negatives data were available for 144 HCP with 91 (63%) wearing a surgical mask. In a third study, out of 138 HCP tested, seven were positive for COVID-19.

- providing usual care for non-ventilated patients with COVID-19

- performing non-aerosol-generating procedures on mechanically ventilated (closed circuit) patients with COVID-19.

### Compared efficacy of four preoxygenation methods for intubation in the ICU: retrospective analysis of mcGrath mac videolaryngoscope versus Macintosh laryngoscope (MACMAN) trial data [^112wmQnA]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Severe hypoxemia is the most common serious adverse event during endotracheal intubation. Preoxygenation is performed routinely as a preventive measure. The relative efficacy of the various available preoxygenation devices is unclear. Here, our objective was to assess associations between preoxygenation devices and pulse oximetry values during endotracheal intubation.

Design

Post hoc analysis of data from a multicenter randomized controlled superiority trial (McGrath Mac Videolaryngoscope Versus Macintosh Laryngoscope [MACMAN]) comparing videolaryngoscopy to Macintosh laryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation in critical care.

Setting

Seven French ICUs.

Patients

Three-hundred nineteen of the 371 critically ill adults requiring endotracheal intubation who were included in the MACMAN trial.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Minimal pulse oximetry value during endotracheal intubation was the primary endpoint. We also sought risk factors for pulse oximetry below 90%. Of 319 patients, 157 (49%) had bag-valve-mask, 71 (22%) noninvasive ventilation, 71 (22%) non-rebreathing mask, and 20 (7%) high-flow nasal oxygen for preoxygenation. Factors independently associated with minimal pulse oximetry value were the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II severity score (p = 0.03), baseline pulse oximetry (p < 0.001), baseline PaO2/FIO2 ratio (p = 0.02), and number of laryngoscopies (p = 0.001). The only independent predictors of pulse oximetry less than 90% were baseline pulse oximetry (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.64–0.79; p < 0.001) and preoxygenation device: with bag-valve-mask as the reference, odds ratios were 1.10 (95% CI, 0.25–4.92) with non-rebreathing mask, 0.10 (95% CI, 0.01–0.80) with noninvasive ventilation, and 5.75 (95% CI, 1.15–28.75) with high-flow nasal oxygen.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that the main determinants of hypoxemia during endotracheal intubation may be related to critical illness severity and to preexisting hypoxemia. The differences across preoxygenation methods suggest that noninvasive ventilation may deserve preference in patients with marked hypoxemia before endotracheal intubation. Ongoing studies will provide further clarification about the optimal preoxygenation method for endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients.

### Last-resort strategies during mask shortages: optimal design features of cloth masks and decontamination of disposable masks during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1178Y2Rt]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue for the medium term until an effective vaccine is available. Respiratory protective gear (RPG) (masks and respirators) are an important non-pharmaceutical intervention for use by health workers, the community and sick patients during the pandemic, which can reduce the risk of infection by 85%. In public settings, RPGs work by source control and protecting healthy wearers, whereas for healthcare workers (HCWs) use of RPGs is mainly for personal protection. RPGs not only protect unaffected people from inhaling contaminated droplets and aerosols but also reduce the spread of virus from those who are infected. A medical or surgical mask is designed to protect the wearer from splash or spray and is regulated on the water resistance. It does not fit around the face and the filtration quality is variable. A respirator is designed to filter > 95% of airborne particles (< 5 μm in diameter) and fits around the face to create a seal. Respirators are regulated on their filtration capacity. However, shortages of RPGs is placing HCWs and others at risk globally. In response to the scarcity of RPGs, there are unprecedented efforts at designing home-made cloth masks globally, using locally available fabrics, some of which involve sewing and others using no-sew methods. Various mask designs have been promoted with little or no evidence of effectiveness. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO have suggested home-made cloth masks, or even bandanas, as the last resort. Potentially, a cloth mask could be designed with features similar to a mask or respirator. Herein, as a last-resort strategy, we outline the principles of good design for a safer cloth mask, based on reported available evidence.

### Rapidly improving acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19: a multi-centre observational study [^1113oAzn]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

One therefore should seek for other potential explanations for our finding of the substantially lower prevalence of rapidly improving ARDS than previously reported. One could argue that previous reports might overestimate the prevalence of rapidly improving ARDS (and of ARDS generally) by including patients who might had alternate, easily reversible, noninflammatory causes of hypoxemia, such as atelectasis or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Indeed, such reports included several patients with ARDS due to unknown risk factors, who might be more likely to experience rapid improvement of their syndrome compared to patients with ARDS due to known risk factors. The fact that COVID-related ARDS has a known risk factor and specifically the fact that this risk factor is pulmonary infection (a "direct" risk factor), which has been identified as the factor least likely to be associated with rapidly improving ARDS, might explain our observed low prevalence of rapidly improving ARDS. That being said, even when we calculated the prevalence of rapidly improving ARDS among patients with ARDS related to influenza and hospitalized in one participating study site (Crete), we found it as high as 15.4% which is closer to that previously reported rather than it of COVID-related ARDS. Therefore, presence of a "direct" risk factor (viral pneumonia) might not fully explain the low prevalence of rapidly improving ARDS in our study.

Beyond the risk factor, one could hypothesize an association between the potential of patient self-inflicted lung injury due to prolonged usage of high-flow nasal oxygen and/or non-rebreather mask prior to intubation and subsequent low prevalence of rapidly improving ARDS. However, in the present study, patients with rapidly improving ARDS did not substantially differ from comparators in terms of usage and duration of high-flow nasal oxygen and/or non-rebreather mask. Besides, it is unclear whether a trial of high-flow nasal oxygen might deteriorate outcomes of patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, although one could think that rapidly improving ARDS is not essentially different from mild ARDS, we found that almost half of patients with rapidly improving ARDS had moderate or severe (rather than mild) ARDS on the day of intubation (Table 1). Taken together, usage of high-flow nasal oxygen prior to intubation and severity of ARDS (i.e. categorization as mild ARDS according to the Berlin definition) on the day of intubation might not fully explain the low prevalence of rapidly improving ARDS in our study.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^112mHsr2]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Resuscitation — Airway and ventilation during cardiac arrest emphasizes that "The airway management strategy should not interrupt compressions" and that "Successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest depends primarily on effective, minimally interrupted chest compressions and prompt defibrillation if the patient is in pulseless VT/VF", with adult airway management "of secondary importance and should not interfere with compressions and defibrillation". Options include passive ventilation with "High flow oxygen is applied via a non-rebreather mask with an oropharyngeal airway" and "This may be applied for the first 3–4 compression cycles (6–8 minutes)", followed by consideration of BVM or advanced airway. BVM may be used "at 10 breaths per minute (1 breath every 10 compressions)" without interrupting compressions, or with "30:2 ventilation to compression ratio", pausing after "Each 30 compressions" to allow "2 BVM ventilations". Pediatric considerations state "For multiple rescuer CPR in children, 15:2 is the recommended compression-to-ventilation ratio (30:2 for single rescuer)" and for neonates "3:1 is the recommended compression-to-ventilation ratio". With advanced airway placement, "Either a supraglottic airway or an endotracheal tube may be placed without interruption of compressions", and ventilations are "provided at 10 breaths/minute for adults".

### Oxygen delivery with an open oxygen mask and other conventional masks: a simulation-based study [^115b12Bu]. Respiratory Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A recently introduced open oxygen mask design was marketed in 2021 (open mask A). The manufacturer claims that the mask "… provides one solution for all your oxygen delivery needs across your patients' continuum of care". The new oxygen mask specifies flow (1–15 L/min and flush) with an expected F IO2 from 0.25–0.85. This suggests that this mask eliminates the need for multiple oxygen delivery devices as F IO2 requirements change. This study aimed to describe the F IO2 performance of the new open oxygen mask and other commonly used oxygen masks.

Methods

The following oxygen masks were studied: open mask A, open mask B, simple mask, partial rebreather, and non-rebreather. An adult mannequin head was attached to a breathing simulator, which recorded F IO2 at the simulated alveolar level. The simulator was set to a closed-loop volume control mode: V T = 320 mL, compliance = 50 mL/cm H 2 O, resistance = 4 cm H 2 O/L/s, breathing frequency = 15 breaths/min, increase = 25%, hold = 0%, and release = 30%. Oxygen was run through each mask at the recommended flows. Each flow was verified with a flow analyzer before attaching the mask for oxygen measurement. Each experiment was performed twice. The F IO2 measurements were averaged and compared using a 2-way ANOVA with P < .05 indicating significance.

Results

The F IO2 delivery was significantly different for each device. The measured F IO2 range was open mask A, 0.30–0.60; open mask B, 0.28–0.64; simple mask, 0.55–0.73; partial non-rebreather, 0.73–1.0; non-rebreather, 0.93–1.00.

Conclusions

The performance of each oxygen mask from highest to lowest F IO2: non-rebreather, partial rebreather, simple mask, open mask A, and open mask B. These findings suggest that no oxygen mask tested serves as a substitute for the others across a flow range of 1–15 L/min and flush.

### Reliability of methods to estimate the fraction of inspired oxygen in patients with acute respiratory failure breathing through non-rebreather reservoir bag oxygen mask [^114QZY39]. Thorax (2020). Medium credibility.

Severity of hypoxaemia can be assessed using the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (FiO 2). However, in patients breathing through non-rebreather reservoir bag oxygen mask, accuracy of bedside FiO 2 estimation methods remains to be tested. In a post-hoc analysis of a multicentre clinical trial, three FiO 2 estimation methods were compared with FiO 2 measured with a portable oxygen analyser introduced in the oxygen mask. Among 262 patients analysed, mean (SD) measured FiO 2 was 65% (13). The 3%-formula (21% + oxygenflow rate in L/min × 3) was the most accurate method to estimate FiO 2 Other methods overestimated FiO 2 and hypoxaemia severity, so they should be avoided.

We evaluated studies that included participants 16 years of age and older who were admitted to the ICU and required treatment with HFNC. We assessed the safety and efficacy of HFNC compared with comparator interventions in terms of treatment failure, mortality, adverse events, duration of respiratory support, hospital and ICU length of stay, respiratory effects, patient-reported outcomes, and costs of treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, Web of Science, proceedings from four conferences, and clinical trials registries; and we handsearched reference lists of relevant studies. We conducted searches from January 2000 to March 2016 and reran the searches in December 2016. We added four new studies of potential interest to a list of 'Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into formal review findings during the review update.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled studies with a parallel or cross-over design comparing HFNC use in adult ICU patients versus other forms of non-invasive respiratory support (low-flow oxygen via nasal cannulae or mask, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias.

Main Results

We included 11 studies with 1972 participants. Participants in six studies had respiratory failure, and in five studies required oxygen therapy after extubation. Ten studies compared HFNC versus low-flow oxygen devices; one of these also compared HFNC versus CPAP, and another compared HFNC versus BiPAP alone. Most studies reported randomization and allocation concealment inadequately and provided inconsistent details of outcome assessor blinding. We did not combine data for CPAP and BiPAP comparisons with data for low-flow oxygen devices; study data were insufficient for separate analysis of CPAP and BiPAP for most outcomes. For the primary outcomes of treatment failure (1066 participants; six studies) and mortality (755 participants; three studies), investigators found no differences between HFNC and low-flow oxygen therapies (risk ratio (RR), Mantel-Haenszel (MH), random-effects 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.27; and RR, MH, random-effects 0.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.06, respectively). We used the GRADE approach to downgrade the certainty of this evidence to low because of study risks of bias and different participant indications. Reported adverse events included nosocomial pneumonia, oxygen desaturation, visits to general practitioner for respiratory complications, pneumothorax, acute pseudo-obstruction, cardiac dysrhythmia, septic shock, and cardiorespiratory arrest. However, single studies reported adverse events, and we could not combine these findings; one study reported fewer episodes of oxygen desaturation with HFNC but no differences in all other reported adverse events. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for adverse events to low because of limited data. Researchers noted no differences in ICU length of stay (mean difference (MD), inverse variance (IV), random-effects 0.15, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.34; four studies; 770 participants), and we downgraded quality to low because of study risks of bias and different participant indications. We found no differences in oxygenation variables: partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) (MD, IV, random-effects 7.31, 95% CI -23.69 to 41.31; four studies; 510 participants); PaO 2 (MD, IV, random-effects 2.79, 95% CI -5.47 to 11.05; three studies; 355 participants); and oxygen saturation (SpO 2) up to 24 hours (MD, IV, random-effects 0.72, 95% CI -0.73 to 2.17; four studies; 512 participants). Data from two studies showed that oxygen saturation measured after 24 hours was improved among those treated with HFNC (MD, IV, random-effects 1.28, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.55; 445 participants), but this difference was small and was not clinically significant. Along with concern about risks of bias and differences in participant indications, review authors noted a high level of unexplained statistical heterogeneity in oxygenation effect estimates, and we downgraded the quality of evidence to very low. Meta-analysis of three comparable studies showed no differences in carbon dioxide clearance among those treated with HFNC (MD, IV, random-effects -0.75, 95% CI -2.04 to 0.55; three studies; 590 participants). Two studies reported no differences in atelectasis; we did not combine these findings. Data from six studies (867 participants) comparing HFNC versus low-flow oxygen showed no differences in respiratory rates up to 24 hours according to type of oxygen delivery device (MD, IV, random-effects -1.51, 95% CI -3.36 to 0.35), and no difference after 24 hours (MD, IV, random-effects -2.71, 95% CI -7.12 to 1.70; two studies; 445 participants). Improvement in respiratory rates when HFNC was compared with CPAP or BiPAP was not clinically important (MD, IV, random-effects -0.89, 95% CI -1.74 to -0.05; two studies; 834 participants). Results showed no differences in patient-reported measures of comfort according to oxygen delivery devices in the short term (MD, IV, random-effects 0.14, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.93; three studies; 462 participants) and in the long term (MD, IV, random-effects -0.36, 95% CI -3.70 to 2.98; two studies; 445 participants); we downgraded the certainty of this evidence to low. Six studies measured dyspnoea on incomparable scales, yielding inconsistent study data. No study in this review provided data on positive end-expiratory pressure measured at the pharyngeal level, work of breathing, or cost comparisons of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

We were unable to demonstrate whether HFNC was a more effective or safe oxygen delivery device compared with other oxygenation devices in adult ICU patients. Meta-analysis could be performed for few studies for each outcome, and data for comparisons with CPAP or BiPAP were very limited. In addition, we identified some risks of bias among included studies, differences in patient groups, and high levels of statistical heterogeneity for some outcomes, leading to uncertainty regarding the results of our analysis. Consequently, evidence is insufficient to show whether HFNC provides safe and efficacious respiratory support for adult ICU patients.

### Universal masking in hospitals in the COVID-19 era: is it time to consider shielding? [^113wfcce]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

As the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) public health crisis escalates, several hospitals have supplemented pre-existing infection prevention measures, such as visitor restrictions and employee screening, with universal masking of all healthcare professionals (HCPs). A universal masking policy usually requires that all HCPs (clinical and nonclinical) wear some sort of face mask while on hospital premises. These new policies also continue pre-existing policies requiring the use of N95 respirators (when available) when performing aerosol-generating procedures on patients with known or suspected SARS-CoV-2. In a nutshell, the rationale of implementing a universal masking policy in hospitals is to limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to HCP and from HCP to patients and/or to other HCPs. In the following sections, we summarize the rationale for universal masking in hospitals, important considerations before implementing this policy, and the challenges with universal masking, and we discuss proposed solutions such as universal face shields.

### Preoxygenation with flush rate oxygen: comparing the nonrebreather mask with the bag-valve mask [^114rrETY]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Nonrebreather masks and bag-valve masks are used for preoxygenation before emergency intubation. Flush rate oxygen delivered with a nonrebreather mask is noninferior to bag-valve mask oxygen at 15 L/min. We seek to compare the nonrebreather mask with flush rate oxygen to a bag-valve mask with flush rate oxygen (with and without inspiratory assistance) and determine whether the efficacy of bag-valve mask with flush rate oxygen is compromised by a simulated mask leak.

Methods

We conducted 2 prospective studies in healthy, adult volunteers. All devices in both studies used flush rate oxygen, achieved by rotating the flowmeter dial counterclockwise until it could not be rotated farther, which delivered oxygen at 40 to 60 L/min. Study 1 compared preoxygenation with nonrebreather mask to bag-valve mask (modified with a one-way exhalation port) with and without a simulated mask leak. Study 2 compared nonrebreather mask to bag-valve mask with inspiratory assistance. The primary outcome was FeO 2. For each comparison, we prespecified a noninferiority margin of FeO 2 for the nonrebreather mask (compared with the bag-valve mask, bag-valve mask with mask leak, and bag-valve mask with assistance) of 10%.

Results

Thirty subjects were enrolled in study 1 and 27 subjects were enrolled in study 2. For study 1, mean FeO 2 values for nonrebreather mask, bag-valve mask, and bag-valve mask with leak were 81% (95% confidence interval [CI] 78% to 83%), 76% (95% CI 71% to 81%), and 30% (95% CI 26% to 35%), respectively. FeO 2 for the nonrebreather mask was noninferior to the bag-valve mask at flush rate (difference 5%; 95% CI -1% to 10%). FeO 2 was higher for the nonrebreather mask compared with the bag-valve mask with a simulated mask leak (difference 51%; 95% CI 46% to 55%). For study 2, mean FeO 2 values for nonrebreather mask and bag-valve mask with assistance were 83% (95% CI 80% to 86%) and 77% (95% CI 73% to 80%), respectively. FeO 2 for the nonrebreather mask was noninferior to the bag-valve mask with assistance at flush rate (difference 6%; 95% CI 3% to 10%).

Conclusion

With flush rate oxygen, the nonrebreather mask is noninferior to the bag-valve mask, with and without inspiratory assistance. Bag-valve mask performed poorly with a mask leak, even with flush rate oxygen. Flush rate oxygen with a nonrebreather mask is a reasonable default preoxygenation method in spontaneously breathing patients with no underlying respiratory pathology.

### Physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection to prevent person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115gbCsL]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

The use of face masks was protective for both health-care workers and people in the community exposed to infection, with both the frequentist and Bayesian analyses lending support to face mask use irrespective of setting. Our unadjusted analyses might, at first impression, suggest use of face masks in the community setting to be less effective than in the health-care setting, but after accounting for differential N95 respirator use between health-care and non-health-care settings, we did not detect any striking differences in effectiveness of face mask use between settings. The credibility of effect-modification across settings was, therefore, low. Wearing face masks was also acceptable and feasible. Policy makers at all levels should, therefore, strive to address equity implications for groups with currently limited access to face masks and eye protection. One concern is that face mask use en masse could divert supplies from people at highest risk for infection. Health-care workers are increasingly being asked to ration and reuse PPE, leading to calls for government-directed repurposing of manufacturing capacity to overcome mask shortagesand finding solutions for mask use by the general public. In this respect, some of the masks studied in our review were reusable 12–16-layer cotton or gauze masks. At the moment, although there is consensus that SARS-CoV-2 mainly spreads through large droplets and contact, debate continues about the role of aerosol, but our meta-analysis provides evidence (albeit of low certainty) that respirators might have a stronger protective effect than surgical masks. Biological plausibility would be supported by data for aerosolised SARS-CoV-2, and preclinical data showing seasonal coronavirus RNA detection in fine aerosols during tidal breathing, albeit, RNA detection does not necessarily imply replication and infection-competent virus. Nevertheless, our findings suggest it plausible that even in the absence of aerosolisation, respirators might be simply more effective than masks at preventing infection. At present, there is no data to support viable virus in the air outside of aerosol generating procedures from available hospital studies. Other factors such as super-spreading events, the subtype of health-care setting (eg, emergency room, intensive care unit, medical wards, dialysis centre), if aerosolising procedures are done, and environmental factors such as ventilation, might all affect the degree of protection afforded by personal protection strategies, but we did not identify robust data to inform these aspects.

### A pediatric bench model of continuous albuterol delivery using heliox [^11739mzF]. Respiratory Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal setup for continuously administering albuterol with heliox remains unclear, especially for pediatric patients. This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of continuous albuterol delivery with heliox using different nebulizer setups in a pediatric model.

Methods

A pediatric manikin with simulated spontaneous breathing was used to receive continuous albuterol (20 mg/h) with heliox (80/20) in 3 setups: (1) The MiniHEART nebulizer, driven by oxygen at 3 L/min, was attached to a Y-piece, linking to a non-rebreather mask and a valved reservoir with 11 L/min heliox; (2) a vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN) placed at the humidifier inlet of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with 11 L/min heliox and the manikin's mouth sealed; and (3) a VMN placed between a valved reservoir with 11 L/min heliox and a non-rebreather mask. Both tight-fitting and loose-fitting mask configurations were tested in the setup with vibrating mesh nebulizer and mask. Heliox of 70/30 was tested with a VMN and a loose-fitting mask. Albuterol was delivered continuously to the nebulizer via an infusion pump at 8 mL (20 mg)/h for each 20-min run and each experiment was repeated five times. A collecting filter placed between the manikin's trachea and lung model was removed after each run, and the drug was eluted and assayed via ultraviolet spectrophotometry (276 nm).

Results

During continuous albuterol nebulization using heliox, the VMN either in line with HFNC or with a tight-fitting mask achieved the highest and similar inhaled dose (8.5 ± 0.4 vs 8.8 ± 0.7%, P = 0.35), while the MiniHEART nebulizer yielded the lowest aerosol deposition (1.5 ± 0.2%). The inhaled dose was lower with the loose-fitting mask than with the tight-fitting mask (5.9 ± 0.9 vs 8.8 ± 0.7%, P = 0.009), and heliox of 80/20 delivered a higher inhaled dose than heliox of 70/30 (5.9 ± 0.9 vs 3.9 ± 0.4%, P = 0.009).

Conclusions

When administering continuous albuterol with heliox in a pediatric model, utilizing a VMN in line with HFNC during closed-mouth breathing yielded a higher inhaled dose compared to both the MiniHEART nebulizer and VMN with a loose-fitting mask.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^113QAXup]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Cluster headache — oxygen therapy recommendation and delivery parameters: We suggest the use of normobaric oxygen therapy for the acute treatment of cluster headache (Weak for | Not reviewed, Amended). Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it is proposed that oxygen neuromodulates and deactivates the trigeminal-autonomic reflex arch. Oxygen can be delivered as normobaric oxygen therapy (NBOT) or hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). NBOT is oxygen administered at one atmosphere of pressure and can be supplied via nasal cannula and face masks (e.g., non-rebreather masks). Flow rates for NBOT (e.g., "high-flow" oxygen being at least 12–15 liters per minute) and fraction of inspired oxygen (e.g., 100%) can both vary. In HBOT, oxygen is administered at a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure in a treatment chamber, breathing nearly 100% oxygen, and NBOT is much more readily available than HBOT.

### Physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection to prevent person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11488eJc]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Strengths of our review include adherence to full systematic review methods, which included artificial intelligence-supported dual screening of titles and abstracts, full-text evaluation, assessment of risk of bias, and no limitation by language. We included patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV and searched relevant data up to May 3, 2020. We followed the GRADE approachto rate the certainty of evidence. Finally, we identified and appraise a large body of published work from China, from which much evidence emerged before the pandemic spread to other global regions.

The primary limitation of our study is that all studies were non-randomised, not always fully adjusted, and might suffer from recall and measurement bias (eg, direct contact in some studies might not be measuring near distance). However, unadjusted, adjusted, frequentist, and Bayesian meta-analyses all supported the main findings, and large or very large effects were recorded. Nevertheless, we are cautious not to be overly certain in the precise quantitative estimates of effects, although the qualitative effect and direction is probably of high certainty. Many studies did not provide information on precise distances, and direct contact was equated to 0 m distance; none of the eligible studies quantitatively evaluated whether distances of more than 2 m were more effective, although our meta-regression provides potential predictions for estimates of risk. Few studies assessed the effect of interventions in non-health-care settings, and they primarily evaluated mask use in households or contacts of cases, although beneficial associations were seen across settings. Furthermore, most evidence was from studies that reported on SARS and MERS (n = 6674 patients with COVID-19, of 25 697 total), but data from these previous epidemics provide the most direct information for COVID-19 currently. We did not specifically assess the effect of duration of exposure on risk for transmission, although whether or not this variable was judged a risk factor considerably varied across studies, from any duration to a minimum of 1 h. Because of inconsistent reporting, information is limited about whether aerosol-generating procedures were in place in studies using respirators, and whether masks worn by infected patients might alter the effectiveness of each intervention, although the stronger association with N95 or similar respirators over other masks persisted when adjusting for studies reporting aerosol-generating medical procedures. These factors might account for some of the residual statistical heterogeneity seen for some outcomes, albeit I 2 is commonly inflated in meta-analyses of observational data, and nevertheless the effects seen were large and probably clinically important in all adjusted studies.

### Respiratory protection: what SARS-CoV-2 has taught us [^11154BuS]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes the epidemiological evidence for respiratory personal protective equipment for SARA-CoV-2, a topic of considerable controversy.

Recent Findings

The main findings are that the observational studies and non-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) randomized trials do not provide clear evidence that the N95 respirators offer superior protection over surgical masks. A randomized controlled trial on COVID-19 provides evidence that the absolute risk to healthcare workers over time using surgical masks is similar to N95 respirators.

Summary

The implications of the findings are that surgical masks and N95 respirators can be considered for respiratory protection in healthcare workers.

### Time to adequate preoxygenation when using flush rate oxygen [^114SwJLB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Preoxygenation utilizing a non-rebreather mask (NRB) to deliver oxygen at the maximal flow rate (> 50 L/min) from a standard hospital gas flowmeter (i.e., the flush rate) is an accepted technique during emergency airway management. Existing guidance to preoxygenate patients for at least 3 min is based on use of oxygen-delivery devices not commonly used in the emergency department (e.g., a closed anesthesia circuit). We sought to determine the median length of time needed to achieve adequate preoxygenation utilizing an NRB with flush rate oxygen.

Methods

Healthy volunteers performing tidal breathing underwent a 5-min trial of preoxygenation with NRB mask with flush rate oxygen. End-tidal oxygen (EtO2), a measure of the degree of adequate preoxygenation, was recorded every 15 s. Adequate preoxygenation was defined as EtO2 ≥ 85%.

Results

We enrolled 50 participants. The median maximum EtO2 achieved during preoxygenation was 87% (interquartile range [IQR] 87–89%) and all participants achieved an EtO2 > 80%. The median time to reach an EtO2 of 85% was 90 s (IQR 60–135 s). By 3 min, 86% (95% CI 73% to 94%) of participants had achieved adequate preoxygenation.

Conclusions

In healthy participants undergoing preoxygenation with an NRB mask with flush rate oxygen, the median time to adequate preoxygenation was 90 s and 86% were adequately preoxygenated at 3 min. This suggests that 3 min of preoxygenation is a reasonable target using this technique.

### Non-invasive ventilation for cystic fibrosis [^116LFwv7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-invasive ventilation may be a means to temporarily reverse or slow the progression of respiratory failure in cystic fibrosis by providing ventilatory support and avoiding tracheal intubation. Using non-invasive ventilation, in the appropriate situation or individuals, can improve lung mechanics through increasing airflow and gas exchange and decreasing the work of breathing. Non-invasive ventilation thus acts as an external respiratory muscle. This is an update of a previously published review.

Objectives

To compare the effect of non-invasive ventilation versus no non-invasive ventilation in people with cystic fibrosis for airway clearance, during sleep and during exercise.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We searched the reference lists of each trial for additional publications possibly containing other trials. Most recent search: 08 August 2016.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing a form of pressure preset or volume preset non-invasive ventilation to no non-invasive ventilation used for airway clearance or during sleep or exercise in people with acute or chronic respiratory failure in cystic fibrosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three reviewers independently assessed trials for inclusion criteria and methodological quality, and extracted data.

Main Results

Ten trials met the inclusion criteria with a total of 191 participants. Seven trials evaluated single treatment sessions, one evaluated a two-week intervention, one evaluated a six-week intervention and one a three-month intervention. It is only possible to blind trials of airway clearance and overnight ventilatory support to the outcome assessors. In most of the trials we judged there was an unclear risk of bias with regards to blinding due to inadequate descriptions. The six-week trial was the only one judged to have a low risk of bias for all other domains. One single intervention trial had a low risk of bias for the randomisation procedure with the remaining trials judged to have an unclear risk of bias. Most trials had a low risk of bias with regard to incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. Six trials (151 participants) evaluated non-invasive ventilation for airway clearance compared with an alternative chest physiotherapy method such as the active cycle of breathing techniques or positive expiratory pressure. Three trials used nasal masks, one used a nasal mask or mouthpiece and one trial used a face mask and in one trial it is unclear. Three of the trials reported on one of the review's primary outcome measures (quality of life). Results for the reviews secondary outcomes showed that airway clearance may be easier with non-invasive ventilation and people with cystic fibrosis may prefer it. We were unable to find any evidence that non-invasive ventilation increases sputum expectoration, but it did improve some lung function parameters. Three trials (27 participants) evaluated non-invasive ventilation for overnight ventilatory support compared to oxygen or room air using nasal masks (two trials) and nasal masks or full face masks (one trial). Trials reported on two of the review's primary outcomes (quality of life and symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing). Results for the reviews secondary outcome measures showed that they measured lung function, gas exchange, adherence to treatment and preference, and nocturnal transcutaneous carbon dioxide. Due to the small numbers of participants and statistical issues, there were discrepancies in the results between the RevMan and the original trial analyses. No clear differences were found between non-invasive ventilation compared with oxygen or room air except for exercise performance, which significantly improved with non-invasive ventilation compared to room air over six weeks. One trial (13 participants) evaluated non-invasive ventilation on exercise capacity (interface used was unclear) and did not reported on any of the review's primary outcomes. The trial found no clear differences between non-invasive ventilation compared to no non-invasive ventilation for any of our outcomes. Three trials reported on adverse effects. One trial, evaluating non-invasive ventilation for airway clearance, reported that a participant withdrew at the start of the trial due to pain on respiratory muscle testing. One trial evaluating non-invasive ventilation for overnight support reported that one participant could not tolerate an increase in inspiratory positive airway pressure. A second trial evaluating non-invasive ventilation in this setting reported that one participant did not tolerate the non-invasive ventilation mask, one participant developed a pneumothorax when breathing room air and two participants experienced aerophagia which resolved when inspiratory positive airway pressure was decreased.

Authors' Conclusions

Non-invasive ventilation may be a useful adjunct to other airway clearance techniques, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis who have difficulty expectorating sputum. Non-invasive ventilation, used in addition to oxygen, may improve gas exchange during sleep to a greater extent than oxygen therapy alone in moderate to severe disease. The effect of NIV on exercise is unclear. These benefits of non-invasive ventilation have largely been demonstrated in single treatment sessions with small numbers of participants. The impact of this therapy on pulmonary exacerbations and disease progression remain unclear. There is a need for long-term randomised controlled trials which are adequately powered to determine the clinical effects of non-invasive ventilation in cystic fibrosis airway clearance and exercise.

### Early weaning from oxygen therapy in African children with severe pneumonia [^116ngJ2w]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Low flow oxygen

The method of delivery for LFO depended on local preference, but generally included a short nasal prong, catheter, or mask (plus a non-rebreathing reservoir for initial resuscitation). Infants were initiated on a flow rate of 1 L/min and children > 1 year on 2 L/min O 2. Flow rates were then titrated up against oxygen saturation over the first 30 min to 1 h to a maximum of 2 L/min in infants and 4 L/min in older children, with the aim of achieving an SpO 2 of ≥ 92%. If higher rates were required, children were switched to a mask and, depending on the type of mask, oxygen flows were gradually increased to 5 L/min, titrated against SpO 2 measurements. Children were eligible for weaning after a minimum of 2 h over a period of 30 min if SpO 2 was ≥ 92%. Monitoring was continued on weaned children, and LFO was restarted if SpO 2 fell to < 92% before 48 h (Additional File Table S4). Crossover to HFNT was not permitted in the protocol.

Control (permissive hypoxaemia)

Children in the control arm were monitored in accordance with the trial protocol, and LFO therapy was initiated if their SpO 2 (recorded over 5 min) fell to < 80%. Such children continued in the trial as described by the LFO protocol (above). Additional monitoring was permitted, driven by the clinical status of the child. After 48 h, LFO could be given as per local preference or per WHO guideline, but use of HFNT was not permitted.

Data management and statistical methods

Data were collected on case report forms and entered into a database written in OpenClinica version 3. As previously reported, protocol adherence within the first 48 h of randomisation was measured as the number and percentage of patients commencing on the randomised treatment, and the number and percentage changing treatment mode before 48 h, overall and by reason (in patients commencing the randomised treatment). The current secondary analyses are reported using descriptive statistics by stratum and/or study arm but were not formally tested for differences between groups. Respiratory support, respiratory distress over time, and respiratory failure at 48 h from randomisation are reported using counts and percentages or as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) as appropriate. Resource use is reported using medians and IQRs. Physiology parameters (respiratory rate and heart rate) are summarised over time using graphical methods.

### Trajectories of hypoxemia and pulmonary mechanics of COVID-19 ARDS in the northCARDS dataset [^113T8Xpj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Data definitions and assumptions

Several data assumptions needed to be made to structure the data. These included which fields contained the most valid and reliable data, and how best to handle missing data. For transparency, we outline assumptions for data structuring below and how we tested these assumptions. The Northwell ARDS Research Collaborative discussed each assumption to ensure that they reflected the clinical practice of providers caring for patients and their data entry into the electronic health record. Further details are provided in Additional file 1.

Oxygen delivery method, concentration, and degree of hypoxemia

The FiO 2 delivered was calculated based on the following formula: for nasal cannula or non-rebreather face mask, each liter of oxygen flow added 0.04 to 0.21 (room air), with a maximum of 6 L per minute for nasal cannula and 15 L per minute for non-rebreather mask. In the instances where the delivery method was not recorded in the electronic medical record, the previous recorded method was presumed to have been continued, until change in flow rate or delivery method was noted. To be able to accurately map hypoxemia prior to intubation, we used both arterial blood gas data on partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) and peripherally measured oxygen saturation (SpO 2). We calculated SpO 2 :FiO 2 ratios as well as PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratios over time for each patient across their entire hospital stay. For separate analyses we converted SpO 2 :FiO 2 to PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratios ('derived P/F') to obtain an estimated trajectory of PaO 2 over time (derived P/F = ([SpO₂:FiO₂] − 64)/0.84). The assumption that derived P/F would have parallel trends compared to Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) based P/F was visually tested (Fig. 3). Oxygenation Index was calculated based on previously described formula [FiO₂ × mean airway pressure]/PaO₂ × 100, using the FiO 2 post-intubation and ABG PaO 2 in the first 24 h after Ti.

### Particulate generation with different oxygen delivery devices [^116Afv6q]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The Coronavirus pandemic has a high mortality rate in patients that are mechanically ventilated, which has led to an ever increasing interest in noninvasive forms of oxygenation. The use of these devices has the theoretical risk of increased exposure risk because of possible particulate generation. This study aimed to quantify the particulate generation associated with different oxygen devices.

Methods

This was a prospective single center study conducted during September 2020 using ten healthy adult volunteers. Testing was conducted in a negative pressure hospital room using a light scattering particle counter. The oxygen devices used were a nasal cannula, an OxyMask™, a non-rebreathing mask, and a high flow system. Particle measurements were obtained at baseline in the room and then with each oxygen delivery device and pre-specified oxygen flow rates. These measurements were obtained different distances from the volunteer with their mouth open. A Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test was performed on each separate oxygen modality with all flow rates as one model.

Results

The particle concentrations were slightly non-significantly increased with the OxyMask™ and non-rebreathing mask at the closest distance measured. As the distance increased, these counts decreased closer to ambient levels. The nasal cannula and high flow nasal cannula particle counts were not significantly different from ambient measurements at either distance.

Conclusion

Nasal cannula, OxyMask™, non-rebreathing mask, and high flow oxygen did not generate any additional aerosols or droplets above a baseline room measurement, but further studies are necessary to determine infectious risk.

### Practical recommendations for the prevention and management of COVID-19 in low-income and middle-income settings: adapting clinical experience from the field [^114QgkNX]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Early initiation of oxygen supplementation anecdotally helped delay or prevent mechanical ventilation among patients with resting hypoxia (SpO 2 < 92%) hospitalised with COVID-19 at our institution. Using non-invasive methods, the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) can only be estimated and depends on the mode of delivery, with additional variability based on the quality of the device. For instance, a maximal rate of 6 L of oxygen per minute delivered by nasal cannula provides roughly 45% FiO 2. The same amount of oxygen delivered through a 'partial rebreather' face mask may provide closer to 60% FiO 2. A 'non-rebreather' mask may provide up to 95% FiO 2 while consuming up to 15 L of oxygen per minute. Oxygen monitoring in low-resource settings may be facilitated by portable pulse oximetry, a fairly inexpensive and reusable tool that may accurately identify patients at highest risk of decompensation. However, clinicians should bear in mind recent findings that occult hypoxaemia is less frequently detected by pulse oximetry in black than white patients.

Piped oxygen availability may be limited in severely resource-constrained settings. In such settings, we recommend the decontamination and reuse of partial rebreather masks, which each cost approximately US$2–US$4, as the more efficient utilisation of oxygen represents an outstanding return on investments. We recommend adjusting supplemental oxygen to achieve a peripheral saturation of 92%–96%or respiratory rate < 25 in all hypoxic patients with COVID-19.

Awake prone positioning

Early prone positioning of awake, non-mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients is a simple, no-cost intervention found in our practice to be highly effective at improving hypoxia. Observational data are inconsistent, with some studies demonstrating that awake proning may improve hypoxia and delay or prevent intubation, and others finding no clinical benefit. Several clinical trials examining the role of awake prone positioning in this context are underway.

Prone positioning homogenises aeration by decreasing intrapulmonary shunting and promoting recruitment of the dorsal lung segments. On this basis, we extended this practice to all awake, non-mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with moderate-to-severe hypoxia, with anecdotal improvement in oxygenation.

We recommend the early use of interval prone positioning on all hemodynamically stable, neurologically oriented COVID-19 patients with peripheral SPO 2 below 92%. Suggested contraindications to this practice include an inability to call for help, unstable fractures, pregnancy or presence of a chest tube.

### Respiratory support in COVID-19 patients, with a focus on resource-limited settings [^113Gxey9]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

The ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is threatening the global human population, including in countries with resource-limited health facilities. Severe bilateral pneumonia is the main feature of severe COVID-19, and adequate ventilatory support is crucial for patient survival. Although our knowledge of the disease is still rapidly increasing, this review summarizes current guidance on the best provision of ventilatory support, with a focus on resource-limited settings. Key messages include that supplemental oxygen is a first essential step for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients with hypoxemia and should be a primary focus in resource-limited settings where capacity for invasive ventilation is limited. Oxygen delivery can be increased by using a non-rebreathing mask and prone positioning. The presence of only hypoxemia should in general not trigger intubation because hypoxemia is often remarkably well tolerated. Patients with fatigue and at risk for exhaustion, because of respiratory distress, will require invasive ventilation. In these patients, lung protective ventilation is essential. Severe pneumonia in COVID-19 differs in some important aspects from other causes of severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and limiting the positive end-expiratory pressure level on the ventilator may be important. This ventilation strategy might reduce the currently very high case fatality rate of more than 50% in invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients.

### Appropriate use of high-flow nasal oxygen in hospitalized patients for initial or postextubation management of acute respiratory failure: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^112oHXH1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Adults with acute respiratory failure — population, intervention, comparators, and outcomes were defined as follows: Population included adults with acute respiratory failure (SpO2 < 90%, PaO2:FIO2 ratio ≤ 300, PaO2 ≤ 60 mm Hg, or PaCO2 ≥ 45 mm Hg). Intervention was high-flow nasal oxygen (humidified oxygen with flow rates ≥ 20 L/min). Comparators were noninvasive ventilation (continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation) and COT (for example, oxygen delivered through nasal cannula, simple face mask, air-entrainment mask, partial rebreathing mask, or nonrebreather mask). Outcomes rated as critical included all-cause mortality (in-hospital and the longest available through 30 days), hospital-acquired pneumonia, intubation or reintubation (days of intubation), ICU admission and ICU transfers, patient comfort, and hospital length of stay; remaining important outcomes included delirium, 30-day hospital readmissions, barotrauma (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, or ventilator-induced lung injury), compromised nutrition (enteral or parenteral nutrition), gastric dysfunction (placement of nasogastric tube, abdominal distension, nausea, or vomiting), functional independence at discharge, discharge disposition (home, assisted-living facility, nursing home, or long-term care hospital), and skin breakdown or pressure ulcers.

Good practice point: patients requiring increased concentration of oxygen
✓ The requirement for an increased concentration of oxygen is an indication for urgent clinical reassessment of the patient (and repeat blood gas measurements in most instances, see recommendations W13 and W18 for exceptions).

D. Initial oxygen therapy; initial choice of equipment for patients who do not have critical illness (see figures 1–2 and table 2 and full Guideline sections 8.9 and 10) i

Initial oxygen therapy in critical illness is covered in the next section.
D1. For acutely breathless patients not at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure who have saturations below 85%, treatment should be started with a reservoir mask at 15 L/min in the first instance. The oxygen concentration can be adjusted downwards (using nasal cannulae at 1–6 L/min or a simple face mask at 5–10 L/min) to maintain a target saturation of 94–98% once the patient has stabilised (grade D).
D2. In other cases of acute hypoxaemia without critical illness or risk factors for hypercapnic respiratory failure, treatment should be started with nasal cannulae (or a simple face mask if cannulae are not tolerated or not effective) with the flow rate adjusted to achieve a saturation of 94–98% (grade D).
D3. If medium-concentration therapy with nasal cannulae or a simple face mask does not achieve the desired saturation, change to a reservoir mask and seek senior or specialist advice (grade D).

### High-flow therapy by nasal cannulae versus high-flow face mask in severe hypoxemia after cardiac surgery: a single-center randomized controlled study-the HEART FLOW study [^112ppHAV]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether high-flow oxygen therapy by nasal cannulae (HFNC) is more effective than a high-flow face mask (HFFM) in severe hypoxemia.

Design

Randomized, single-center, open-labeled, controlled trial.

Setting

University Hospital of Nantes, France.

Participants

Cardiac surgery patients presenting oxygen saturation < 96% with Venturi mask 50%.

Intervention

Oxygenation by HFNC (45 L/min, F I O 2 100%) or Hudson RCI non-rebreather face mask with a reservoir bag (15 L/min).

Measurements and Main Results

The co-primary outcomes were the PaO 2 /F I O 2 ratio at 1 and 24 hours. In the intent-to-treat analysis (90 patients), the mean (standard deviation) PaO 2 /F I O 2 ratios were: after 1 hour, 113.4 (50.2) in HFFM versus 137.8 (57.0) in HFNC (mean difference 24.4, CI 97.5% [2.9–45.9], p = 0.03), and after 24 hours, 106.9 (62.6) in HFFM versus 129.9 (54.0) in HFNC (mean difference 23.0, CI 97.5% [1.5–44.6], p = 0.04). After adjustment on baseline PaO 2 /F I O 2, this difference persisted at 24 hours (p = 0.04). For secondary outcomes, the PaO 2 /F I O 2 ratio after 6 hours was 108.7 (47.9) in HFFM versus 136.0 (45.2) in HFNC (p = 0.01), without difference after 48 hours (p = 0.95). Refractory hypoxemia requiring noninvasive ventilation occurred in 13 (28%) patients in HFNC versus 24 (56%) patients in HFFM (p = 0.007). The HFNC improved satisfaction (p = 0.0002) and reduced mucus dryness (p = 0.003) compared with HFFM.

Conclusion

In patients with severe hypoxemia after cardiac surgery, PaO 2 /F I O 2 at 1 and 24 hours were higher and the use of noninvasive ventilation was reduced in HFNC compared with HFFM.

### Comparing the effects of 3 oxygen delivery methods plus intravenous ketorolac on primary headaches: a randomized clinical trial [^114m6aNC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare three different oxygen therapy methods in primary headaches.

Methods

Design: A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted between January 2016 and October 2017.

Setting

The emergency department of a university-affiliated urban hospital in Tehran, Iran.

Participants

Adult patients (aged 18 years and above) with moderate and severe primary headaches (VAS score of 4 or more).

Interventions

Participants were allocated to one of four groups. Group A (n = 34) received 30 mg of intravenous ketorolac plus oxygen at 15 l/min (min) through a non-rebreather mask (NRB), group B (n = 34) received 30 mg of intravenous ketorolac plus 7 l/min of oxygen through a 60% venturi mask, group C (n = 34) received 30 mg of intravenous ketorolac plus 4 l/min of oxygen through a nasal cannula and group D (n = 34) received 30 mg of intravenous ketorolac and room air.

Main Outcomes Measured

Pain was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) at 0, 15, 30 and 60 min after admission.

Results

Altogether, 136 patients were included. The most significant VAS change occurred in the NRB group at 30 min (p-value = 0.001). At this point, pain reduction in the NRB group was clinically higher than for the venturi and nasal cannula groups, but this effect had disappeared at 60 min.

Conclusion

Although the non-rebreather mask was significantly more effective at 30 min, after 60 min, none of the groups met the endpoint criterion of a 1.3-cm difference on the VAS scale.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^1111k4c1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Resuscitation — ventilation during chest compressions advises avoiding excessive ventilation and considering delayed airway management when no advanced airway is present, with passive ventilation using a non-rebreather mask (NRB) with 3–4 cycles of uninterrupted chest compressions and consideration of bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation or an advanced airway after 3–4 cycles; performing BVM ventilation every 10–15 compressions with cycles of uninterrupted chest compressions and upstroke ventilation between compressions with a 30:2 ventilation to compression ratio for adults and 15:2 for children when 2 rescuers are present; and, if an advanced airway is placed, ventilations should not exceed 10 breaths/minute (1 breath every 6 seconds or 1 breath every 10 compressions) in adults, with a pediatric consideration of 1 breath every 3–5 seconds (equivalent to 12–20 breaths/minute).

### Performance of different low-flow oxygen delivery systems [^1163jiRY]. Respiratory Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The delivery of a high and consistent [Formula: see text] is imperative to treat acute hypoxemia. The objective of this study was to analyze the effective inspired oxygen concentration delivered by different low-flow oxygen therapy systems challenged with different oxygen flows and respiratory patterns in an experimental lung model.

Methods

An adult lung model ventilated in volume control mode simulated different respiratory patterns to obtain mean inspiratory flow of 22.5, 30.0, 37.5, or 45.0 L/min. The oxygen concentration sampled inside the lung model by nasal cannula, simple face mask, non-rebreather mask, and double-trunk mask above nasal cannula tested at oxygen flows of 10, 12.5, and 15 L/min was quantified. The 3 masks were sealed tight onto the model's airway opening. They were also tested with standardized leaks to determine their clinical performance.

Results

All oxygen delivery systems delivered higher oxygen concentration with increasing oxygen flows, regardless of the respiratory pattern. Within each device, the increase in inspiratory flow decreased oxygen concentration when using nasal cannula (P = 0.03), the simple face mask (P = 0.03), but not the non-rebreather mask (P = 0.051) nor the double-trunk mask (P = 0.13). In sealed condition, the double-trunk mask outperformed the non-rebreather mask and simple face mask (P < .001); mean oxygen concentration was 84.2%, 68.5%, and 60.8%, respectively. Leaks amplified oxygen concentration differences between the double-trunk mask and the other masks as the oxygen delivery decreased by 4.6% with simple face mask (95% CI 3.1–6.1%, P < .001), 7.8% with non-rebreather mask (95% CI 6.3–9.3%, P < .001), and 2.5% with double-trunk mask (95% CI 1–4%, P = 0.002). With leaks, the oxygen concentration provided by the simple face mask and the non-rebreather mask was similar (P = 0.15).

Conclusions

Lung oxygen concentration values delivered by the double-trunk mask were higher than those obtained with other oxygen delivery systems, especially when leaks were present.

### High-flow nasal oxygen therapy compared with conventional oxygen therapy in hospitalised patients with respiratory illness: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Suvt3]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Results

Of 17 948 abstracts screened, 63 studies (26 RCTs, 13 cross-over studies and 24 observational studies) described in 74 articles, with a total of 10 230 participants were included(figure 1).

Figure 1
PRISMA flow chart. ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; COT, conventional oxygen therapy; PRISMA, preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses; RCTs, randomised controlled trials.

Study characteristics and quality

A summary of included study characteristics is shown in online supplemental table 2, with more detailed information available in online supplemental table 3. COVID-19 was the most common cause of ARF (n = 3782), followed by pneumonia (n = 1583) (figure 1). Definitions of respiratory illnesses, as reported by the included studies, are reflected in online supplemental table 4. Overall, most studies included patients with mild-moderate degrees of hypoxaemia. Of the 17 studies that reported PaO2/FiO2 ratio as an inclusion criteria, 13 studies (76%) included patients with PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mm Hg and 4 studies (24%) accepted patients with PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mm Hg.

HFNO was most commonly administered via Fisher & Paykel Optiflow system (38 studies, 60%) and initiated at a median initial flow rate of 40 L/min (range 4–60 L/min, 34 studies). COT was initiated at a median initial flow rate of 10 L/min (range 2–15 L/min, 13 studies) and was most commonly delivered via nasal cannula (22 studies, 35%), followed by non-rebreather mask (20 studies, 32%) (table 1).

Characteristics of HFNO and COT delivery

Risk of bias

Of 26 articles reporting RCTs (25 RCTs and 1 post hoc analysis), 20 (77%) had a moderate risk of bias and 2 (8%) at high risk (online supplemental table 5 and online supplemental figure 1). Five of nine randomised cross-over studies (56%) had a moderate risk of bias, with three (33%) at high risk (online supplemental table 6 and online supplemental figure 2). All five non-randomised interventional studies were of moderate-to-high risk of bias (online supplemental table 7 and online supplemental figure 3). For the 24 included observational studies (including 1 post hoc analysis), the overall risk of bias was low to moderate (online supplemental table 8 and online supplemental figure 4).

### 100% inspired oxygen from a hudson mask-a realistic goal? [^113ScYgE]. Resuscitation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The administration of oxygen at a high-inspired concentration is often required in medicine, particularly in resuscitation of critically ill patients. However, there is a lack of evidence-based guidance on how to achieve this using currently available apparatus. The aim of this study was to assess how maximum inspired oxygen concentrations can be delivered using existing equipment.

Methods

Ten healthy female volunteers breathed oxygen through two types of Hudson non-rebreathing mask with reservoir bag, one with a safety vent in the mask body and the other with a valve replacing this safety vent (3-valve mask). Oxygen flow was adjusted to either 10 or 15 l min(-1) and the masks were fitted to the face either loosely or tightly. The expired oxygen concentration was measured using an oxygen analyzer.

Findings

By using the Hudson non-rebreathing mask with three valves, increasing the oxygen flow to 15 l min(-1), and fitting the mask tightly to the face the average expired oxygen fraction could be raised to 0.85. This equates to an average inspired oxygen fraction of 0.97 in these subjects.

Interpretation

The three simple measures mentioned above result in a significant improvement in the performance of the Hudson non-rebreathing mask. Together they allow the delivery of an inspired oxygen concentration close to maximum.

### Time to loss of preoxygenation in emergency department patients [^1141gknQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients requiring emergency rapid sequence intubation (RSI), 100% oxygen is often delivered for preoxygenation to replace alveolar nitrogen with oxygen. Sometimes, however, preoxygenation devices are prematurely removed from the patient prior to the onset of apnea, which can lead to rapid loss of preoxygenation.

Objective

We sought to determine the elapsed time, on average, between removing the oxygen source and the loss of preoxygenation among non-critically ill patients in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We conducted a prospective, crossover study of non-critically ill patients in the ED. Each patient received two identical preoxygenation trials for 4 min using a non-rebreather mask with oxygen flow at flush rate and a nasal cannula with oxygen flow at 10 L/min. After each preoxygenation trial, patients underwent two trials in random order while continuing spontaneous breathing: 1) removal of both oxygen sources and 2) removal of non-rebreather mask with nasal cannula left in place. We defined loss of preoxygenation as an end-tidal oxygen (exhaled oxygen percentage; EtO 2) value < 70%. We measured EtO 2 breath by breath until loss of preoxygenation occurred.

Results

We enrolled 42 patients, median age was 43 years (interquartile range [IQR] 30 to 54 years) and 72% were male. Median time to loss of preoxygenation was 20 s (IQR 17–25 s, 4.5 breaths) when all oxygen devices were removed, and 39 s (IQR 21–56 s, 8 breaths) when the nasal cannula was left in place.

Conclusions

In this population of non-critically ill ED patients, most had loss of preoxygenation after 5 breaths if all oxygen devices were removed, and after 8 breaths if a nasal cannula was left in place. These data suggest that during ED RSI, preoxygenation devices should be left in place until the patient is completely apneic.

### Early prolonged prone position in noninvasively ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2-related moderate-to-severe hypoxemic respiratory failure: clinical outcomes and mechanisms for treatment response in the PRO-NIV study [^112wpb7o]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Study design

Consecutive patients with acute moderate-to-severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to SARS‐CoV‐2 pneumonia treated with NIV (CPAP or Pressure Support Ventilation, PSV) and prolonged PP (experimental group), prospectively enrolled from December 16, 2020 to May 30, 2021, were compared with a group of matched historical controls, constituted by consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to SARS‐CoV‐2 pneumonia treated with NIV (CPAP or PSV) delivered in the conventional (supine) position, in the same unit from April 1, 2020 to December 15, 2020 (Additional file 1: Figure S1).

Patients

All consecutive adult patients with confirmed severe SARS‐CoV‐2 pneumonia and acute (i.e. symptom onset < 14 days of hospital admission) moderate-to-severe hypoxemic respiratory failure (defined by a paO2/FiO2 ratio < 200 mmHg while receiving O2-therapy through either a Venturi mask with FiO2 50% or a non-rebreather reservoir bag mask) admitted to HUMANITAS Gradenigo Subintensive Care Unit from April 1, 2020 to May 30, 2021, who required NIV and were able to provide informed consent were eligible for inclusion.

We excluded patients who were unable or refused to provide informed consent to treatment, were pregnant, hemodynamically unstable or needed urgent endotracheal intubation (ETI), or candidates for palliative care: inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same for both arms and are detailed in the Additional file 3.

Interventions

In both arms, patients received NIV within 24 h of admission and the duration, settings and modes of NIV were based on available literature and consolidated clinical practice.

### Effect of preoxygenation using non-invasive ventilation before intubation on subsequent organ failures in hypoxaemic patients: a randomised clinical trial [^112VPELe]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Previous data showed that non-invasive ventilation (NIV) applied for 3 min before tracheal intubation ensured better oxygenation compared with using a non-rebreather bag-valve-mask. We aimed to determine whether preoxygenation using NIV is effective in reducing the incidence of organ dysfunction in hypoxaemic, critically ill patients in intensive care.

Methods

A multicentre, randomised, open-label trial evaluating 100% FiO 2 administered with NIV (99 patients) vs with face mask (102 patients) for 3 min before tracheal intubation. The primary endpoint was the maximal value of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score within 7 days after intubation.

Results

The median (inter-quartile range) values of the maximal value of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score within 7 days post-intubation were not significantly different between the two randomised groups: nine (6–12) in the NIV group vs 10 (6–12) in the face mask group (P = 0.65). In patients treated by NIV prior to the randomisation, there was a significant increase in the occurrence in adverse events in patients randomised to face mask [odds ratio = 5.23 (1.61;16.99), P = 0.0059].

Conclusions

This study failed to demonstrate any benefits of using NIV as a preoxygenation method to reduce organ dysfunction compared with usual preoxygenation in hypoxaemic, critically ill patients requiring tracheal intubation for invasive ventilation. NIV should not be discontinued for preoxygenation in the cases of patients treated by NIV before the decision to intubate.

### Performance characteristics of the second-generation remote emergency medical oxygen closed-circuit rebreather [^116SUe8X]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Closed-circuit oxygen rebreathers may provide high concentrations of oxygen at extremely low flow rates appropriate for field use with limited oxygen supplies. The performance of the preproduction, second-generation remote emergency medical oxygen (REMO(2)) system developed for Divers Alert Network was evaluated.

Methods

The unidirectional circuit was made up of a solid, prepackaged CO(2) scrubber canister (984 ± 14 [SD] g scrubber mass), standard 22-mm-inside-diameter anesthesia circuit hoses, 5-L breathing bag, 5-cm H(2)O positive end-expiratory pressure valve, and oronasal mask. Oxygen flow, inspired oxygen, expired CO(2), peak inspired and expired mask pressures, time to reach scrubber canister saturation or "breakthrough" (postscrubber CO(2) concentration reaching 3.8 mm Hg), and subject tolerance were measured under standard laboratory conditions.

Results

Six trials were completed using healthy volunteers (94.7 ± 19.6 kg). Five of the 6 completed trials did not reach breakthrough at the planned trial limit of 8 hours. Mean average oxygen flow rate was 1.00 ± 0.17 L x min(-1). Mean peak inspired and expired mask pressures were -5.0 ± 1.9 and 6.5 ± 1.9 cm H(2)O, respectively. Subjects generally reported good tolerance to circuit breathing.

Conclusions

The second-generation REMO(2) was well tolerated by healthy subjects during 8-hour laboratory evaluation trials. The device provided high mean inspired oxygen fractions at low mean oxygen flow rates, relatively modest mean maximal inspired and expired pressures, and excellent scrubber canister duration. Further evaluation of field performance with a patient population is warranted.

### Medical masks versus N95 respirators for preventing COVID-19 among health care workers: a randomized trial [^114eHvDh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

It is uncertain if medical masks offer similar protection against COVID-19 compared with N95 respirators.

Objective

To determine whether medical masks are noninferior to N95 respirators to prevent COVID-19 in health care workers providing routine care.

Design

Multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04296643).

Setting

29 health care facilities in Canada, Israel, Pakistan, and Egypt from 4 May 2020 to 29 March 2022.

Participants

1009 health care workers who provided direct care to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

Intervention

Use of medical masks versus fit-tested N95 respirators for 10 weeks, plus universal masking, which was the policy implemented at each site.

Measurements

The primary outcome was confirmed COVID-19 on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.

Results

In the intention-to-treat analysis, RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 occurred in 52 of 497 (10.46%) participants in the medical mask group versus 47 of 507 (9.27%) in the N95 respirator group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.14 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.69]). An unplanned subgroup analysis by country found that in the medical mask group versus the N95 respirator group RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 occurred in 8 of 131 (6.11%) versus 3 of 135 (2.22%) in Canada (HR, 2.83 [CI, 0.75 to 10.72]), 6 of 17 (35.29%) versus 4 of 17 (23.53%) in Israel (HR, 1.54 [CI, 0.43 to 5.49]), 3 of 92 (3.26%) versus 2 of 94 (2.13%) in Pakistan (HR, 1.50 [CI, 0.25 to 8.98]), and 35 of 257 (13.62%) versus 38 of 261 (14.56%) in Egypt (HR, 0.95 [CI, 0.60 to 1.50]). There were 47 (10.8%) adverse events related to the intervention reported in the medical mask group and 59 (13.6%) in the N95 respirator group.

Limitation

Potential acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 through household and community exposure, heterogeneity between countries, uncertainty in the estimates of effect, differences in self-reported adherence, differences in baseline antibodies, and between-country differences in circulating variants and vaccination.

Conclusion

Among health care workers who provided routine care to patients with COVID-19, the overall estimates rule out a doubling in hazard of RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 for medical masks when compared with HRs of RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 for N95 respirators. The subgroup results varied by country, and the overall estimates may not be applicable to individual countries because of treatment effect heterogeneity.

### COVID-19 respiratory support in the emergency department setting [^112MM1Lt]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may result in severe complications, multiorgan dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, and death. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and places healthcare workers at significant risk, especially during aerosol-generating procedures, including airway management.

Objective

This narrative review outlines the underlying respiratory pathophysiology of patients with COVID-19 and discusses approaches to airway management in the emergency department (ED) based on current literature.

Discussion

Patients presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection are at high risk for acute respiratory failure requiring airway management. Among hospitalized patients, 10–20% require intensive care unit admission, and 3–10% require intubation and mechanical ventilation. While providing respiratory support for these patients, proper infection control measures, including adherence to personal protective equipment policies, are necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers. A structured approach to respiratory failure in these patients includes the use of exogenous oxygen via nasal cannula or non-rebreather, as well as titrated high-flow nasal cannula and non-invasive ventilation. This review offers several guiding principles and resources designed to be adapted in conjunction with local workplace policies for patients requiring respiratory support.

Conclusions

While the fundamental principles of acute respiratory failure management are similar between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, there are some notable differences, including a focus on provider safety. This review provides an approach to airway management and respiratory support in the patient with COVID-19.

(Strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remark: Despite the very low quality and indirect evidence supporting this recommendation, the IDSA guideline panel placed a high value on avoiding serious harms to exposed healthcare personnel.

### Noninvasive ventilation for preoxygenation during emergency intubation [^114nM4DU]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study PREOXI was published by Kevin W Gibbs and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Endotracheal intubation and Critical illness. In the PREOXI study, the trial question was: what is the role of noninvasive ventilation for preoxygenation in critically ill patients undergoing tracheal intubation? In the PREOXI study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PREOXI study, the population was: 1301 patients (515 female, 786 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy; incarceration; receipt of positive-pressure ventilation; apnea or hypopnea; immediate need for tracheal intubation. In the PREOXI study, the interventions were: n = 645 noninvasive ventilation (administration of noninvasive ventilation using a tight-fitting mask connected to either a conventional mechanical ventilator or a dedicated noninvasive ventilator) n = 656 oxygen mask (administration of supplemental oxygen using either a nonrebreather mask or bag-mask device without manual ventilation). In the PREOXI study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in hypoxemia during intubation (9.1% vs. 18.5%; ARD -9.4, 95% CI -13.2 to -5.6). In the PREOXI study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in median lowest oxygen saturation (99% vs. 97%; AD 2%, 95% CI 1 to 3) Significant decrease in lowest oxygen saturation < 80% (6.2% vs. 13.2%; ARD -6.9, 95% CI -10.2 to -3.7) No significant difference in cardiovascular collapse (17.5% vs. 19.4%; ARD -1.8, 95% CI -6.1 to 2.4). In the PREOXI study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in aspiration, new infiltrate on chest imaging, new pneumothorax. In the PREOXI study, the conclusion was: in critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation, noninvasive ventilation was superior to oxygen mask with respect to hypoxemia during intubation.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on infection prevention for health care personnel caring for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 [^11629Jyt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America COVID-19 infection prevention — evidence for N95 respirators or surgical masks is derived from observational studies, with the best evidence coming from a single comparative cohort study rated up for both large magnitude of effect and a suspected dose-response gradient based on the association between duration of mask/respirator use and size of protective effect. Although that study had concerns with residual confounding that could have only decreased the already large effect, the overall certainty of evidence was moderate, and additional studies with risk of bias or indirectness showed a consistent trend towards a protective effect when masks were used.

### Burden of bronchiolitis post-COVID-19 pandemic in children less than 2 years old in 2021–2024: experience from a tertiary center in Saudi Arabia [^112Xsyqt]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome measured was the frequency of hospitalizations due to bronchiolitis during winter, specifically from September 1 to March 31, 2021–2024. Secondary outcomes included the duration of in-hospital and pediatric intensive care (PICU) stay as well as the requirement for oxygen, non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS), or mechanical ventilation (MV). NIRS involves the application of low-flow oxygen therapy, non-rebreather mask, HFNC, or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Data on the duration of each instance of respiratory support were collected. Virological results and the types of tests conducted, specifically for RSV and co-infections, were documented. We documented the distribution of hospitalizations across the winter seasons.

Statistical analysis

Continuous variables are expressed as means with standard deviations, whereas categorical variables are expressed as frequencies and percentages. Statistical comparisons between groups, such as RSV-positive versus non-RSV and PICU-admitted versus non-PICU patients, were conducted using the Chi-square test to identify the potential risk factors associated with illness severity. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 22 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA).

### Pre-oxygenation: implications in emergency airway management [^1132tqmi]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Transient oxygen desaturation during emergency department intubation is an event with potentially devastating consequences. Pre-oxygenation is an important means of increasing a patient's oxygen reserve and duration of safe apnea prior to intubation. In the emergent setting, important modifications to pre-oxygenation techniques need to be considered to best manage critically ill patients. In this review, we discuss recent updates in pre-oxygenation techniques and evaluate the evidence supporting both commonly used and newly emerging techniques for pre-oxygenation, assessing nature and level of illness, the best delivery method of oxygen, using delayed sequence intubation in patients who cannot tolerate non-invasive pre-oxygenation and using apneic oxygenation via nasal cannula and non-rebreather mask during intubation.

### Longitudinal analysis reveals that delayed bystander CD8 + T cell activation and early immune pathology distinguish severe COVID-19 from mild disease [^113WxSsE]. Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

Participants in group A were further sub-grouped according to whether they were completely asymptomatic (n = 8), or had had any of the above COVID-19 symptoms before PCR testing (n = 10, median time from symptoms to COVID-19 PCR test 26 days, range 9–42 days).

Group B participants included both staff who were self-isolating because of COVID-19 symptoms (n = 30), and staff members who were reporting fit for duty, but had some symptoms that did not reach the threshold for self-isolation at that time (n = 10).

Hospital patients were assigned to 3 severity groups, mainly reflecting the maximum intensity of respiratory support for COVID-19 received during their hospital stay:

- **group C**: did not receive any supplemental oxygen. Five patients were discharged soon after initial diagnosis and assessment but followed up as part of the study.
- **group D**: received supplemental oxygen using low flow nasal prongs, simple face mask, Venturi mask or non-rebreather face mask.
- **group E**: received any of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), mechanical ventilation or ECMO. Patients who received supplemental oxygen (but no ventilation) and deceased in hospital were also assigned to group E.

In patients who were already established on home NIV for chronic respiratory failure, NIV delivered as per the home prescription (e.g. nocturnal) was not considered for the purpose of classification. Moreover, oxygen requirements that were clearly not related to COVID-19 were also not considered for classification purposes. In particular, 2 cases who received low flow supplemental oxygen for non-COVID-19 indications (ascitic splinting in decompensated cirrhosis in one case, and recovery from anesthesia after orthopedic surgery in the other) were assigned to group C. Cases in group C were further sub-classified according to chest radiology results (X-ray and, if available, CT scan), as:

- **Abnormal radiology**: chest X-ray/ CT scan showed changes compatible with COVID-19
- **Normal radiology**: chest X-ray/ CT scan did not show any abnormality compatible with COVID-19 (reported as normal or showing lung changes diagnostic of conditions other than COVID-19).

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^112xqkFF]. Neonatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Non-Invasive Respiratory Support

Preterm infants should be managed without MV where possible and if needed, time on MV should be minimised. CPAP has been successfully used for > 50 years for stabilising preterm infants, in both high- and middle-to-low-income settings. CPAP improves lung volume, especially functional residual capacity. The increased positive distending airway pressure improves oxygenation, decreases apnoea, and reduces the work of breathing. Thus, CPAP is recommended as the first choice for primary and secondary respiratory support. However, alternative modes of NIV are increasingly being tested in clinical trials against CPAP as the gold standard.

CPAP involves delivering gas, ideally heated and humidified, with a measurable and controllable pressure which is transmitted using an interface such as short soft nasal prongs or mask, connected tightly to the baby's face creating a seal. CPAP pressures are typically set between 5 and 9 cm H 2 O. Increasing airway pressure provides several benefits including splinting the upper airway, maintaining lung expansion, and preventing end-expiratory alveolar collapse. Other benefits include reduced apnoea rates, improved tidal volumes, higher functional residual capacity, and reduced work of breathing. Higher pressures improve oxygenation but potentially increase risk of air leaks. An underwater seal or "bubble CPAP", to generate the pressure, causes small fluctuations around the set pressure which some believe offers the additional advantage of improved CO 2 washout. When weaning babies from CPAP, a gradual reduction in pressure rather than sudden cessation of CPAP results in greater likelihood of success.

### 2023 American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics focused update on neonatal resuscitation: an update to the American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^116cscBp]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Neonatal resuscitation ventilation devices and interfaces — Using a T-piece resuscitator to deliver positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) is preferred to the use of a self-inflating bag. Because both T-piece resuscitators and flow-inflating bags require a compressed gas source to function, a self-inflating bag should be available as a backup in the event of compressed gas failure when using either of these devices. Use of a supraglottic airway may be considered as the primary interface to administer PPV instead of a face mask for newborn infants delivered at ≥ 34 0/7 weeks' gestation.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^111HSXqf]. Neonatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Using a flow driver to generate CPAP has the theoretical advantage of offloading expiratory work of breathing, although no important clinical differences have been shown in clinical trials among various CPAP devices. The simplicity of bubble CPAP systems allows their use in low-income settings with some evidence of benefit over free-flowing oxygen. Leaks between the interface and nose are common with both nasal prongs and masks but somewhat less with prongs. All CPAP interfaces carry risk of facial distortion and nasal trauma.

Bi-level CPAP, Duo-PAP, or BIPAP are variants between CPAP and IPPV that use low pressure differences between inspiratory and expiratory phases at PIPs of 9–11 cm H 2 O at rates of around 20–40 per minute with long inspiratory times of up to 1.0 s. There is no evidence that BIPAP confers any advantage over CPAP, and any clinical differences may simply reflect a higher overall mean airway pressure. Modern ventilators provide NIPPV using pressures similar to those used for invasive MV. Challenges of NIPPV relate to pressure delivery through a non-sealed system, which is limited by leak at the nasal interface and the infant's tolerance to gas inflation of the stomach. Ventilator inflations can be synchronised with the infant's breathing by using either an abdominal capsule or in-line sensors. Synchronisation of nasal ventilation further improves respiratory stability. Recent systematic reviews comparing different modes of NIV for primary respiratory support or post-extubation concluded that synchronised NIPPV was the most effective, decreasing the need for MV, or re-ventilation, in preterm infants.

### Preoxygenation strategies for endotracheal intubation in resource-limited settings: reframing the basics [^111QhbwD]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Preoxygenation strategies using available devices in low-resource settings. BMV: bag-mask ventilation; CPAP: continuous positive airway pressure; ETI: endotracheal intubation; FiO₂: fraction of inspired oxygen; HFNC: high-flow nasal cannula; IAH: intra-abdominal hypertension; IBW: ideal body weight; MV: mechanical ventilation; NIV: noninvasive ventilation; NRM: non-rebreather mask; P/F: PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio; PEEP: positive end-expiratory pressure; RR: respiratory rate; S/F: SpO₂/FiO₂ ratio; VCV: volume-controlled ventilation; VT: tidal volume

Future studies should focus on validating simplified, cost-effective devices, such as flush rate nasal cannulas, basic CPAP systems, BVM with PEEP valves, and Mapleson C circuits as practical alternatives to advanced equipment in LRS. The development of standardized, low-complexity preoxygenation protocols and context-specific training modules will be essential to enhance patient safety where HFNC and NIPPV are not routinely available.
