## Question

What antibiotics can be used to treat colitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotics can be used to treat colitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "colitis" means clinically and whether we are dealing with infectious colitis, inflammatory colitis, or other etiologies. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence and guidelines for each scenario, especially ulcerative colitis, Clostridioides difficile infection, and pouchitis. Next, I will examine the specific antibiotics studied and their roles, and finally, I will synthesize a cautious, reference-aware recommendation with dosing and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: "colitis" is not a single disease but an umbrella term encompassing infectious colitis (notably C. difficile), inflammatory colitis (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), ischemic colitis, drug-induced colitis, and microscopic colitis. Antibiotics are relevant in some of these but not all, so I need to ensure I match therapy to etiology rather than use antibiotics indiscriminately.

> For ulcerative colitis, I should double-check the highest-certainty evidence. The 2022 Cochrane review of 12 RCTs found high-certainty evidence that antibiotics are no better than placebo for inducing remission in UC, and low-certainty evidence for no difference in clinical response or serious adverse events, so routine antibiotics are not recommended for induction or maintenance in UC [^f1cb89d1]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some older or smaller studies suggested signals with broad-spectrum regimens, but the Cochrane synthesis overrides those exploratory findings, and contemporary guidelines align with this, advising against antibiotics for induction or maintenance in moderate-to-severe UC and in acute severe UC without infection [^70926eb9] [^a247db76] [^36da822c] [^ec30528e].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance for acute severe UC. Guidelines allow that if there is systemic toxicity or suspected extracolonic infection, antibiotics may be used for the infection, but not to treat the underlying UC inflammatory process itself; otherwise, routine broad-spectrum antibiotics should be avoided in ASUC without infection, and four trials in ASUC showed no benefit from adjunctive antibiotics on response or colectomy rates [^b5c7fe74] [^08ba65be]. I should confirm that this applies even when patients are on immunosuppression; yes, the recommendation stands regardless of concomitant steroids or biologics, with antibiotics reserved for documented infection or systemic toxicity concerns [^70926eb9].

> For Clostridioides difficile colitis, I need to check first-line therapy and severity stratification. Current guidelines recommend oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin as first-line for initial CDI, with vancomycin preferred in severe disease and fidaxomicin associated with lower recurrence; metronidazole is no longer first-line in adults due to lower efficacy, though it may be considered for mild cases if access is limited [^f037355f] [^b0ae6c74]. Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence: multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show vancomycin superiority over metronidazole overall, and fidaxomicin superiority to vancomycin for sustained cure, which supports choosing vancomycin or fidaxomicin up front when available [^86aeccbe] [^c78f4879].

> I will now examine fulminant C. difficile colitis. In severe or fulminant disease with ileus or systemic toxicity, dual therapy with high-dose oral or rectal vancomycin plus intravenous metronidazole is recommended, with early surgical consultation and consideration of colectomy or diverting loop ileostomy with lavage if medical therapy fails; this approach is consistently endorsed by surgical and infectious disease guidelines [^21521990] [^150d858c] [^6fc90925]. Let me reconsider whether IV vancomycin helps; no, IV vancomycin is not effective for colonic CDI because it does not reach the lumen, so oral or rectal vancomycin is required for local effect [^e6fab019].

> For pouchitis after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, I should confirm that antibiotics are actually indicated. Yes, guidelines suggest antibiotics for acute pouchitis, with ciprofloxacin or metronidazole for 2–4 weeks as first-line; combination therapy may be used if single-agent therapy fails, and chronic antibiotic-dependent pouchitis may warrant chronic or rotating antibiotics with the lowest effective dose and intermittent breaks to mitigate resistance risk [^255899e1] [^9259e026] [^7c4d736e]. Hold on, I should verify the evidence base: small RCTs and observational data support antibiotic benefit in acute pouchitis, though certainty is low, which is why recommendations are conditional and emphasize individualized risk–benefit assessment [^9259e026].

> But wait, what if the "colitis" is microscopic colitis or drug-induced colitis? I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize. For microscopic colitis, guidelines state insufficient evidence to recommend antibiotics, so antibiotics are not indicated. For drug-induced colitis, management is withdrawal of the offending agent and supportive care, not antibiotics. And for ischemic colitis, antibiotics are not routinely indicated unless there is superinfection or perforation risk, so I should avoid reflex antibiotic use in these scenarios [^ef6db616] [^13aae27e].

> Let me synthesize a practical, etiology-specific approach. Do not use antibiotics for ulcerative colitis flares in the absence of infection. Treat C. difficile colitis with vancomycin or fidaxomicin, escalate to combination therapy with high-dose oral/rectal vancomycin plus IV metronidazole if fulminant, and involve surgery early if failing. Treat pouchitis with ciprofloxacin or metronidazole for 2–4 weeks, consider combinations if refractory, and reserve chronic or rotating antibiotics for chronic antibiotic-dependent disease. Otherwise, avoid antibiotics unless there is a documented infection or a guideline-supported indication, given risks of dysbiosis and resistance [^f1cb89d1] [^f037355f] [^21521990] [^255899e1].

> I should double-check dosing details I'm implying. For CDI, vancomycin 125 mg orally four times daily for 10–14 days is standard, with 500 mg every 6 hours orally or by enema plus IV metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours for fulminant disease; fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 days is an alternative with lower recurrence. For pouchitis, ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily or metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 2–4 weeks is typical, with combination regimens such as ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole or ciprofloxacin plus tinidazole considered if response is suboptimal, and chronic regimens individualized with intermittent breaks to limit resistance [^f037355f] [^21521990] [^255899e1] [^7c4d736e].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety and stewardship are front and center. Antibiotics can precipitate or worsen C. difficile, so I should minimize unnecessary exposure, reassess the need for concomitant non-CDI antibiotics in patients with CDI, and prefer agents with less microbiome disruption when treating CDI, such as fidaxomicin when available. In UC, avoid antibiotics unless there is a clear infectious indication, and in pouchitis, use the lowest effective dose with drug holidays to reduce resistance and adverse effects [^7d1e93ea] [^f037355f] [^7c4d736e].

Antibiotics are not routinely used for colitis unless there is a specific infection or complication. For **ulcerative colitis**, antibiotics are not recommended for induction or maintenance of remission [^f1cb89d1] [^a247db76] [^36da822c]; reserve them for severe flares with systemic toxicity or suspected infection [^b5c7fe74] [^ebe74ade]. For **C. difficile colitis**, use oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin as first-line therapy [^f037355f] [^b0ae6c74]; metronidazole is an alternative only if first-line agents are unavailable [^b0ae6c74]. For **pouchitis**, short courses of ciprofloxacin or metronidazole are first-line [^255899e1] [^9259e026]; chronic or recurrent cases may need rotating antibiotics or advanced therapies [^544e43f6] [^2ac27f39]. Avoid routine antibiotics in microscopic colitis [^ef6db616] and ischemic colitis unless infection is suspected.

## Indications for antibiotic use in colitis

Antibiotics are **not routinely indicated** for colitis; their use is limited to specific scenarios:

- **Infectious colitis**: Particularly C. difficile infection (CDI) [^f037355f], which is a common and serious complication in patients with colitis [^ce026dcc].
- **Severe ulcerative colitis (UC) flares**: Antibiotics may be considered in severe UC with systemic toxicity or suspected infection, but routine use is not recommended [^b5c7fe74] [^70926eb9].
- **Pouchitis**: Antibiotics are first-line therapy for acute pouchitis following ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) [^255899e1] [^9259e026].

---

## Antibiotics for specific colitis conditions

### Ulcerative colitis (UC)

- **Routine use**: Not recommended for induction or maintenance of remission [^f1cb89d1] [^a247db76] [^36da822c].
- **Severe flares**: Consider antibiotics only if there is systemic toxicity or suspected infection [^b5c7fe74] [^ebe74ade].
- **Evidence**: High-certainty evidence shows no benefit of antibiotics over placebo for induction of remission [^f1cb89d1].

---

### Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI)

- **First-line therapy**: Oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin [^f037355f] [^b0ae6c74].
- **Alternative**: Metronidazole only if first-line agents are unavailable [^b0ae6c74].
- **Fulminant disease**: High-dose vancomycin (oral or rectal) plus intravenous metronidazole [^21521990] [^150d858c].
- **Recurrent CDI**: Fidaxomicin or vancomycin taper; consider fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) [^f037355f] [^78f27519].

---

### Pouchitis

- **First-line therapy**: Ciprofloxacin or metronidazole for 2–4 weeks [^255899e1] [^9259e026].
- **Chronic or recurrent pouchitis**: Rotating antibiotics or advanced immunosuppressive therapies (e.g. vedolizumab) [^544e43f6] [^2ac27f39].
- **Evidence**: Moderate evidence supports antibiotic efficacy in acute pouchitis [^9259e026].

---

### Microscopic colitis and ischemic colitis

Routine antibiotics are **not recommended** unless infection is suspected or confirmed [^ef6db616].

---

## Risks and considerations

Antibiotic use in colitis carries risks, including:

- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Antibiotics can disrupt the gut microbiota, increasing CDI risk [^74e7b5ae].
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Prolonged or inappropriate use can promote resistance [^e086aef0].
- **Adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, and rare severe reactions [^86aeccbe].

## Summary of antibiotic recommendations

| **Colitis condition** | **Antibiotic indication** | **Recommended antibiotics** |
|-|-|-|
| Ulcerative colitis | Only in severe flares with systemic toxicity or suspected infection | - Ciprofloxacin <br/> - Metronidazole <br/> - Broad-spectrum antibiotics |
| Clostridioides difficile infection | First-line therapy | - Vancomycin <br/> - Fidaxomicin <br/> - Metronidazole (alternative) |
| Pouchitis | First-line therapy | - Ciprofloxacin <br/> - Metronidazole |
| Microscopic colitis | Not recommended unless infection suspected | None |
| Ischemic colitis | Not recommended unless infection suspected | None |

---

Antibiotics are **not routinely used** for colitis and should be reserved for specific indications such as C. difficile infection, severe UC flares with systemic toxicity, or pouchitis. Routine antibiotic use is discouraged due to lack of efficacy and potential risks.

Background

Antibiotics have been considered to treat ulcerative colitis (UC) due to their antimicrobial properties against intestinal bacteria linked to inflammation. However, there are concerns about their efficacy and safety.

Objectives

To determine whether antibiotic therapy is safe and effective for the induction and maintenance of remission in people with UC.

Search Methods

We searched five electronic databases on 10 December 2021 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic therapy to placebo or an active comparator.

Selection Criteria

We considered people with UC of all ages, treated with antibiotics of any type, dose, and route of administration for inclusion. Induction studies required a minimum duration of two weeks for inclusion. Maintenance studies required a minimum duration of three months to be considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome for induction studies was failure to achieve remission and for maintenance studies was relapse, as defined by the primary studies.

Main Results

We included 12 RCTs (847 participants). One maintenance of remission study used sole antibiotic therapy compared with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). All other trials used concurrent medications or standard care regimens and antibiotics as an adjunct therapy or compared antibiotics with other adjunct therapies to examine the effect on induction of remission. There is high certainty evidence that antibiotics (154/304 participants) compared to placebo (175/304 participants) result in no difference in failure to achieve clinical remission (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.06). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids, steroids plus 5-ASA, or steroids plus 5-ASA plus probiotics were used as additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (102/168 participants) compared to placebo (121/175 participants) may result in no difference in failure to achieve clinical response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.22). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids or steroids plus 5-ASA were used as additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (6/342 participants) compared to placebo (5/349 participants) may result in no difference in serious adverse events (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.71). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids were additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (3/342 participants) compared to placebo (1/349 participants) may result in no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 2.06, 95% CI 0.27 to 15.72). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids or steroids plus 5-ASA were additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics in combination with probiotics compared to no treatment or placebo for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.19), serious adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.08), or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.08). The certainty of the evidence is very low. It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to 5-ASA for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.14). The certainty of the evidence is very low. It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to probiotics for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.94). The certainty of the evidence is very low. It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to 5-ASA for failure to maintain clinical remission (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.06). The certainty of the evidence is very low. It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to no treatment for failure to achieve clinical remission in a mixed population of people with active and inactive disease (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07). The certainty of the evidence is very low. For all other outcomes, no effects could be estimated due to a lack of data.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high certainty evidence that there is no difference between antibiotics and placebo in the proportion of people who achieve clinical remission at the end of the intervention period. However, there is evidence that there may be a greater proportion of people who achieve clinical remission and probably a greater proportion who achieve clinical response with antibiotics when compared with placebo at 12 months. There may be no difference in serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events between antibiotics and placebo. No clear conclusions can be drawn for any other comparisons. A clear direction for future research appears to be comparisons of antibiotics and placebo (in addition to standard therapies) with longer-term measurement of outcomes. Additionally. As there were single studies of other head-to-head comparisons, there may be scope for future studies in this area.

### Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease with antibiotics [^45db398c]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Although antibiotics are clearly recognized as having a role in treating the infectious complications of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), their impact in the primary treatment of IBD has long been an area of speculation. Over the past decade there is increasing evidence that luminal gut bacteria play a role in the pathogenesis of IBD, particularly Crohn's disease. Compelling evidence that normal commensal bacteria induce chronic intestinal inflammation in susceptible rodents provides an excellent rationale for treatment of human IBD with antibiotics. This article summarizes published studies of antibiotics in IBD patients and reviews available data for the use of antibiotic therapy in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

### Antibiotics in IBD: still a role in the biological era? [^58f83e39]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Despite compelling evidence pointing to a critical role of gut microflora in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis, the role of antibiotics in clinical practice remains limited, largely due to heterogeneous trials with often conflicting evidence. In this review, we revisit previous randomized controlled trials and high-quality uncontrolled studies in an effort to better elucidate the role of antibiotics in contemporary treatment algorithms. The most established role of antibiotics is in perianal Crohn's disease (CD), utilizing ciprofloxacin with or without metronidazole often as an adjunct to biological therapy. Evidence also points to a likely modest role of various antibiotic classes in mild to moderate luminal CD, including ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, azithromycin, and rifaximin. The benefit of metronidazole in preventing postoperative recurrence in CD is well reported; however, the long-term benefit of this intervention remains uncertain. The use of antibiotics in ulcerative colitis (UC) is even more controversial, but studies using broad-spectrum oral antibiotic cocktails have reported a possible role in acute severe colitis and chronic persistent UC. Similarly, the role of oral vancomycin and gentamicin in very early-onset IBD has interesting preliminary results. Adverse events of antibiotics, the resulting alterations in the microbiome with its associated unknown long-term sequela, and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains must be carefully balanced. Therefore, although antibiotics may be underused in the treatment of IBD, their integration into clinical practice must be approached judiciously and individually.

### Use of antibiotics in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [^b6265bce]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

An increasing amount of evidence suggests that enteric flora may have a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients with IBD appear to have an altered composition of luminal bacteria that may provide the stimulus for the chronic inflammation characterizing IBD. The suspected role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of IBD provides the rationale for using agents, such as antibiotics, that alter the intestinal flora. However, there remains much uncertainty about the optimal use of antibiotics in the treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis. This article reviews the literature and presents a clinical model for the use of antibiotics in IBD.

### Antibiotics and probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: why, when, and how [^fc114fca]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize recent evidence on the role of intestinal bacteria in inflammatory bowel diseases, and of antibiotics and probiotics in their treatment. The implications connected with the use of antibiotics are also examined.

Recent Findings

The hypothesis that Mycobacterium paratuberculosis could be a causative agent of Crohn's disease has not been confirmed by a large trial on symptomatic patients treated by a combination of antibiotics active against this bacterium. An increased number of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli have been found in the intestinal tissue of patients with Crohn's disease, but their role in the pathogenesis of this condition remains to be defined. The combination of metronidazole and azathioprine, associating the effects of a reduced bacterial load with immunosuppression, appears to be a therapeutic option to decrease the recurrence of postoperative Crohn's disease in high-risk patients. However, concerns are raised by the possibility that antibiotics may induce disease relapse due to Clostridium difficile infection.

Summary

Recent literature provides increasing support for the use of antibiotics in Crohn's disease, although the side effects limit their long-term use. The efficacy of antibiotics in ulcerative colitis is not confirmed by the available literature, except in severe colitis. More trials are needed to support the use of probiotics as therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.

### Study of antibiotics in the treatment of colonic Crohn's disease… [^171ee67e]. ClinicalTrials (2005). Low credibility.

Among such strategies is the use of a combination of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin. These broad-spectrum antibiotics control CD symptoms by acting on the intestinal bacteria that can contribute to chronic inflammation. More investigation is needed to firmly establish the usefulness of this therapy because previous clinical trials have given mixed results, although they have suggested that antibiotics can be particularly useful in cases of Crohn's colitis. Because these earlier studies have lacked a large enough patient population with colonic involvement, a trial focusing on this CD subgroup with a sufficient number of subjects will help to clarify the value of combining metronidazole and ciprofloxacin. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that combination antibiotic therapy is effective in the treatment of CD involving the colon.

The study will compare the use of combination therapy consisting of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin with placebo and will examine the results of treatment at the end of 8 weeks of treatment. In order to better justify the use of antibiotics in the treatment of Crohn's disease, the Antibiotics for Colonic Crohn's Disease trial has been designed to determine if ciprofloxacin and metronidazole combination therapy is effective in the treatment of active Crohn's disease of the colon. This two arm, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study will involve 136 patients with mild to moderate active Crohn's disease of the colon, as defined by a Crohn's Disease Activity Index score between 220 and 450.

Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of two treatment regimens: ciprofloxacin and metronidazole or placebo. Treatment will be continued for a period of 8 weeks.
- Patients who have received, i)any antibiotic within 2 weeks of the screening visit, ii)systemic corticosteroid therapy within 2 weeks of the screening visit, iii)parenteral nutritional therapy within 2 weeks of the screening visit, iv)enteral elemental or polymeric nutritional therapy or exclusively liquid diet.

### Antibiotic treatment for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in adults [^4e4b9077]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Clostridium difficile is recognized as a frequent cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to investigate the efficacy of antibiotic therapy for C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD).

Search Strategy

MEDLINE (1966 to March 24, 2010), EMBASE (1980 to March 24, 2010), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register were searched using the following search terms: "pseudomembranous colitis and randomized trial"; "Clostridium difficile and randomized trial"; "antibiotic associated diarrhea and randomized trial".

Selection Criteria

Only randomized, controlled trials assessing antibiotic treatment for CDAD were included in the review. The following outcomes were sought: initial resolution of diarrhea; initial conversion of stool to cytotoxin and/or culture negative; recurrence of diarrhea; recurrence of fecal evidence of CDAD; patient response to cessation of prior antibiotic therapy; emergent surgery; and death.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed abstracts and full text articles for inclusion. The risk of bias was independently rated by two authors. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived from each study and summary statistics obtained when appropriate, using a fixed effects model, except where significant heterogeneity was detected, at which time a random effects model was used.

Main Results

Fifteen studies (total of 1152 participants) with CDAD were included. Nine different antibiotics were investigated: vancomycin, metronidazole, fusidic acid, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, rifampin, rifaximin, bacitracin and fidaxomicin (OPT-80). Most of the studies were active comparator studies comparing vancomycin with other antibiotics. The risk of bias was rated as high for 12 of 15 included studies. Patients with severe CDAD were often excluded from the included studies. In the only placebo-controlled trial vancomycin was found to be superior to placebo for treatment of CDAD for initial symptomatic cure. Initial symptomatic cure was achieved in 41% of vancomycin patients compared to 4% of placebo patients (1 study; 44 patients; RR 9.00; 95% CI 1.24 to 65.16). Vancomycin was significantly superior to placebo for initial bacteriologic response. Initial bacteriologic response was achieved in 45% of vancomycin patients compared to 4% of placebo patients (1 study; 44 patients; RR 10.00; 95% CI 1.40 to 71.62). The results of this study should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients and high risk of bias. No statistically significant differences in efficacy were found between vancomycin and metronidazole, vancomycin and fusidic acid, vancomycin and nitazoxanide, or vancomycin and rifaximin. No statistically significant differences in efficacy were found between metronidazole and nitazoxanide or metronidazole and fusidic acid. Vancomycin was significantly superior to bacitracin for initial bacteriologic response. Initial bacteriologic response was achieved in 48% of vancomycin patients compared to 25% of bacitracin patients (2 studies; 104 patients; RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.86). Teicoplanin, an antibiotic of limited availability and great cost, was significantly superior to vancomycin for initial bacteriologic response and cure. Initial bacteriologic response was achieved in 62% of vancomycin patients compared to 87% of teicoplanin patients (2 studies; 110 patients; RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.81). Bacteriologic cure was achieved in 45% of vancomycin patients compared to 82% of teicoplanin patients (2 studies; 110 patients; RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.19 to 2.78). These results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients and the high risk of bias in the two studies in the pooled analysis. Teicoplanin was significantly superior to metronidazole for initial bacteriologic response. Initial bacteriologic response was achieved in 71% of metronidazole patients compared to 93% of teicoplanin patients (1 study; 59 patients; RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.98). This result should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients and high risk of bias in the study. Only one study investigated synergistic antibiotic combination, metronidazole and rifampin, and no advantage was demonstrated for the drug combination. This result should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients and high risk of bias in the study. Adverse events including surgery and death occurred infrequently in the included studies. There was a total of 18 deaths among 1152 patients in this systematic review. Among the studies that commented on the cause of mortality the deaths were attributed to underlying disease rather than CDAD or antibiotic treatment. One study reported a partial colectomy after failed CDAD treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence leads to uncertainty whether mild CDAD needs to be treated. The studies provide little evidence for antibiotic treatment of severe CDAD as many studies excluded these patients. Considering the two goals of therapy: improvement of the patient's clinical condition and prevention of spread of C. difficile infection to other patients, one should choose the antibiotic that brings both symptomatic cure and bacteriologic cure. A recommendation to achieve these goals cannot be made because of the small numbers of patients in the included studies and the high risk of bias in these studies, especially related to dropouts. Most of the active comparator studies found no statistically significant difference in efficacy between vancomycin and other antibiotics including metronidazole, fusidic acid, nitazoxanide or rifaximin. Teicoplanin may be an attractive choice but for its limited availability (Teicoplanin is not available in the USA) and great cost relative to the other options. More research of antibiotic treatment and other treatment modalities of CDAD is required.

### An update on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated disease [^1336d417]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is an important cause of nosocomial morbidity and mortality and is implicated in recent epidemics. Data support the treatment of colitis with oral metronidazole in a dose of 1.0 to 1.5 g/d, with oral vancomycin as a second-line agent, not because its efficacy is questioned but because of environmental concerns. Nitazoxanide and other drugs are currently under intense study as alternatives. Treatment of asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Current management strategies appear to be increasingly ineffective, especially for patients who experience multiple recurrences. Biotherapy and vaccination are currently being explored as treatment options for patients who have recurrent disease. Greater attention should be paid to hospital infection control policies and restriction of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

### Antibiotic treatment for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in adults [^c8f2de42]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is recognized as a frequent cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to establish the efficacy of antibiotic therapy for C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), to identify the most effective antibiotic treatment for CDAD in adults and to determine the need for stopping the causative antibiotic during therapy.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE (1966 to 2003), EMBASE (1980 to 2003), Cochrane Central Database of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane IBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register were searched using the following search terms: "pseudomembranous colitis and randomized trial"; "Clostridium difficile and randomized trial"; "antibiotic associated diarrhea and randomized trial".

Selection Criteria

Only randomized, controlled trials assessing antibiotic treatment for CDAD were included in the review. Probiotic trials are excluded. The following outcomes were sought: initial resolution of diarrhea; initial conversion of stool to C. difficile cytotoxin and/or stool culture negative; recurrence of diarrhea; recurrence of fecal C. difficile cytotoxin and/or positive stool culture; patient response to cessation of prior antibiotic therapy; sepsis; emergent surgery: fecal diversion or colectomy; and death.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were analyzed using the MetaView statistical package in Review Manager. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived from each study. When appropriate, the results of included studies were combined for each outcome. For dichotomous outcomes, pooled RR and 95% CI were calculated using a fixed effect model, except where significant heterogeneity was detected, at which time the random effects model was used. Data heterogeneity was calculated using MetaView.

Main Results

Of eleven studies identified, two were subsequently excluded because patients were stool positive for C. difficile, but did not have diarrhea or because the study was not a randomized controlled trial. All of the remaining nine studies involved patients with diarrhea who recently received antibiotics for an infection other than C. difficile. The definition of diarrhea ranged from at least two loose stools per day with an associated symptom such as rectal temperature > 38°C, to at least six loose stools in 36 hours. In terms of symptomatic cure, metronidazole, bacitracin and fusidic acid were not shown to be less effective than vancomycin. Teicoplanin may be slightly more effective than vancomycin with a relative risk of 1.21 [95% CI 1.00 to 1.46] and a p-value of 0.06. In terms of initial symptomatic resolution, vancomycin is more effective than placebo with a relative risk of 6.75 [95% CI 1.16 to 48.43] and a p-value of 0.03. This result should be interpreted with caution given the small number of patients in this comparison (12 in the vancomycin group and nine in the placebo group) and the poor methodological quality of the trial. Metronidazole, bacitracin, teicoplanin, fusidic acid and rifaximine are as effective as vancomycin for initial symptomatic resolution. The other secondary outcomes measured in this review: surgery, sepsis and death occurred infrequently in all of the studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence leads to uncertainty whether mild CDAD needs to be treated. Patients with mild CDAD may resolve their symptoms as quickly without treatment. The only placebo-controlled study shows vancomycin's superior efficacy. However, this result should be treated with caution due to the small number of patients enrolled and the poor methodological quality of the trial. The Johnson study of asymptomatic carriers also shows that placebo is better than vancomycin or metronidazole for eliminating C. difficile in stool during follow-up. If one does decide to treat, then two goals of therapy need to be kept in mind: improvement of the patient's clinical condition and prevention of spread of C. difficile infection to other patients. Given these two considerations, one should choose the antibiotic that brings both symptomatic cure and bacteriologic cure. In this regard, teicoplanin appears to be the best choice because the available evidence suggests that it is better than vancomycin for bacteriologic cure and has borderline superior effectiveness in terms of symptomatic cure. Teicoplanin is not readily available in the United States, which must be taken into account when making treatment decisions in that country.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^08ba65be]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Hospitalized adults with acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) — steroids, antibiotics, and rescue therapy: The AGA suggests using intravenous methylprednisolone dose equivalent of 40–60 mg/d rather than higher doses of intravenous corticosteroids and suggests against adjunctive antibiotics in acute severe UC without infection. For steroid-refractory ASUC, the AGA suggests using infliximab or cyclosporine. In those being treated with infliximab, the AGA makes no recommendation on routine use of intensive vs standard infliximab dosing.

### Antibiotic treatment for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea in adults [^86aeccbe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is recognized as a frequent cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and colitis. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to investigate the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD), or C. difficile infection (CDI), being synonymous terms.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Trials Register from inception to 26 January 2017. We also searched clinicaltrials.gov and clinicaltrialsregister.eu for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials assessing antibiotic treatment for CDI were included in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed abstracts and full text articles for inclusion and extracted data. The risk of bias was independently rated by two authors. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We pooled data using a fixed-effect model, except where significant heterogeneity was detected, at which time a random-effects model was used. The following outcomes were sought: sustained symptomatic cure (defined as initial symptomatic response and no recurrence of CDI), sustained bacteriologic cure, adverse reactions to the intervention, death and cost.

Main Results

Twenty-two studies (3215 participants) were included. The majority of studies enrolled patients with mild to moderate CDI who could tolerate oral antibiotics. Sixteen of the included studies excluded patients with severe CDI and few patients with severe CDI were included in the other six studies. Twelve different antibiotics were investigated: vancomycin, metronidazole, fusidic acid, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, rifampin, rifaximin, bacitracin, cadazolid, LFF517, surotomycin and fidaxomicin. Most of the studies were active comparator studies comparing vancomycin with other antibiotics. One small study compared vancomycin to placebo. There were no other studies that compared antibiotic treatment to a placebo or a 'no treatment' control group. The risk of bias was rated as high for 17 of 22 included studies. Vancomycin was found to be more effective than metronidazole for achieving symptomatic cure. Seventy-two per cent (318/444) of metronidazole patients achieved symptomatic cure compared to 79% (339/428) of vancomycin patients (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.97; moderate quality evidence). Fidaxomicin was found to be more effective than vancomycin for achieving symptomatic cure. Seventy-one per cent (407/572) of fidaxomicin patients achieved symptomatic cure compared to 61% (361/592) of vancomycin patients (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.31; moderate quality evidence). Teicoplanin may be more effective than vancomycin for achieving a symptomatic cure. Eightly-seven per cent (48/55) of teicoplanin patients achieved symptomatic cure compared to 73% (40/55) of vancomycin patients (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.46; very low quality evidence). For other comparisons including the one placebo-controlled study the quality of evidence was low or very low due to imprecision and in many cases high risk of bias because of attrition and lack of blinding. One hundred and forty deaths were reported in the studies, all of which were attributed by study authors to the co-morbidities of the participants that lead to acquiring CDI. Although many other adverse events were reported during therapy, these were attributed to the participants' co-morbidities. The only adverse events directly attributed to study medication were rare nausea and transient elevation of liver enzymes. Recent cost data (July 2016) for a 10 day course of treatment shows that metronidazole 500 mg is the least expensive antibiotic with a cost of USD 13 (Health Warehouse). Vancomycin 125 mg costs USD 1779 (Walgreens for 56 tablets) compared to fidaxomicin 200 mg at USD 3453.83 or more (Optimer Pharmaceuticals) and teicoplanin at approximately USD 83.67 (GBP 71.40, British National Formulary).

Authors' Conclusions

No firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of antibiotic treatment in severe CDI as most studies excluded patients with severe disease. The lack of any 'no treatment' control studies does not allow for any conclusions regarding the need for antibiotic treatment in patients with mild CDI beyond withdrawal of the initiating antibiotic. Nonetheless, moderate quality evidence suggests that vancomycin is superior to metronidazole and fidaxomicin is superior to vancomycin. The differences in effectiveness between these antibiotics were not too large and the advantage of metronidazole is its far lower cost compared to the other two antibiotics. The quality of evidence for teicoplanin is very low. Adequately powered studies are needed to determine if teicoplanin performs as well as the other antibiotics. A trial comparing the two cheapest antibiotics, metronidazole and teicoplanin, would be of interest.

### Antibiotic treatment induces long-lasting changes in the fecal microbiota that protect against colitis [^7b8e5c22]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The interplay between host genetics, immunity, and microbiota is central to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Previous population-based studies suggested a link between antibiotic use and increased inflammatory bowel disease risk, but the mechanisms are unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term effects of antibiotic administration on microbiota composition, innate immunity, and susceptibility to colitis, as well as the mechanism by which antibiotics alter host colitogenicity.

Methods

Wild-type mice were given broad-spectrum antibiotics or no antibiotics for 2 weeks, and subsequent immunophenotyping and 16S rRNA gene sequencing-based analysis of the fecal microbiome were performed 6 weeks later. In a separate experiment, control and antibiotic-treated mice were given 7 days of dextran sulfate sodium, 6 weeks after completing antibiotic treatment, and the severity of colitis scored histologically. Fecal transfer was performed from control or antibiotic-treated mice to recipient mice whose endogenous microbiota had been cleared with antibiotics, and the susceptibility of the recipients to dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis was analyzed. Naive CD4 T cells were transferred from control and antibiotic-treated mice to immunodeficient Rag-1 recipients and the severity of colitis compared.

Results

Antibiotics led to sustained dysbiosis and changes in T-cell subpopulations, including reductions in colonic lamina propria total T cells and CD4 T cells. Antibiotics conferred protection against dextran sulfate sodium colitis, and this effect was transferable by fecal transplant but not by naive T cells.

Conclusions

Antibiotic exposure protects against colitis, and this effect is transferable with fecal microbiota from antibiotic-treated mice, supporting a protective effect of the microbial community.

### Clostridioides difficile colitis [^08f48aeb]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile colitis is an important source of hospital-acquired diarrhea associated with antibiotic use. Symptoms are profuse watery diarrhea, typically following a course of antibiotics; however, some cases of fulminant disease may manifest with shock, ileus, or megacolon. Nonfulminant colitis is treated with oral fidaxomicin. C difficile colitis has a high potential for recurrence, and recurrent episodes are also treated with fidaxomicin. Bezlotoxumab is another medication that may be used in populations at high risk for further recurrence. Fulminant disease is treated with maximal medical therapy and early surgical consultation. Antibiotic stewardship is critical to preventing C difficile colitis.

### Clostridium difficile colitis [^44bbc851]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitalized patients. Its effects are mediated by C difficile toxins A and B. Recent outbreaks of severe colitis have been associated with a new strain of the bacterium that produces large amounts of the toxins. Although oral metronidazole and oral vancomycin can be used to treat C difficile-associated disease, intraluminal vancomycin is preferable for more severe C difficile colitis. Early surgical intervention can improve outcomes with fulminant colitis, although overall mortality remains high.

### The role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile colitis [^530ae94f]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile colitis is the most common gastrointestinal infection, exceeding all other gastrointestinal infections combined. There has been a dramatic increase in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) worldwide during the past decade. Antibiotic therapy is a trigger precipitating antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), which may lead to CDI. The antibiotic alters the protective, diverse bacteria allowing pathogenic bacteria to cause disease. Probiotics have been effective in reducing AAD and preventing CDI.

### Impact of antibiotic therapy on the development and response to treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated diarrhea and colitis [^3e29fdf0]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Treatment with antibiotics having anaerobic activity was associated with an increased risk of IMDC with a more severe disease course, especially when given after ICI therapy. Empiric antibiotic use in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms receiving ICI therapy should be considered only when the suspicion for infectious etiology is high. Patients who received anaerobic antibiotic therapy had worse survival rates than did those who did not. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution. We suspect that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is a sequela of antibiotic therapy administered with ICI therapy. Due to the indirect nature of our conclusions, further stool metagenomic analyses are needed to clarify the role of antibiotics and the gut microbiome in the development of IMDC and their influence on IMDC outcome. Similarly, prospective studies are warranted to determine the effect of antibiotic therapy on overall survival.

### A systematic review of vedolizumab in treating pediatric ulcerative colitis: efficacy and safety insights [^a06e5876]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antibiotics, biologics, corticosteroids (CS), immunomodulators, probiotics, and aminosalicylates are typical medical treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially ulcerative colitis (UC). The high rate of relapse associated with UC may lead to a dependence on or resistance to corticosteroids in many individuals. Young patients are more likely than adults to be dependent on steroids, with rates of 45% and 8%, respectively. About 20%–40% of individuals may eventually lose their responsiveness throughout the years (a subsequent loss of responsiveness), even though other patients do not respond to the initial treatment (original no-response). – This highlights the ongoing need for innovative therapies that focus on several inflammatory pathways linked to the pathophysiology of UC. In addition, between 10% and 40% of individuals do not respond to anti-TNF drugs, although there has been significant advancement in IBD treatment.

AGA guideline — advanced immunosuppressive therapies for chronic antibiotic-dependent pouchitis — In patients with ulcerative colitis who have undergone IPAA and experience recurrent pouchitis that responds to antibiotics but relapses shortly after stopping antibiotics, the AGA suggests using advanced immunosuppressive therapies to treat recurrent pouchitis (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence for vedolizumab and very low certainty of evidence for other advanced immunosuppressive therapies). Implementation considerations note that the panel suggests endoscopic evaluation of the pouch with confirmation of inflammation and ruling out alternative etiologies in patients with recurrent pouchitis, and that advanced immunosuppressive therapies approved for treatment of UC or CD may be used.

### Impact of antibiotic therapy on the development and response to treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated diarrhea and colitis [^eac45144]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Importantly, a portion of our cohort received empiric antibiotic therapy at the onset of IMDC without confirmation of an active infection. The infectious workup, including multiplex study, in these patients was negative for infection at time of IMDC onset. Similarly, endoscopy with biopsy was performed in a few of them and confirmed IMDC. This approach was pursued more often in patients with severe IMDC disease course reflected by high grades of IMDC, frequent hospitalization with long hospital stays, and frequent use of immunosuppressive therapy, including intravenous steroids and infliximab/vedolizumab. Of note, these patients were likely to experience recurrence of IMDC. The causative correlation between severity of IMDC and antibiotic use (i.e. antibiotic use led to more severe IMDC versus severe IMDC symptoms led to more frequent use of antibiotics) could not be determined based on findings of this study given its retrospective design and the presence of most severity indicators before antibiotic treatment initiation. There was no beneficial impact from empiric antibiotic use on IMDC outcomes. These observations stress the importance of careful evaluation of patients for active infection before starting antibiotic therapy. Before implementation of the current treatment guidelines and with limited awareness of these toxic effects, physicians commonly used antibiotic therapy empirically to manage diarrhea. Our findings reinforce the recommendation of avoiding empiric antibiotic therapy in patients who suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms following immunotherapy unless they have clear infections.

Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, affect around 1 in every 1000 individuals in western countries. They probably result from an inappropriate reaction towards the commensal microflora and are currently treated with anti-inflammatory drugs or surgery. Novel strategies aim at blocking lymphocyte recruitment and activation, improved targeting of therapeutics and modification of gut microflora.

### Infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^0002fd77]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

The use of alternate antibiotics has been researched extensively, but no consensus has been reached. Nelson comprehensively reviewed twelve randomized, controlled trials (1157 participants) of antibiotic treatment for C. difficile associated diarrhea involving patients who had recently taken antibiotics for other infections. Eight antibiotics were studied, including vancomycin, metronidazole, fusidic acid, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, rifampin, rifaximin and bacitracin. In paired comparisons, no single antibiotic was superior to others, though teicoplanin, a costly antibiotic of limited availability, showed in some trials a significant benefit over vancomycin and fusidic acid, and a trend towards benefit compared with metronidazole. The combination of metronidazole and rifampin had no advantage over metronidazole alone. Teicoplanin is not readily available but was somewhat better than vancomycin for bacteriologic cure. Bacitracin was less effective. Nitazoxamide has been shown in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study (N = 74) to be as effective as metronidazole in treating C. difficile colitis. Fidaxomicin is a bactericidal macrocyclic antibiotic that has been found to reduce C. difficile counts while, unlike vancomycin, maintaining Bacteriodes species, a major constituent of normal flora. A phase III trial in 128 subjects who had experienced a single prior C. difficile infection episode and had recurred within three months, showed fewer recurrences and higher global cure rates in comparison to fidaxomicin with vancomycin. It is as safe and as well tolerated as standard vancomycin treatment. The search for the ideal antibiotic regime continues, given that recurrence of C. difficile colitis after cessation of therapy is common, occurring in 15–30% of patients. One reason for this may be that the antibiotic treatment administered for C. difficile colitis does not permit the restoration of the normal bowel flora. Some patients have multiple recurrences. Among non-antibiotics, cholestyramine has been used with dubious results in patients that were unresponsive to antibiotics. The drastic step of total colectomy can only be considered in the context of life-saving surgery for unresponsive ulcerative colitis. Here it is important to operate before life-threatening metabolic changes occur, such as hypoalbuminemia and lactic acidosis, and before the leukocyte count exceeds 16,000.

AGA pouchitis guideline — management of chronic antibiotic-dependent pouchitis after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) in ulcerative colitis (UC) states that in patients who experience recurrent pouchitis that responds to antibiotics but relapses shortly after stopping antibiotics (commonly referred to as "chronic antibiotic-dependent pouchitis"), the AGA suggests using chronic antibiotic therapy to treat recurrent pouchitis (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The panel suggests endoscopic evaluation of the pouch with confirmation of inflammation and ruling out alternative etiologies in patients with recurrent pouchitis, and lowest effective dose of antibiotics (eg, ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily or 250 mg twice daily) with intermittent gap periods (such as approximately 1 week per month), or use of cyclical antibiotics (such as rotating between ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin every 1–2 weeks) may be considered to decrease risk of antimicrobial resistance.

### Antimicrobials: a global alliance for optimizing their rational use in intra-abdominal infections (AGORA) [^74e7b5ae]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotics and C. difficile infection

C. difficile infections have become more frequent, more severe and more difficult to treat.

The prolonged use of antibiotics induces a change in the intestinal flora and may result in a higher incidence of C. difficile infections.

C. difficile is an anaerobic, spore forming, Gram-positive bacillus, which may be part of the normal intestinal microbiota in healthy newborns but is rarely present in the gut of healthy adults. A direct correlation between antibiotic use and C. difficile infection (CDI) has been well described. Disruption of the normal gut flora as a consequence of antibiotic use provides an excellent setting for C. difficile to proliferate and produce toxins.

The risk of CDI is increased up to 6-fold during and in the subsequent month after antibiotic therapy. Although nearly all antibiotics have been associated with CDI, clindamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones have traditionally been considered to pose the greatest risk.

In 2014, a systematic review of observational epidemiological studies measuring associations between antibiotic classes and hospital acquired CDI was published. Of 569 citations identified, 13 case–control and 1 cohort study (15,938 patients) were included. The strongest associations were found for third-generation cephalosporins, clindamycin, second-generation cephalosporins, fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, trimethoprim-sulphonamides, fluoroquinolones and penicillin combinations.

In the last two decades, the dramatic increase in incidence and severity of CDI in many countries worldwide, has made CDI a global public health challenge.

CDI represents the most common cause of diarrhea in hospitalized patients. C. difficile colitis can be treated by oral or intravenous metronidazole and/or oral or intracolonic vancomycin. In severe colitis, surgery may be required.

In 2015, the WSES published guidelines for management of C. difficile infection in surgical patients.

### Targeting enteric bacteria in treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases: why, how, and when [^dc89b0f6]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

This review discusses the role of bacterial adjuvants and antigens in induction and reactivation of chronic intestinal inflammation in susceptible hosts; discusses the results of recent therapeutic trials of antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics; and suggests future treatment strategies.

Recent Findings

Bacterial adjuvants, including peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, and DNA (CpG) bind to membrane-bound toll-like receptors (TLR-2, 4, and 9. respectively) or cytoplasmic (NOD1 and NOD2) receptors (pattern recognition receptors) that activate nuclear factor-kappaB and transcription of many proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion, costimulatory, and major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. Experimental enterocolitis does not occur in a sterile (germ-free) environment and is prevented and treated by broad-spectrum antibiotics. Individual nonpathogenic intestinal bacterial species selectively induce experimental colitis, with host specificity. Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis patients exhibit pathogenic immune responses (loss of immunologic tolerance) to multiple normal enteric bacterial species and serologic responses to Mycobacterium paratuberculosis. Metronidazole and ciprofloxacin selectively treat colonic Crohn disease, but not ulcerative colitis or ileal Crohn disease, and may prevent recurrence of postoperative Crohn disease. Certain probiotic species decrease relapse of ulcerative colitis and chronic pouchitis and delay onset of pouchitis.

Summary

Normal, nonpathogenic enteric bacteria induce and perpetuate chronic intestinal inflammation in genetically susceptible hosts with defective immunoregulation, bacterial clearance, or mucosal barrier function. Altering the composition and decreasing mucosal adherence/invasion of commensal bacteria with antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics can potentially prevent and treat Crohn disease, pouchitis, and possibly ulcerative colitis, but optimal treatments have not yet been identified.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^f501ec4e]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

FMT can be used to treat Clostridium difficile infection in the context of ulcerative colitis when first line antibiotics are ineffective. There is currently no place for FMT in the management of IBD unless complicated by C. difficile infection outside of the clinical trial setting.

Anti-diarrhoeal drugs are often used by patients with IPAA to reduce bowel frequency. There is no evidence of benefit in pouchitis treatment although they are often continued. More evidence is required to support this common practice.

3.14.3 Treatment of chronic pouchitis

Statement 24. We suggest that chronic pouchitis may be treated with a combination of antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, tinidazole, rifaximin), oral budesonide or oral beclomethasone (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 85.7%).

Chronic pouchitis or chronic refractory pouchitis is defined as occurring when patients with pouchitis remain symptomatic despite 4 weeks' treatment with antibiotics. Patients who fail to respond to 2 weeks of an antibiotic, or relapse rapidly after stopping, can be treated with a combination of antibiotics for 4 weeks. Ciprofloxacin plus rifaximin and ciprofloxacin plus tinidazole have been shown to be effective in randomised controlled trials. Oral budesonide 9 mg and oral beclomethasone dipropionate 10 mg daily given for 8 weeks have also been shown to be effective, and if symptoms worsen on stopping, biologics should be considered rather than continuing long-term steroids. Some antibiotic-dependent patients may require long-term rotating antibiotic therapy, and coliform sensitivity testing may help to choose appropriate agents. Patients with pre-pouch ileitis (occurring in 6% of patients with pouchitis) represent a high-risk group for chronic refractory pouchitis and should be considered for early escalation to immunomodulatory therapy.

Guideline overview

C. difficile is a unique disease in that both infectious disease providers and gastroenterologists see and manage these patients. As such, guidelines from both disciplines will be reviewed, compared and contrasted. The goal of this manuscript is to focus on the evolution of the guidelines and changes over the last few years, but it is important from a foundational standpoint to understand the recommendations prior to the modern era to contextualize how they have evolved into what is recommended today. It is best to break these publications into three time frames: 1995–1997, 2009–2013, and 2014 to the present.

### Drug-induced colitis [^13aae27e]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Drug-induced colitis encompasses a wide spectrum of colon disorders that can manifest microscopically or macroscopically. Patients present with new-onset colitis or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel diseases; in some cases, colitis resolves with discontinuation of medication. Mucosal injury can be focal or extensive, involving the entire colonic mucosa, and sometimes involves other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. It has been a challenge to determine the proportion of new-onset colitis caused by medication and there are few data on the overall prevalence. We review the drugs that have been linked with development of drug-induced colitis and strategies for physicians who believe their patients have this disorder-usually discontinuation of the drug believed to cause colitis and treatment with steroids or immune-modulating therapies. Physicians must be aware of medications that can cause colitis.

### New developments in chemotherapeutic options for Clostridium difficile colitis [^e4953906]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) are of increasing concern in healthcare due to increasing incidence as well as suboptimal response to standard therapies. This review focuses on current updates in chemotherapeutic treatment options for primary CDI as well as for relapse.

Recent Findings

Metronidazole and vancomycin remain the standard therapy for mild and severe CDI, respectively. Fidaxomicin was approved for use in CDI by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2011 and new studies have shown a decreased rate of recurrence as compared with vancomycin as well as potential promise for use as a chaser. Rifaximin may be useful in salvage therapy for recurrent CDI as well as for a chaser. Tigecycline, teicoplanin, doxycycline, linezolid, nitazoxanide, amixicile, LFF571, and CB-183 315 have in-vitro activity and are under different stages of study. Monoclonal antitoxin antibodies for prevention of relapse of CDI are currently under evaluation in a phase 3 clinical trial.

Summary

A variety of promising new treatment options for Clostridium difficile are under development, although further studies are necessary to determine the efficacy of these newer treatments for cure and preventing disease relapse.

### Pouchitis unveiled: exploring clinical features, diagnosis, and cutting-edge treatments [^a6145d75]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Last decades led to a revolution in the management of ulcerative colitis (UC), due to the development of novel advanced therapies and the identification of increasingly ambitious therapeutic goals. Nevertheless, a subset of patients, refractory to available therapies, still requires proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). Pouchitis, an inflammatory condition of the ileal pouch, is the most common long-term complication of IPAA, affecting almost one-half of patients in the first 10 years after surgery. Symptoms of pouchitis include increased stool frequency, urgency, and abdominal discomfort, significantly affecting patients' quality of life. Traditionally the mainstay treatment of acute pouchitis involves the use of antibiotics, but one-fifth of patients develop chronic pouchitis (CP), which may be dependent or resistant to antibiotics, posing significant challenges in the management of this condition. Currently, there is still no consensus on the optimal management for CP, though recent progress in understanding the pathophysiology of pouchitis has paved the way for innovative therapeutic approaches, based on biological therapies and small molecules. This review aims to discuss the recent advanced therapies available for pouchitis and provide a comprehensive review on the topic to guide physicians in their clinical practice.

### A comparison of vancomycin and metronidazole for the treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, stratified by disease severity [^c78f4879]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The study Vancomycin vs. metronidazole for C. difficile colitis was published by Zar FA and colleagues in 2007 in the journal Clin Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: Clostridioides difficile infection. In the Vancomycin vs. metronidazole for C. difficile colitis study, the trial question was: what is the effect of vancomycin in patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea? In the Vancomycin vs. metronidazole for C. difficile colitis study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the Vancomycin vs. metronidazole for C. difficile colitis study, the population was: 150 patients (68 female, 82 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea were stratified according to whether they had mild or severe disease based on clinical criteria. The key exclusion criteria were perforated viscus or bowel obstruction; prior failure of C. difficile-associated diarrhea to respond to either study drug; pregnancy; history of allergy to either study drug; or treatment with oral vancomycin or parenteral or oral metronidazole during the previous 14 days. In the Vancomycin vs. metronidazole for C. difficile colitis study, the interventions were: n = 71 vancomycin (125 mg QID PO for 10 days) n = 79 metronidazole (250 mg QID PO for 10 days). In the Vancomycin vs. metronidazole for C. difficile colitis study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in cure rate (97% vs. 84%; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.97). In the Vancomycin vs. metronidazole for C. difficile colitis study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in cure in patients with mild disease (98% vs. 90%; RR 1.09, 95% CI -1.22 to 3.4) Significant increase in cure in patients with severe disease (97% vs. 76%; RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.36). In the Vancomycin vs. metronidazole for C. difficile colitis study, the conclusion was: in patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea were stratified according to whether they had mild or severe disease based on clinical criteria, vancomycin was superior to metronidazole with respect to cure rate.

### Treatment of an initial infection with Clostridium difficile in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^ff0ae73a]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Although the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in the general population has increased dramatically over the past decade, an even greater rate of infection exists in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Susceptibility in this population is likely inherent to the pathophysiology and treatment of these diseases. C. difficile infection can cause serious complications and death. Consequently, early diagnosis and initiation of effective antibacterial therapy is imperative. This article evaluates treatment recommendations for an initial episode of C. difficile infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease based on the current guidelines and a Cochrane systematic review.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of pouchitis and inflammatory pouch disorders [^9259e026]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA guideline — intermittent pouchitis after ileal pouch–anal anastomosis (IPAA): In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who have undergone IPAA and experience infrequent episodes of pouchitis, the AGA suggests using antibiotics for treatment of pouchitis (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Based on available evidence, ciprofloxacin and/or metronidazole are the preferred antibiotics, the typical duration of antibiotic therapy is 2–4 weeks, a combination of antibiotics may be more effective in patients who do not respond to single-antibiotic therapy, and alternative antibiotic regimens, such as oral vancomycin, may be considered in patients who do not respond to the initial course of antibiotics or have allergies or intolerance to ciprofloxacin and/or metronidazole. Evidence included 4 small RCTs evaluating antibiotics for treatment of pouchitis, of which 2 were placebo-controlled; in these 2 trials, 11 of 19 antibiotic-treated patients vs 3 of 21 placebo-treated patients had clinical improvement (RR, 3.45; 95% CI, 0.29–41.82). On pooled analysis from RCT arms and observational studies, 160 of 239 patients treated with antibiotics had marked improvement in symptoms (pooled response, 65%; 95% CI, 52–75). With assumed spontaneous improvement rates of 40% (range, 30%-50%), antibiotics were associated with 67% higher risk of clinical response (RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.34–2.01), and the overall body of evidence from these observational studies led to overall very low certainty of evidence.

### Impact of antibiotic therapy on the development and response to treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated diarrhea and colitis [^67f08b0e]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Overview of antibiotic therapy

Of the 826 study patients, 569 (68.9%) received antibiotic therapy (Table 1). Of these 569 patients, 299 (52.5%) received antibiotics both before and after initiation of ICI therapy, 186 (32.7%) received antibiotics before initiation of ICI therapy only, and 84 (14.8%) received antibiotics after initiation of ICI therapy only. Empirical use of antibiotic without an identifiable source was the most common indication for antibiotic use, followed by prophylactic use without signs of infection (Additional file 1: Table S4). Overall, patients who received antibiotics had lower IMDC occurrence (p < 0.001) and recurrence (p = 0.025) rates than did patients without antibiotic exposure (Table 2). However, more IMDC patients who received antibiotics needed hospitalization (p < 0.001) or ICU admission (p = 0.038) or had severe colitis (p = 0.022) than did patients who did not receive antibiotics.

Table 2
Clinical features of the study patients according to use of antibiotic therapy

Of the patients given antibiotics, 51% received antibiotics with anaerobic activity. When we compared the patients given anaerobic and aerobic antibiotic agents, we noticed that anaerobic antibiotic therapy was associated with increased rates of hospitalization (p < 0.001) and ICU admission for IMDC (p = 0.002), IMDC grade (p = 0.004), and requirement of immunosuppressive therapy (p = 0.03) (Table 3).

Table 3
Clinical features of patients who received anaerobic and aerobic antibiotic therapy (No. of patients who received antibiotic = 569)

Patients who received anti-CTLA-4

Additional file 1: Table S5. A summarizes the clinical features of patients who received antibiotics. The rate of IMDC was lower in patients who received antibiotic therapy compared with those who did not (p = 0.002). Moreover, antibiotic use was associated with more frequent hospitalizations (p < 0.001) and higher grades of colitis (p = 0.011). Antibiotics with anaerobic activity were associated with higher rates of IMDC (p = 0.021), more frequent requirement for immunosuppressive therapy (p = 0.014), more frequent hospitalizations (p = 0.002), higher grades of colitis (p = 0.009), and higher levels of fecal calprotectin (p = 0.010) (Additional file 1: Table S5.B).

Ulcerative colitis — therapeutic management guidance: Therapeutic management in UC should be guided by the extent of bowel involvement, an assessment of disease activity and disease prognosis; patients with moderate-to-severely active UC or with high risk of hospitalization or colectomy should be treated with therapies that have evidence for efficacy based on clinical trials and real world studies. We recommend that prognosis should guide choice of therapy as much as activity of inflammation at the time of acute illness.

### Erythromycin (Ery) [^4d548813]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including erythromycin, and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents.

Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is one primary cause of "antibiotic-associated colitis".

After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established, therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone. In moderate to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation and treatment with an antibacterial drug clinically effective against C. difficile colitis.

### Inflammatory bowel disease andinfection: clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management [^dc25648d]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

How to manage medications for IBD

Public Health England noted in the 2019 British Society for Gastroenterology guidelines for adult IBD that stopping corticosteroid therapy during CDI therapy is not necessary for patients with acute severe UC. However, a study conducted by Solanky et al. showed that there was a higher risk of colectomy when escalated corticosteroid for IBD with CDI. During acute CDI, clinicians may delay upgrades of steroids until CDI is controlled.

It is confirmed that whether to stop the use of immunosuppressants or not in IBD patients with CDI has not been clarified in the current consensus of guidelines after a systematic review of the current publicly available literature. When being asked to comment on CDI management in IBD, 46% of 169 gastroenterologists (25% of respondents were IBD specialists) opted for a combination of immunosuppression and antibiotics, while the remaining 54% preferred antibiotics alone to treat the flare. In addition, Beniwal-Patel et al. suggested that new immunosuppressants should not be started and scheduled infusions should be suspended until the symptoms of C. difficile are resolved in the case of new CDI. While Krishna et al. pointed out that IBD patients with CDI should be treated with appropriate antibiotics immediately. If symptoms are not relieved in 48 h, starting/updating immunotherapy should be considered at the same time. The guidelines of the American Gastroenterology Association recommend that steroid or immunosuppressive therapy should be started 72–96 h after the use of antibiotics. With the escalation of immunosuppression, patients should be closely monitored for worsening symptoms and impending complications. The decision on whether or not to continue immunomodulator treatment should be made on an individual basis (including discussed surgery). Similarly, the 2021 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidelines on the management of IBD stated that the effect of immunosuppressive agents on CDI progression in IBD patients is not clear. For IBD patients with CDI, whether to maintain immunosuppressants should be carefully considered after risk–benefit assessment and clinical judgment.

### Clostridium difficile infection: a review of current and emerging therapies [^42403079]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection (CDI) is the most common cause of -healthcare-associated infections in US hospitals. The epidemic strain NAP1/BI/ribotype 027 accounts for outbreaks worldwide, with increasing mortality and severity. CDI is acquired from an endogenous source or from spores in the environment, most easily acquired during the hospital stay. The use of antimicrobials disrupts the intestinal microflora enabling C. difficile to proliferate in the colon and produce toxins. Clinical diagnosis in symptomatic patients requires toxin detection from stool specimens and rarely in combination with stool culture to increase sensitivity. However, stool culture is essential for epidemiological studies. Oral metronidazole is the recommended therapy for milder cases of CDI and oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin for more severe cases. Treatment of first recurrence involves the use of the same therapy used in the initial CDI. In the event of a second recurrence oral vancomycin often given in a tapered dose or intermittently, or fidaxomicin may be used. Fecal transplantation is playing an immense role in therapy of recurrent CDI with remarkable results. Fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon warrant surgical intervention. Novel approaches including new antibiotics and immunotherapy against CDI or its toxins appear to be of potential value.

### Detecting and treating Clostridium difficile infections in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^0375d51c]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The prevalence of CDI in patients with IBD has increased over the last decade. The excess morbidity and mortality associated with CDI appears to be greater in patients with IBD than in those without preexisting bowel disease. The risk factors for CDI in IBD and non-IBD populations appear similar; unique IBD-related risk factors are use of maintenance immunosuppression and extent and severity of prior colitis. Nevertheless, a significant proportion of CDI-IBD patients may have the disease without traditional risk factors (ie, antibiotic use, recent hospitalization). The absence of such risk factors must not preclude considering CDI in the differential diagnosis of IBD patients presenting with a disease flare. Vancomycin and metronidazole appear to have similar efficacy with vancomycin being the preferred agent for severe disease. Early surgical consultation is key for improving outcomes of patients with severe disease. Several gaps in research exist; prospective multicenter cohorts of CDI-IBD are essential to improve our understanding of the impact of CDI on IBD patients and define appropriate therapeutic regimens to improve patient outcomes.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing and remitting gastrointestinal disorder of uncertain aetiology. The last two decades have seen an expansion in the therapeutic arsenal used to treat UC. This has resulted in improved clinical remission and response rates. Nonetheless, staples in our current medical management originate from trials conducted in the early 20th century. In this review article, we aim to outline the key milestones in the history of the medical management of UC in addition to highlighting promising therapeutic developments for the future.

### Host immunity modulates the efficacy of microbiota transplantation for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^78f27519]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The microbiota, consisting of the community of bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoa organisms that inhabit a mammalian host, can impact susceptibility to a range of diseases including cancer, diabetes, allergy, obesity, and infection –. An altered or dysbiotic intestinal microbiota is observed in all of these disease states suggesting that resetting the intestinal microbiota with a composition of bacteria from healthy individuals could treat disease. This theory is supported by animal studies demonstrating alleviation of disease through transplantation of bacteria into the diseased host's intestinal tract –. Significant advancements have been made in defining the community of microbial species that are important in supporting human health –. Translating these findings into viable microbiota-based therapies has had limited success in the clinic, however, and is not yet considered a treatment option for most diseases impacted by microbial dysbiosis. One notable exception is the use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to treat recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. FMT treatment of C. difficile infection is the first microbiota-based therapy clinically proven to ameliorate disease. Before such treatment strategies can be broadly implemented, the underlying principles determining success for microbiota-based therapy need to be elucidated.

C. difficile, a gram positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobe is currently the most common nosocomial infection encountered by hospitalized patients, with nearly a half million patients infected and an estimated 13,000–30,000 deaths annually in the USA alone –. This opportunistic pathogen infects the large intestine following perturbation of the intestinal microbiota. Vancomycin or fidaxomicin are first line treatment options that effectively target the vegetative form of C. difficile, but fail to resolve the underlying condition that promotes infection, a dysbiotic microbiota. Recurrence of C. difficile infection due to repeated failed antibiotic treatments is estimated as high as 25–35% and can cause potentially lethal fulminant colitis. The high recurrence rate following standard antibiotic treatment has spurred the development of new treatment modalities such as FMT. In 2013, the first controlled, double-blinded study reported the superior efficacy of FMT compared to antibiotics in treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection. Subsequent studies demonstrate FMT has an 80–90% cure rate in individuals and this treatment option is now incorporated as standard care for recurrent disease in both Europe and the USA –.

### Clostridioides difficile infection: update on management [^b0ae6c74]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection have recently been updated. Risk factors include recent exposure to health care facilities or antibiotics, especially clindamycin. C. difficile infection is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, from mild or moderate diarrhea to severe disease with pseudomembranous colitis, colonic ileus, toxic megacolon, sepsis, or death. C. difficile infection should be considered in patients who are not taking laxatives and have three or more episodes of unexplained, unformed stools in 24 hours. Testing in these patients should start with enzyme immunoassays for glutamate dehydrogenase and toxins A and B or nucleic acid amplification testing. In children older than 12 months, testing is recommended only for those with prolonged diarrhea and risk factors. Treatment depends on whether the episode is an initial vs. recurrent infection and on the severity of the infection based on white blood cell count, serum creatinine level, and other clinical signs and symptoms. For an initial episode of nonsevere C. difficile infection, oral vancomycin or oral fidaxomicin is recommended. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line therapy for adults. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a reasonable treatment option with high cure rates in patients who have had multiple recurrent episodes and have received appropriate antibiotic therapy for at least three of the episodes. Good antibiotic stewardship is a key strategy to decrease rates of C. difficile infection. In routine or endemic settings, hands should be cleaned with either soap and water or an alcohol-based product, but during outbreaks soap and water is superior. The Infectious Diseases Society of America does not recommend the use of probiotics for prevention of C. difficile infection.

### 2019 update of the WSES guidelines for management of () infection in surgical patients [^e6fab019]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

However, recent data have suggested an overall superiority of vancomycin to metronidazole for the treatment of patients with CDI and oral vancomycin 125 mg four times per day for 10 days is recommended as first choice antibiotic also for moderate cases.

In 2017, in an update of a previously published Cochrane review, moderate quality evidence suggested that vancomycin is superior to metronidazole in all cases of CDI. The differences in effectiveness between these antibiotics were not too large and the advantage of metronidazole is its far lower cost even if liquid vancomycin is cheaper and reduces the cost.
18 Both oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin are recommended for treatment of all patients with severe CDI (Recommendation 1 A).
19 In patients in whom oral antibiotics cannot reach the colon, vancomycin may be administered as retention enema via a large rectal tube or catheter (Recommendation 1 B).
20 Fidaxomicin may be used to treat CDI, especially in patients at higher risk for recurrence (e.g. elderly patients or those receiving concomitant antibiotics) (Recommendation 1A).

Vancomycin orally 125 mg four times daily for 10 days is considered superior to metronidazole in severe C. difficile disease. This may reflect the superior pharmacokinetic properties of vancomycin which is concentrated in the gut lumen. Doses of up to 500 mg have been used in some patients with severe or fulminant, as defined as hypotension or shock, ileus or megacolon, CDI, although there is little evidence for this in the literature.

Unlike vancomycin delivered enterally, intravenous vancomycin has no effect on CDI since the antibiotic is not excreted into the colon. Vancomycin enema may be an effective therapy for patients who cannot tolerate the oral preparation or patients with ileus who have delayed passage of oral antibiotics from the stomach to the colon.

Trans-stoma vancomycin may also be effective in surgical patients with Hartmann resection, ileostomy, or colon diversion. A single-hospital, retrospective chart review on 47 consecutive patients with C. difficile colitis treated with intracolonic vancomycin (ICV) was published by Kim et al. in 2013. Thirty-three of 47 patients (70%) with severe C. difficile colitis responded to adjunct intracolonic vancomycin with complete resolution without surgery. Multivariate analysis suggested that failures to intracolonic vancomycin enemas occurred in patients who were older and frail with albumin < 2.5 g/dl. Early surgery should be considered for those patients. Early surgery should also be offered to those patients who are failing maximal medical therapy including ICV enemas.

Conclusion

The guidelines referenced in this review offer a useful summary for how to manage UC. They highlight the need for accurate diagnosis, early initiation of appropriate therapy and ongoing assessment of disease progress and the side effects of treatment. Care is often centralised, but awareness of who and when to refer for assessment both initially and during relapse (particularly for severe colitis) will remain an important part of the overall management of these children.

### Cefoxitin sodium (cefoxitin) [^e086aef0]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

General:

The total daily dose should be reduced when CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION is administered to patients with transient or persistent reduction of urinary output due to renal insufficiency (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), because high and prolonged serum antibiotic concentrations can occur in such individuals from usual doses.

Antibiotics (including cephalosporins) should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.

As with other antibiotics, prolonged use of CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient's condition is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

Prescribing CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Information for Patients:

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting the treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Laboratory Tests:

As with any potent antibacterial agent, periodic assessment of organ system functions, including renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic, is advisable during prolonged therapy.

Drug Interactions:

Increased nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of cephalosporins and aminoglycoside antibiotics.

Antimicrobial therapy

12) Unnecessary antimicrobial agent(s) and proton pump inhibitors should be discontinued if CDI is suspected (Recommendation 1 C).

13) Empirical therapy for CDI should be avoided unless there is a strong suspicion for CDI. If a patient has a strong suspicion for CDI, empirical therapy for CDI should be considered while awaiting test results (Recommendation 1 B).

14) Metronidazole is recommended for the treatment of mild-moderate disease (Recommendation 1 A).

15) Oral vancomycin is recommended for treatment of patients with severe disease, or for patients with mild-moderate disease who do not respond to metronidazole. (Recommendation 1 A).

16) In patients in whom oral antibiotics cannot reach the colon, vancomycin may be administered by enema and metronidazole can be given intravenously (Recommendation 1 B).

17) Fidaxomicin may be used to treat CDI, especially in the patients at higher risk for recurrence (e.g. elderly patients with severe underlying disease or those requiring receiving concomitant antibiotics) (Recommendation 1 A).

Surgical management

18) Patients with severe CDI who progress to systemic toxicity should undergo early surgical consultation and evaluated for potential surgical intervention (Recommendation 1 C).

19) Resection of the entire colon should be considered to treat patients with fulminant colitis (FC) (Recommendation 1 B).

20) Diverting loop ileostomy with colonic lavage may be a useful alternative to resection of entire colon (Recommendation 2 C).

21) Patients with FC should be treated with high dose oral or by enema vancomycin (500 mg, 6 hourly) in combination with intravenous metronidazole (500 mg, 8 hourly). (Recommendation 1 C).

Supportive care

22) Supportive measures, including intravenous fluid resuscitation and electrolyte replacement, should be provided to all patients with severe C. difficile infection (Recommendation 1 C).

23) Early detection of shock and aggressive management of underlying organ dysfunction are essential for optimum outcomes in patients with fulminant colitis (Recommendation 1 C).

Recurrent C. difficile infection (RCDI)

24) Agents that may be used to treat the first recurrence of CDI include metronidazole, for non-severe RCDI, and vancomycin for severe RCDI. (Recommendation 1 B).

25) Fidaxomicin may be used as an alternative agent (Recommendation 1 B).

26) In subsequent recurrence of CDI (2nd or later) oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin is recommended (Recommendation 1 B).

AGA pouchitis guideline — advanced immunosuppressive therapy for chronic antibiotic-dependent pouchitis after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) in ulcerative colitis (UC) states that the AGA suggests using advanced immunosuppressive therapies to treat recurrent pouchitis (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence for vedolizumab and very low certainty of evidence for other advanced immunosuppressive therapies). The panel suggests endoscopic evaluation of the pouch with confirmation of inflammation and ruling out alternative etiologies in patients with recurrent pouchitis. Advanced immunosuppressive therapies approved for treatment of UC or CD may be used, including TNF–α antagonists (ie, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol), vedolizumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, ozanimod, tofacitinib, and upadacitinib. Advanced immunosuppressive therapies may be used in lieu of chronic, continuous antibiotic therapy, particularly in patients who are intolerant to antibiotics or when patients and/or providers are concerned about risks of long-term antibiotic therapy, and advanced immunosuppressive therapies that patients had used before colectomy may be reconsidered.

### Association between antibiotic treatment and outcomes in patients hospitalized with acute exacerbation of COPD treated with systemic steroids [^9b067b5b]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are widely used in acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD), but their additional benefit to a therapeutic regimen that already includes steroids is uncertain. We evaluated the association between antibiotic therapy and outcomes among a large cohort of patients treated with steroids who were hospitalized with AE-COPD and compared the effectiveness of three commonly used antibiotic regimens.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients aged 40 years hospitalized for AE-COPD from January 1, 2006, through December 1, 2007, at 410 acute care hospitals throughout the United States.

Results

Of the 53,900 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 85% were treated with antibiotics in the first 2 hospital days; 50% were treated with a quinolone, 22% with macrolides plus cephalosporin, and 9% with macrolide monotherapy. Compared with patients not treated with antibiotics, those who received antibiotics had lower mortality (1% vs 1.8%, P < .0001). In multivariable analysis, receipt of antibiotics was associated with a 40% reduction in the risk of in-hospital mortality (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.50–0.73) and a 13% reduction in the risk of 30-day readmission for COPD (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79–0.96). The risk of late ventilation and readmission for Clostridium difficile colitis was not significantly different between the two groups. We found little difference in the outcomes associated with three common antibiotic treatment choices.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that the addition of antibiotics to a regimen that includes steroids may have a beneficial effect on short-term outcomes for patients hospitalized with AE-COPD.

### How would you manage this patient withInfection? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^a6969757]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America/Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America and the American College of Gastroenterology recently released updated guidelines on management of patients with Clostridioides difficile infection. Although these 2 guidelines generally agree, there are a few important differences in their advice to clinicians. In these rounds, 2 experts, an infectious diseases specialist and a gastroenterologist, discuss antibiotic treatment options for nonsevere disease, the role of fecal microbiota transplantation for fulminant disease, and the use of bezlotoxumab to prevent recurrence in the context of Ms. C, a 48-year-old woman with fulminant C difficile infection.

### How can patients with Clostridioides difficile infection on concomitant antibiotic treatment be best managed? [^7d1e93ea]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Antibiotics are modifiable risk factors for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), driving pathogenesis via gut microbiome disruption. The management of patients with CDI prescribed concomitant non-CDI antibiotics is problematic and influences CDI outcome and recurrence risk. Though an assessment of the ongoing requirement for concomitant antibiotics is essential, discontinuation is often not possible. Antibiotics for other reasons might also need to be commenced during CDI therapy. Attempts to minimise the number and duration of antibiotics with a change to a low-risk class are recommended. Fidaxomicin might be preferable to vancomycin due to it having less effect on the gut microbiome; however, vancomycin is also acceptable. Metronidazole should be avoided and proton pump inhibitors discontinued. Access to fidaxomicin might be limited; hence, it should be prioritised for patients at high risk of recurrence. There is insufficient evidence to support extending anti-CDI therapy duration and concerns regarding microbiome effect remain. The addition of bezlotoxumab might be considered if multiple additional risk factors for recurrent CDI exist, though the amount of evidence is low. Investigational approaches to reduce the effect of concomitant antibiotics on the gut microbiome could further optimise CDI treatment in the presence of concomitant antibiotic use in the future.

### Safety analysis of fidaxomicin in comparison with oral vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infections [^c3fe3be6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile was recognized as the causative agent for antibiotic-associated colitis in 1978, first observed in conjunction with clindamycin treatment. Since then, C. difficile infection (CDI) has become an increasingly challenging nosocomial infection with severe medical consequences.

Hamster animal models showed some protective and beneficial effect from oral vancomycin, which quickly became the treatment drug of choice. However, the use of all vancomycin formulations (parvules and intravenous vancomycin used orally) had to be limited either because of its high price (parvules) or to curtail the potential risk for the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). In 1995, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that vancomycin not be used orally for CDI in hospital settings as a strategy to prevent the emergence of VRE and vancomycin intermediate Staphylococcus aureus.

Prior to the approval of fidaxomicin, oral vancomycin was the only agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis produced by C. difficile. Metronidazole was subsequently used off-label and, as a much less expensive alternative, became the de facto first-line treatment for mild to moderate cases of CDI. Other antibiotics have been tried in the past (fusidic acid, bacitracin, rifaximin, and nitazoxanide), but only limited clinical data are available for the treatment of CDI. Thus, there has been a need for new therapies to treat this challenging disease.

Ideally, drugs against C. difficile should be minimally absorbed, remain in the intestinal lumen, and have a narrow spectrum of activity, preserving the normal microbiota of the gut.

Fidaxomicin has a narrow-spectrum antibacterial profile, with potent bactericidal activity specifically against C. difficile. It displays moderate in vitro activity against some Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.) and is inactive against Gram-negative organisms and yeast. Fidaxomicin is minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with plasma concentrations in the nanogram-per-milliliter range after oral dosing.

In 2 phase 3 trials, fidaxomicin demonstrated noninferiority to vancomycin for clinical response in the treatment of CDI and superiority to vancomycin for sustained clinical response (cure without recurrence during the 30-day follow-up period). The efficacy results are presented in detail elsewhere. The safety results from nonclinical and clinical studies are summarized in the following sections.

### Clostridium difficile in inflammatory bowel disease [^ce026dcc]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis, are associated with an increased risk of symptomatic Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). CDI may also masquerade as an IBD flare and complicate IBD management. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of CDI in IBD patients.

Recent Findings

CDI remains common in IBD with complications including flares in disease activity, recurrent CDI episodes, and prolonged hospital stays. Newer IBD therapeutics including vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and tofacitinib are less likely to cause severe CDI. A high index of suspicion, rapid testing via a two-step method, and prompt treatment with vancomycin or fidaxomicin are paramount to managing CDI in IBD patients. Strategies to prevent recurrent CDI (rCDI) include the monoclonal antibody bezlotoxumab as well as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT has a robust profile of safety and effectiveness in preventing rCDI in adults and children.

Summary

Clinicians must remain vigilant in the prompt diagnosis and treatment of CDI in IBD patients. Corticosteroids, unnecessary antibiotics, and ongoing colonic inflammatory disease are modifiable risk factors. Improved infection control measures, newer IBD medications, and using effective CDI treatments will facilitate a reduced burden of severe CDI and complications for IBD patients.

### Treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated disease: old therapies and new strategies [^50ea0406]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2005). Medium credibility.

Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) causes substantial morbidity and mortality. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, involving altered bowel flora, production of toxins, and impaired host immunity, often in a nosocomial setting. Current guidelines recommend treatment with metronidazole; vancomycin is a second-line agent because of its potential effect on the hospital environment. We present the data that led to these recommendations and explore other therapeutic options, including antimicrobials, antibody to toxin A, probiotics, and vaccines. Treatment of CDAD has increasingly been associated with failure and recurrence. Recurrent disease may reflect relapse of infection due to the original infecting organism or infection by a new strain. Poor antibody responses to C difficile toxins have a permissive role in recurrent infection. Hospital infection control and pertinent use of antibiotics can limit the spread of CDAD. A vaccine directed against C difficile toxin may eventually offer a solution to the CDAD problem.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^393b6661]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

CDI is mediated through antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis that is exacerbated by current recommended first-in-line antibiotic therapy options, leading to high rates of CDI recurrence. The success of FMT therapy for multiply recurrent CDI has paved the way for next generation live biotherapeutics. Therapies targeted at microbiome restoration as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy can significantly improve treatment success and reduce the risk of disease recurrence. However, evidence suggests survival of C. difficile spores within mucosal biofilm populations, which could have implications for extended treatment success, emphasizing the need for biofilm targeted therapies. The long-term implications of these new CDI therapeutics are still mostly unknown, but efforts to expand the options for CDI treatment can offer multiple alternative solutions to treat this multifaceted infectious disease.

### Pouchitis: what every gastroenterologist needs to know [^cf52d324]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Pouchitis is the most common complication among patients with ulcerative colitis who have undergone restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Pouchitis is actually a spectrum of diseases that vary in etiology, pathogenesis, phenotype, and clinical course. Although initial acute episodes typically respond to antibiotic therapy, patients can become dependent on antibiotics or develop refractory disease. Many factors contribute to the course of refractory pouchitis, such as the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, infection with Clostridium difficile, pouch ischemia, or concurrent immune-mediated disorders. Identification of these secondary factors can help direct therapy.

### Cefotetan disodium (cefotetan) [^2996a019]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Prescribing cefotetan in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

As with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, prolonged use of cefotetan may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

Cefotetan should be used with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.

Information for Patients

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including cefotetan, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When cefotetan is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Cefotetan for Injection, USP or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

As with some other cephalosporins, a disulfiram-like reaction characterized by flushing, sweating, headache, and tachycardia may occur when alcohol (beer, wine, etc.) is ingested within 72 hours after Cefotetan for Injection, USP administration. Patients should be cautioned about the ingestion of alcoholic beverages following the administration of cefotetan.

Drug Interactions

Increases in serum creatinine have occurred when cefotetan was given alone. If cefotetan and an aminoglycoside are used concomitantly, renal function should be carefully monitored, because nephrotoxicity may be potentiated.

For non-typhoidal Salmonella, antibiotic therapy does not appear to reduce the length of illness and increases the period of stool detection. Self-treatment increased colonization by resistant Enterobacteriaceae: travel alone carried a 21% rate of colonization, whereas fluoroquinolone treatment increased extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae colonization to 80% of those who self-medicated with a fluoroquinolone.

### A review of the therapeutic management of ulcerative colitis [^3b9c09d8]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing and remitting and potentially progressive form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of uncertain aetiology, characterised by inflammation localised in the mucosa of the rectum and colon. A number of aetiological factors, such as genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, perturbations in the gut microbiome and immune dysregulation, have been implicated. The term 'ulcerative colitis' was first coined by Sir Samuel Wilks in 1859, distinguishing it as a separate entity from infectious diarrhoeal illnesses, a condition that would, in fact, be called Crohn's disease today. Until the realisation that corticosteroid therapy induced remission, surgery was the mainstay of management. There has been an evolution in therapies since the 1950s, and conventional management evolved into the use of broad spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs, such as amino-salicylates and corticosteroids, or immunomodulators, such as thiopurines, often sequentially with the aim of relieving symptoms and achieving remission to prevent long-term complications.

Unprecedented advances in the understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of IBD in the last 2–3 decades have translated into a dramatic increase in our therapeutic armamentarium with biological and 'small molecule' therapies intercepting and abrogating the immune-inflammatory cascade. Consequently, we have seen clinical response and remission rates that have emboldened our definitions of meaningful disease control. In this paper, we undertake a journey in the pharmacological therapy of UC from corticosteroids to modern biological, small molecule and other novel therapies.

### Therapeutic effects of roxithromycin in interleukin-10-deficient colitis [^bdfae9ab]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A limited number of therapeutic strategies are currently available to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Interleukin-10 (IL-10)-deficient mice, well characterized as an experimental model of IBD, develop severe chronic colitis because of aberrant Th1 responses. Roxithromycin (RXM), a macrolide antibiotic, has received attention because it offers not only antibacterial but also immunosuppressive effects. We examined the immunosuppressive effect of RXM on the development of IBD.

Methods

To test the efficacy of short-term administration of RXM, elder IL-10-deficient mice (16–20 weeks old) with established colitis were orally treated for 10 days with RXM (20 mg/kg per day). To test the long-term preventive effects of RXM, for 20 weeks young adult IL-10-deficient mice (4–5 weeks old) also were administered RXM orally (20 mg/kg per day).

Results

The short-term treatment-oriented administration of RXM reduced the degree of inflammatory change and lowered serum amyloid A in IL-10-deficient mice with severe colitis. Mononuclear cells from the lamina propria of RXM-treated large intestines showed lower production of IFN-gamma than did those from diseased mice that were untreated. Long-term prevention-oriented administration of RXM suppressed the development of severe colitis and decreased production of IFN-gamma and IL-12. In addition to its expected immunosuppressive effect, RXM treatment also decreased the level of Bacteroides vulgatus, a Gram-negative anaerobe.

Conclusions

The anti-inflammatory changes observed in IL-10-deficient mice resulted from the efficacy of RXM as an immunosuppressant as well as from its efficacy as an antibiotic. According to our findings, RXM would seem to have significant potential as a preventive and/or therapeutic agent for IBD.

### Management ofcolitis: insights for the gastroenterologist [^71c4df96]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The therapeutic landscape against CDI is rapidly evolving with accumulation of evidence from clinical trials and observational studies. At present, vancomycin and fidaxomicin are the drugs of choice in treating primary as well as recurrent CDI; the use of metronidazole is limited to severe-complicated disease. FMT should be offered to patients with multiply recurrent CDI. Further research into the treatment of recurrent and severe disease is warranted. Several drugs and microbiota-based products are undergoing clinical trials and may soon join the armamentarium available to physicians and patients to combat CDI.

### Management of Clostridium difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease: expert review from the clinical practice updates committee of the AGA institute [^a3e0d695]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — antibiotics and severity: According to treatment guidelines, a first and a second episode of mild–moderate CDI is treated with metronidazole 500 mg 3 times a day for 10 to 14 days (off-label), but failure rates have risen from 9.6% to as high as 22% to 26% and vancomycin was significantly more effective overall than metronidazole in randomized subgroup analysis. Vancomycin has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CDI and is first-line for severe (monotherapy) and severe complicated (in combination with intravenous metronidazole), is superior to metronidazole for CDI, and is noninferior to fidaxomicin for initial clinical response; fidaxomicin trials showed fewer recurrences compared with vancomycin. In adults with IBD, vancomycin use versus metronidazole has been associated with a decreased colectomy rate, significantly fewer re-admissions, and an approximately 50% shorter length of hospital stay. In an open-label study of fidaxomicin in IBD (n = 21), all patients responded, with resolution of diarrhea (81%) or improvement but not resolution (19%), and recurrent CDI occurred in 19% with a median time to recurrence of 29 days. Severe CDI is defined either by an increased leukocyte count, increased creatinine level, or low albumin level, and when CDI complicates underlying IBD it is associated with prolonged hospitalization, need for surgery, escalation of IBD therapy, and increased mortality; the authors state that IBD can be considered as another CDI severity marker indicating the need for more aggressive management and, in their opinion, vancomycin or fidaxomicin, but not metronidazole, should be used for the management of CDI in IBD.

### Management ofcolitis: insights for the gastroenterologist [^0f5f4c8d]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

To summarize, it seems prudent at this time to treat patients with CDI and IBD with vancomycin or fidaxomicin; FMT may be preferred in recurrent CDI. The decision regarding immunosuppression needs to be individualized. Above all, as patients with CDI and IBD are at an elevated risk of adverse outcomes, close monitoring and a low threshold for escalating therapy is essential. Ongoing clinical trials of FMT in this population will add much needed high-quality evidence (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT03106844, NCT03829475).

### A phase 2 extension study evaluating the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of 3 or 4 doses of a Clostridioides difficile vaccine in healthy US adults aged 65 to 85 years [^99c89b46]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile (previously Clostridium difficile) is a major cause of health care– and community-associated diarrhea. Symptoms can range from mild to severe outcomes, including colitis, toxic megacolon, intestinal perforation, and death. Risk factors for C difficile infection (CDI) include recent antibiotic treatment, older age, and certain comorbidities. Recurrence is a key challenge to treating CDI, occurring in up to 25% of patients given a traditional course of antibiotics to manage a primary infection.

Traditionally associated with health care facilities, the burden of community-associated CDI is increasing, with an estimated US incidence of 121.2 per 100 000 population in 2019 vs 55.3 in 2011. A highly virulent drug-resistant strain belonging to polymerase chain reaction ribotype 027 emerged from 2000 to 2010; however, incidence of hospital-acquired CDI has decreased since its peak. Antibiotics such as metronidazole, vancomycin, and fidaxomicin are generally the first line of treatment for primary CDI. Additional antibiotic courses may be used to treat recurrent infections but generally with less success than for primary infections. Another approach to treating recurrent CDI is the use of monoclonal antibodies against C difficile toxin B (bezlotoxumab), which is currently licensed for use in adults in the United States and Europe. Another treatment option recently approved in the United States for cases of recurring antibiotic-resistant CDI involves fecal transplants from healthy donors.

Overall, our results show that bacteria play a role in worsening colitis in α6 ΔIEC mice, but disease onset precedes bacterial attachment to the intestinal epithelial layer. In addition, the fact that antibiotic treatment only partially restored a normal healthy mucosa with normal IL-18 levels further supports the notion that IL-18 plays a key role in triggering inflammation.

### Early-life microbial restitution reduces colitis risk promoted by antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis in interleukin 10Mice [^c08e2641]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Perturbations in the early-life gut microbiome are associated with increased risk for complex immune disorders like inflammatory bowel diseases. We previously showed that maternal antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis vertically transmitted to offspring increases experimental colitis risk in interleukin (IL) 10 gene deficient (IL10 -/-) mice, a finding that may result from the loss/lack of essential microbes needed for appropriate immunologic education early in life. Here, we aimed to identify key microbes required for proper development of the early-life gut microbiome that decrease colitis risk in genetically susceptible animals.

Methods

Metagenomic sequencing followed by reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes was performed on fecal samples of IL10 -/- mice with and without antibiotic-induced dysbiosis to identify potential missing microbial members needed for immunologic education. One high-value target strain was then engrafted early and/or late into the gut microbiomes of IL10 -/- mice with antibiotic-induced dysbiosis.

Results

Early-, but not late-, life engraftment of a single dominant Bacteroides strain of non-antibiotic-treated IL10 -/- mice was sufficient to restore the development of the gut microbiome, promote immune tolerance, and prevent colitis in IL10 -/- mice that had antibiotic-induced dysbiosis.

Conclusions

Restitution of a keystone microbial strain missing in the early-life antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis results in recovery of the microbiome, proper development of immune tolerance, and reduced risk for colitis in genetically prone hosts.

### Clinical characteristics of colitis induced by taxane-based chemotherapy [^87c36451]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with diarrhea, abdominal pain, or vomiting were more likely to receive antibiotic treatment (P = 0.002, 0.004, and < 0.001 respectively; Table 4). These were administered either as monotherapy or combination therapy, with a median duration of 12 days (Table 1 and). Patients with abdominal pain or vomiting were more likely to be treated with intravenous fluids (P = 0.013 and < 0.001 respectively) than patients without these symptoms. Hospitalized patients were also more likely to be treated with antibiotics and intravenous fluids (P = 0.006 and < 0.001 respectively) than were patients who did not require hospitalization. In our cohort, 9 patients received both antibiotics and intravenous fluids. Patients who received antibiotics had a shorter duration of symptoms, with a mean duration of 24 days, while those who did not receive antibiotics had a mean duration of 63 days (P = 0.025). Likewise, patients who received intravenous fluids had a shorter duration of symptoms compared with those who did not (P = 0.037). More patients who received antibiotics for taxane-induced colitis were able to resume taxane therapy after resolution of colitis, but this difference was not significant (P = 0.080).

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^c201f332]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evolution of Guideline-Based Antimicrobial Recommendations to Treat C. difficile Infection. Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States (US), imposing a major burden on our healthcare system and affecting approximately 365,000 people annually. The financial burden of managing this infection is significant as well. It is estimated that all-cause direct medical costs for a population aged 18–64 were approximately US$72,000 for those with no recurrence and approximately US$200,000 for those with three or more recurrences. Given these considerations, optimizing therapies with data-driven recommendations by experts in the field can be most beneficial to minimize the burden of this disease on our patients, lessen the frequency of recurrence, and improve overall outcomes. Clinical guideline recommendations are an essential tool guiding treatment as they summarize data for a disease and provide algorithms to manage patients based on data that has been critically validated.

The CDI epidemic essentially began in the mid-1990s and continues to this day. As this epidemic has extended, there have been more reports and studies considering this infection. When searching " C. difficile " in PubMed, there were 68 references in 1995. In 2020, there were 726. With this influx of new studies, there have been surprisingly few well-performed prospective randomized controlled trials comparing treatments head-to-head. As a result, we rely on smaller studies or non-standard designs to guide our treatments for CDI and recurrent disease. This reliance on imperfect studies has led to certain foundational treatments becoming standard without the supporting data that we would typically expect from a clinical guideline that impacts care as significantly as guidelines for the management of CDI. Given these limitations, it is important to understand how the guidelines have changed over time, and, most importantly, what foundational studies have paved the way for the most recent recommendations in order for clinicians to make decisions that are most appropriate for their patients with the best insights to the data that support those decisions.

### Muc5ac expression protects the colonic barrier in experimental colitis [^c28f3891]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The mucus gel layer (MGL) lining the colon is integral to exclusion of bacteria and maintaining intestinal homeostasis in health and disease. Some MGL defects allowing bacteria to directly contact the colonic surface are commonly observed in ulcerative colitis (UC). The major macromolecular component of the colonic MGL is the secreted gel-forming mucin MUC2, whose expression is essential for homeostasis in health. In UC, another gel-forming mucin, MUC5AC, is induced. In mice, Muc5ac is protective during intestinal helminth infection. Here we tested the expression and functional role of MUC5AC/Muc5ac in UC biopsies and murine colitis.

Methods

We measured MUC5AC/Muc5ac expression in UC biopsies and in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis. We performed DSS colitis in mice deficient in Muc5ac (Muc5ac-/-) to model the potential functional role of Muc5ac in colitis. To assess MGL integrity, we quantified bacterial-epithelial interaction and translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes. Antibiotic treatment and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were performed to directly investigate the role of bacteria in murine colitis.

Results

Colonic MUC5AC/Muc5ac mRNA expression increased significantly in active UC and murine colitis. Muc5ac-/- mice experienced worsened injury and inflammation in DSS colitis compared with control mice. This result was associated with increased bacterial-epithelial contact and translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes. However, no change in microbial abundance or community composition was noted. Antibiotic treatment normalized colitis severity in Muc5ac-/- mice to that of antibiotic-treated control mice.

Conclusions

MUC5AC/Muc5ac induction in the acutely inflamed colon controls injury by reducing bacterial breach of the MGL.
