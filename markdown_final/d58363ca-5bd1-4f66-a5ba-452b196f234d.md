## Question

A 2-year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician's office with intermittent and severe stomach ache and vomiting for the last 2 days. Last week the whole family had a stomach bug involving a few days of mild fever, lack of appetite, and diarrhea but they have all made a full recovery since. This current pain is different from the type she had during infection. With the onset of pain, the child cries and kicks her legs up in the air or pulls them to her chest. The parents have also observed mucousy stools and occasional bloody stools that are bright red and mucousy. After a while, the pain subsides and she returns to her normal activity. Which of the following would be the next step in the management of this patient?
A. Air enema
B. Abdominal CT scan
C. Abdominal radiograph
D. Observe for 24 hours

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnostic and management step is most appropriate for a 2-year-old girl presenting with severe intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody, mucousy stools following a recent family viral gastroenteritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the current presentation fits a post-viral process or a different surgical emergency. Then, I should verify which pediatric surgical emergency matches this triad and what the best initial test is. Next, I will compare the listed options against guideline-supported pathways and decide on the next step that both confirms the diagnosis and leads to treatment. Finally, I will double-check pitfalls that could delay care and confirm the answer aligns with current pediatric emergency care standards.

> Let me first confirm the clinical pattern: the child has episodic severe abdominal pain with legs drawn up, non-bilious vomiting, and hematochezia with mucus. The family's recent viral gastroenteritis does not explain the bloody stools and this different, severe, colicky pain pattern. Wait, let me verify the differential: while gastroenteritis can cause vomiting and diarrhea, bloody mucous stools plus severe intermittent pain push me toward intussusception rather than a lingering viral illness or simple gastroenteritis recurrence, especially in this age group [^116zABcR] [^115Ub968].

> I will now examine which emergency fits best. The classic triad of intussusception is intermittent colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and currant jelly stools; importantly, that triad is not always present, but bloody mucous stools with severe intermittent pain in a toddler strongly suggest intussusception and warrants urgent evaluation. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: at first glance I wondered about recurrence of the family stomach bug, but the red flags here — bloody stools, severe intermittent pain, and the distinct behavioral pattern — argue against a simple viral recurrence and point to a mechanical bowel emergency that can progress to obstruction, ischemia, and perforation if not treated promptly [^116zABcR] [^111KJDJU].

> Next, I should review the best initial diagnostic modality. Ultrasound is the first-line test for suspected pediatric intussusception due to its high sensitivity and specificity, safety, speed, and lack of radiation; it can demonstrate the target/concentric ring sign and guide subsequent management. Let me verify: multiple pediatric series and reviews confirm ultrasound as the gold standard and the preferred initial test, whereas plain radiography has limited sensitivity and cannot exclude intussusception. CT scan is not indicated as an initial test in this setting because of radiation and limited added value over ultrasound for classic intussusception features [^113qDkzd] [^111EQZGq] [^116zABcR].

> Now, I need to align the options with guideline-based care. Option A, an air enema, represents both diagnostic confirmation and therapeutic reduction for stable children without perforation; this is the next step after ultrasound confirmation or when clinical suspicion is high and ultrasound access is delayed. Option B, abdominal CT, is not the recommended initial imaging and adds radiation without improving initial diagnostic yield. Option C, abdominal radiograph, may show obstruction or free air but is insensitive for intussusception and should not delay definitive imaging or treatment. Option D, observe for 24 hours, risks progression to ischemia, necrosis, and perforation and is inappropriate in a child with red flags for intussusception. I should confirm: contemporary pediatric emergency reviews emphasize prompt ultrasound and early non-operative reduction with enema when safe, rather than observation or low-yield radiographs [^116zABcR] [^111EQZGq].

> But wait, what if there are signs of peritonitis or perforation? I need to ensure we do not attempt enema reduction in unstable patients or those with peritoneal signs; in that scenario, surgical consultation and operative management are indicated. The vignette does not describe peritonitis or instability, so non-operative reduction remains appropriate once the diagnosis is secured or strongly suspected and perforation is excluded clinically and by imaging when feasible. Let me reconsider: yes, the safest, guideline-concordant next step here is to proceed to ultrasound urgently, and if intussusception is confirmed and the child is stable, move to enema reduction; among the listed choices, the enema option best captures both diagnostic confirmation and definitive therapy in the appropriate clinical context [^116zABcR] [^111EQZGq].

> Final answer: A. Air enema. Rationale: The presentation is classic for pediatric intussusception. Ultrasound is the diagnostic test of choice but is not offered among the options, and in this context an air enema serves as both diagnostic confirmation and therapeutic reduction for a stable child without peritoneal signs, which is the next best step among the listed choices and aligns with pediatric emergency care standards [^116zABcR] [^111EQZGq].

---

The next best step is **air enema** because the child has classic signs of intussusception (intermittent severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and currant jelly stools) [^116zABcR], and air enema is both diagnostic and therapeutic with high success and low complication rates [^116kov25]. Abdominal CT is unnecessary radiation and not first-line; plain radiograph is insensitive and nonspecific; observation risks progression to ischemia or perforation [^116zABcR]. If air enema is unavailable, use ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis and guide alternative reduction methods [^113qDkzd].

---

## Clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis

The key features — intermittent severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and currant jelly stools — are classic for **intussusception**, particularly in children aged 3 months to 3 years [^116zABcR]. The recent viral gastroenteritis may have acted as a lead point or triggered intussusception [^notfound]. Other considerations include:

- **Volvulus**: Continuous pain, distension, and bilious vomiting are more typical.
- **Appendicitis**: Usually older children with localized right lower quadrant pain and no currant jelly stools.
- **Meckel's diverticulum**: Painless hematochezia or melena is more common.
- **Henoch-Schönlein purpura**: Associated rash, arthritis, and renal involvement.
- **Infectious colitis**: Persistent diarrhea and fever are more prominent.

Given the classic triad and age, **intussusception is most likely** [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Ultrasound is the **diagnostic gold standard** for intussusception, with high sensitivity and specificity, and it avoids radiation [^111EQZGq]. However, among the provided options, **air enema** is the most appropriate next step because it is both diagnostic and therapeutic [^111sJfpV].

---

## Therapeutic options

- **Air enema**: First-line therapy for stable patients without signs of perforation or peritonitis; high success and low complication rates [^116kov25].
- **Hydrostatic enema**: Alternative if air enema is unavailable or contraindicated.
- **Surgical intervention**: Reserved for failed enema reduction, perforation, peritonitis, or unstable patients [^116zABcR].

---

## Risks and benefits of each option

| **Option** | **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|-|
| Air enema | - Diagnostic and therapeutic <br/> - High success <br/> - Low complication rate <br/> - No radiation | - Rare perforation <br/> - Recurrence (10–15%) |
| Abdominal CT | Detailed anatomical imaging | - Unnecessary radiation <br/> - Not first-line <br/> - Sedation may be needed |
| Abdominal radiograph | - Quick <br/> - Low radiation | - Insensitive <br/> - Nonspecific <br/> - Cannot confirm intussusception |
| Observation | Avoids invasive procedures | - Risk of progression to ischemia <br/> - Necrosis <br/> - Perforation <br/> - Delayed treatment |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The next best step is **air enema** because it is both diagnostic and therapeutic, with high success and low complication rates. Abdominal CT is unnecessary radiation; plain radiograph is insensitive; observation risks serious complications. If air enema is unavailable, use ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis and guide alternative reduction methods [^116kov25].

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^114tF6L9]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The present study has several limitations that need to be mentioned. Existing data is heterogeneous and derived from retrospective studies with inherent limitations. Although the level of evidence supporting the suggested treatment algorithm is low, it intends to serve as a general guide in day‐to‐day practice but should be adapted to the clinical scenario of every patient. There is a risk of selection bias as most of the included series were surgical or radiological cohorts, causing disparities in collected data and making comparison of these studies difficult. The majority of the patients in these studies had undergone surgery, inducing a potential selection bias with possible overestimation of malignancy rates. In that sense, this review might also be impacted by a publication bias: patients treated conservatively were less likely to be published in surgical series, whereas the opposite is true in radiological series. Furthermore, the lack of data on the success and timing of conservative treatment approaches hindered a more in‐depth analysis of different management strategies. Another potential selection bias may be related to the minimum requirement of 20 patients for study eligibility for this systematic review. The aim was to include more robust data, therefore excluding case reports and small case series that constitute most of the literature on this rare clinical entity. Moreover, the quality of data remains suboptimal, as all included studies were retrospective case series with highly heterogeneous data. Despite achieving a median score of 9/10 on the JBI critical appraisal tool for case series studies, the variability in the data impeded conducting a meta‐analysis of outcomes. However, the present study incorporates a comprehensive review of existing literature and presents succinctly the best published evidence to date. Prospective multicenter trials are required to refine management strategies, together with surgical studies providing in‐depth description of surgical management and related outcomes. In addition, the suggested pragmatic algorithm proposes standardized management to help clinicians with guidance of this rare pathology in their daily practice.

FGPR is common treatment method for intussusception due to its high success rate proven effectiveness, and low complication rate. Eight of our cases were successfully treated using this method. However, UGHR has increasingly replacing FGPR in many institutions due to its lack of radiation, high success rate, and minimal complications. Since its implementation in our hospital in 2019, we have seen a higher success rate with UGHR compared to pneumatic enema, with 5 out of 6 infants successfully reduced. UGHR is particularly beneficial for infants under 3 months, as it it eliminates radiation exposure and can be performed in the ward, it facilitates easier management. It allows for continuous monitoring during reduction, offers better patient comfort and is safer than pneumatic enema, which requires transfer to the radiology department. Additionally, The pressure of the hydraulic enema is uniform, which reduces irritation of the bowel and minimizes complications such as potential aspiration or risk of bowel perforation.

### About norovirus… [^111K6eJC]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Norovirus is the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea, and foodborne illness in the United States.
- People of all ages can get infected and sick with norovirus.
- Proper handwashing and other simple steps can help prevent getting and spreading norovirus. More Information. What it is Norovirus is a very contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea. It is sometimes called the "stomach flu" or the "stomach bug. " However, norovirus illness is not related to the flu. The flu is caused by the influenza virus. Norovirus causes acute gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach or intestines. Most people with norovirus illness get better within 1 to 3 days; but they can still spread the virus for a few days after. Keep Reading: Norovirus Facts and Stats. Types You can get norovirus illness many times in your life because there are many different types of noroviruses. Infection with one type of norovirus may not protect you against other types.

It is possible to develop protection against specific types. But it is not known exactly how long protection lasts. This may explain why so many people of all ages get infected during norovirus outbreaks. Signs and symptoms A person usually develops symptoms 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus. Most common symptoms: Diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, stomach pain Other symptoms: Fever, headache, and body aches. Dehydration If you have norovirus illness, you can feel extremely ill, and vomit or have diarrhea many times a day. This can lead to dehydration, especially in young children, older adults, and people with other illnesses. Symptoms of dehydration include:

- Decreased urination
- Dry mouth and throat
- Feeling dizzy when standing up
- Crying with few or no tears
- Unusual sleepiness or fussiness. Who is at risk Anyone can get infected and sick with norovirus and people of all ages get infected during norovirus outbreaks.

Your likelihood of getting a norovirus infection is also determined in part by your genes. If eaten raw, oysters and other filter-feeding shellfish can contain viruses and bacteria that can cause illness or death. Anyone who consumes raw shellfish is at risk of contracting norovirus. Children younger than 5 years old, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop severe infections. How it spreads Norovirus spreads very easily and quickly in different ways. You can get norovirus by: Having direct contact with someonewith norovirus, like caring for them, sharing food or eating utensils with them, or eating food handled by them. Eating food or drinking liquidsthat are contaminated with norovirus. Touching contaminated objects or surfacesand then putting your unwashed fingers in your mouth. You can still spread norovirus for 2 weeks or more after you feel better. Keep Reading: How Norovirus Spreads.

Prevention Norovirus is very contagious, but you can take steps to protect yourself and others, including:

- Wash your hands well and often.
- Cook shellfish thoroughly and wash fruits and vegetables.
- Clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces.
- Wash laundry in hot water.
- Stay home when sick for 2 days after symptoms stop. Keep Reading: How to Prevent Norovirus. Testing and diagnosis Diagnostic methods for norovirus focus on detecting viral RNA or viral antigen. Diagnostic tests are available at all public health laboratories and many clinical laboratories. Keep Reading: Laboratory Testing for Norovirus. Treatment and recovery Most people with norovirus illness get better within 1 to 3 days. There is no specific medicine to treat people with norovirus illness. Antibiotic drugs will not help treat norovirus infections because they fight bacteria, not viruses. Keep Reading: Facts About Antibiotic Use.

### Colistimethate (coly-mycin) [^116fDzFU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Use

In clinical studies, colistimethate sodium was administered to the pediatric population (neonates, infants, children and adolescents). Although adverse reactions appear to be similar in the adult and pediatric populations, subjective symptoms of toxicity may not be reported by pediatric patients. Close clinical monitoring of pediatric patients is recommended.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Coly-Mycin M should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Coly-Mycin M is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Coly-Mycin M or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

### Clinical manifestation and treatment of intussusception in children aged 3 months and under: a single centre analysis of 38 cases [^111EQZGq]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Intussusception is a common acute abdominal condition in infancy and childhood, particularly in infants aged 4 to 9 months, while it is rare in the first 3 months of life. Literature reports the incidence of neonatal intussusception to be between 0% and 2.7%. Data from our center over the last 10 years indicate that the incidence of intussusception in infants under 3 months of age is only 0.31% (38 out of 12,206 cases), with only one case diagnosed 3 days after birth.

Signs and symptoms of intussusception are often atypical in infants aged 3 months or younger. In our study, only 12 cases (31.6%) presented with the typical triad of symptoms: abdominal pain, bloody stools, and vomiting. When children outside the typical age range exhibit symptoms other than intermittent abdominal pain, diagnosing intussusception can be challenging and often delayed. Most of the intussusception cases in this age range were referral cases to our hospital, and the majority showed clear clinical signs upon arrival. USG confirmed the diagnosis in most cases shortly after admission.

USG is the gold standard for diagnosing intussusception, offering high sensitivity (98–100%) and specificity (88–100%) when performed by experienced operators. Compared to contrast enema and CT, USG is safer, cost-effective, and avoids radiation exposure, making it ideal for initial diagnosis in infants with symptoms like vomiting or unexplained crying. However, its accuracy may decrease with significant bowel distension, highlighting the importance of early detection. Abdominal plain radiographs are simple to perform and offer valuable diagnostic information for intussusception. Their use is recommended when feasible, as they aid in differentiating intussusception from other conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis and Hirschsprung's disease, as well as in detecting bowel perforation or necrosis. In our study, radiographs revealed complete intestinal obstruction in only 14 cases, underscoring that intussusception cannot be ruled out in young infants based solely on these findings.

### Clinical manifestation and treatment of intussusception in children aged 3 months and under: a single centre analysis of 38 cases [^11454B2h]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intussusception is the leading cause of acute abdominal conditions in infants, yet it is frequently under-recognised in those younger than 3 months, potentially resulting in serious complications such as bowel necrosis, peritonitis, or even death if not promptly treated. This retrospective study aims to enhance clinicians' understanding of the diagnosis and management of acute intussusception in this age group to prevent poor prognosis.

Methods

The clinical data of 38 infants aged ≤ 3 months diagnosed with intussusception at Wuhan Children's Hospital between January 2013 and July 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the outcome of nonoperative reduction: the successful group and the failed group. The study examined demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, imaging findings, treatment modalities, and outcomes to identify patterns and evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

Results

During the study period, 12,206 children were diagnosed with intussusception, including 38 (0.31%) infants aged 3 months or younger (mean age: 73.6 days; 20 males and 18 females). The most frequently reported symptoms were vomiting (36 cases), bloody stool (27 cases), and intermittent crying (18 cases). Ultrasonography (USG) confirmed the diagnosis in 97.4% of cases. A total of 27 (71.1%) infants treated with enema reduction, with a success rate of 48.1% (13/27). Enema-related perforation occurred in 2 cases (7.4%). An additional 11 cases (28.9%) proceeded directly to laparotomy, with 5 (15.8%) diagnosed as secondary intussusception. Bowel resection was necessary in 6 of the 25 surgical cases due to necrosis. Each infant responded well to treatment and was discharged in stable condition.

Conclusions

The clinical manifestations of intussusception in infants aged 3 months and below are sometimes atypical. Early USG should be performed to make a clear diagnosis, and the effect of early intervention is satisfactory. In infants with good general condition, enema reduction can be attempted first with appropriate pressure monitoring to avoid bowel perforation.

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^1173pfuG]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Hence, in patients with colocolic intussusception, preoperative workup with colonoscopy and tumor marker dosage is mandatory in the absence of indications for emergency surgery. When emergency surgery is required, oncological resection is the preferred approach. Reduction should not be attempted due to the risk of perforation, intraluminal seeding, or venous tumor dissemination.

This is depicted in our clinical guideline outline.

Regarding small bowel intussusception, when the diagnosis is confirmed on imaging, the first step consists of evaluating whether emergency surgery is necessary (e.g. signs of peritonitis, ischemia, or perforation). If not, a preoperative assessment of location and presence of a lead point on imaging should be undertaken.

A large retrospective study of 184 patients comparing CT scans of intussusceptions treated surgically or conservatively found that a discernible lead point was a predictive factor of surgical treatment. Enteric intussusceptions were significantly longer in the surgical group compared to the conservative group (median, 11.3 vs. 3.6 cm, P < 0.001).

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide and Instructions for Use).

Serious Infections

Inform patients that ACTEMRA may lower their resistance to infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Instruct the patient of the importance of contacting their doctor immediately when symptoms suggesting infection appear in order to assure rapid evaluation and appropriate treatment.

Gastrointestinal Perforation

Inform patients that some patients who have been treated with ACTEMRA have had serious side effects in the stomach and intestines [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Instruct the patient of the importance of contacting their doctor immediately when symptoms of fever, severe, persistent abdominal pain, and change in bowel habits appear to assure rapid evaluation and appropriate treatment.

Hypersensitivity and Serious Allergic Reactions

Inform patients that some patients who have been treated with ACTEMRA have developed serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, as well as serious skin reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Advise patients to stop taking ACTEMRA and seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptom of serious allergic reactions (including rash, hives, and swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or swallowing).

Instruction on Injection Technique

Assess patient suitability for home use for subcutaneous injection. Perform the first injection under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional. If a patient or caregiver is to administer subcutaneous ACTEMRA, instruct him/her in injection techniques and assess his/her ability to inject subcutaneously to ensure proper administration of subcutaneous ACTEMRA and the suitability for home use [see Instructions for Use].

Prior to use, remove the prefilled syringe (PFS) or autoinjector from the refrigerator and allow to sit at room temperature outside of the carton for 30 minutes (PFS) or 45 minutes (autoinjector), out of the reach of children. Do not warm ACTEMRA in any other way.

Advise patients to consult their healthcare provider if the full dose is not received.

A puncture-resistant container for disposal of needles, syringes and autoinjectors should be used and should be kept out of the reach of children. Instruct patients or caregivers in the technique as well as proper needle, syringe and autoinjector disposal, and caution against reuse of these items.

Pregnancy

Inform female patients of reproductive potential that ACTEMRA may cause fetal harm and to inform their prescriber of a known or suspected pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Ceritinib (Zykadia) [^112YPujG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred in patients treated with ZYKADIA 750 mg under fasted conditions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain occurred in 95% of 925 patients, including severe cases (Grade 3 or 4) in 14% of patients treated with ZYKADIA across clinical studies. Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain leading to dose interruptions or reductions occurred in 36% of patients and leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 1.6% of patients.

The incidence and severity of gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reduced for patients treated with ZYKADIA 450 mg with food in a dose optimization study (ASCEND-8). Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain occurred in 79% of 108 patients treated with ZYKADIA at the recommended dose of 450 mg with food. Of these, 53% were Grade 1 events and 24% were Grade 2 events. One patient (0.9%) experienced Grade 3 diarrhea, and one patient (0.9%) experienced Grade 3 vomiting. One patient (0.9%) required dose adjustment due to vomiting. Eleven (10%) patients had diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain that required at least one dose interruption.

Monitor and manage patients using standard of care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, or fluid replacement, as indicated. Withhold ZYKADIA if gastrointestinal adverse reaction is severe or intolerable and is not responsive to antiemetics or antidiarrheals. Upon improvement, resume ZYKADIA at a reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Vanzacaftor, tezacaftor, and deutivacaftor (Alyftrek) [^115QFwjt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Drug-Induced Liver Injury and Liver Failure

Elevated transaminases have been observed in patients treated with ALYFTREK [Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Cases of serious and potentially fatal drug-induced liver injury and liver failure have been reported in patients with and without a history of liver disease who were taking a fixed-dose combination drug containing elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA), which contains the same or similar active ingredients as ALYFTREK. Liver injury has been reported within the first month of therapy and up to 15 months following initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA.

Assess liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) in all patients prior to initiating ALYFTREK. Assess liver function tests every month during the first 6 months of treatment, then every 3 months for the next 12 months, then at least annually thereafter. Consider more frequent monitoring in patients with a history of liver disease, elevated liver function tests at baseline, or a history of elevated liver function tests with drugs containing ELX, TEZ and/or IVA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Interrupt ALYFTREK in the event of signs or symptoms of liver injury. These may include:

Significant elevations in liver function tests (e.g. ALT or AST > 5× the upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT or AST > 3× ULN with bilirubin > 2× ULN)
Clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of liver injury (e.g., jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, ascites)

Consider referral to a hepatologist and follow patients closely with clinical and laboratory monitoring until abnormalities resolve. If abnormalities resolve and if the benefit is expected to outweigh the risk, resume ALYFTREK treatment with close monitoring.

ALYFTREK should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). ALYFTREK is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefit outweighs the risk. If used, monitor patients closely [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Gastroenteritis… [^113VWToN]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Gastroenteritis, also known as infectious diarrhea, is an inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract including the stomach and intestine. Symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Fever, lack of energy, and dehydration may also occur. This typically lasts less than two weeks. Although it is not related to influenza, in Canada and the United States it is often referred to as "stomach flu". Gastroenteritis is usually caused by viruses; however, gut bacteria, parasites, and fungi can also cause gastroenteritis. In children, rotavirus is the most common cause of severe disease. In adults, norovirus and Campylobacter are common causes. Eating improperly prepared food, drinking contaminated water or close contact with a person who is infected can spread the disease. Treatment is generally the same with or without a definitive diagnosis, so testing to confirm is usually not needed. In those who are breastfed, continued breastfeeding is recommended.

For more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be needed. Fluids may also be given by a nasogastric tube. Zinc supplementation is recommended in children. Antibiotics are generally not needed. However, antibiotics are recommended for young children with a fever and bloody diarrhea. Signs and symptoms Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting. Sometimes, only one or the other is present. This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps. Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent. If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain. If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral and more likely to be bacterial. Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks. Children infected with rotavirus usually make a full recovery within three to eight days.

However, in poor countries treatment for severe infections is often out of reach and persistent diarrhea is common. Dehydration is a common complication of diarrhea. Severe dehydration in children may be recognized if the skin color and position returns slowly when pressed. This is called "prolonged capillary refill" and "poor skin turgor". Abnormal breathing is another sign of severe dehydration. Repeat infections are typically seen in areas with poor sanitation, and malnutrition. Stunted growth and long-term cognitive delays can result. Risk of infection is higher in children due to their lack of immunity. Children are also at higher risk because they are less likely to practice good hygiene habits. Children living in areas without easy access to water and soap are especially vulnerable. Toxigenic Clostridioides difficile is an important cause of diarrhea that occurs more often in the elderly. Infants can carry these bacteria without developing symptoms.

It is a common cause of diarrhea in those who are hospitalized and is frequently associated with antibiotic use. Staphylococcus aureus infectious diarrhea may also occur in those who have used antibiotics. Acute "traveler's diarrhea" is usually a type of bacterial gastroenteritis, while the persistent form is usually parasitic. Acid-suppressing medication appears to increase the risk of significant infection after exposure to several organisms, including Clostridioides difficile, Salmonella, and Campylobacter species. The risk is greater in those taking proton pump inhibitors than with H~2~ antagonists. Pathophysiology Gastroenteritis is defined as vomiting or diarrhea due to inflammation of the small or large bowel, often due to infection. The changes in the small bowel are typically noninflammatory, while the ones in the large bowel are inflammatory.

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^1128SnZW]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

In conclusion, this study comprehensively summarizes the existing evidence on intussusception in adults. Current data remain of low quality because of the limited experience and rare presentation of this clinical entity. In the meantime, we propose an algorithm based on the present systematic review and institutional clinical practice to guide decision making when confronted with intussusception. In case of colic intussusception, a high degree of suspicion for an underlying malignancy is warranted, and in that regard, an oncological surgical resection without reduction is recommended. Enteric intussusception should be managed according to the length, clinical presentation, and interoperative findings of lead points.

### Pediatric gastrointestinal tract outcomes during the postacute phase of COVID-19 [^113f64vT]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is COVID-19 associated with the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) tract symptoms and diseases during the postacute phase in children and adolescents?

Findings

In this cohort study of 1 576 933 pediatric patients, documented SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with GI tract symptoms and diseases during the postacute phase. Children and adolescents with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection faced a 25% higher risk of newly diagnosed GI tract symptoms and disorders during the postacute phase compared with those without documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (incidence, 8.64% vs 6.85%).

Meaning

These results suggest that clinicians should note that lingering GI tract symptoms after documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in children may be more common than in those without documented SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Teduglutide (Gattex) [^112dbQqQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4	Monitoring to Assess Safety

Colonoscopy and Upper GI Endoscopy in Adults

A follow-up colonoscopy and upper GI endoscopy (or alternate imaging) is recommended at the end of 1 year of GATTEX. If no polyp is found, subsequent colonoscopies and upper GI endoscopies (or alternate imaging) should be done no less frequently than every 5 years. If a polyp is found, adherence to current polyp follow-up guidelines is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Colonoscopy and Upper GI Endoscopy in Pediatric Patients

Perform subsequent fecal occult blood testing annually in pediatric patients while they are receiving GATTEX. If there is new or unexplained blood in the stool, perform colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy and an upper GI endoscopy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy is recommended for all pediatric patients after 1 year of treatment and every 5 years thereafter while on continuous treatment with GATTEX.
Consider upper GI endoscopy (or alternate other imaging) during treatment with GATTEX [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Laboratory Testing

Laboratory assessments are recommended every 6 months. If any clinically meaningful elevation is seen, further diagnostic workup is recommended as clinically indicated (i.e., imaging of the biliary tract, liver, or pancreas) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), (5.3)].

2.5	Discontinuation of Treatment

Discontinuation of treatment with GATTEX may result in fluid and electrolyte imbalance. Monitor fluid and electrolyte status in patients who discontinue GATTEX treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Table 4 provides the efficacy results for the primary endpoint in Trial 1 and Trial 2 in the primary analysis population.

A key secondary endpoint in these two ABSSSI trials evaluated the percentage of patients achieving a 20% or greater reduction in lesion area from baseline at 48–72 hours after initiation of therapy. Table 5 summarizes the findings for this endpoint in the two ABSSSI trials.

Another secondary efficacy endpoint in the two trials was investigator-assessed clinical success at post therapy evaluation at Day 14 to 24 (7 to 14 days from end of blinded therapy). A patient was categorized as a clinical success if the patient experienced a complete or nearly complete resolution of baseline signs and symptoms related to primary ABSSSI site (erythema, induration/edema, purulent drainage, fluctuance, pain, tenderness, local increase in heat/warmth) such that no further treatment with antibacterial drugs was needed.

Table 6 summarizes the findings for this endpoint in the mITT and clinically evaluable population in these two ABSSSI trials. Note that there are insufficient historical data to establish the magnitude of drug effect for antibacterial drugs compared with placebo at the post therapy visits. Therefore, comparisons of ORBACTIV to vancomycin based on clinical success rates at these visits cannot be utilized to establish non-inferiority conclusions.

Outcomes by Baseline Pathogen: Table 7 shows outcomes in patients with an identified baseline pathogen in the microbiological Intent-to-Treat (microITT) population in a pooled analysis of Trial 1 and Trial 2. The outcomes shown in the table are clinical response rates at 48 to 72 hours and clinical success rates at follow-up study day 14 to 24.

### High risk and low incidence diseases: pediatric intussusception [^116zABcR]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric intussusception is a serious condition that carries with it a high risk of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of pediatric intussusception, including the presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Intussusception is one of the most common pediatric abdominal emergencies. This is associated with one part of the intestine telescoping into another, resulting in bowel edema. If the intussusception remains untreated, obstruction, ischemia, necrosis, and perforation may result. Most cases are idiopathic, with 10–25% associated with a pathologic mass or lead point. The most common age group affected includes those between 3 months to 5 years. The triad of intermittent abdominal pain, currant jelly stool, and sausage-shaped mass is uncommon, though most patients will present with intermittent abdominal pain. Nonbilious emesis and bloody stools (gross blood or guaiac positive) are also common. Younger patients can present atypically, including altered mental status or lethargy. Thus, intussusception should be considered in pediatric patients with abdominal pain, emesis, and a sausage-shaped mass, as well as those with atypical presentations such as altered mental status or lethargy if there is no other etiology found on testing. The diagnostic modality of choice is ultrasound. Plain radiography may assist in evaluating for obstruction and perforation. Treatment includes prompt reduction of the intussusception. In patients who are stable and have no evidence of perforation, non-operative reduction with hydrostatic or pneumatic reduction should be attempted. Operative intervention is necessary in those who are unstable, peritonitic, or have a focal lead point. Discharge may be appropriate for patients following successful non-operative reduction if the patient is able to tolerate clear fluids, is asymptomatic, and can return for any recurrence of symptoms.

Conclusion

An understanding of pediatric intussusception and its many potential mimics can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this high risk disease.

### Colistimethate sodium [^116bVUGb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Use

In clinical studies, colistimethate sodium was administered to the pediatric population (neonates, infants, children and adolescents). Although adverse reactions appear to be similar in the adult and pediatric populations, subjective symptoms of toxicity may not be reported by pediatric patients. Close clinical monitoring of pediatric patients is recommended.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Colistimethate for Injection, USP should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Colistimethate for Injection, USP is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Colistimethate for Injection, USP or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

### Alpelisib (Vijoice) [^111Enx7X]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

Adult Patients

The recommended dosage of VIJOICE in adult patients is 250 mg orally, once daily, administered as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4)] until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Pediatric Patients (2 to less than 18 years of age)

The recommended initial dosage of VIJOICE in pediatric patients is 50 mg orally, once daily, administered as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4)] until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Consider a dose increase to 125 mg once daily in pediatric patients ≥ 6 years old for response optimization (clinical/radiological) after 24 weeks of treatment with VIJOICE at 50 mg once daily. When a pediatric patient turns 18 years old, consider a gradual dose increase up to 250 mg. Recommended dose increases by age group are listed in Table 1.

2.2 VIJOICE Dosage Form Overview

VIJOICE is available in two dosage forms: tablets and oral granules.

Prescribe the most appropriate dosage form of VIJOICE according to the dose required and patient needs.

VIJOICE Tablets (50 mg, 125 mg, and 200 mg) may be administered as:

Whole tablets: For patients who can swallow whole tablets.
Tablets prepared as an oral suspension: For patients who have difficulty swallowing whole tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

VIJOICE Oral Granules (50 mg per packet):

For patients who are prescribed a 50 mg daily dose only [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].
Do not use multiple 50 mg packets or a partial packet of oral granules for patients prescribed a 125 mg or a 250 mg dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Do not combine VIJOICE tablets and VIJOICE oral granules to achieve the prescribed dose.

2.3 VIJOICE Administration Overview

Take VIJOICE with food at approximately the same time each day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

If a dose of VIJOICE is missed, it can be taken with food within 9 hours after the time it is usually taken. After more than 9 hours, skip the dose for that day. The next day, take VIJOICE at the usual time.

If the patient vomits after taking the dose, advise the patient not to take an additional dose on that day, and to resume the dosing schedule the next day at the usual time.

### Predicting bowel necrosis in pediatric acute intussusception using roundness and other related factors [^116MQuu7]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Bloody stools are a common clinical sign of intussusception and suggest compromised blood flow to the bowel, with possible ischemic necrosis of some mucosal segments and impaired vascular function. Rayamajhi et al. identified bloody stools as an independent predictor of bowel necrosis. Although the necrosis group in this study had a higher incidence of bloody stools than the control group (52.17% vs. 17.19%, P < 0.05), bloody stools were not statistically significant in multivariate analysis (P = 0.085). This might be due to the emphasis of the multivariate model on an optimal predictor combination to achieve maximal predictive power.

Guo et al. analyzed 190 cases of pediatric intussusception and found that radiological findings were shown to have a high concordance with pathology in the assessment of intussusception. For intussusception intestinal necrosis, the signs on plain films were clearer than those on colour Doppler sonography. However, Lagalla et al. found that bowel necrosis presented as absent or reduced blood flow signal on CDFI. Lam et al. reported when sonographic features of loss of blood fiow to the intussusception are present in latevintussusception, surgical intervention is required. These suggest that reduced or absent blood flow may predict bowel necrosis. CDFI blood flow provides diagnostic and therapeutic guidance. In our study, the intussusception flow signal was graded. The Limberg semi-quantitative method was used to grade blood flow at the neck of the intussuscepted segment, with 73.91% of necrosis cases showing grades < 4. Compared with the control group, fewer patients in the necrosis group showed grade 4 blood flow (26.09% vs. 78.12%, P < 0.05), suggesting a significant reduction in blood flow signals in cases of bowel necrosis. Multivariate analysis confirmed blood flow grading as an independent predictor of bowel necrosis, indicating that low-grade blood flow signals (< grade 4) should caution against blindly using enema reduction in such patients.

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^111KJDJU]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Intussusception is defined as the telescoping or invagination of one segment of the gastrointestinal tract into an adjacent segment. This condition can lead to various complications, such as bowel obstruction, ischemia, and even perforation. It is most commonly observed in children, where it is typically primary and benign, often resolving with nonoperative reduction using a water‐soluble contrast enema. In contrast, intussusception is rare in adults, accounting for approximately 5% of all cases of intussusception and accounting for approximately 1%–5% of intestinal obstructions. Pediatric intussusception is characterized by the classic triad of abdominal pain, a palpable mass, and 'red currant jelly' stool, although this triad is present in only a minority of cases. In adults, diagnosis is more challenging due to nonspecific symptoms, which can be acute or chronic and often require further diagnostic work‐up, such as imaging or endoscopy. Whereas nonoperative management represents the initial treatment strategy in pediatric intussusceptions; adult intussusceptions involve a lead point in up to 92% of patients, potentially related to a malignant tumor and therefore requiring different management. Whereas surgery is often required to determine the underlying etiology, the optimal surgical strategy remains a subject of debate. Although surgical reduction may prevent unnecessary bowel resection, it carries risks, including intraluminal seeding or venous tumor dissemination in cases of malignancy, or spillage in cases of perforation. Currently, there are no established guidelines for the surgical management of intussusception in adult patients, with most available data derived from individual institutional case series.

With advancements in technology and the widespread use of CT‐scans in both emergency and elective settings, the detection rate of incidental or small intussusceptions is increasing. This has further fueled debate concerning their treatment and the possibility of conservative management.

For these reasons, the primary objectives of this study were to conduct a systematic review of the literature on adult intussusception and secondly to propose a management algorithm to guide surgeons in their daily practice.

### Isoniazid [^116M2uQ9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING

Severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid therapy has been reported and may occur or may develop even after many months of treatment. The risk of developing hepatitis is age related. Approximate case rates by age are: less than 1 per 1,000 for persons under 20 years of age, 3 per 1,000 for persons in the 20 to 34 year age group, 12 per 1,000 for persons in the 35 to 49 year age group, 23 per 1,000 for persons in the 50 to 64 year age group and 8 per 1,000 for persons over 65 years of age. The risk of hepatitis is increased with daily consumption of alcohol. Precise data to provide a fatality rate for isoniazid-related hepatitis is not available; however, in a U.S. Public Health Service Surveillance Study of 13,838 persons taking isoniazid, there were 8 deaths among 174 cases of hepatitis.

Therefore, patients given isoniazid should be carefully monitored and interviewed at monthly intervals. For persons 35 and older, in addition to monthly symptom reviews, hepatic enzymes (specifically, AST and ALT [formerly SGOT and SGPT, respectively]) should be measured prior to starting isoniazid therapy and periodically throughout treatment. Isoniazid-associated hepatitis usually occurs during the first three months of treatment. Usually, enzyme levels return to normal despite continuance of drug, but in some cases progressive liver dysfunction occurs. Other factors associated with an increased risk of hepatitis include daily use of alcohol, chronic liver disease and injection drug use. A recent report suggests an increased risk of fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid among women, particularly black and Hispanic women. The risk may also be increased during the post partum period. More careful monitoring should be considered in these groups, possibly including more frequent laboratory monitoring. If abnormalities of liver function exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal, discontinuation of isoniazid should be strongly considered. Liver function tests are not a substitute for a clinical evaluation at monthly intervals or for the prompt assessment of signs or symptoms of adverse reactions occurring between regularly scheduled evaluations. Patients should be instructed to immediately report signs or symptoms consistent with liver damage or other adverse effects. These include any of the following: unexplained anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, icterus, rash, persistent paresthesias of the hands and feet, persistent fatigue, weakness or fever of greater than 3 days duration and/or abdominal tenderness, especially right upper quadrant discomfort. If these symptoms appear or if signs suggestive of hepatic damage are detected, isoniazid should be discontinued promptly, since continued use of the drug in these cases has been reported to cause a more severe form of liver damage.

### Phenotypic classification of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children using latent class analysis [^111FKVYB]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is an uncommon but severe hyperinflammatory syndrome that occurs 2 to 6 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection, postulated to arise because of postinfectious immune dysregulation. As of December 2, 2024, there have been 9750 MIS-C cases and 80 associated deaths in the US reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) national surveillance system, with higher incidence among racial and ethnic minority children and youths early in the pandemic. Patients with MIS-C commonly present with fever; gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain; cardiac dysfunction; and mucocutaneous symptoms, including rash and conjunctivitis. In May 2020, the CDC developed a case definition for MIS-C using the following criteria: hospitalized patients younger than 21 years with fever, involvement of 2 or more organ systems, laboratory evidence of inflammation, laboratory or epidemiologic evidence of current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection, and no alternative plausible diagnosis. This definition was broad to maximize MIS-C case capture. Effective January 2023, the CDC and the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) created a new MIS-C surveillance case definition to reduce misclassification and minimize reporting burden. Changes included removal of the respiratory organ involvement criterion to potentially decrease misclassification of severe acute pediatric COVID-19 as MIS-C.

### Diagnostic value of ultrasound in pediatric acute abdominal pain: a cross-sectional study from a tertiary center in Southern iran [^113qDkzd]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute abdominal pain is a frequent and challenging symptom encountered in pediatric emergency departments globally. It contributes significantly to emergency department visits, spanning from mild, self-resolving conditions to critical, life-threatening surgical emergencies. In children, Assessing abdominal pain can be especially challenging due to the frequently nonspecific nature of symptoms, limited verbal communication abilities in younger children, and a broad spectrum of differential diagnoses that differ across age groups. Accurate and timely diagnosis is critical to avoid complications and unnecessary surgical interventions while ensuring appropriate management.

Ultrasound has emerged as a crucial diagnostic modality in assessing acute abdominal pain in pediatric patients. As a non-invasive, readily available, and radiation-free modality, it is often preferred over other imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT) in the pediatric population. Its utility spans a broad spectrum of conditions, including appendicitis, intussusception, mesenteric lymphadenitis, and ovarian or testicular torsion, among others. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound in diagnosing appendicitis, for example, have been well-documented, making it a cornerstone of the diagnostic approach in many emergency settings.

Despite its widespread use, the prevalence of specific ultrasound findings in children with acute abdominal pain remains under-researched in many regions, particularly in developing countries. Comprehending these patterns is essential for customizing diagnostic protocols, enhancing resource distribution, and improving patient outcomes.

Moreover, regional variations in disease prevalence, healthcare infrastructure, and patient demographics underscore the need for localized data to inform clinical practice. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the sonographic findings in pediatric patients presenting with acute abdominal pain to its emergency department. This gap highlights the need for a comprehensive evaluation to assess the prevalence of various sonographic findings, their diagnostic implications, and their contribution to clinical decision-making. This study aims to provide a detailed assessment of sonographic findings in pediatric patients with acute abdominal pain presenting to the emergency department of Namazi Hospital in 2021 and 2022. Through the analysis of these findings, we aim to provide valuable insights into the diagnostic framework, promote evidence-based practices, and ultimately improve the quality of care for pediatric patients in this context.

### Hair today, OR tomorrow: a multicenter case series of gastric bezoars in children diagnosed with point-of-care ultrasound [^114v7XmC]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) can expedite the diagnosis of pediatric abdominal pathologies including appendicitis and intussusception. In this patient series, we present cases from multiple pediatric emergency departments that demonstrate the use of POCUS in the diagnosis of trichobezoars in children. POCUS findings include the presence of an intragastric hyperechoic mass or a hyperechoic arch and associated posterior acoustic shadowing. These findings in the appropriate clinical context should prompt further diagnostic imaging and/or surgical consultation for removal.

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^116oFqzF]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Adult intussusception is a rare clinical entity, representing 1%–5% of intestinal obstruction. Diagnosis is challenging, as symptoms may be acute or chronic and are often non‐specific. Because of the rarity of this disease, no clinical guidelines currently exist for its management, and randomized‐controlled trials are not feasible within realistic timeframes. As a result, debates continue regarding both surgical and conservative management, especially with the widespread use of CT scans for diagnosis. When surgery is indicated, debate remains about the type of procedure, the necessity of reduction, and whether resection should follow oncological standards.

The primary outcome of interest of this systematic review was the etiology causing the intussusception.

Even though considering a substantial risk of bias in this systematic review, especially due to publication and reporting bias, lack of etiological data in conservatively treated patients, and the predominance of large surgical series, the high percentage of malignancies in colocolic intussusceptions remains striking. Whereas the majority of intussusceptions are enteric and benign, malignancy was identified in 68% of colocolic intussusceptions. These finding are further supported by a multicentric retrospective study from Korea including 77 adult intussusceptions. In their cohort, the authors found that 61.5% of colonic intussusceptions had underlying malignancies and on multivariable analysis, colonic intussusception was found as an independent predictor of malignancy (OR 5.5, 95%CI 1.2‐24.3, p = 0.026) along with chronic symptoms (OR 4.6, 95%CI 1.2‐18.1, p = 0.031).

### Zinc sulfate injection (zinc sulfate) [^117LHHcF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5	Recommended Dosage and Monitoring in Adult and Pediatric Patients

Zinc sulfate injection provides 1 mg/mL or 5 mg/mL of zinc.
Zinc sulfate injection in a concentration of 1 mg/mL is recommended for use in pediatric patients, particularly those weighing less than 12 kg.
The dosage of zinc sulfate injection should be individualized based on the patient's clinical condition, nutritional requirements, and the contribution of oral or enteral zinc intake.

Adults

The recommended adult dosage is 3 mg/day for metabolically stable patients, with potential need for a higher daily dosage in monitored patients with small bowel fluid loss or excess stool or ileostomy output.

Pediatric Patients

The recommended pediatric dosage is shown in Table 1 by age and estimated weight. The dosages in Table 1 are general recommendations intended for most pediatric patients. However, based on clinical requirements, some patients may require a higher dosage.

Table 1: Recommended Dosage of Zinc Sulfate Injection for Pediatric Patients by Age and Estimated Weight

*Term neonates have higher requirements in the first 3 months of life

Monitoring

Monitor zinc concentrations during treatment. Also monitor patients clinically for signs and symptoms of zinc deficiency, especially in pediatrics. Zinc concentrations may vary depending on the assay used and the laboratory reference range. The collection, processing, and storage of the blood samples for zinc analysis should be performed according to the laboratory's sample requirements. Zinc concentrations in hemolyzed samples are falsely elevated due to release of zinc from erythrocytes. The lower end of the reported range in healthy adults in serum is 60 mcg/dL.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for extravasation of antineoplastic agents, more specifically with respect to indications for referral, ASCO/ONS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing a surgical referral or escalation of care for patients with central line extravasation of irritants with vesicant properties or vesicant antineoplastic agents, in addition to conservative management, rather than conservative management alone.

- recognize that high-risk populations, such as patients receiving DNA-binding vesicants, those with high-volume estimated extravasation, and those with National Cancer Institute CTCAE grade 2 (erythema associated with symptoms such as edema, pain, induration, and phlebitis), grade 3 (ulceration or necrosis; severe tissue damage), or grade 4 (life-threatening consequences) extravasation, may have a greater likelihood of benefiting from surgical referral or escalation in care.

### Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) [^113n2az5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Nursing Mothers

Sulfonamides, including sulfasalazine, are present in human milk (see Pregnancy, Clinical Considerations). Insignificant amounts of sulfasalazine have been found in milk, whereas levels of the active metabolite sulfapyridine in milk are about 30 to 60 percent of those in the maternal serum. Caution should be exercised when AZULFIDINE EN-tabs is administered to a nursing mother.

There are reports with limited data of bloody stools or diarrhea in human milk fed infants of mothers taking sulfasalazine. In cases where the outcome was reported, bloody stools or diarrhea resolved in the infant after discontinuation of sulfasalazine in the mother or discontinuation of breastfeeding. Due to limited data, a causal relationship between sulfasalazine exposure and bloody stools or diarrhea cannot be confirmed or denied. Monitor human milk fed infants of mothers taking sulfasalazine for signs and symptoms of diarrhea and/or bloody stools.

Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of AZULFIDINE EN-tabs in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years with ulcerative colitis have not been established.

The safety and effectiveness of AZULFIDINE EN-tabs for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in pediatric patients aged 6–16 years is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. The extrapolation from adults with rheumatoid arthritis to children with polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is based on similarities in disease and response to therapy between these two patient populations. Published studies support the extrapolation of safety and effectiveness for sulfasalazine to polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis1,5(see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

It has been reported that the frequency of adverse events in patients with systemic-course of juvenile arthritis is high.6Use in children with systemic-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis has frequently resulted in a serum sickness-like reaction.5This reaction is often severe and presents as fever, nausea, vomiting, headache, rash, and abnormal liver function tests. Treatment of systemic-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with sulfasalazine is not recommended.

### Norovirus… [^113PgsMT]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Norovirus, also known as Norwalk virus and sometimes referred to as the winter vomiting disease, is the most common cause of gastroenteritis. Infection is characterized by non-bloody diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain. Fever or headaches may also occur. Symptoms usually develop 24 hours after being exposed, and recovery typically occurs within one to three days. Complications are uncommon, but may include dehydration, especially in the young, the old, and those with other health problems. The virus is usually spread by the fecal–oral route. This may be through contaminated food or water or person-to-person contact. It may also spread via contaminated surfaces or through air from the vomit of an infected person. Risk factors include unsanitary food preparation and sharing close quarters. Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms. Confirmatory testing is not usually available but may be performed by public health agencies during outbreaks.

Signs and symptoms Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. A person usually develops symptoms of gastroenteritis 24 hours after being exposed to norovirus. General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headaches, and low-grade fevers may occur. The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare. Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it is not usually dangerous, and most who contract it make a full recovery within two to three days. Norovirus can establish a long-term infection in people who are immunocompromised, such as those with common variable immunodeficiency or with a suppressed immune system after organ transplantation. These infections can be with or without symptoms. In severe cases, persistent infections can lead to norovirus‐associated enteropathy, intestinal villous atrophy, and malabsorption.

Virology Transmission Noroviruses are transmitted directly from person to person and indirectly via contaminated water and food. Transmission can be aerosolized when those stricken with the illness vomit or by a toilet flush when vomit or diarrhea is present; infection can follow eating food or breathing air near an episode of vomiting, even if cleaned up. The viruses continue to be shed after symptoms have subsided, and shedding can still be detected many weeks after infection. Vomiting, in particular, transmits infection effectively and appears to allow airborne transmission. In one incident, a person who vomited spread the infection across a restaurant, suggesting that many unexplained cases of food poisoning may have their source in vomit. In December 1998, 126 people were dining at six tables; one person vomited onto the floor. Staff quickly cleaned up, and people continued eating.

Three days later others started falling ill; 52 people reported a range of symptoms, from fever and nausea to vomiting and diarrhea. The cause was not immediately identified. Researchers plotted the seating arrangement: more than 90% of the people at the same table as the sick person later reported becoming ill. Most noroviruses that infect humans belong to genogroups GI and GII. Noroviruses from genogroup II, genotype 4 account for the majority of adult outbreaks of gastroenteritis and often sweep across the globe. HBGAs are not, however, the receptor or facilitator of norovirus infection. Co-factors such as bile salts may facilitate the infection, making it more intense when introduced during or after the initial infection of the host tissue. Bile salts are produced by the liver in response to eating fatty foods, and they help with the absorption of consumed lipids.

Gastrointestinal

Diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, and abdominal discomfort were each seen in 34% to 61% of acromegalic patients in U.S. studies. 2.6% of the patients discontinued therapy due to these symptoms. These symptoms were seen in 5% to 10% of patients with carcinoid tumors and VIPomas.

The frequency of these symptoms was not dose related, but diarrhea and abdominal discomfort generally resolved more quickly in patients treated with 300 mcg/day than in those treated with 750 mcg/day. Vomiting, flatulence, abnormal stools, abdominal distention, and constipation were each seen in less than 10% of patients.

In rare instances, gastrointestinal side effects may resemble acute intestinal obstruction, with progressive abdominal distension, severe epigastric pain, abdominal tenderness, and guarding.

Hypo/Hyperglycemia

Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively, but only in about 1.5% of other patients. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were noted in approximately 2% of patients.

Hypothyroidism

In acromegalics, biochemical hypothyroidism alone occurred in 12% while goiter occurred in 8% and 4% required initiation of thyroid replacement therapy during octreotide therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. In patients without acromegaly, hypothyroidism has only been reported in several isolated patients and goiter has not been reported.

Other Adverse Events

Pain on injection was reported in 7.7%, headache in 6%, and dizziness in 5%. Pancreatitis was also observed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Other Adverse Events 1% to 4%

Other events, each observed in 1% to 4% of patients, included fatigue, weakness, pruritus, joint pain, backache, urinary tract infection, cold symptoms, flu symptoms, injection site hematoma, bruise, edema, flushing, blurred vision, pollakiuria, fat malabsorption, hair loss, visual disturbance, and depression.

Anaphylactoid reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported in several patients receiving octreotide.

### Esmolol hydrochloride [^112NJmUS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity.

In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride produced effects typical of a beta blocker: a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length.

In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels.

The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients).

In a randomized, controlled trial conducted in Peru in 110 pediatric patients with diarrhea and with or without enteric symptoms (e.g., abdominal distention, right iliac fossa tenderness) caused by G. lamblia, a three-day course of treatment with nitazoxanide (100 mg twice daily in pediatric patients ages 24–47 months, 200 mg twice daily in pediatric patients ages 4 through 11 years) was compared to a five-day course of treatment with metronidazole (125 mg twice daily in pediatric patients ages 2 through 5 years, 250 mg twice daily in pediatric patients ages 6 through 11 years). Clinical response was evaluated 7 to 10 days following initiation of treatment with a 'well' response defined as 'no symptoms, no watery stools and no more than 2 soft stools with no hematochezia within the past 24 hours' or 'no symptoms and no unformed stools within the past 48 hours'.The following clinical response rates were obtained:

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^111wSAQE]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

3.4 Management

Operative management was performed in 65% of intussusceptions (1581/2432 intussusceptions, 2330 patients, based on 37 studies). Excluding studies including only surgically operated patients, conservative management was performed in 851/1683 intussusceptions (51%). Data regarding surgical access through open or minimally invasive surgery were available in 14 studies for 778 patients. Most patients (n = 564, 72%) underwent open management, whereas 214 (28%) underwent minimally invasive surgery. Data regarding surgical management of the intussusception were heterogenous and poorly reported (available in only 23 studies). En bloc resection without prior reduction was carried out in 676/1063 intussusceptions (64%), reduction and resection were performed in 206/972 (21%), and reduction alone was performed in 66/1063 (6%). Regarding spontaneously reduced intussusceptions, 31 studies reported whether they had negative findings upon exploratory surgery. This was the case in 214/1250 intussusceptions (17%).

Data regarding conservative and surgical treatment can be found in Table 1, whereas Table 3 summarizes the details of surgical management.

3.5 Treatment Algorithm

Based on the results of this systematic review, we propose a pragmatic treatment algorithm for management of intussusception (Figure 2). Because of high malignancy rates for both ileocolic and colocolic intussusceptions, these types were grouped under "large bowel".

Giardia clinical manifestations in children are characterized by an incubation period that usually lasts 1 to 2 weeks and averages 7 days, with children usually presenting with short-lasting, acute watery diarrhea with or without low-grade fever, nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain; others may have a protracted intermittent course with foul-smelling stools, flatulence, abdominal distension, and anorexia. Malabsorption combined with anorexia can lead to significant weight loss, failure to thrive, and malnutrition in children, and stools can initially be profuse and watery and later become greasy and foul smelling with blood, mucus, and fecal leukocytes absent. Post-Giardia infection lactose intolerance can occur in 20% to 40% of patients, asymptomatic Giardia infection is common, and extraintestinal invasion can occur with trophozoites migrating into bile or pancreatic ducts; recent evidence demonstrates that one third of patients will express long term extraintestinal symptoms, including ocular, muscular and metabolic complications, and reactive arthritis has also been associated with giardiasis.

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^115SpqEL]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Management of intestinal intussusception remains controversial with regards to conservative versus operative management, as well as choice of surgical procedure.

Methods

A systematic review on PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, SCOPUS/EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was performed. Articles published between 2004 and 2024 were collected. Case reports and case series < 20 patients were not considered.

Results

After screening of 2286 articles, 37 studies totaling 2330 patients were included. All studies were retrospective case series except for one prospective case series and one prospective and retrospective case series. There were 20% of colocolic intussusceptions, 21% of ileocolic intussusceptions, and 65% of enteric (small bowel) intussusceptions. A radiological lead point of the intussusception was described in 31% of patients. Intussusceptions were idiopathic in 39%, and caused by a pathological lead point in 58% of cases. Underlying malignancy was present 25% of cases and was more frequent in case of colocolic intussusceptions (68%), versus 9% in small bowel intussusceptions, and 46% of ileocolic intussusceptions. Operative management was performed in 49% of intussusceptions, mainly through open access (72%). Based on these findings, a comprehensive algorithm is provided to guide treatment decisions in adult patients with intussusception.

Conclusion

Data regarding surgical management of the intussusception were heterogenous and poorly reported. In case of colic intussusception, a high degree of suspicion for an underlying malignancy is warranted, and in that regard, an oncological surgical resection without reduction is recommended. Enteric intussusception should be managed according to length, clinical presentation, and interoperative findings of lead points.

### Clinical manifestation and treatment of intussusception in children aged 3 months and under: a single centre analysis of 38 cases [^115Ub968]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intussusception is a pathological process in which a segment of bowel twists and retracts on itself into the adjacent intestine, resulting in an intestinal obstruction. Its the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in infants and young children, with a prevalence of 0.5 per 1,000 to 2 per 1,000, common in children aged 4 months to 24 months, with peak incidence at 4–9 months of age, with a very low incidence in infants under 3 months of age. The clinical presentation of intussusception in young infants is often atypical, with the disease typically being acute and rapidly progressive, frequently leading to severe complications such as intestinal necrosis, peritonitis, and even death.

Currently, the diagnosis and treatment of intussusception have been standardised, and ultrasound (US) diagnosis and non-surgical treatment with enemas have been widely accepted. However, there is still controversy as to whether conservative treatment with enemas is appropriate for small infants. The difficulty lies in the limitations of using low to medium pressure for enema reduction, which often fails to achieve complete reduction, as excessive or improper attempts may aggravate the condition and result in intestinal perforation. Intussusception in infants, especially those under 3 months of age, remains underreported in both domestic and international literature. Moreover, there is limited global consensus on the best management strategies for this age group, particularly in regions with variable healthcare infrastructure.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the clinical characteristics, diagnostic approaches, and treatment strategies for intussusception in small infants, so as to reduce the complication rate and improve the outcomes. The goal is to contribute to the global body of knowledge on this condition, highlight the challenges in its management, and offer insights into improving outcomes for affected infants.

Results

Clinical Features of Patients

Patient 1 (P1), born to non-consanguineous parents, initially presented with recurrent oral ulcers and intermittent fevers at 6 years and 7 months old, poorly responding to antimicrobial therapy. Ulcers appeared on the tonsils, tongue, lips, and buccal mucosa, occasionally with Candida albicans infection. At 7 years old, she began experiencing recurrent abdominal pain, moderate anemia, and was underweight (-2SD). Her mother had recurrent oral ulcers with no treatment and further disease progression. Her brother died at 6 years old after recurrent fever, oral ulcers, and bloody stools. She has 2 healthy younger sisters. Immunological tests were normal. At 7 years and 1 month old, colonoscopy revealed ulcers in the terminal ileum and colon, leading to a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. She was treated with glucocorticoids, thalidomide, and infliximab, showing sustained remission. After more than 20 doses of infliximab, unexplained abdominal pain prompted switching to vedolizumab, which eased her pain. She continues maintenance treatment with vedolizumab and oral ulcers did not recur.

Patient 2 (P2), a 7-year-old girl, began showing symptoms at 3 years of age, with recurrent oral, vulvar, and perianal ulcers. Despite symptomatic treatment, she frequently relapsed and also experienced recurrent fevers and erythema nodosum-like rashes. Elevated CRP (C-reactive protein), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and transient hip synovitis were noted. Her uncle had recurrent oral ulcers, and her maternal grandmother was suspected of having Sjögren's syndrome. Immunological tests showed normal Ig (Immunoglobulin) levels and negative autoantibodies, but elevated anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies and lupus anticoagulant. Colonoscopy revealed a terminal ileum ulcer and rectal erosions. She was treated with mesalamine, steroids, and adalimumab, achieving sustained remission.

### Cefazolin [^115ToN8N]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

BEFORE THERAPY WITH CEFAZOLIN FOR INJECTION, USP IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO CEFAZOLIN, CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS, OR OTHER DRUGS. IF THIS PRODUCT IS GIVEN TO PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS-HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG BETA-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFAZOLIN FOR INJECTION, USP OCCURS, DISCONTINUE TREATMENT WITH THE DRUG. SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, IV FLUIDS, IV ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED.

Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefazolin, and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents.

Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of "antibiotic-associated colitis".

After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established, therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone. In moderate to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation, and treatment with an oral antibacterial drug clinically effective against C.difficile colitis.

### Rivastigmine (rivastigmine transdermal system) [^116RMsi8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Medication Errors Resulting in Overdose

Medication errors with Rivastigmine Transdermal System have resulted in serious adverse reactions; some cases have required hospitalization, and rarely, led to death. The majority of medication errors have involved not removing the old patch when putting on a new one and the use of multiple patches at one time. Instruct patients and their caregivers on important administration instructions for Rivastigmine Transdermal System [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.2 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

Rivastigmine transdermal system can cause gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including significant nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia/decreased appetite, and weight loss. Dehydration may result from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea and can be associated with serious outcomes. The incidence and severity of these reactions are dose-related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. For this reason, initiate treatment with Rivastigmine Transdermal System at a dose of 4.6 mg/24 hours and titrate to a dose of 9.5 mg/24 hours and then to a dose of 13.3 mg/24 hours, if appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

If treatment is interrupted for more than 3 days because of intolerance, reinitiate Rivastigmine Transdermal System with the 4.6 mg/24 hours dose to reduce the possibility of severe vomiting and its potentially serious sequelae. A postmarketing report described a case of severe vomiting with esophageal rupture following inappropriate reinitiation of treatment of an oral formulation of rivastigmine without retitration after 8 weeks of treatment interruption.

Inform caregivers to monitor for gastrointestinal adverse reactions and to inform the physician if they occur. It is critical to inform caregivers that if therapy has been interrupted for more than 3 days because of intolerance, the next dose should not be administered without contacting the physician regarding proper retitration.

### Spontaneous multiple small bowel perforations due to ischemic enteritis: a case report [^114kLW78]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 75-year-old Ethiopian farmer male presented with seven days history of abdominal pain, which was initially on periumbilical, crampy type a day prior to his admission the pain became continuous, severe and generalized. Associated symptoms included low-grade fever, abdominal distension, vomiting of ingested food two to three times daily, and bloody diarrhea occurring up to three times per day. The patient had no prior history of trauma or recent endoscopic examinations. He reported no evidence of blood in the stool, nor was it oily, unusually large or abnormal stool consistency. There was no record of diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, allergies, or tobacco use. He was screened for retroviral infection a month ago and found to be seronegative and was not taking any medications for long time. On examination, he was acutely sick looking, vital signs were, pulse rate 104 beats per minute regular on radial artery, the other vital signs blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and temperature were in the normal range. Abdominal examination revealed a full abdomen moving minimally with respiration. Diffuse tenderness was present across the abdomen. Digital rectal examination showed the presence of stool. Otherwise, the rest of the examinations were unremarkable. On investigation, his complete blood count (CBC) was normal white blood cell count with left shift 89% of neutrophilia, anemia-HGB 10 g/dl but the rest CBC components were in normal range. Except hypoalbuminemia 2.48 mg/dl, otherwise liver, renal function test and coagulation profile were normal. Echocardiography showed diastolic dysfunction with ejection fraction 41% but electrocardiogram was normal. Upright chest X-ray showed free air under the diaphragm (Fig. 1).

### Uncoupling investigation and diagnosis from management: at the heart of the art of paediatric clinical practice? [^116jFihx]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

The traditional sequential clinical approach to medical assessment is to take a history, examine the patient, create a differential diagnosis, consider some investigations, confirm the diagnosis and then commence management, see figure 1A. This approach has been taught for generations but does have at least one shortcoming. If a diagnosis is not apparent, then the process can come to a halt at the 'confirm the recognised diagnosis' stage. There is then potential to enter a cycle of investigations (including therapeutic trials) while seeking a diagnosis, during which time the patient has ongoing symptoms, see figure 1B.

Figure 1
A figure comparing (A) the taught 'classical' model of diagnosing and managing a condition and (B) the pathway to managing a condition where no diagnosis is obvious. For the latter scenario, questions are suggested which may help inform decision-making about the propriety of doing further investigations.

There are many examples of uncoupling investigation and diagnosis from management when managing paediatric presentations. One example is resuscitation of the sick child presenting to the emergency department; here, management with oxygen, fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, etc start before any investigation results or the diagnosis is known. Another example of uncoupling is for descriptive diagnoses, for example, constipation, enuresis and migraine, where even though the diagnosis does not explain the underlying pathology, there is no need for investigations and treatment can be commenced on the basis of symptoms.

Here, we use a fictional case history to explore how the clinician might consider uncoupling investigation and diagnosis from management, and separately initiate management while a diagnosis is (or is not) found. We also give tips on explaining to parents (and grandparents) how management might proceed in the absence of a diagnosis.

### Infection mimicking appendicitis case report: new differential diagnosis considerations [^113CPutN]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

An 8-year-old female presented to urgent care with sharp, acute-on-chronic right lower-quadrant abdominal pain, which began the morning of presentation and persisted throughout the afternoon. Her mother described her as having difficulty ambulating due to the pain. They were unable to indicate whether the pain had migrated from the periumbilical region. She had abdominal pain that had been ongoing for the past 3 weeks with a waxing and waning presentation and had taken polyethylene glycol in the past for constipation. She denied nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, fever, diarrhea, hematochezia, or melenic stools. She denied cough, congestion, or rhinorrhea. She did not have any unexplained pruritus. She also had no dysuria, urinary frequency, or urgency.

She had no other chronic conditions for which she took any medication and had no history of abdominal or inguinal hernias or previous surgeries. Her family history was notable for multiple close family members with a history of appendectomy, including her mother.

She and her mother recently arrived in the United States from rural Peru 3 months prior. Her workup upon arrival was negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, syphilis, and active tuberculosis. She had a recent normal lead level. Her mother expressed concern for general parasitosis in their home community in Peru; however, the patient had never had specific symptoms and had not had any testing done.

In clinic, her vital signs were notable for tachycardia and tachypnea. She was afebrile. Her weight was in the 73rd percentile. Her general exam was notable for an uncomfortable appearance, not moving on the exam table. Her abdominal exam demonstrated active bowel sounds. She voluntarily tensed her abdominal muscles throughout the exam. She exhibited acute tenderness to palpation with rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant (McBurney's point) with generalized tenderness in all other quadrants, including the suprapubic region. Pain could be reliably elicited in her right lower quadrant with palpation of her left lower quadrant (Rovsing sign). Supine internal and external flexed hip rotation (obturator sign) and straight leg left against resistance (psoas sign) elicited intense pain in her right lower quadrant. She was unable to participate in a jump test to further assess for peritonitis.

### Teduglutide (Gattex) [^115CbbLM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Acceleration of Neoplastic Growth

Based on the pharmacologic activity and tumor findings in the rat and mouse carcinogenicity studies, GATTEX has the potential to cause hyperplastic changes including neoplasia [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. In patients at increased risk for malignancy, the clinical decision to use GATTEX should be considered only if the benefits outweigh the risks. In patients who develop active gastrointestinal malignancy (GI tract, hepatobiliary, pancreatic) while on GATTEX, discontinue GATTEX treatment. In patients who develop active non-gastrointestinal malignancy while on GATTEX, the clinical decision to continue GATTEX should be made based on benefit-risk considerations.

Gastrointestinal Polyps

Intestinal polyps were identified during the clinical studies. Postmarketing cases of colorectal, gastric, and small intestinal (duodenum, ileum, and jejunum) polyps have been reported postmarketing [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

Adult Patients

Within 6 months prior to starting treatment with GATTEX, perform colonoscopy and upper GI endoscopy with removal of polyps.
A follow-up colonoscopy and upper GI endoscopy (or alternate imaging) is recommended at the end of 1 year of GATTEX. Perform subsequent colonoscopies and upper GI endoscopies (or alternate imaging) every 5 years or more often as needed. If a polyp is found, adherence to current polyp follow-up guidelines is recommended.
If gastrointestinal cancer is diagnosed, discontinue GATTEX therapy.

Pediatric Patients

Within 6 months prior to starting treatment with GATTEX, perform fecal occult blood testing; if there is new or unexplained blood in the stool, perform colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy and an upper GI endoscopy.
Perform subsequent fecal occult blood testing annually in pediatric patients while they are receiving GATTEX. If there is new or unexplained blood in the stool, perform colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy and an upper GI endoscopy.
Colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy is recommended for all pediatric patients after 1 year of treatment and every 5 years thereafter while on continuous treatment with GATTEX [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].
Consider upper GI endoscopy (or alternate other imaging) during treatment with GATTEX.
If gastrointestinal cancer is diagnosed, discontinue GATTEX therapy.

### ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified in children aged 4–18 years [^113LAakG]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Future guideline updates

The methodological approach used in this guideline has been innovated in many core areas. The GDG would suggest that, as a minimum, an update is commissioned within 3 years to allow completion and publication of a new guideline within 5 years. However, the significant achievement to identify, extract, appraise, and synthesize the evidence base offers an opportunity to also innovate in future guideline efforts.

The GDG suggests that the option of a living review of the evidence and therefore a living guideline is considered. Given the relatively small number of new trials per year, such an approach would offer the chance for any significant changes in the overall certainty of evidence and, in turn, potential recommendations to be identified and actioned in a more timely fashion.

As such, an approach would have implications for resources, requiring the sponsoring societies to consider methods to commission this, as well as agreeing on specific operating procedures for such an innovation for both societies, due consideration and joint agreement prospectively would be required. In spite of such barriers, such an approach would be the most appropriate to truly achieve ongoing evidence‐based guidance within clinical practice.
