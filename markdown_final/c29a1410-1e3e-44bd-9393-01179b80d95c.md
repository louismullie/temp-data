## Question

When to use octaplex in a patient on warfarin with a upper GI bleed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to use Octaplex (4-factor PCC) in a patient on warfarin with an upper gastrointestinal bleed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate hemodynamic assessment and severity stratification. Then, I should verify the INR and how it influences reversal decisions. Next, I will review guideline positions on 4-factor PCC versus FFP and vitamin K. After that, I need to consider endoscopy timing and whether reversal should precede endoscopy. Finally, I should confirm dosing, monitoring, and thrombotic risk mitigation, including when to resume anticoagulation after hemostasis [^112Nxfti] [^116UeLWh] [^113REFQ9].

> Let me first confirm the initial priorities: stabilize the patient and stratify severity. I need to check for shock, ongoing hemodynamic instability, active hematemesis or melena with falling hemoglobin, and transfusion requirements, because these features push toward rapid reversal rather than watchful waiting. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines align with this approach; European and US guidance emphasize withholding warfarin and using rapid reversal for severe UGIB, while less severe bleeding allows individualized risk–benefit assessment of reversal versus observation with supportive care [^112Nxfti] [^116UeLWh].

> Next, I should review the INR and its practical implications. Wait, let me verify a common misconception: I initially thought an INR above 2.5 mandates reversal, but that is too rigid. The INR helps gauge the intensity of anticoagulation, yet endoscopic hemostasis is often feasible even with moderately elevated INR, and observational data suggest rebleeding may not correlate tightly with pre-endoscopy INR in the therapeutic-to-mildly supratherapeutic range. So, I should not delay urgent endoscopy solely to normalize a moderately elevated INR, especially if the patient is stable and the INR is around 2.5 or less [^112Nxfti] [^114jYkfp].

> Now, when should I actually give Octaplex (4-factor PCC)? I need to ensure I apply the scenarios with the strongest support: life-threatening bleeding with hemodynamic instability, massive transfusion needs, or inability to achieve hemostasis despite resuscitation; and supratherapeutic INR substantially exceeding the therapeutic range, particularly INR above 3.5–4.0, where rapid correction is more compelling [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify guideline convergence here; European guidance supports 4-factor PCC plus vitamin K for severe bleeding, and North American guidance suggests PCC over FFP when reversal is indicated, acknowledging low-to-very low certainty but favoring PCC's speed and lower volume load [^112Nxfti] [^116UeLWh] [^114Css4S] [^115V5Kht].

> I should double-check the comparative role of FFP and vitamin K. FFP is slower, requires large volumes, and may not reliably normalize INR rapidly, whereas 4-factor PCC achieves INR reduction within 10–30 minutes and is not blood-group specific. Vitamin K alone is too slow for acute bleeding but is essential to sustain reversal after PCC to prevent INR rebound. Let me verify dosing: a fixed 25 IU/kg dose of 4-factor PCC is commonly used and effective in achieving a target INR near 1.5, with repeat INR checking about 30 minutes after infusion and additional vitamin K as needed to maintain correction [^111vgWqt] [^115skzCb] [^115nLRBT].

> But wait, what if the INR is only mildly elevated and the patient is stable? I need to ensure I do not overuse PCC. For hemodynamically stable patients with INR in the therapeutic-to-mildly supratherapeutic range, withholding warfarin and proceeding to timely endoscopy is reasonable, as endoscopic therapy is effective even with INR up to about 2.5. Routine reversal in this scenario is not recommended, and I should avoid delaying endoscopy for coagulopathy correction unless the bleeding is life-threatening or the INR is markedly elevated [^112Nxfti] [^114jYkfp].

> Next, I should review endoscopy timing and its interaction with reversal. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: I almost said to always reverse before endoscopy, but that would be misleading. For unstable patients or those with INR substantially above therapeutic levels, reversal can proceed in parallel with resuscitation and should not delay urgent endoscopy. For stable patients with INR around 2.5 or less, endoscopy can proceed without prior reversal, as hemostasis is achievable and delays risk ongoing bleeding. I should confirm that this balanced approach is consistent with guideline statements on not delaying endoscopy for coagulopathy correction in non–life-threatening presentations [^112Nxfti] [^116UzNdh].

> I will now examine dosing and monitoring details for Octaplex. Let me verify the practical steps: administer 25 IU/kg IV, check INR 30 minutes later, and give 5–10 mg IV vitamin K concurrently or immediately after to sustain reversal; repeat PCC if INR remains above the desired threshold and bleeding persists, recognizing that most centers target INR less than 1.5 for life-threatening bleeding. I need to ensure we also monitor for thrombotic complications, as PCC carries a small but real risk of arterial and venous thrombosis, which is why reversal should be reserved for appropriate indications and the shortest necessary duration [^111vgWqt] [^115skzCb] [^115nLRBT].

> Let me consider special situations and thrombotic risk. Patients with mechanical heart valves or very high thrombotic risk require a plan for rapid resumption of anticoagulation after hemostasis; bridging with heparin may be appropriate in selected high-risk scenarios, but I should confirm that routine bridging is not advised for most endoscopic procedures. I should also remember that warfarin's effect persists 3–5 days, so vitamin K is necessary to prevent INR rebound after PCC wears off, and decisions about restarting warfarin should balance bleeding source control against thrombotic risk, ideally within a week after hemostasis in coordination with cardiology or hematology [^116UeLWh] [^113REFQ9] [^116ZAVKq] [^112QXA13].

> Finally, I should review the evidence quality and acknowledge uncertainty. The certainty for PCC versus FFP or no reversal in GI bleeding is low to very low, largely based on observational data and surrogate outcomes like INR correction, with mixed clinical outcomes across studies. A recent retrospective analysis suggested higher mortality with PCC, but this conflicts with other data and is likely confounded by severity; thus, I need to ensure decisions remain individualized and guideline-concordant rather than reflexively avoiding PCC when it is clearly indicated for severe bleeding or markedly elevated INR [^114Css4S] [^112A2XgL] [^1124p5yu].

> Putting this together, my decision pathway is as follows: if the patient has life-threatening warfarin-associated UGIB or an INR substantially above therapeutic range, I should give Octaplex 25 IU/kg IV with 5–10 mg IV vitamin K and proceed to urgent endoscopy without undue delay; if the patient is stable with INR around 2.5 or less, I should hold warfarin, avoid routine reversal, and perform timely endoscopy with hemostatic therapy as indicated. I need to check INR 30 minutes after PCC, repeat dosing if needed, and reassess thrombotic risk to plan safe resumption of anticoagulation once hemostasis is secured [^112Nxfti] [^116UeLWh] [^111vgWqt].

Use Octaplex (4-factor PCC) for warfarin-associated upper GI bleeding when there is **life-threatening bleeding** [^112Nxfti] or an **INR > 1.5 with ongoing bleeding** that requires rapid reversal [^116UeLWh]. It is preferred over FFP because it achieves faster INR correction [^111bB1X4] with a lower volume load [^113REFQ9]. Always administer **vitamin K 5–10 mg IV** with Octaplex to sustain reversal and prevent INR rebound [^115nLRBT]. For stable patients with INR ≤ 1.5 or minor bleeding, withhold warfarin and give vitamin K alone; reserve Octaplex for severe or refractory cases [^112Nxfti] [^117CKyan].

---

## Indications for Octaplex administration

Octaplex is indicated for **rapid reversal of warfarin-associated coagulopathy** in patients with acute upper GI bleeding who meet any of the following criteria:

- **Life-threatening bleeding**: Hemodynamic instability, shock, or massive transfusion requirements [^116CeTLZ] [^116UeLWh].

- **INR > 1.5 with ongoing bleeding**: Rapid correction is needed to facilitate hemostasis and endoscopic therapy [^notfound].

- **Need for urgent endoscopy**: INR > 1.5 may impede effective endoscopic hemostasis; rapid reversal is recommended [^112Nxfti] [^114j8frs].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from major gastroenterology and hematology societies provide clear recommendations on the use of **Octaplex** in warfarin-associated upper GI bleeding:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) | - Strong recommendation for 4-factor PCC (Octaplex) plus vitamin K for life-threatening bleeding or INR > 1.5 with ongoing bleeding [^117CKyan] [^116UeLWh] |
| American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) | - Suggests PCC over FFP for rapid INR correction in acute GI bleeding [^114Css4S] [^1124p5yu] |
| British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) | - Recommends 4-factor PCC plus vitamin K for unstable GI bleeding [^111hAPxW] |

---

## Comparison with alternative reversal strategies

Octaplex offers several advantages over alternative reversal strategies, such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K alone:

- **Rapid INR correction**: Octaplex achieves significant INR reduction within 10–30 minutes, compared to several hours for FFP and vitamin K alone [^111vgWqt] [^116r3GC6].

- **Lower volume load**: Octaplex requires significantly less volume than FFP, reducing the risk of fluid overload, particularly in elderly or cardiac patients [^111vgWqt] [^113REFQ9].

- **Effective hemostasis**: Clinical studies have demonstrated effective hemostasis in approximately 85% of patients receiving Octaplex [^116r3GC6].

---

## Risks and contraindications

While Octaplex is generally safe, it carries potential risks and contraindications that must be considered:

- **Thrombotic events**: PCC administration carries a risk of thrombotic complications, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^111vgWqt] [^114EC4qH].

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare hypersensitivity reactions may occur [^111vgWqt].

- **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)**: Octaplex contains heparin and is contraindicated in patients with HIT [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where Octaplex is not recommended

Octaplex is **not recommended** in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Minor bleeding**: Stable patients with INR ≤ 1.5 or minor bleeding may be managed with vitamin K alone and warfarin interruption [^117CKyan].

- **Low thrombotic risk**: Patients at low risk of thromboembolic events may not require rapid reversal [^notfound].

- **Mechanical heart valves**: Caution is advised due to the risk of thromboembolic complications; individualized risk assessment is necessary [^116UeLWh].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

After Octaplex administration, **close monitoring is essential**:

- **INR monitoring**: Check INR 30 minutes post-infusion and adjust dosing as needed [^111vgWqt].

- **Clinical monitoring**: Monitor for signs of ongoing bleeding, thrombotic events, and allergic reactions [^111vgWqt].

- **Vitamin K administration**: Administer 5–10 mg IV vitamin K concurrently to sustain reversal and prevent INR rebound [^115nLRBT].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Use Octaplex for warfarin-associated upper GI bleeding in patients with **life-threatening bleeding**, **INR > 1.5 with ongoing bleeding**, or when **urgent endoscopy** is required. It is preferred over FFP due to faster INR correction and lower volume load, but carries a risk of thrombotic events and allergic reactions. For minor bleeding or INR ≤ 1.5, manage with vitamin K and warfarin interruption.

Anticoagulant treatment

Patients on anticoagulants have an inherent underlying thrombotic risk that must be balanced against the bleeding risk in UGIB. In cases of severe UGIB, both European and US guidelines suggest that patients on warfarin have the drug withheld, together with anticoagulant reversal. Vitamin K should be given in addition to the faster acting four factor prothrombin complex. This method is preferred over fresh frozen plasma because of the lower volume required. In less severe UGIB, the risk versus benefit balance of continuing anticoagulation must be assessed. Rebleeding after endotherapy does not appear to be affected by a moderately elevated International Normalised Ratio, based on a case series of 233 patients, where anticoagulation was defined as an International Normalised Ratio greater than or equal to 1.3. Ninety seven (95%) of 102 patients who were anticoagulated had an International Normalised Ratio of between 1.3 and 2.7, with a rebleeding rate (after initial haemostasis) of 23% (23/102) noted in patients who had anticoagulation, and 21% (28/131) in those with International Normalised Ratio less than 1.3. In the absence of large randomised controlled trials, the US guidelines suggest that endotherapy is appropriate in patients with an International Normalised Ratio of less than 2.5.

Data are limited to guide timing of reintroduction of warfarin. A retrospective cohort study of 442 patients suggested that early reintroduction lowers the risk of thromboembolic events (hazard ratio 0.05, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.58) and death (0.31, 0.15 to 0.62). Current European guidance advises reintroduction of warfarin after haemostasis is achieved and within seven days, taking patient factors into consideration. Unlike warfarin, the direct oral anticoagulants have a rapid onset of action and short half-life of 12–24 h. Various reversal agents have been identified, including andexanet alfa and idarucizumab. Although effective, these drugs are expensive and concerns exist regarding a possible procoagulant effect. European and British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines suggest that given their short half-life, apart from life threatening bleeds, simply withholding the direct oral anticoagulant is an appropriate course of action.

Conclusions.

Although there is biological plausibility of FFP administration to reverse VKA in patients with GI bleeding, there exists only very low certainty evidence, given serious concerns of risk of bias, imprecision, and indirectness. The panel also considered the low cost of FFP, relevant patient utilities, and the potential increased risk of transmission of infectious agents with FFP administration. The panel suggested that FFP should not be used routinely but could be considered for patients with a life-threatening GI bleed or a supratherapeutic INR substantially exceeding the therapeutic range. Its use could also be considered in those for whom massive blood transfusion is undesirable because of its effect on coagulopathy or dilution of blood components when PCC is unavailable (see below).

2. For patients on warfarin who are hospitalized or under observation with acute GI bleeding, we could not reach a recommendation for or against prothrombin complex concentrate administration.

### Management of anticoagulation in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding [^111zJTPh]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding represents the most common adverse event associated with the use of oral anticoagulant therapy. Due to increasing prescription of anticoagulants worldwide, gastroenterologists are more and more called to deal with bleeding patients taking these medications. Their management is challenging because several issues have to be taken into account, such as the severity of bleeding, the intensity of anticoagulation, the patient's thrombotic risk and endoscopy findings. The recent introduction into the marketplace of new direct oral anticoagulants, for whom specific reversal agents are still lacking, further contributes to make the decision-making process even more demanding. Available evidence on this topic is limited and practice guidelines by gastroenterology societies only marginally address key issues for clinicians, including when and how to reverse coagulopathy, the optimal timing of endoscopy and when and how to resume anticoagulation thereafter. The present paper reviews the evidence in the literature and provides practical algorithms to support clinicians in the management of patients on anticoagulants who present with acute gastrointestinal bleeding.

Reversal of direct oral thrombin inhibitors

The other group of DOACs directly targets thrombin (factor IIa) and is represented by dabigatran. Preclinical studies show variable effects for the efficacy of (activated) PCCs and factor VIIa to reverse the anticoagulant effect and to ameliorate experimental bleeding in animals exposed to dabigatran Relatively high doses of PCCs, however, seem to have a reversing effect. Similarly, human volunteer studies show a limited effect of conventional doses of PCC to normalize coagulation parameters after ingestion of dabigatran. There are no systematic clinical trials investigating the effect of PCCs to reverse dabigatran-associated hemorrhage in clinical practice. However, some case series are helpful. The effectiveness of dabigatran-related bleeding management using a nonactivated four-factor (4F)-PCC (Octaplex ®; Octapharma, Vienna, Austria) was recently evaluated by Diaz et al. Five patients receiving dabigatran, 76–88 years of age, were administered 4 F-PCC to manage dabigatran-related GI bleeding complications. Treatment with 4 F-PCC was able to adequately control bleeding in four of five patients; the fifth patient died of septic shock and coagulopathy secondary to severe hemorrhage. No thromboembolic events were reported in the next 6 months of follow-up in these patients. Interestingly, the authors also reported that, in the one patient presenting with a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) as a result of dabigatran treatment, administration of 4 F-PCC was able to partially normalize this laboratory parameter. Similar clinical case reports have been reviewed elsewhere.

Regarding medical management for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, more specifically with respect to management of anticoagulant therapy, acute gastrointestinal bleeding, ASGE 2016 guidelines recommend to administer either 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate with vitamin K or FFP for life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding in patients on warfarin anticoagulant therapy.

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^115KmtGw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions.

The effect of PCC compared with FFP on further GI bleeding in patients on warfarin is unknown; however, the more rapid and reliable correction of the INR provides for a biological rationale supporting the efficacy of PCCs. Although there was a very low certainty of evidence, the panel determined that the anticipated desirable effects of PCC compared with FFP were greater than the undesirable effects in patients with acute GI bleeding. The panel concluded that although most patients with acute GI bleeding on warfarin would not require PCC administration, PCC use could be considered in patients with a life-threatening GI bleed, in those with a supratherapeutic INR substantially exceeding the therapeutic range, or those in whom massive blood transfusion is undesirable because of its effect on coagulopathy or dilution of blood components.

4. For patients on warfarin who are hospitalized or under observation with acute GI bleeding, we suggest against the use of vitamin K (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions.

There is insufficient evidence to judge the balance between desirable and undesirable effects with PCC administration; thus, the panel was unable to issue a recommendation. The guideline panel implicitly considered evidence from the comparison of PCC with FFP for warfarin reversal that did reveal a favorable profile for PCC use and benefit in studies using the surrogate endpoint of INR correction. PCC is not necessary for most patients on warfarin with a GI bleed. PCC administration could be considered in patients with a life-threatening GI bleed, those with a supratherapeutic INR substantially exceeding the therapeutic range, or in patients in whom massive blood transfusion is undesirable because of its effect on coagulopathy or dilution of blood components.

3. For patients on warfarin who are hospitalized or under observation with acute GI bleeding, we suggest prothrombin complex concentrate administration compared with FFP administration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

Direct oral anticoagulants

Dabigatran is a thrombin inhibitor, whereas rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban are factor Xa inhibitors. Unlike warfarin, DOACs have relatively short half-lives, which may be prolonged in renal failure. For minor AUGIB, it is usually sufficient to withhold DOAC therapy and allow the effect to dissipate; severe AUGIB is challenging and advice should be sought from a haematologist. In the case of life-threatening haemorrhage, idarucizumab has been developed as an antidote for dabigatran, and andexanet for the antifactor Xa inhibitors.

### The management of antithrombotic agents for patients undergoing GI endoscopy [^115nLRBT]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding — warfarin reversal and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) use — The ACCP recommends that warfarin (Coumadin) be held and rapid reversal of anticoagulation with 4-factor PCC be used for vitamin K antagonist–associated major bleeding rather than fresh frozen plasma; they also suggest the additional use of vitamin K (5–10 mg by slow IV) rather than reversal with coagulation factors alone; PCC contains the vitamin K–dependent factors II, VII, IX, and X, with nonactivated and partially activated formulations, and some nonactivated PCCs are referred to as 3-factor PCCs; in 2012 the FDA approved a 4-factor PCC (Kcentra) for vitamin K antagonist reversal in patients with acute major bleeding or need for an urgent surgery/invasive procedure; for warfarin reversal, the 4-factor PCC is the appropriate reversal agent, and a combination of 3-factor PCC and low dose recombinant factor VIIa can be used when the 4-factor agent is unavailable.

### Endoscopy in patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy: British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline update [^113REFQ9]. Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

We recommend restarting anticoagulation following acute GI haemorrhage in patients with an indication for long-term anticoagulation (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). In patients at low thrombotic risk, we suggest restarting anticoagulation as soon as possible after seven days of anticoagulant interruption (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). In those at high-thrombotic risk, an earlier resumption of anticoagulation with heparin bridging, preferably within 3 days, is recommended (strong recommendation, low quality evidence).

Anticoagulant use is reported in up to 15% and 25% of patients presenting with acute upper and lower GI bleeding, respectively. GI bleeding-related mortality in these patients is high (up to 8–12%), but mainly related to patients' comorbidities. Anticoagulants are independent predictors of neither mortality nor in-hospital rebleeding, provided they are managed appropriately. Temporary discontinuation of anticoagulation is the "standard of care" in patients with clinically significant GI bleeding.

The anticoagulant effect of Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) such as warfarin can persist for 3–5 days. The need for a rapid correction of VKA-related coagulopathy with reversal agents mainly depends on the severity of haemorrhage, but their use requires caution in patients at high thrombotic risk (e.g. mechanical heart valve) since their use has been associated with thromboembolism. Vitamin K takes several hours to correct anticoagulation, so the use of 4-factor Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC) may be necessary to rapidly reverse anticoagulation in patients with active bleeding and haemodynamic instability. PCC is preferred over FFP, for a lower volume load, faster onset of action, and no need to check the patient's blood group. Concomitant low-dose vitamin K is recommended in this situation to prevent an "INR rebound".

Summary of evidence.

The panel made an a priori decision to consider 3-factor PCC and 4-factor PCC equivalent for the intervention (PCC for reversal of warfarin and other VKAs). No eligible studies were identified exclusively in patients with GI bleeding. A backward (snowballing) citation search of previous guidelines was used to identify supporting evidence, including noncomparative cohort data derived from the PCC arms of 2 RCTs that compared PCC vs FFP. We also considered a cohort study of GI patients, which provided clinical outcomes and results on the indirect outcome of INR reversal. This study was regarded as noncomparative data with the inclusion of the PCC group only.

From 7 studies, there were 223 patients on warfarin, all experiencing major bleeding and treated with PCC (,–). Of these, 38.6% had GI bleeding. All patients received 4-factor PCC at various doses, with vitamin K administered to most patients. Further bleeding was observed in 25.5%, with a 7.2% incidence of thrombotic events and 30-day mortality of 7.0% (,–). One study estimated transfusion-related events (fluid overload) of 4.9% within 7 days of PCC use. All studies demonstrated consistently rapid INR reduction of a large magnitude. Given the pharmacodynamics of warfarin treatment, it was implausible that this dramatic INR change could have occurred because of bias, confounding, or chance.

Studies were downrated for serious or very serious risk of bias (no comparator cohorts), indirectness of the outcome ("hemostatic efficacy" or active bleeding visualized at the time of endoscopy), and the concomitant use of vitamin K. The small number of events contributed to serious imprecision. Only a small proportion of the patients had GI bleeds, although the type of bleed would not have influenced the effect of PCC on the INR. Finally, the speed of INR correction is a surrogate outcome, not a clinical outcome.

Warfarin

Indications for warfarin can be characterised into low risk or high risk for thrombosis. Warfarin can be interrupted on presentation with AUGIB, but a plan for resumption should be made. Specific advice on the management of patients in whom reversal of anticoagulation is indicated are outside the scope of this bundle but are available in published guidelines.

(Accept — agreement: 83.3%, level of evidence: low)

Clinical evidence is lacking to support strategies for managing patients with NVUGIB and high cardiothrombotic risk who receive DOAC or warfarin. For such patients with atrial fibrillation and/or valvular heart diseases, management should depend on the balance between thrombotic risk and bleeding risk. In acute NVUGIB, DOAC or warfarin should be withheld to facilitate achievement of haemostasis.

If the patient is taking warfarin, four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma can be given for life-threatening GI bleeding. Warfarin reversal should be used for life-threatening bleeding irrespective of the international normalised ratio (INR). Current evidence does not show any correlation between INR at presentation and outcomes of GI bleeding. A combination of PCC and vitamin K is preferred for urgent reversal of warfarin. PCC has advantages over fresh-frozen plasma such as faster onset of action and minimal risk of fluid overload. Endoscopic therapy should not be delayed in patients with serious UGIB. Warfarin and DOAC treatment should be withheld in patients with ongoing NVUGIB.

### Acquired hemophilia A as a cause of acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage [^1169Q4jv]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 71-year-old man presented to the emergency department with his first episode of hematemesis. He was anemic and coagulopathic on admission, and became hemodynamically unstable requiring surgical intervention to control the bleeding. Prior to surgery, he required 100% plasma exchange with human plasma derived prothrombin complex concentrate (Octaplex) as the exchange fluid. At induction of anesthesia, he received tranexamic acid, prothrombin complex concentrate, and platelets. At the time of knife to skin, he was given coagulation factor VIIa intravenously as a bolus. This treatment was on the recommendation of the hematology team who suspected a diagnosis of acquired hemophilia on the basis of his history and coagulation screen. His bleeding was controlled and a diagnosis of acquired hemophilia A was confirmed in the postoperative period. This was managed with immunosuppressive therapy, and at the 2 year follow-up he remains well and is off all treatment.

### Reintroduction of anti-thrombotic therapy after a gastrointestinal haemorrhage: if and when? [^113KYunV]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal haemorrhage is a common clinical scenario and, in those using antithrombotic agents, the risk is significantly increased. Management of these patients, in terms of initial resuscitation is well established and numerous guidelines exist in this area. However, few studies have addressed the subsequent dilemma of if and when antithrombotic agents should be reintroduced. Consequently, practice is variable and not necessarily evidenced-based. Overall, for patients that are either anticoagulated or using antiplatelet drugs for secondary prophylaxis, there is a clear benefit to restarting these agents. However, there is limited data to guide when this should occur. For individuals at low risk of re-bleeding, current guidelines suggest single agent aspirin can be continued without interruption, assuming haemostatic control has been confirmed endoscopically. For those at higher bleeding risk, aspirin should be withheld, but reintroduced early (within 3 days of index endoscopy). However, randomised evidence is lacking, as are studies including more modern agents or combined anticoagulant/ antiplatelet regimens. As such, guidance statements are limited and management suggestions must be extrapolated from clinical trials, retrospective studies and data relating specifically to warfarin and aspirin. The intention of this review is to summarise what evidence is available and, where this is lacking, suggest pragmatic management options based on a risk-benefit assessment of thromboembolism and recurrent bleeding.

### Gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients on anticoagulant therapy and antiplatelet agents [^114j8frs]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Early endoscopy is encouraged, especially if an upper GI bleeding source is likely, and correction of coagulopathy should not delay it, according to data from two observational studies suggesting that endoscopic therapy is safe and effective even in patients with moderately elevated INR (≤ 2.5). Conversely, there are no data concerning the safety and effectiveness of endoscopic therapy in bleeding patients whose supratherapeutic INR has not been corrected. Therefore, partial or complete reversal of coagulopathy before endoscopy is strongly advised in cases of serious or life-threatening bleeding. In patients at high thrombotic risk with no severe bleeding, delaying endoscopy may be a reasonable option, taking into account that the use of reversal agents carries a small but not negligible risk of thromboembolic complications and thus needs judicious use in these patients.

Acute GI bleeding in the setting of DOACs, in contrast to warfarin, requires a different approach, because of the drugs' distinct pharmacology. Given the relatively short half-lives of DOACs, their clearance and the consequent loss of anticoagulation after drug interruption are rapid and predictable, occurring gradually over 12–24 h in the absence of renal or hepatic failure. Thus, time is the most important antidote for DOACs, and the use of reversal agents is less important than in the case of warfarin. If the patient is hemodynamically stable and/or responds to resuscitation, it may be reasonable to simply observe the patient closely and defer endoscopy for 12–24 h, thus allowing the natural clearance of the drug and the resumption of normal hemostatic functions. Supportive measures with aggressive fluid replacement are important for enhancing renal excretion, which may deteriorate during an acute bleeding event. Conversely, if the patient is persistently or intermittently unstable, emergent endoscopy may be appropriate, and strategies to accelerate anticoagulation reversal should be considered whenever clinically significant DOAC levels are suspected. In this regard, it is important to underline that routine laboratory tests are not sensitive for the quantitative assessment of the anticoagulant intensity of DOACs, although a normal prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time usually exclude an anticoagulation effect due to rivaroxaban and dabigatran, respectively. Apixaban has little or no effect on these tests, which may be normal in the presence of clinically relevant drug concentrations. In the absence of more appropriate laboratory assays to determine the anticoagulant activity (diluted thrombin time for dabigatran or anti-Xa specific calibrators, not yet available in most centers), the presence of a clinically relevant DOAC concentration can be roughly estimated by taking into account the timing of the last dose intake, the drug's half-life, and creatinine clearance (CrCl).

Management of antithrombotic agents

Use is increasing for antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease; one international study reported that 253 (45%) of 568 patients presenting with UGIB were taking these drugs. This poses a major dilemma in the treatment of UGIB because clinicians must balance the risk of bleeding with the risk of thrombotic events and decide if, and for how long, these drugs should be withheld or their effects corrected.

Gastrointestinal bleeding — resumption of oral anticoagulation (OAC) is supported by observational evidence showing reduced thromboembolism and mortality but higher rebleeding, and the document states reinitiation is reasonable once hemostasis is achieved. In a systematic review of 12 observational studies (3,098 patients), resumption after OAC‑associated GI bleeding was linked to lower thromboembolism (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.13–0.68; 9 studies) and lower death (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38–0.70; 8 studies) but higher recurrent bleeding (RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.47–2.48; 11 studies). Additional studies reported discharge‑time restart after a median 5 days with fewer thromboembolic events at 90 days but more bleeding, and warfarin restart > 7 days after a bleed in AF with improved survival and no increase in recurrent GI bleeding; accordingly, "it is reasonable to reinitiate OAC once hemostasis has been achieved".

GASTROINTESTINAL HEMORRHAGE AND RE-INITIATION OF OACS

Gastrointestinal bleeding also has a diverse etiology (eg, hemorrhagic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, arteriovenous malformations, and diverticulosis), but has generally been studied as a single cohort. Again, etiology plays a role in recurrence risk, but it is difficult to parse out. Acute GI bleeds related to both VKAand DOACtherapy are more common in the upper GI tract. Data from an open cohort study (upper GI bleed n = 21,641) gave an age-standardized incidence rate (per 1000 person-years) for upper GI tract bleeding of 5.8 in those prescribed warfarin and 2.7 in those prescribed DOACs. A meta-analysis of data from 11 phase 3 randomized controlled trials reported no significant difference in the overall incidence of major GI bleeding between DOACs and VKAs (relative risk 0.94; p = 0.62). There is evidence, some of it prospective, that restarting OAC therapy after GI hemorrhage is beneficial.

A prospective observational study in the United States identified 197 patients who developed GI bleeding while receiving systemic anticoagulation (145/197 [74%] received warfarin), of whom 76 (39%) discontinued anticoagulation upon hospital discharge (ie, interruption of anticoagulation for ≥ 72 hours after discharge). Restarting OAC therapy at hospital discharge was associated with a lower risk of major thrombotic episodes within 90 days (HR 0.121; 95% CI, 0.006–0.812; p = 0.03), and no significant difference in mortality was observed (at 90 days, HR 0.632; 95% CI, 0.216–1.89; p = 0.40). Furthermore, restarting OAC was not significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrent GI bleeding at 90 days (HR 2.17; 95% CI, 0.861–6.67; p = 0.10).

### Anticoagulant-associated gastrointestinal bleeding: framework for decisions about whether, when and how to resume anticoagulants [^117EJMk9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is the most frequent single site of oral anticoagulant (OAC)-associated major bleeding. Patients with major GI bleeding experience morbidity and a substantial risk of short-term all-cause mortality up to 10%. While OACs are frequently discontinued during acute bleeding, there is substantial uncertainty about whether, when, and how OACs should be resumed after bleeding has resolved. Limited evidence suggests a lower risk of thromboembolism and death, and a higher risk of recurrent bleeding with OAC resumption. However, the absolute risks and optimal timing of anticoagulation remain uncertain based on these observational studies at risk of bias, particularly due to baseline confounding. In addition to an individualized approach to determining the benefits and harms of treatment decisions informed by the best available evidence about thrombosis and recurrent bleeding, discussions should meaningfully incorporate patient values and preferences. The objective of this review is to provide a framework for decision-making by summarizing the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of OAC-associated GI bleeding, providing an approach for assessment and risk stratification for OAC resumption and its timing, and outlining strategies for the prevention of recurrent GI bleeding.

Cessation of anticoagulant — The absolute risk of an embolic event when anticoagulation is interrupted for 4 to 7 days is approximately 1%, and after temporary discontinuation of warfarin (Coumadin), reinitiation should occur within 4 to 7 days of initial discontinuation and can occur on the same day in many patients.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence.

In patients receiving a VKA such as warfarin, low-dose oral vitamin K 1–2 mg can be used when there is an elevated INR (typically an INR ≥ 10) to restore therapeutic-level anticoagulation (i.e. INR 2.0–3.0). In the setting of clinically significant GI bleeding requiring therapeutic intervention, vitamin K 2–5 mg (oral or intravenous) reverses anticoagulant effect (to INR ≤ 1.3) in 24–48 hours. Vitamin K use does not achieve rapid hemostasis in patients with acute bleeding. Consequently, the clinical value of vitamin K is limited in most patients with acute GI bleeding, especially if the bleed is self-limiting, treatable through direct endoscopic hemostatic intervention, or if the INR is mildly elevated (e.g. INR 1.5–2.5). Vitamin K can be administered in patients with a supratherapeutic INR if the intent is to reverse the effect of a VKA over an extended period (i.e. 2–4 weeks) or if the objective is to stop the VKA altogether. This decision should be undertaken in consultation with hematologists, cardiologists, or other clinicians involved in patients' anticoagulant management.

No prospective studies have assessed whether giving vitamin K in VKA-treated patients with acute bleeding affects clinically meaningful outcomes. In a meta-analysis involving nonbleeding patients on a VKA with a supratherapeutic INR, administration of vitamin K was associated with small, nonsignificant increases in mortality (RR = 1.24; 95% CI: 0.62–2.47) and thrombotic events (RR = 1.29; 95% CI: 0.35–4.78). One retrospective case-control study involving patients with VKA-associated bleeding (from both GI and non-GI sites) found vitamin K administration was associated with a significant decrease in mortality (adjusted OR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.24–0.92). However, this study had significant methodological limitations, including cointerventions that confounded an association between vitamin K administration and clinical outcomes.

Conclusions.

Overall, there is no clinical evidence that vitamin K administration in VKA-treated patients with acute GI bleeding prevents further bleeding or improves mortality or other clinically meaningful outcomes. Moreover, evidence is very weak that giving or not giving vitamin K will affect the risk of thromboembolism, such as stroke or venous thrombosis, presumed to be because of normalization of the INR.

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^114CMwnw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence.

For this recommendation, no eligible studies specifically addressing patients with GI bleeding were identified by literature searches. The observational studies identified were cohort studies without a comparator arm, or the study did not report separate results for clinical outcomes in patients with GI bleeding. It is thus not possible to infer with any certainty whether administering FFP can benefit, harm, or make no difference in these patients compared with no reversal.

Pertinent studies included a small cohort of 41 warfarin-treated patients requiring rapid reversal, with 12 receiving FFP, 29 receiving clotting factor concentrates, and all receiving vitamin K 1–5 mg intravenously. No clinical outcomes were measured, but in the 12 patients given FFP, the international normalized ratio (INR) did not normalize (range 1.6–3.8, mean 2.3), indicating an ongoing anticoagulated state in all patients. In a case-control study of 267 patients with major bleeding prescribed VKA for venous thromboembolism, 78 patients had GI bleeding, but no results were reported for the GI bleeding outcomes. In a multivariable analysis that failed to adjust sufficiently for confounding, FFP use was associated with a higher risk of thrombotic events (OR: 4.22; 95% CI: 1.25–14.3).

Three additional RCTs which lacked the comparator of interest (i.e. placebo) provide cohort-type data that further inform this recommendation. Sarode et al. randomized 202 patients on a VKA with an INR ≥ 2.0 and major bleeding to FFP (n = 104) vs 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), while both arms received vitamin K (5–10 mg intravenously). In the FFP arm, 58 patients had GI bleeding with excellent or good hemostatic efficacy achieved in 75.9%. Additional outcome measures were reported only for all-cause bleeding and included thrombotic events in 7 of 109, mortality in 6 of 103, rapid INR reduction in 10 of 109, and fluid overload after 10–45 days in 14 of 109. Smaller RCTs by Steiner et al. (N = 50, 23 in the FFP arm) and Boulis et al. (N = 13, 8 in the FFP arm) assessed patients with intracranial hemorrhage, reporting thromboembolic events in 2 of 23 and 1 of 8 patients, respectively, and an INR ≤ 2 within 3 hours of treatment in 2 of 23 patients; significant complications from fluid overload were noted in 5 of 8 patients.

### Endoscopy in patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy: British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline update [^116UeLWh]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

The anticoagulant effect of VKAs such as warfarin can persist for 3–5 days. The need for a rapid correction of VKA-related coagulopathy with reversal agents mainly depends on the severity of haemorrhage, but their use requires caution in patients at high thrombotic risk (eg, mechanical heart valve) since their use has been associated with thromboembolism. Vitamin K takes several hours to correct anticoagulation, so the use of 4-factor PCC may be necessary to rapidly reverse anticoagulation in patients with active bleeding and haemodynamic instability. PCC is preferred over FFP, for a lower volume load, faster onset of action, and no need to check the patient's blood group. Concomitant low-dose vitamin K is recommended in this situation to prevent an 'INR rebound'.

Unlike VKAs, DOACs are characterised by a relatively short half-lives, so that their anticoagulant activity usually rapidly wanes-off over 12–24 hours. Consequently, most cases of major GI haemorrhage can be managed by withholding the drug and waiting for the anticoagulant effects to resolve. In haemodynamically unstable patients, acute reversal of anticoagulation may be required. Vitamin K, FFP, and protamine administration are ineffective. Idarucizumab, a humanised antibody fragment that neutralises the effect of dabigatran, is now currently available as first-line reversal agent in dabigatran patients presenting with life-threatening/uncontrolled bleeding. Idarucizumab reverses dabigatran-related coagulopathy rapidly (within a few minutes) and persistently (for about 24 hours) in more than 98% of the patients, with a low thrombotic complication rate (6% at 90 days). Andexanet alfa, an inactive form of FXa that neutralises circulating FXa inhibitors, has recently been approved as an antidote to apixaban and rivaroxaban in patients with life threatening haemorrhage, but its clinical use is hindered by its limited availability, the prohibitive cost and safety concern about possible procoagulant effect. Four-factor PCC at fixed dose (2000 IU) may represent an alternative to andexanet alpha, with lower thromboembolic risk, but uncertain efficacy.

### Burden of major gastrointestinal bleeding among oral anticoagulant-treated non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients [^11114g7J]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The common sites of GI bleeding differ according to specific OACs. – For example, while upper GI bleeding predominates in warfarin, 53% lower GI bleeding was observed in dabigatran users with a major GI bleed; for apixaban and rivaroxaban, upper GI bleeding is more common than lower GI bleeding (apixaban: 63% versus 37%; rivaroxaban: 76% versus 24%); and edoxaban showed comparable risks of upper and lower GI bleeding.,

Due to the increased risk of bleeding, many patients stop OAC treatment after a bleed. For patients who have a major bleeding event, the ESC guidelines recommend re-initiation of an OAC as soon as the cardiovascular thrombotic risks associated with discontinuation are thought to outweigh the risk of subsequent bleeding. If an OAC was not reinitiated after a major GI bleed, patients incurred similar or lower risks of recurrent GI bleeding events but higher risk of thromboembolic events. Although the benefits of restarting an OAC have been found to outweigh the risk of bleeding, 25–50% of patients still do not resume an OAC after a GI bleed.

There are limited data regarding OAC use and GI bleeding in the real-world clinical setting. In this study, we used pooled data of five US claims databases to examine the risk of stroke/SE and subsequent major bleeding between OAC-treated NVAF patients with and without a major GI bleeding event. Second, we analyzed event characteristics and post-event OAC treatment patterns among patients with major GI bleeding.

Direct thrombin inhibitor reversal.

5. For patients on dabigatran who are hospitalized or under observation with acute GI bleeding, we suggest against the administration of idarucizumab (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

Summary of evidence.

The available evidence addressing this recommendation included 1 cohort study that compared idarucizumab with no treatment and 2 additional cohort studies without a comparator. Singh et al. performed a retrospective cohort study in the United States that included patients hospitalized for dabigatran-associated major nontraumatic GI bleeding or intracranial bleeding. Among those with GI bleeding (159 who received idarucizumab vs 1124 who did not), nonsignificant differences in mortality (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 0.51–3.45) and venous thromboembolism (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.08–1.58) were observed. In the Reversal Effects of Idarucizumab on Active Dabigatran study, Pollack et al. examined patients on dabigatran with multiple causes of acute bleeding, including GI (45.5%) and other patients on dabigatran about to undergo an urgent surgery or procedure. The reversal of dabigatran anticoagulant effect (before and up to 24 hours after the administration of idarucizumab) was assessed by dabigatran-specific coagulation function tests (dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time), and the reduction in the concentration of unbound dabigatran, both indirect measures of the outcome of interest. In a subgroup analysis of 137 patients with GI bleeding, Van der Wall et al. reported 30-day mortality and thrombotic event rates of 11.1% and 3.6%, respectively, among patients receiving idarucizumab.

Conclusions.

Given the limited evidence of benefit and the high cost of idarucizumab, the panel felt it could not recommend routine use of idarucizumab for patients with GI bleeding who have taken dabigatran. However, selective use may be appropriate in patients with a life-threatening GI bleed who have taken dabigatran within the past 24 hours.

GUIDELINE STATEMENTS

Management of antithrombotic agents in the setting of acute GI bleeding

The first 10 guideline statements address the management of antithrombotic agents in the setting of acute GI bleeding. Acute GI bleeding is defined as patients hospitalized or under observation with acute overt GI bleeding (upper and/or lower) manifesting as melena, hematochezia, or hematemesis. Life-threatening hemorrhage is defined as major clinically overt or apparent bleeding, resulting in hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring pressors or surgery; or associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of > 5 g/dL, or requiring transfusion of ≥ 5 units of packed red blood cells, or causing death.

VKA reversal.

2. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage and re-initiation of OACs

Gastrointestinal bleeding also has a diverse etiology (eg, hemorrhagic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, arteriovenous malformations, and diverticulosis), but has generally been studied as a single cohort. Again, etiology plays a role in recurrence risk, but it is difficult to parse out. Acute GI bleeds related to both VKA 34 and DOAC therapy are more common in the upper GI tract. Data from an open cohort study (upper GI bleed n = 21,641) gave an age-standardized incidence rate (per 1000 person-years) for upper GI tract bleeding of 5.8 in those prescribed warfarin and 2.7 in those prescribed DOACs. A meta-analysis of data from 11 phase 3 randomized controlled trials reported no significant difference in the overall incidence of major GI bleeding between DOACs and VKAs (relative risk 0.94; p = 0.62). There is evidence, some of it prospective, that restarting OAC therapy after GI hemorrhage is beneficial.

A prospective observational study in the United States identified 197 patients who developed GI bleeding while receiving systemic anticoagulation (145/197 [74%] received warfarin), of whom 76 (39%) discontinued anticoagulation upon hospital discharge (ie, interruption of anticoagulation for ≥ 72 hours after discharge). Restarting OAC therapy at hospital discharge was associated with a lower risk of major thrombotic episodes within 90 days (HR 0.121; 95% CI, 0.006–0.812; p = 0.03), and no significant difference in mortality was observed (at 90 days, HR 0.632; 95% CI, 0.216–1.89; p = 0.40). Furthermore, restarting OAC was not significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrent GI bleeding at 90 days (HR 2.17; 95% CI, 0.861–6.67; p = 0.10).

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^113eF7Xy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions.

The only published study presents a serious risk of bias because it lacks a control group. Indirectness of the outcomes is also a significant concern because data on patients with GI bleeding are limited, with missing information concerning specific management. Additional methodological limitations include very serious imprecision as event rates are low and the use of surrogate laboratory rather than clinical outcomes. Notably, the cost of using the drug is high (up to $49,500 at high-dose regimen, with the low-dose regimen costing half as much). Accordingly, the panel could not recommend the routine use of andexanet alfa in patients with GI bleeding. This intervention could be considered in the setting of life-threatening GI bleeding in hospitalized patients who have taken apixaban or rivaroxaban within the past 24 hours.

Reversal of DOACs with PCC.

7. For patients on direct oral anticoagulants who are hospitalized or under observation with acute GI bleeding, we suggest against prothrombin complex concentrate administration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

Summary of evidence.

The literature search identified only 2 cohort studies with comparator arms (no PCC), both of which have limitations. Schulman et al. examined the reversal of dabigatran-associated major bleeding with activated prothrombin concentrate in a small prospective cohort study (N = 14). Among the 5 patients with GI bleeding compared with matched patients (N = 28) from 5 Phase III trials, the "effectiveness" rating was assessed at 24 hours by the treating physicians for GI bleeding. The effectiveness was considered good in 4 patients and moderate in 1, which was not statistically different from the comparator group. Smythe et al. reported that among 28 patients with GI bleeding on dabigatran, 2 received 4-factor PCC, and both (100%) died within 30 days. However, the mortality results were not adjusted for confounding, and the comparator group's death rate is unknown. Several systematic reviews have reported mainly on low-quality, single-arm cohort studies.

Conclusions.

Given the uncertainty of the available evidence, the panel felt they could not recommend routine use of PCC for patients with GI bleeding who have taken DOACs. However, selective use may be clinically justifiable in some patients who have taken DOACs within the past 24 hours with a life-threatening GI bleed.

### Gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients on anticoagulant therapy and antiplatelet agents [^117CKyan]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Anticoagulants and urgent endoscopy

Both the ESGE and the ASGE guidelines strongly recommend temporary interruption of anticoagulant therapy in all patients who present with clinically significant acute GI bleeding. In the setting of VKA-based therapy, the decision to reverse anticoagulation should be based on the clinical assessment of the severity of bleeding at presentation. Evidence to support different strategies for the correction of coagulopathy is lacking, and this may potentially explain the large variation in practice among endoscopists. The updated ESGE guidelines on upper GI bleeding have endorsed the 2008 recommendation by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) to administer prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or fresh frozen plasma, if PCC is unavailable, in addition to intravenous vitamin K in patients with serious, life-threatening bleeding (i.e. patients presenting with persistent or intermittent hemodynamic instability), in the case of either therapeutic or supratherapeutic elevations of the international normalized ratio (INR). For patients who are not actively bleeding and are hemodynamically stable, intravenous vitamin K administration may be an option.

Introduction

Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC) is a key treatment in the management of bleeding related to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA). This study aimed to evaluate prospectively PCC use in patients with VKA-related bleeding in view of the French guidelines published in 2008.

Methods

All consecutive patients with VKA-related bleeding treated with a 4-factor PCC (Octaplex®) were selected in 33 French hospitals. Collected data included demographics, site and severity of bleeding, modalities of PCC administration, International Normalized Ratio (INR) values before and after PCC administration, outcomes and survival rate 15 days after infusion.

Results

Of 825 patients who received PCC between August 2008 and December 2010, 646 had severe bleeding. The main haemorrhage sites were intracranial (43.7%) and abdominal (24.3%). Mean INR before PCC was 4.4 ± 1.9; INR was unavailable in 12.5% of patients. The proportions of patients who received a PCC dose according to guidelines were 15.8% in patients with initial INR 2–2.5, 41.5% in patients with INR 2.5–3, 40.8% in patients with INR 3–3.5, 26.9% in patients with INR > 3.5, and 63.5% of patients with unknown INR. Vitamin K was administered in 84.7% of patients. The infused dose of PCC did not vary with initial INR; the mean dose was 25.3 ± 9.8 IU/Kg. Rates of controlled bleeding and target INR achievement were similar, regardless of whether or not patients were receiving PCC doses as per the guidelines. No differences in INR after PCC treatment were observed, regardless of whether or not vitamin K was administered. INR was first monitored after a mean time frame of 4.5 ± 5.6 hours post PCC. The overall survival rate at 15 days after PCC infusion was 75.4% (65.1% in patients with intracranial haemorrhage). A better prognosis was observed in patients reaching the target INR.

Conclusions

Severe bleeding related to VKA needs to be better managed, particularly regarding the PCC infused dose, INR monitoring and administration of vitamin K. A dose of 25 IU/kg PCC appears to be efficacious in achieving a target INR of 1.5. Further studies are required to assess whether adjusting PCC dose and/or better management of INR would improve outcomes.

Regarding medical management for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, more specifically with respect to management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy, warfarin, ACG 2023 guidelines recommend to prefer a 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate over FFP due to the rapidity of INR reduction to prevent stroke in NVAF in patients on VKAs requiring reversal.

Severe LGIB on anticoagulants — narrative guidance states that although most patients can likely be managed by withholding the anticoagulant drug, patients who are having severe hematochezia with signs of hemodynamic compromise may benefit from reversal agents before endoscopic intervention, and that data on the use of reversal agents (such as PCC and targeted reversal agents) compared with withholding the drug alone are needed to determine the appropriate role for these drugs.

Summary of evidence.

We identified 2 randomized trials and 1 cohort study comparing PCC with FFP in patients on warfarin with bleeding. The 2 studies that included patients with GI bleeding reported inconsistent results. The RCT by Sarode et al. did not find a difference in further bleeding among patients with acute GI bleeding with PCC (25.4%) compared with FFP (24.1%) (relative risk [RR] 1.05, 95% CI: 0.55–2.00). However, the study's definition of successful hemostasis allowed for up to 2 additional units of blood products after receiving FFP or PCC. It did not report whether this cointervention differed between the 2 groups. Furthermore, a higher proportion of patients in the FFP arm received vitamin K, including intravenously.

A prospective cohort study of patients with acute upper GI bleeding who received intravenous vitamin K and either FFP or PCC found that the absolute risk of further bleeding was numerically lower in the PCC arm with zero of 20 patients diagnosed with bleeding compared with 7 of 20 patients (35%) in the FFP arm but without statistical significance (RR 0.07, 95% CI: 0–1.09). An additional 3 patients in the FFP arm developed recurrent bleeding, but it was unclear whether these 3 patients were independent of the 7 patients already attributed. Regardless, their inclusion would not change the direction of the effect nor certainty of evidence.

The risk of thromboembolic events in patients on warfarin randomized to receive either FFP or PCC was evaluated in 2 studies. In 1 study, the bleeding site was intracranial, whereas in the second study, the bleeding site varied and included GI bleeding in some patients. Combining results from both studies, although not significant, the absolute risk of thromboembolic events was numerically higher in the PCC arm (RR = 1.60, 95% CI: 0.70–3.62), whereas the 30-day mortality (RR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.17–2.49) and transfusion-related adverse events (1 transfusion-related anaphylaxis in the FFP group) were numerically lower in the PCC arm. Both studies demonstrated a more rapid INR reduction in patients receiving PCC than FFP (RR = 6.99, 95% CI: 3.61–13.53). The heterogeneous study populations, variability in outcome definition and timing of assessment, and the wide confidence intervals for clinical outcomes led to a very low certainty of evidence.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^114Jfvj4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

DOAC reversal — Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) in patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is addressed as follows: we suggest reversal for the small subset of patients who present with a life-threatening LGIB that does not respond to initial resuscitation and cessation of the anticoagulant alone, and for patients requiring reversal, targeted reversal agents (idarucizumab for dabigatran and andexanet alfa for apixaban and rivaroxaban) should be used when available if the DOAC has been taken within the past 24 hours (Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Evidence cited includes idarucizumab data in RE-VERSE AD where 68.7% of evaluable patients experienced a bleeding cessation within 24 hours, after a median duration of 2.4 hours, with 43 of the 137 patients having a LGIB, and andexanet alfa use in GIB showed in-hospital mortality of 10% compared with 4% with FFP or PCC reversal. At present, there is no role for PCC in reversal of factor Xa inhibitors; in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 case series of 340 patients receiving PCC for DOAC reversal, the pooled proportion of effective hemostasis achieved was 69%.

### Efficacy and safety of a prothrombin complex concentrate (octaplex) for rapid reversal of oral anticoagulation [^116r3GC6]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Bleeding is the most serious adverse event of oral anticoagulants and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in such patients. Rapid reversal of anticoagulation in bleeding patients or prior to urgent surgery is mandatory. The therapeutic options in these situations include administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and recently of prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs). However, viral safety and thrombogenicity of PCCs remain issues of concern. In the present study, we administered Octaplex, a new solvent/detergent (S/D) treated and nanofiltered PCC, to excessively anticoagulated bleeding patients or to anticoagulated patients facing urgent surgery. Ten excessively anticoagulated patients with major bleeding and 10 anticoagulated patients awaiting surgery (median age 72.5 (43–83) years, 9 females) received a median dose of 26.1 IU/kg body weight (BW) of Octaplex for reversal of anticoagulation. Response to Octaplex was rapid with decline of INR within 10 min after Octaplex administration (from 6.1 ± 2. to 1.5 ± 0.3). Clinical response was graded as good in most patients (85%) and as moderate in the rest. Octaplex administration was uneventful in all patients. Following Octaplex administration, a small increase in F1+2 levels was observed in bleeding patients, whereas D-dimer level did not change significantly. We conclude that Octaplex is effective and safe in situations where rapid reversal of anticoagulation is needed.

Because of the pharmacokinetic profile of DOACs, the rationale for heparin bridging in this setting is much weaker than when VKAs are interrupted. Data from prospective registries clearly indicated that patients who received bridging anticoagulation had similar rates of thrombotic events compared with those who did not receive bridging, but experienced an up to 5-fold greater risk of major bleeding. These findings do not support the use of LMWH bridging during interruption of DOAC therapy for elective procedures.

Acute LGIB — anticoagulant reversal and antifibrinolytics: Although most patients with LGIB on vitamin K antagonists are unlikely to require reversal, we suggest reversal of patients who present with a life-threatening LGIB and have an INR substantially exceeding the therapeutic range; for patients on vitamin K antagonists to prevent thromboembolism, 4-factor PCC is preferred to FFP because of the rapidity of INR reduction (Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients on direct oral anticoagulants, we suggest reversal in the setting of a life-threatening LGIB that does not respond to initial resuscitation and cessation of the anticoagulant alone, and targeted reversal agents (idarucizumab for dabigatran and andexanet alfa for apixaban and rivaroxaban) should be used when available if the direct oral anticoagulant has been taken within the past 24 hr (Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). We recommend against administration of antifibrinolytic agents such as tranexamic acid in LGIB (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Prothrombin complex concentrate

Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) are plasma‐derived concentrates containing either three or four of the vitamin K‐dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, X). Small amounts of protein C and S and antithrombin may also be present. It is produced by fractionation of pooled plasma from non‐UK donors, virally inactivated and available in lyophilised powder form which is reconstituted in sterile water immediately prior to use. Commonly available PCCs are Beriplex (CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany) and Octaplex (Octapharma Ltd. Manchester, UK). Prothrombin complex concentrates are not blood group specific. They are often stored in blood banks and not pharmacy.

The main indication for the use of PCCs is the rapid reversal of vitamin K antagonists in the context of major or life‐threatening bleeding (including intracranial bleeding). It usually reverses warfarin anticoagulation within 10–30 min. There is limited evidence to support the use of PCCs in the management of major haemorrhage not related to vitamin K antagonists. A large trial evaluating its clinical effectiveness in patients who are actively bleeding following cardiac surgery is currently ongoing (NIHR152151).

The recommended starting dose is 25 IU·kg⁻¹, but this may vary according to local guidelines. An INR should be checked 30 min after dosing to ascertain the degree of correction. The indication for any further dosing should be guided by clinical and laboratory assessment of haemostatic efficacy. Due to the short half‐life of factor VII (6 h), it is essential to also give 5–10 mg of intravenous vitamin K. Important risks associated with PCC include thrombosis (arterial and venous), as demonstrated in a recent RCT, and hypersensitivity/allergic reactions. Where possible, patients should be consented for these.

Off‐label indications, which should be discussed on a case‐by‐case basis with a haematologist include:
Reversal of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) prior to urgent/emergency surgery (i.e. rivaroxaban, apixaban);
Reversal of anticoagulation with antithrombin agents (e.g. argatroban, dabigatran);
Treatment of non‐life‐threatening bleeding in patients who cannot tolerate large volumes of FFP.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^112QezhU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Target-specific oral anticoagulants — evidence for acute gastrointestinal bleeding indicates increased bleeding risk and limited guidance on management, with a meta-analysis reporting an odds ratio for overall bleeding of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.07–1.97) and no direct evidence to guide management in acute GI bleeding. A reversal agent for dabigatran (idarucizumab) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, reversal agents for other non-vitamin K antagonists are in development, and these antidotes may increase the risk of thrombosis; therefore, a multidisciplinary approach involving hematology, cardiology/neurology, and gastroenterology is necessary when managing patients on anticoagulant medications, particularly if newer target-specific oral agents are involved to optimally balance ongoing bleeding and thromboembolic risks.

Anticoagulant therapy

The burden

Anticoagulants are commonly used to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves, deep venous thrombosis, and hypercoagulable conditions. These drugs are increasingly prescribed worldwide, mostly because of the rising prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation. About 2% of the population in developed countries receives long-term anticoagulation, reaching 8–10% in elderly patients. After decades during which vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were the only oral anticoagulation option, the spectrum of oral anticoagulants has been recently broadened by the introduction of new oral anticoagulants, also named direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), as they directly inhibit either thrombin (dabigatran, Pradaxa®, Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany) or the activated coagulation factor X (rivaroxaban, Xarelto®, Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany; apixaban, Eliquis®, Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY, USA; edoxaban, Lixiana®, Daiichi-Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan). DOACs offer several benefits over VKAs. They are prescribed at fixed doses and their anticoagulant effect is more predictable than that of warfarin, obviating the need for routine coagulation monitoring. Moreover, the rapid onset of anticoagulation (within 1–4 h) and the short half-life of DOACs (9–17 h) make initiation and interruption of therapy considerably easier than with VKAs. The individual DOACs have different pharmacologic properties, and the knowledge of these differences is important in clinical practice (Table 1).

Table 1
Pharmacodynamic characteristics of novel oral anticoagulants

Management of anticoagulants is a common clinical problem for gastroenterologists. Annually, 10% of patients taking anticoagulants require temporary discontinuation of therapy for surgical or other invasive elective procedures, in many cases represented by gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Furthermore, major GI bleeding represents a serious complication of anticoagulant therapy, with an occurrence ranging approximately from 1–4% per year and a case fatality rate up to 10%. Among patients presenting with acute upper and lower GI bleeding, up to 15% and 32%, respectively take anticoagulants.

The periendoscopic management of patients receiving anticoagulants, for either urgent or elective procedures, is challenging, as the thrombotic and bleeding risks may vary depending on individual circumstances. Practice guidelines from the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), recently updated, may assist the physician in the decision-making process.

### The efficacy and safety of andexanet alfa in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding while taking factor Xa inhibitors: an ANNEXA-4 subanalysis [^113JiyMm]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Most (80.7%) patients with GI bleeding in the safety population (n = 109) received packed red blood cell transfusion; coagulation factor concentrates (n = 1) or plasma (n = 2) use was infrequent.

Eight (7.3%) patients experienced a thromboembolic event during 30-day follow-up. Thrombotic events occurred in 7.7% of patients taking antiplatelets, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors at baseline and 7.3% not taking these medications. No thrombotic events were recorded after restarting oral anticoagulation. Thirteen (11.9%) patients died within 30 days of enrollment (cause: cardiovascular, n = 6; noncardiovascular, n = 6; unknown, n = 1).

FXa inhibitors were discontinued at enrollment in all patients. Anticoagulation (of any type/dose) was reinitiated in 64 (58.7%) patients within 30 days of AA treatment. Fifty (45.9%) patients received oral anticoagulation within 30 days (days: 7, n = 23; 7–14, n = 19; 15–30, n = 8).

This ANNEXA-4 subanalysis of patients presenting with acute major GI bleeding while taking FXa inhibitors is consistent with the overall ANNEXA-4 study. A key finding of this analysis is the 12% mortality rate within 30 days of anticoagulant-related major GI bleeding, suggesting that these events are not trivial complications of therapy. Strengths of this study include adjudication of major bleeding events and hemostatic efficacy by an independent committee using prespecified criteria. The modest sample size and lack of a control group, information about specific causes of death, and endoscopic evaluation in all patients limit interpretation of the results and preclude potential analysis of clinically important subgroups. Overall, these analyses demonstrate rapid reversal of FXa inhibitor anticoagulant effect and clinical hemostasis after treatment with AA among patients with major GI bleeding.

### Comparison of anticoagulation reversal strategies for warfarin associated acute gastrointestinal bleeding [^112A2XgL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a common complication associated with warfarin use. However, the optimal approach for anticoagulation reversal-whether with prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), vitamin K (intravenous or oral), or no reversal-remains unclear as current literature and society guidelines do not provide definitive recommendations.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of emergency department patients with warfarin-associated GIB who presented to an academic health system was performed, comparing reversal with PCC, FFP, vitamin K only, or no reversal agent. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included rebleeding events and 30-day thrombotic events. Standardized guidelines for reporting were followed (STROBE).

Results

Of 815 patients, within 12 h of presentation, 10.7% received reversal with PCC (with or without vitamin K), 12.9% with FFP (with or without vitamin K), and 34.9% with vitamin K alone; 41.5% of patients received no reversal agent. Compared to all other groups, patients receiving PCC had significantly higher 30-day mortality (18.4% [PCC] vs 5.7% [FFP] vs 4.6% [vitamin K] vs 5.6% [no reversal], p < 0.001), which remained significant after adjusting for hemodynamic instability and ICU admission. There were no significant differences in rates of thrombotic event within 30 days (3.4% vs 3.8% vs 1.4% vs 1.2%, p = 0.20).

Conclusions

Patients who received PCC had a threefold increase in mortality compared to FFP, vitamin K alone, or no reversal, even after adjusting for severity of the bleeding. Further research is necessary to understand factors leading to this observed mortality difference among patients with warfarin related GIB.

### What gastroenterologists should know about direct oral anticoagulants [^115oDbdS]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants are being increasingly used in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism, due to their improved efficacy/ safety ratio, a predictable anticoagulant effect without need for routine coagulation monitoring, and fewer food and drug interactions compared with vitamin K antagonists. Gastrointestinal bleeding remains a serious complication, whose management is challenging for gastroenterologists due to the lack of a standardized clinical approach. Clinical experience on periendoscopic management of these drugs is still limited and there is a paucity of clinical data supporting guidelines recommendations', and this ultimately turns out in different, unsubstantiated and potentially harmful practices of patient management. Present study will provide a thorough revision on the risk of GI bleeding for DOAC therapy and the identification of patient risk factors to individualize treatment. Moreover, the approach to management of DOACs in case of bleeding complications is discussed, and an algorithm of different strategies in presence or not of plasma level measurement is proposed. Finally the periendoscopic management for elective procedures will be reviewed, at the light of the guideline recommendations and new evidences from observational studies.

### The management of antithrombotic agents for patients undergoing GI endoscopy [^112ZvkJ5]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal endoscopy — post-procedure anticoagulation and antiplatelet resumption — unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) should be restarted as soon as bleeding stability allows and continued until the international normalized ratio (INR) is therapeutic; UFH may be restarted 2 to 6 hours after a therapeutic procedure; the 2012 ACCP guidelines recommend delaying reinitiation of LMWH 48 to 72 hours after surgery in patients believed to be at high risk for bleeding adverse events; there are no data to inform optimal timing for resuming non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), and if a NOAC cannot be restarted within 24 hours after a high-risk procedure because of hemostasis concerns, thromboprophylaxis (ie, a UFH bridge) should be considered for patients at high risk for thromboembolism; cardiac acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) should not be discontinued in most cases, and other antiplatelet agents should be resumed once hemostasis has been achieved.

### Resumption of anticoagulant therapy after anticoagulant-related gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116VeRkV]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is permanently discontinued in up to 50% of patients following a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. A previous meta-analysis showed a reduced risk of thromboembolism and death, and a non-statistically significant increased risk of re-bleeding associated with resumption. We conducted an updated meta-analysis to determine the risks of recurrent GI bleeding, thromboembolism, and death in patients who resumed OAC compared to those who did not.

Materials and Methods

We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for new references from January 2014 to September 2017. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies involving adults with OAC-related GI bleeding were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's ROBINS-I tool. Pooled relative risk (RR) ratios were calculated using a random-effects model.

Results

We identified 12 observational studies involving 3098 patients. There was an increased risk of recurrent GI bleeding (RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.47–2.48, I² = 0%, 11 studies), and a reduced risk of thromboembolism (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.13–0.68, I² = 59.8%, 9 studies) and death (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38–0.70, I² = 71.8%, 8 studies) in patients who resumed OAC compared to those who did not. Eleven studies were judged to be at serious risk of bias due to confounding.

Conclusions

Resuming OAC after OAC-related GI bleeding appears to be associated with an increase in recurrent GI bleeding, but a reduction in thromboembolism and death. Further prospective data are needed to identify patients for whom the net clinical benefit favours OAC resumption and the optimal timing of resumption.

### What to do after the bleed: resuming anticoagulation after major bleeding [^115ueJyW]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Resuming anticoagulation therapy after a potentially life-threatening bleeding complication evokes high anxiety levels among clinicians and patients trying to decide whether resuming oral anticoagulation to prevent devastating and potentially fatal thromboembolic events or discontinuing anticoagulation in hopes of reducing the risk of recurrent bleeding is best. The available evidence favors resumption of anticoagulation therapy for gastrointestinal tract bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage survivors, and it is reasonable to begin postbleeding decision making with resuming anticoagulation therapy as the default plan. After considering factors related to the index bleeding event, the underlying thromboembolic risk, and comorbid conditions, a decision to accept or modify the default plan can be made in collaboration with other care team members, the patient, and their caregivers. Although additional information is needed regarding the optimal timing of anticoagulation resumption, available evidence indicates that waiting ∼14 days may best balance the risk of recurrent bleeding, thromboembolism, and mortality after gastrointestinal tract bleeding. When to resume anticoagulation after intracranial hemorrhage is less clear, but most studies indicate that resumption within the first month of discharge is associated with better outcomes.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^111aRLHb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Anticoagulation reversal for hemodynamic instability and severe bleeding — options and evidence for vitamin K antagonist reversal include that reversal of anticoagulation may be warranted and options for reversal include vitamin K, FFP, and 4-factor PCC; European guidelines recommend administering vitamin K along with PCC (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence) or FFP if PCC is unavailable (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), while joint ACG–Canadian Association of Gastroenterology guidance suggests against the routine use of vitamin K and suggests PCC administration as compared with FFP for those who require reversal (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Among patients with GIB on warfarin or dabigatran in 3 phase III trials, 26% were managed with discontinuation only, and in another study of patients with GIB on warfarin in the ARISTOTLE trial, 76% had drug interruption during admission. In a multicenter observational cohort of warfarin-associated bleeding (52% GIB), 31% received FFP vs 23% PCC. In an RCT of urgent VKA reversal (n = 202; 63% with GIB/defined nonvisible bleeding), treatment with PCC was shown to be noninferior to FFP in achieving effective hemostasis, with overall 42% (n = 71/98) achieving effective hemostasis with PCC vs 65.9% (n = 68/104) with FFP; another RCT found PCC superior to FFP in effective hemostasis (90% vs 75%) and rapidity of INR reduction (55% in PCC group vs 10% in FFP group) with a similar safety profile. A post hoc analysis limited to 42 patients with acute severe GIB found PCC associated with reduced time to the first endoscopic procedure with no difference in hemostatic efficacy, and another study of 40 patients on warfarin reported PCC normalized INR more rapidly than FFP and was associated with less active bleeding on endoscopy. Meta-analyses reported PCC was associated with a low risk of thromboembolic complications compared with FFP and, for VKA reversal as compared with FFP, was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality, more rapid INR reduction, and less volume overload.

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^1154AEnw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions.

It is impossible to confidently estimate the GI procedural bleeding risk associated with uninterrupted warfarin therapy (vs warfarin interruption), given the limitations of the published literature, heterogeneity of patient populations and procedure type, and imprecision of the results. The absence of studies in advanced endoscopic procedures (with higher baseline bleeding risk), and differences in clinical consequences of luminal and extraluminal bleeding associated with such endoscopic GI procedures, limits our ability to comment on the safety of proceeding without interrupting warfarin. The evolving role of mechanical hemostasis may render some advanced procedures safer with continued warfarin in the future; however, current evidence supporting this strategy is scant.

The planned procedure type (Table 3) and its associated risk of postprocedural bleeding, and the baseline risk of thromboembolism will influence the recommendation, as will resource requirements associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of anticoagulation (e.g. laboratory tests and clinic visits). For patients on warfarin who are undergoing elective and planned outpatient endoscopic GI procedures, we suggest warfarin be continued unless they are undergoing an advanced endoscopic procedure (Table 3), which may incur a higher risk of procedural bleeding, in which case 5 days of temporary interruption without bridging heparin would be appropriate, as discussed in PICO 12.

12. For patients on warfarin, who hold warfarin in the periprocedural period for elective/planned endoscopic GI procedures, we suggest against bridging anticoagulation (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

### Gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with rivaroxaban or warfarin: ROCKET AF trial [^111itjFv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common complication of oral anticoagulation.

Objectives

This study evaluated GI bleeding in patients who received at least 1 dose of the study drug in the on-treatment arm of the ROCKET AF (Rivaroxaban Once-daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation) trial.

Methods

The primary outcome was adjudicated GI bleeding reported from first to last drug dose + 2 days. Multivariable modeling was performed with pre-specified candidate predictors.

Results

Of 14,236 patients, 684 experienced GI bleeding during follow-up. These patients were older (median age 75 years vs. 73 years) and less often female. GI bleeding events occurred in the upper GI tract (48%), lower GI tract (23%), and rectum (29%) without differences between treatment arms. There was a significantly higher rate of major or nonmajor clinical GI bleeding in rivaroxaban- versus warfarin-treated patients (3.61 events/100 patient-years vs. 2.60 events/100 patient-years; hazard ratio: 1.42; 95% confidence interval: 1.22 to 1.66). Severe GI bleeding rates were similar between treatment arms (0.47 events/100 patient-years vs. 0.41 events/100 patient-years; p = 0.39; 0.01 events/100 patient-years vs. 0.04 events/100 patient-years; p = 0.15, respectively), and fatal GI bleeding events were rare (0.01 events/100 patient-years vs. 0.04 events/100 patient-years; 1 fatal events vs. 5 fatal events total). Independent clinical factors most strongly associated with GI bleeding were baseline anemia, history of GI bleeding, and long-term aspirin use.

Conclusions

In the ROCKET AF trial, rivaroxaban increased GI bleeding compared with warfarin. The absolute fatality rate from GI bleeding was low and similar in both treatment arms. Our results further illustrate the need for minimizing modifiable risk factors for GI bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulation.

Dabigatran (a novel oral anticoagulant) — pharmacokinetics, laboratory interpretation, and periprocedural considerations indicate it reaches maximum effect 1.25 to 3 hours after ingestion with a half-life of 12 to 14 hours, partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time can be normal in spite of circulating therapeutic levels whereas a normal activated partial thromboplastin time effectively rules out a clinically significant circulating drug level, and timing of discontinuation before an endoscopic procedure is dictated by creatinine clearance because 80% of excretion occurs via the kidneys.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^1169oCmw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Management of coagulation defects — recommendations for acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding state that endoscopic hemostasis may be considered in patients with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5–2.5 before or concomitant with the administration of reversal agents, and reversal agents should be considered before endoscopy in patients with an INR ≥ 2.5 (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). Platelet transfusion should be considered to maintain a platelet count of 50×10⁹/l in patients with severe bleeding and those requiring endoscopic hemostasis (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence), and platelet and plasma transfusions should be considered in patients who receive massive red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). In patients on anticoagulant agents, a multidisciplinary approach should be used when deciding whether to discontinue medications or use reversal agents to balance the risk of ongoing bleeding with the risk of thromboembolic events (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

### The management of antithrombotic agents for patients undergoing GI endoscopy [^116UzNdh]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Urgent and emergent endoscopic procedures — patients receiving anticoagulant therapy: In acute bleeding, We recommend patients with acute GI bleeding on anticoagulation therapy have anticoagulant agents held to facilitate achievement of hemostasis. For life-threatening bleeding on warfarin, We recommend either (1) 4-factor PCC and vitamin K or (2) fresh frozen plasma be given for life-threatening GI bleeding in patients on warfarin anticoagulant therapy. Regarding timing, We suggest endoscopic therapy not be delayed in patients with serious GI bleeding and an INR < 2.5. After hemostasis for high-risk stigmata, We suggest patients who require anticoagulation receive UFH because of its relatively short half-life after successful endoscopic hemostasis for high-risk stigmata.

### Management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents in acute gastrointestinal bleeding and prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding [^114xyjzi]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Managing gastrointestinal bleeding in patients using antithrombotic agents remains challenging in clinical practice. This review article provides a comprehensive and evidence-based approach to managing acute antithrombotic-related gastrointestinal bleeding, focusing on the triage of patients, appropriate resuscitation, and timely endoscopy. The latest clinical practice guidelines are highlighted to guide decisions concerning the use of reversal agents, temporary interruption, and resumption of antithrombotic drugs. Additionally, preventive measures are discussed to lower the risk of future bleeding and minimize complications among patients prescribed antithrombotic drugs.

Antithrombotic drugs (anticoagulants, aspirin, and other antiplatelet agents) are used to treat cardiovascular disease and to prevent secondary thromboembolic events. These drugs are independently associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and, when prescribed in combination, further increase the risk of adverse bleeding events. Clinical evidence to inform the choice of endoscopic hemostatic procedure, safe temporary drug cessation, and use of reversal agents is reviewed to optimize management following clinically significant GIB.

Liver transplantation

This is probably appropriate only for patients who bleed while awaiting liver transplantation, although studies comparing VBL or TIPSS placement with urgent liver transplantation in this situation need to be done. Liver transplantation is an exceedingly rare option for the vast majority of patients, both because it is not commonly available and because of shortages and delays in organ procurement. No controlled trials of liver transplantation in uncontrolled/active bleeding are available.

Recommendations for the control of variceal bleeding in cirrhosis are given below and in figure 3.

Recommendations: control of active variceal haemorrhage in cirrhosis (figure 3)
Suggestions for resuscitation and initial management Units offering an emergency acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding service should have expertise in VBL, balloon tamponade and management of gastric variceal bleeding (level 5, grade D). Transfuse patients with massive bleeding with blood, platelets and clotting factors in line with local protocols for managing massive bleeding (level 5, grade D). Base decisions on blood transfusion on the full clinical picture, recognising that overtransfusion may be as damaging as undertransfusion. A restrictive transfusion policy aiming for a haemoglobin of 70–80 g/L is suggested in haemodynamically stable patients (level 1b, grade B). Do not offer platelet transfusion to patients who are not actively bleeding and are haemodynamically stable (level 5, grade D). Offer platelet transfusion to patients who are actively bleeding and have a platelet count of < 50×10⁹/L (level 5, grade D). Offer fresh frozen plasma to patients who have either: a fibrinogen level of < 1 g/L (level 5, grade D), or a prothrombin time (international normalised ratio) or activated partial thromboplastin time > 1.5 times normal (level 5, grade D). Offer prothrombin complex concentrate to patients who are taking warfarin and actively bleeding (level 5, grade D). Treat patients who are taking warfarin and whose upper gastrointestinal bleeding has stopped in line with local warfarin protocols (level 5, grade D). There is insufficient evidence for the use of recombinant factor VIIa in acute variceal haemorrhage (level 1b, grade B).
Suggestions for timing of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: Offer endoscopy to unstable patients with severe acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding immediately after resuscitation (level 5, grade A). Offer endoscopy within 24 h of admission to all other patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (level 2b, grade A). Units seeing more than 330 cases a year should offer daily endoscopy lists. Units seeing fewer than 330 cases a year should arrange their service according to local circumstances (level 5, grade D).
Control of bleeding: Antibiotics are recommended for all patients with suspected or confirmed variceal bleeding (level 1a, grade A). In all patients, vasoconstrictors such as terlipressin or somatostatin are recommended and should be started as soon variceal bleeding is suspected and continued until haemostasis is achieved or for up to 5 days. Octreotide (unlicensed) is suggested if terlipressin or somatostatin are unavailable (level 1a, grade A). Variceal band ligation is recommended as the preferred endoscopic method (level 1a, grade A). After satisfactory haemostasis with the methods above, and depending on local resources, early covered TIPSS (< 72 h after index variceal bleed) can be considered in selected patients with Child's B cirrhosis and active bleeding or Child's C cirrhosis with Child's score < 14 (level 1b, grade B). Proton pump inhibitors are not recommended unless otherwise required for peptic ulcer disease (level 1b, grade B).
Failure to control active bleeding: If bleeding is difficult to control, a Sengstaken–Blakemore tube should be inserted until further endoscopic treatment, TIPSS or surgery is performed depending on local resources and expertise (level 1b, grade B). Specialist help should be sought at this time and transfer to a specialist centre should be considered. Units that do not offer a TIPSS service should identify a specialist centre which offers a 24 h emergency TIPSS service and have appropriate arrangements for safe transfer of patients in place (level 2a, grade B).
Areas requiring further study: The efficacy of restrictive blood transfusion in variceal haemorrhage. The role of blood products in variceal haemorrhage. The utility of early TIPSS (< 72 h) in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of removable oesophageal stents in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of haemostatic powders in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of proton pump inhibitors in variceal haemorrhage.
Quality indicators: Antibiotic administration in acute variceal bleeding within 1 day either before or after the procedure (level 1a, grade A). Numerator; patients with an acute variceal bleed who have received antibiotics within 1 day either before or after the procedure. Denominator; patients with an acute variceal bleed. Endoscopy performed within 24 h of presentation of an acute variceal bleed (level 2b, grade A). Numerator; patients with an acute variceal bleed who have received endoscopy within 24 h of presentation. Denominator; patients with an acute variceal bleed.

### The management of antithrombotic agents for patients undergoing GI endoscopy [^114jYkfp]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding on anticoagulants — endoscopic therapy effectiveness and INR thresholds — In a retrospective series of 52, correction of INR to between 1.5 and 2.5 allowed successful endoscopic diagnosis and therapy; in a large series with 95% of patients having INR between 1.3 and 2.7, endoscopic therapy achieved initial success in 95% of patients (233/246) using multiple hemostatic modalities; although rebleeding was 23%, pre-endoscopy INR was not a predictor of rebleeding; another retrospective study found rebleeding rates with supratherapeutic INRs (≥ 4.0) not significantly different from those with therapeutic INRs (2.0–3.0); a systematic review of 1869 nonvariceal upper GI bleed cases found initial INR did not predict rebleeding; pending further data, performing endoscopic therapy in bleeding patients with INRs < 2.5 is reasonable.

### Severity of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients treated with direct-acting oral anticoagulants [^116koZxj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which have gained approval for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and treatment of venous thromboembolism, have become increasingly preferred over warfarin given their predictable pharmacodynamics, lack of required monitoring, and superior outcomes. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants have been shown to be associated with an increased frequency of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with warfarin, but the severity and characteristics of gastrointestinal bleeding in these patients is poorly understood.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated electronic medical records of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 8496) from 2010–2016. We identified 61 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding episodes while treated with DOACs (rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or apixaban) and 123 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding while taking warfarin. We randomly selected a control group of 296 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding who were not receiving anticoagulation treatment from the same sample. Outcomes included the need for hospitalization, blood transfusion, endoscopic or surgical intervention, and 30-day mortality.

Results

The DOAC and warfarin groups were similar in terms of age and underlying comorbidity (assessed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index), but the DOAC group had greater concomitant aspirin use. Gastrointestinal bleeding was classified as upper (n = 186), lower (n = 88), anorectal (n = 183), small bowel (n = 9), and indeterminate (n = 14). After adjusting for differences in baseline variables, the DOAC group had fewer hospitalizations and required fewer transfusions than the warfarin group. The DOAC and control groups were not statistically different for all outcomes. There were no significant mortality differences among groups.

Conclusion

Although prior studies have shown a higher frequency of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients treated with DOACs compared with warfarin, our data suggest that gastrointestinal bleeding in patients taking DOACs may be less severe. These differences occurred despite significantly greater concomitant aspirin use in the DOAC group compared with warfarin users.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to the new anticoagulants [^114JWzZz]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To quantify direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) related gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), characterize patients at greatest risk and provide a pragmatic approach for the management of these drugs. This review will also summarize risk-management strategies and highlight evolving areas of clinical knowledge.

Recent Findings

DOACs permit anticoagulation with predictable dosing without the need for routine serum monitoring. Since their availability on the market, they have quickly emerged as a popular alternative for patients requiring short-term and lifelong anticoagulation. However, they are associated with an increased risk of GIB when compared with warfarin; thus, gastroenterologists must be prepared to manage DOAC-related GIB and prevent drug-related complications. This review will focus on acute and elective periendoscopic DOAC management, high-risk clinical groups for DOAC-related GIB, quantification of DOAC levels, use of reversal agents and minimization of thromboembolic risk associated with temporary interruption.

Summary

This review will highlight pragmatic strategies for the treatment of DOAC-related bleeding and the prevention of postendoscopic DOAC bleeding. It will address new and evolving areas of periendoscopic management and identify knowledge gaps requiring further research to inform clinical practice.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^113kApjt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Management of patients on vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) with lower gastrointestinal bleeding emphasizes procedural safety and selective reversal: endoscopic hemostasis can be considered safe and effective in patients who have an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 or less. Although most patients with LGIB on VKAs are unlikely to require reversal, we suggest reversal of patients who present with a life-threatening LGIB and have an INR substantially exceeding the therapeutic range; for those requiring reversal to prevent stroke in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is preferred to fresh frozen plasma (FFP) because of the rapidity of INR reduction (Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). In patients with minor bleeding who are unlikely to require a hospital-based intervention (e.g. Oakland score ≤ 8), oral anticoagulants may be held, and reversal is unnecessary; for patients with more significant bleeding requiring hospitalization, oral anticoagulants should be held at admission. Endoscopic therapy is effective even at moderately elevated INR levels (2.5 or less); however, reversal agents should be considered before endoscopy in patients with severe bleeding with hemodynamic instability and significant prolongation in INR substantially exceeding therapeutic levels.

### Apixaban [^116nsgMm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

¶GI bleed includes upper GI, lower GI, and rectal bleeding.

 Fatal bleeding is an adjudicated death with the primary cause of death as intracranial bleeding or non-intracranial bleeding during the on-treatment period.

In ARISTOTLE, the results for major bleeding were generally consistent across most major subgroups including age, weight, CHADS2score (a scale from 0 to 6 used to estimate risk of stroke, with higher scores predicting greater risk), prior warfarin use, geographic region, and aspirin use at randomization (Figure 1). Subjects treated with apixaban with diabetes bled more (3% per year) than did subjects without diabetes (1.9% per year).

Figure 1: Major Bleeding Hazard Ratios by Baseline Characteristics – ARISTOTLE Study Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups, all of which are baseline characteristics and all of which were prespecified, if not the groupings. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted.

### Use and effectiveness of prothrombin complex concentrates vs fresh frozen plasma in gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to warfarin usage in the ED [^115dRvgg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

High International Normalized Ratio (INR) level resulting from warfarin use increases the risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhages. We aimed to compare the efficacy of prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) at lowering the INR level, decreasing active hemorrhages visible by endoscopy, and shortening the length of stay at the emergency department (ED).

Method

This study is a prospective cohort study of consecutive patents with gastrointestinal hemorrhages that received either PCC or FFP. With strict exclusion criteria, only patients over 18 years of age with a high INR level (> 2.1) due to warfarin usage were included.

Results

A total of 40 patients (18 female) were included in the study, 20 each in the PCC and FFP groups. For the PCC group, the mean INR levels at the second and sixth hours were lower than those for the FFP group (second hour INR: 1.53 vs 4.50, P < .01, sixth hour INR: 1.52 vs 2.41, P < .01). Seven patients experienced active bleeding (Forrest 1) in the FFP group, whereas no patient experienced active bleeding in the PCC group based on the Forrest classification (35% vs 0%, P < .01), and only 3 patients in the FFP group underwent invasive/surgical treatment (15% vs 0%, P < .01). The ED length of stay was lower for the PCC group (1.62 days vs 3.46 days, P < .01).

Conclusion

For patients experiencing a gastrointestinal hemorrhage, INR levels were reversed more quickly, there was less active bleeding on endoscopy, and the ED length of stay was lower in the PCC group than in the FFP group.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, more specifically with respect to management of anticoagulant therapy, preprocedural, ACG/CAG 2022 guidelines recommend to consider continuing warfarin rather than temporarily interrupting (1–7 days) in patients on warfarin undergoing elective/planned endoscopic gastrointestinal procedures.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence.

In patients receiving warfarin who require its temporary interruption, heparin bridging, typically with subcutaneous, full-dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), is sometimes used for 3 days before and 3–5 days after the surgery or procedure. The premise for heparin bridging is that by minimizing the time patients are not therapeutically anticoagulated periprocedurally during warfarin interruption and resumption, the risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events will be reduced. However, heparin bridging may not affect the pathophysiologic pathway that mediates periprocedural stroke and thromboembolism and may place patients at increased risk of procedure-site bleeding, especially if heparin bridging is administered in too close proximity to the time of the procedure.

Two randomized trials assessed heparin bridging among warfarin-treated patients who required anticoagulant interruption for elective surgery/procedure, including GI procedures. One randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (BRIDGE) assessed the need for heparin bridging in patients with atrial fibrillation who required temporary warfarin interruption for an elective surgical procedure, including 758 GI procedures (98.7% were minor or low bleeding risk procedures). Excluded from the BRIDGE trial were patients with a very high thrombotic risk (i.e. a mechanical heart valve; stroke, systemic embolism, or transient ischemic attack within the past 12 weeks) or significant risk factors for major bleeding (i.e. history of a bleeding event within the past 6 weeks; creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min; and thrombocytopenia < 100,000 per microliter). Patients with planned cardiac, intracranial, or intraspinal surgeries were also excluded.

### The management of antithrombotic agents for patients undergoing GI endoscopy [^117Cragf]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants — periprocedural principles and laboratory assessment — Anti-Xa anticoagulants are best assessed by anti-Xa levels with drug-specific calibrators, whereas prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time are crude and may be minimally prolonged or normal; normal results rule out high circulating drug levels, there is no reliable serum assay to assess anticoagulant activity at this time, and interpretation of activated partial thromboplastin time requires caution due to a ceiling effect. In the periprocedural period, key considerations are time to maximum effect, half-life, and drug excretion; these agents have a short time to maximal effect (2–4 hours with rivaroxaban, 1–3 hours with apixaban), a half-life ranging from 8 to 15 hours, and renal excretion variability (rivaroxaban 66% and apixaban 25%). To minimize bleeding risk, these medications should be stopped for at least 2 half-lives before high-risk procedures and dosing adjusted for renal impairment.

### Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with oral anticoagulants: population based retrospective cohort study [^1155UGPj]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Despite the insights that these trials provide, the real world safety of these novel oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin from limited observational studies is less clear. Such safety may diverge from the trial results for several reasons, including trials' selective inclusion criteria as well as the limited duration of these investigations. Information on findings on gastrointestinal safety will allow clinicians to weigh the risks and benefits of these agents. Gastrointestinal bleeding carries substantial morbidity and mortality. In the United States in 2009, an estimated 140 000 or more hospital admissions had the principal diagnoses of gastrointestinal bleeding and their aggregate costs reached $1.15bn (£0.77bn; €1.06bn). The incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the United Kingdom was 103 cases per 100 000 adults per year. Among patients admitted to hospital with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the United Kingdom in 2007, the overall mortality rate was 10%; among UK patients with atrial fibrillation with warfarin induced gastrointestinal bleeding, 6% of such bleeds are fatal.

Post-marketing reports have noted reports of major bleeding associated with dabigatran among older patients, those at the extremes of body weight, and those with impaired renal function. Such patients have been largely excluded from the trials. Approximately 25% of the bleeding events in post-marketing reports were associated with prescribing and dosing error. Concomitant use of antiplatelet drugs with dabigatran increases the risk of bleeding. The proportion of patients taking antiplatelet drugs is higher in the real world, making such patients susceptible to bleeding complications. Furthermore, in contrast to warfarin, no specific antidote for dabigatran exists and it is not dialyzable.

We did a retrospective cohort study using a large administrative claims database of commercially insured people to quantify the comparative safety of these novel anticoagulants relative to warfarin with respect to major gastrointestinal bleeding. We focused on gastrointestinal bleeding because of earlier signals in pivotal clinical trials suggesting an increase in gastrointestinal bleeding with dabigatran relative to warfarin. Additionally, these novel agents have been approved only recently and assessing the efficacy of long term outcomes such as stroke without incurring adequate follow-up would be premature.

### Limb-threatening deep venous thrombosis complicating warfarin reversal with three-factor prothrombin complex concentrate: a case report [^114EC4qH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Three- and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) are gaining popularity for acute reversal of vitamin K antagonist-associated bleeding. Although acute thrombosis after PCC administration has been described, it seems to be rare.

Case Report

An 83-year-old woman on warfarin for history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) presented to the Emergency Department with life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding, requiring urgent PCC administration. After stabilization, she subsequently developed a new limb-threatening upper-extremity DVT. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? As PCC therapy gains popularity for reversal of anticoagulant-induced bleeding in urgent bleeding scenarios, the emergency physician must be aware of the complications of PCC administration, including new limb-threatening DVT.

### Role of red blood cells in clinically relevant bleeding tendencies and complications [^112ytPKN]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Among patients with atrial fibrillation using dabigatran or warfarin in the large The Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy [RELY] trial, 12% had anemia already at the initiation of the study. The anemic patients carried an elevated cardiovascular risk profile. Anemia, particularly, was associated with the risk of bleeding complications, at a safety hazard ratio (HR) exceeding 2, which resulted in cessation of the anticoagulant and in turn created a risk for systemic embolization and mortality (HR, 1.4 and 1.5, respectively). This is the case irrespective of the anticoagulant chosen, except that the site of the bleed with warfarin is more often intracranial than with direct oral anticoagulants.

In another study (The Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation [ROCKET AF]) of patients with atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban or warfarin, 5% of the patients experienced a GI bleed, which affected mostly the upper GI tract. Major GI bleeds occurred more (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2–1.7) in the rivaroxaban group than in the warfarin group. The independent risk factors for major bleeds included baseline anemia, history of a GI bleed, and coadministration of aspirin.

Finally, also in case of apixaban (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation [ARISTOTLE] trial) among patients with atrial fibrillation, baseline anemia (according to World Health Organisation criteria) was associated with almost doubling (HR, 1.9) of bleeding complications and aligned with significant increased mortality after follow up at 1.8 years. Again, anemia occurred in 12% of the patients at the baseline, and new anemia developed in 30% of the patients during the study. Overall, in patients with atrial fibrillation, anemia should be closely monitored during all types of anticoagulant therapy and solving the underlying causes of anemia is critical. In patients with acute coronary syndromes who are on platelet inhibitors, anemia is also clearly associated with bleeding risks. Successful proactive management of anemia, most often iron deficiency anemia, should be the target to avoid severe complications in all patients, along with all types of antithrombotic treatment. Obviously, endoscopies are needed to identify and manage the tissue injuries or malignancies causing GI bleeds.

Patients on antithrombotic therapy undergoing endoscopy — adverse events of antithrombotic therapy include GI bleeding, and their use increases the risk of hemorrhage after some endoscopic interventions, and for patients taking these medications who require endoscopy, one should consider the following important factors: (1) the urgency of the procedure, (2) the bleeding risk of the procedure, (3) the effect of the antithrombotic drug(s) on the bleeding risk, and (4) the risk of a thromboembolic event related to periprocedural interruption of antithrombotic agents.

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding: an 86-year-old woman with peptic ulcer disease [^115X5oXg]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract is a common medical problem, with an incidence of 48 to 160 cases per 1000 adults per year and a mortality rate of 5% to 14%. The risk of gastrointestinal bleeding is increased with the use of antiplatelet medications including aspirin and clopidogrel, as well as warfarin or a combination of these medications. The recurrence rate for bleeding in patients who continue to take aspirin after an episode of peptic ulcer disease-related bleeding can reach up to 300 cases per 1000 person-years and varies by age, sex, and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Using the case of Ms S, an 86-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department with an episode of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding, we address the management of patients who are receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy who present with gastrointestinal bleeding, including when to restart antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy, interventions to reduce the risk of bleeding recurrence, and the potential for drug interactions between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors.

### Risks and benefits of direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in a real world setting: cohort study in primary care [^1165Qj3d]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

In the subcohort without atrial fibrillation, apixaban was associated with lower risks of major bleed (adjusted hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.79) than warfarin (fig 4) or rivaroxaban (fig 5). Rivaroxaban was associated with a lower risk of intracranial bleed (0.54, 0.35 to 0.82) compared with warfarin, and apixaban with lower risks of all gastrointestinal (0.55, 0.37 to 0.83) and upper gastrointestinal bleeds (0.55, 0.36 to 0.83). Dabigatran and rivaroxaban were associated with higher risks for all gastrointestinal bleeds compared with apixaban, rivaroxaban was also associated with a higher risk for upper gastrointestinal bleed (fig 5).

The risk of primary ischaemic stroke did not differ between any of the anticoagulants studied in either subcohort. Figure 4 shows that the risk of primary venous thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation was not different between any drugs, but in the subcohort without atrial fibrillation compared with warfarin there was a higher risk in patients taking rivaroxaban (adjusted hazard ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.33 to 1.68) and lower risks in patients taking dabigatran (0.25, 0.15 to 0.41) and apixaban (0.42, 0.33 to 0.53).

For both patients with atrial fibrillation (adjusted hazard ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.29) and without atrial fibrillation (1.51, 1.38 to 1.66), the risk of mortality was increased in patients taking rivaroxaban compared with warfarin. Although the estimates for apixaban in both subcohorts were higher than unity (1.13, 1.01 to 1.26 for patients with atrial fibrillation; 1.16, 1.02 to 1.33 for patients without atrial fibrillation) and neither of them were statistically significant (at P < 0.01), the estimate for the whole cohort was (adjusted hazard ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.24, P = 0.001) (see supplementary figure 1 and supplementary table 5). Supplementary table 8 shows that most of these deaths were owing to causes other than bleeding, ischaemic stroke, or venous thromboembolism (91% in QResearch and 88% in CPRD).

Warfarin drug interactions and bleeding risk — drugs such as aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, high-dose penicillins, and moxalactam increase the risk of warfarin-associated bleeding by inhibiting platelet function, and aspirin is the most important because of its widespread use and prolonged effect; aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can also produce gastric erosions that increase the risk of upper GI bleeding, which can occur even with COX-2 inhibitors. In one case-control analysis of 98,821 subjects on warfarin, celecoxib and rofecoxib were associated with a 1.7- or 2.4-fold increased risk of GI hemorrhage, respectively, and the risk of clinically important bleeding is heightened when high doses of aspirin are taken during high-intensity warfarin therapy (INR, 3.0–4.5). However, low doses of aspirin (ie, 75 to 100 mg daily) combined with moderate-intensity and low-intensity warfarin anticoagulation therapy are also associated with increased rates of bleeding; the effect of statins or fibrates on bleeding in patients on vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is controversial, with initiation of a fibrate or a statin that inhibits CYP3A4 enzymes reported to increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in warfarin-treated patients, whereas other statins mainly excreted unchanged were not, and other authors reported that long-term statin use is associated with a decreased risk of bleeding complications in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) on warfarin therapy.

Role of bridge therapy — Patients on warfarin (Coumadin) may be switched to a shorter acting (ie, bridge) anticoagulant in the periproceduric period, but evidence for the use of UFH and LMWH (enoxaparin) as bridge therapies for endoscopic procedures in patients on warfarin is limited; in one study of 98 patients undergoing endoscopy with bridge therapy using bemiparin, no thromboembolic events and only 2 major bleeding episodes that were unrelated to endoscopy were reported.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

The greatest limitation to the panel's ability to provide unequivocal clinical recommendations was the certainty of evidence in the published literature. As highlighted throughout this clinical practice guideline, insufficient high-quality evidence exists in antithrombotic and antiplatelet drug users to evaluate strategies for the temporary interruption, drug reversal, and resumption against a comparator group with great certainty. In addition, we found too few studies focusing on advanced endoscopic procedures to inform our recommendations.

The GRADE approach has clearly defined criteria for grading the certainty of evidence and the strength of recommendations. Accordingly, the certainty of much of the relevant evidence was downgraded mainly because of indirectness, risk of bias, and imprecision. For some clinical questions, we could not make a recommendation for or against the treatment strategy examined, given the very low certainty or absence of evidence comparing a treatment strategy that is now a common clinical practice (e.g. reversal of warfarin with vitamin K) with alternative treatment strategies. For all remaining clinical questions, the recommendations were conditional (rather than strong) because the certainty of the evidence was low or very low, and the criteria for paradigmatic situations as described in the "METHODS" section were not met.

We suggest future studies focus on areas where insufficient evidence currently exists to inform clinical decisions. In particular, the potential benefit of PCC use for reversal of warfarin in the setting of acute GIB, the appropriate timing of resumption of P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors and anticoagulants (VKA and DOACs) after elective endoscopy, and whether it is necessary to interrupt P2Y 12 inhibitor antiplatelet monotherapy before elective endoscopy. There is also a lack of high certainty evidence informing optimal antithrombotic drug management before and after advanced endoscopic procedures.

Future observational studies hoping to influence the management of antithrombotic agents in the periendoscopic period must standardize endoscopic techniques to eliminate confounders for GI bleeding and ensure adequate adjustment for confounders of both GI bleeding and thromboembolism. These studies should ensure the existence of an appropriate comparator group and report results in sufficient detail to allow for inclusion in future meta-analyses. Ideally, double-blinded RCTs with adequate allocation concealment should be undertaken to rigorously examine the questions of temporary interruption, reversal, and postprocedural resumption of antiplatelets and anticoagulants. Standardization of endoscopic techniques will increase the generalizability of RCT results. Multicenter studies are likely required, given the low event rate of postprocedural bleeding and thrombosis.

### Clinical and endoscopic features of severe acute gastrointestinal bleeding in elderly patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants: a multicentre study [^113Hrf4t]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

More than two thirds of our patients needed transfusion of RBC, with a median number of 3.4 units, and more than 15% received fresh frozen plasma. In comparison, only 44.1% (median number of two units), 27.9% and 31% of patients required RBC transfusion in the Dresden registry, the American retrospective cohort and the study by Sengupta and colleagues, respectively. PCC was administered in around one third of our patients compared with only 4.2% of those from the Dresden registry.

The high proportion of patients treated with dabigatran and showing concomitant moderate to severe renal impairment could also partially explain the high mortality rate in our cohort. Renal excretion of dabigatran is significant (85%) and renal impairment will induce an extension of the drug's half-life and, therefore, a potentially longer and more severe bleeding episode. However, our results are very similar to those described by a French observational study. In a subset of 27 patients presenting with GI bleeding, haemoglobin levels were 78 ± 20 g/L and patients received a mean number of 3.7 RBC units (range 1–15). Of these 27 patients, 3 (11%) died within a 30-day period, all of them from gastroduodenal bleeding with gastroduodenal ulcers being the first bleeding cause (28.6%).

Nevertheless, in our study, with appropriate care only one out of four patients with life-threatening bleeding at admission died within 1 month. A low haemoglobin level was the only predictive factor for life-threatening bleeding and all-cause mortality in our study after adjustment for confounding factors. These results suggest that one of the most important parts of management of GI bleeding in patients treated with DOACs, in terms of prognosis, might be haemodynamic optimization and transfusion support until the pro-bleeding effect of DOACs disappears. This is consistent with the global improvement in management of GI bleeding in the past few decades, as it is now well known that early intensive resuscitation measures decrease mortality, especially in upper GI bleeding.

According to most of the meta-analyses of RCTs and real-life observational studies, apixaban seems to be associated with a minimal risk of all-cause bleeding, and more particularly intracranial and GI bleeding.– In our cohort, patients treated with apixaban had significantly fewer life-threatening bleeding events than with the other DOACs.

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^115CE51M]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

We conducted systematic reviews of predefined clinical questions and used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach to develop recommendations for the periendoscopic management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs during acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and the elective endoscopic setting. The following recommendations target patients presenting with acute GI bleeding: For patients on warfarin, we suggest against giving fresh frozen plasma or vitamin K; if needed, we suggest prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) compared with fresh frozen plasma administration; for patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), we suggest against PCC administration; if on dabigatran, we suggest against the administration of idarucizumab, and if on rivaroxaban or apixaban, we suggest against andexanet alfa administration; for patients on antiplatelet agents, we suggest against platelet transfusions; and for patients on cardiac acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) for secondary prevention, we suggest against holding it, but if the ASA has been interrupted, we suggest resumption on the day hemostasis is endoscopically confirmed. The following recommendations target patients in the elective (planned) endoscopy setting: For patients on warfarin, we suggest continuation as opposed to temporary interruption (1–7 days), but if it is held for procedures with high risk of GI bleeding, we suggest against bridging anticoagulation unless the patient has a mechanical heart valve; for patients on DOACs, we suggest temporarily interrupting rather than continuing these; for patients on dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention, we suggest temporary interruption of the P2Y12 receptor inhibitor while continuing ASA; and if on cardiac ASA monotherapy for secondary prevention, we suggest against its interruption. Evidence was insufficient in the following settings to permit recommendations. With acute GI bleeding in patients on warfarin, we could not recommend for or against PCC administration when compared with placebo. In the elective periprocedural endoscopy setting, we could not recommend for or against temporary interruption of the P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for patients on a single P2Y12 inhibiting agent. We were also unable to make a recommendation regarding same-day resumption of the drug vs 1–7 days after the procedure among patients prescribed anticoagulants (warfarin or DOACs) or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor drugs because of insufficient evidence.

### Antithrombotic medication management in GI bleeding… [^112MECSA]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Platelet transfusions appear to increase mortality in patients with GI bleeding who are taking antiplatelet agents.
- Patients should continue taking aspirin for secondary cardiovascular protection in GI bleeding because stopping aspirin does not improve bleeding outcomes and may increase mortality.
- Prothrombin complex concentrates do not appear beneficial for GI bleeding related to direct oral anticoagulants but may be beneficial for patients taking warfarin. From the AFP Editors The major risk of taking antithrombotic medications, including antiplatelet and anticoagulation agents, is gastrointestinal bleeding. The optimal means of managing bleeding episodes is uncertain. The American College of Gastroenterology and Canadian Association of Gastroenterology conducted a systematic review to publish guidelines for managing GI bleeding for patients who are taking antithrombotic medications.

Antiplatelet Medications When patients who take antiplatelet medications have GI bleeding, platelet transfusions may be harmful. In a small cohort study, patients receiving platelet transfusions had an increased risk of death over patients who did not receive platelet transfusions, with no difference in further bleeding or thrombotic events. ASPIRIN When patients taking aspirin for secondary cardiovascular protection present with GI bleeding, stopping aspirin is not helpful, and it may increase cardiovascular risk. Because aspirin causes permanent platelet inhibition that lasts for at least three days after stoppage, stopping aspirin is unlikely to reduce bleeding. In one small retrospective study, continued bleeding and mortality were similar whether aspirin was stopped or not. If aspirin is stopped for bleeding concerns, restarting aspirin shortly after surgery reduces cardiovascular and gastrointestinal mortality without increasing recurrent bleeding.

Because of the little to no benefit of aspirin for primary cardiovascular prevention, stopping aspirin in these patients is recommended with any gastrointestinal bleeding. P2Y 12 INHIBITORS When patients have GI bleeding while taking P2Y. 12 inhibitors, such as clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and prasugrel, evidence is less clear. From studies of endoscopy for patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy, stopping the P2Y 12 inhibitor does not appear to reduce bleeding. Although up to 6% of patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy will have stent thrombosis if the P2Y 12 inhibitor is stopped for 10 days, the risk of stent thrombosis with a stoppage of up to four days appears minimal. Direct Oral Anticoagulants When patients have GI bleeding while taking direct oral anticoagulant medications, prothrombin complex concentrates may not be effective.

Evidence is limited to small studies with patients who had GI bleeding while taking dabigatran, where prothrombin complex concentrates did not improve outcomes over conservative care. RIVAROXABAN OR APIXABAN Andexanet alfa, a modified recombinant human factor Xa decoy protein, sequesters apixaban and rivaroxaban. Andexanet alfa reduces the activity of apixaban and rivaroxaban by more than 90%, but the only clinical trial lacks a control group for clinical outcome comparison. It should be avoided until more data regarding its effectiveness are available. DABIGATRAN Idarucizumab, a monoclonal antibody to reverse the effects of dabigatran, does not appear to improve outcomes in patients with GI bleeding who are taking dabigatran. In a retrospective study, administering idarucizumab did not reduce mortality over conservative care.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding… [^114v6oV7]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding can be caused by peptic ulcers, gastric erosions, esophageal varices, and rarer causes such as gastric cancer. The initial assessment includes measurement of the blood pressure and heart rate, as well as blood tests to determine the hemoglobin. Significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding is considered a medical emergency. Fluid replacement, as well as blood transfusion, may be required. Endoscopy is recommended within 24 hours and bleeding can be stopped by various techniques. Proton pump inhibitors are often used. Tranexamic acid may also be useful. Procedures may be used. Recurrent or refractory bleeding may lead to need for surgery, although this has become uncommon as a result of improved endoscopic and medical treatment.

Signs and symptoms Persons with upper gastrointestinal bleeding often present with hematemesis, coffee ground vomiting, melena, or hematochezia if the hemorrhage is severe. The presentation of bleeding depends on the amount and location of hemorrhage. A person with upper gastrointestinal bleeding may also present with complications of anemia, including chest pain, syncope, fatigue and shortness of breath. The physical examination performed by the physician concentrates on the following things:

- Vital signs, in order to determine the severity of bleeding and the timing of intervention
- Abdominal and rectal examination, in order to determine possible causes of hemorrhage
- Assessment for portal hypertension and stigmata of chronic liver disease in order to determine if the bleeding is from a variceal source. Laboratory findings include anemia, coagulopathy, and an elevated BUN-to-creatinine ratio.

Causes A number of medications increase the risk of bleeding including NSAIDs and SSRIs. SSRIs double the rate of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. There are many causes for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Causes are usually anatomically divided into their location in the upper gastrointestinal tract. People are usually stratified into having either variceal or non-variceal sources of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, as the two have different treatment algorithms and prognosis. The causes for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage include the following:

- **Esophageal causes**:

- Esophageal varices
- Esophagitis
- Esophageal cancer
- Esophageal ulcers
- Mallory-Weiss tear
- **Gastric causes**:

- Gastric ulcer
- Gastric cancer
- Gastritis
- Gastric varices
- Gastric antral vascular ectasia
- Dieulafoy's lesions.
- **Duodenal causes**:

- Duodenal ulcer
- Vascular malformation, including aorto-enteric fistulae.

Fistulae are usually secondary to prior vascular surgery and usually occur at the proximal anastomosis at the third or fourth portion of the duodenum where it is retroperitoneal and near the aorta.
- Hematobilia, or bleeding from the biliary tree
- Hemosuccus pancreaticus, or bleeding from the pancreatic duct
- Severe superior mesenteric artery syndrome. Determining whether blood is in gastric contents, either vomited or aspirated specimens, may be a challenge when determining the source of the hemorrhage. Slide tests are based on orthotolidine or guaiac. There is some evidence that orthotolidine-based tests more sensitive than specific, the Hemoccult test's sensitivity reduced by the acidic environment; and the Gastroccult test be the most accurate. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value have been reported as follows:

### Association between oral anticoagulant PPI cotherapy and UGl bleeding… [^116H8DtQ]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Question Are anticoagulant drug choice and proton pump inhibitor cotherapy associated with the risk of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding in Medicare beneficiaries. Findings During 754 389 person-years of anticoagulation treatment with apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and warfarin, the risk of hospitalization for upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding was highest for rivaroxaban. The use of PPI cotherapy was associated with a significantly lower overall risk of gastrointestinal bleeding for all anticoagulants. Exposures Apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or warfarin with or without PPI cotherapy. Main Outcomes and Measures Hospitalizations for upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding: adjusted incidence and risk difference per 10 000 person-years of anticoagulant treatment, incidence rate ratios.

Conclusions and Relevance Among patients initiating oral anticoagulant treatment, incidence of hospitalization for upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding was the highest in patients prescribed rivaroxaban, and the lowest for patients prescribed apixaban. For each anticoagulant, the incidence of hospitalization for upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding was lower among patients who were receiving PPI cotherapy. These findings may inform assessment of risks and benefits when choosing anticoagulant agents. PPI cotherapy is associated with reduced incidence of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding in patients prescribed warfarin4 and dabigatran10; the absolute reduction in risk increases with the prevalence of several known risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding.

4 However, whether PPI cotherapy is associated with a lower incidence of anticoagulant-related serious upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding for other NOACs or alters the relative upper gastrointestinal tract safety associated with individual oral anticoagulants is unknown. Oral anticoagulant treatment during follow-up was the period during which patients were likely to have increased risk of anticoagulant-related bleeding. This period began on the date the prescription was filled, and, given potential residual anticoagulant effects, ended either 1 day or 3 days after the end of the days of supply. All cohort follow-up and study analyses were restricted to periods of oral anticoagulant treatment.

The primary study end point was hospitalization for upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding that was potentially preventable by PPI cotherapy. This end point included bleeding related to esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastritis, and excluded bleeding unlikely to be affected by PPIs. Hospitalization for other gastrointestinal bleeding was analyzed as a negative outcome control.
13. Several analyses were stratified according to an internally derived integrated measure of gastrointestinal bleeding risk that included all study covariates. This measure was calculated as a disease risk score, 15–17 which was defined as the expected incidence of hospitalization for upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding given the study covariates.

### Risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in warfarin users… [^112kGzZf]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background Little is known about the risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage during the concomitant use of warfarin and selective cyclooxygenase -2 inhibitors. We examined the association between the concomitant use of warfarin and nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or selective COX-2 inhibitors in older adults hospitalized for upper GI hemorrhage. Methods This nested case-control analysis of multiple linked health care databases conducted over 1 year identified a cohort of patients in Ontario, Canada, who were older than 66 years and continuously prescribed warfarin. Case patients were those admitted to the hospital with upper GI hemorrhage while taking warfarin. We compared their prescription records prior to hospitalization with those of age- and sex-matched controls who were also receiving warfarin. During the study period, we identified 98 821 elderly patients continuously receiving warfarin. Of those, 361 were admitted to the hospital with upper GI hemorrhage. Conclusions Patients taking warfarin concomitantly with selective COX-2 inhibitors have an increased risk of hospitalization for upper GI hemorrhage. The risk appears similar to that of patients simultaneously taking warfarin and nonselective NSAIDs. Warfarin is an anticoagulant commonly used for the management of patients with a variety of thromboembolic conditions1 but it is implicated in many drug-drug interactions. Some interactions alter warfarin pharmacokinetics and others involve drugs that directly influence hemostasis or gastrointestinal integrity. 2, 3 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often coprescribed to patients receiving warfarin, potentially resulting in a significantly increased risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. 4 This increased risk may be mediated through several pathways.

NSAIDs leads to significant inhibition of COX-1–generated thromboxane A 2, impairing platelet aggregation, 6, 7 which may be further compounded by the concomitant use of warfarin. 8 Third, traditional NSAIDs can cause gastric erosion, thereby further increasing the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with warfarin.
9. among users of selective COX-2 inhibitors relative to users of nonselective NSAIDs. 10 While recent pharmacodynamic evidence suggests that at least 1 of the selective COX-2 inhibitors may slightly augment the pharmacodynamic effect of warfarin by increasing prothombin time, 14, 15 information on the clinical consequences of this combination of drug therapy is limited. 16 We conducted a population-based study of older adults to examine the association between the concomitant use of warfarin with these drugs and the risk of hospitalization for upper GI hemorrhage.

We studied elderly patients whose prescription records allowed us to define a period of uninterrupted warfarin use. This observation period began with the first prescription for warfarin after their 66th birthday and ended with hospital admission for upper GI hemorrhage, the end of the study period, the patient's death, or discontinuation of warfarin, whichever occurred first. of 86% for upper GI hemorrhage. 21 These specific dates were chosen because both celecoxib and rofecoxib were made available on the provincial formulary on April 17, 2000, and our hospital database, the CIHI DAD, was complete until March 31, 2001, at the time of the study. The date of admission for upper GI hemorrhage served as the index date for all analyses. To adjust for potential confounders we included several comorbidities in the analysis, as outlined in Table 1. We included hospitalizations for upper GI hemorrhage in the 3 years prior to the index date using the CIHI DAD.

### International consensus group issues recommendations for… [^114eLnGy]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

The guidelines include new recommendations, as well as updates to the 2002 guidelines from the British Society of Gastroenterology and the 2003 consensus guidelines from the Nonvariceal Upper GI Bleeding Consensus Conference Group. Predictors of increased risk of rebleeding include age older than 65 years; shock; poor overall health; comorbid illnesses; low initial hemoglobin levels; melena; transfusion requirement; fresh red blood on rectal examination, in the emesis, or in the nasogastric aspirate; sepsis; and elevated urea, creatinine, or serum transaminase levels. New recommendation: In patients receiving anticoagulants, correction of coagulopathy is recommended, but should not delay endoscopy. Available data suggest that it may not be necessary to delay endoscopy in patients with mild to moderate coagulopathy.

One study of patients undergoing endoscopy found no difference in rebleeding, surgery, mortality, or complication rates between patients receiving warfarin and those not receiving anticoagulants. New recommendation: Promotility agents should not be used routinely before endoscopy to increase the diagnostic yield. Although promotility agents may be useful in selected patients with suspected blood in the stomach, they are not recommended for routine use in patients with upper GI bleeding. Revised recommendation: Selected patients with acute ulcer bleeding who are at low risk of rebleeding on the basis of clinical and endoscopic criteria may be discharged promptly after endoscopy. One randomized controlled trial assessing the role of early discharge in low-risk patients found no difference in rates of recurrent bleeding.

None of the patients who were discharged early experienced serious adverse events, underwent surgery, or died during the 30-day follow-up. Revised recommendation: Pre-endoscopic proton pump inhibitor therapy may be considered to downstage the endoscopic lesion and decrease the need for endoscopic intervention, but should not delay endoscopy. PPI therapy may be useful, especially in patients suspected to have high-risk stigmata. However, it has not been shown to affect rebleeding, surgery, or mortality. Endoscopic Management Revised recommendation: Early endoscopy is recommended for most patients with acute upper GI bleeding. Early endoscopy has been shown to be safe and effective in all risk groups, although it may need to be delayed or deferred in certain high-risk patients, such as those with active acute coronary syndrome or suspected perforation.

Revised recommendation: The role of endoscopic therapy for ulcers with adherent clots is controversial. Intensive PPI therapy alone may be sufficient. Endoscopic therapy for adherent clots involves preinjecting with epinephrine before shaving, followed by applying combination treatment to the remaining stigmata of hemorrhage. A meta-analysis of five RCTs involving patients with adherent clots found no significant benefits for endoscopic therapy compared with no endoscopic therapy. Revised recommendation: Clips, thermocoagulation, or sclerosant injection should be used in patients with high-risk lesions, alone or in combination with epinephrine injection. Meta-analyses showed that adding a second procedure to epinephrine injection is superior to epinephrine injection alone.

### Risk of GI bleeding highest with rivaroxaban, lower with apixaban… [^114N4f2F]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Which oral anticoagulants have the highest risk of causing upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding, and does cotherapy with a proton pump inhibitor lower that risk. Bottom Line Among patients using oral anticoagulants alone, the risk of hospitalization for upper GI tract bleeding is highest with rivaroxaban and lowest with apixaban. Cotherapy with a PPI reduces the risk among patients using any oral anticoagulant. Synopsis The risk of serious upper GI tract bleeding associated with individual anticoagulant drug choice is uncertain. These investigators analyzed the U. S. Medicare beneficiary files of patients 30 years or older who initiated oral anticoagulation treatment with apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or warfarin.

The primary outcome of interest was hospitalization for upper GI tract bleeding that is potentially preventable by PPI cotherapy, including esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastritis. Multiple analyses occurred to control for covariates, including cardiovascular disease, low-dose aspirin prophylaxis, frailty, alcohol abuse, liver disease, history of previous upper GI tract bleeding, current use of other medications that affect bleeding risk, and age and other demographic factors. A total of 1, 643, 123 patients had 1, 713, 183 new episodes of oral anticoagulant treatment from January 1, 2011, through September 30, 2015. The mean age of the patients was
76. 4 years and the indication for anticoagulation was atrial fibrillation for 74. 9% of them.

In patients receiving anticoagulant treatment without PPI cotherapy, the adjusted incidence of hospitalization for upper GI tract bleeding was significantly higher in those who received rivaroxaban compared with those who received dabigatran, warfarin, or apixaban. For patients receiving anticoagulant treatment with PPI cotherapy, the adjusted incidence of severe upper GI tract bleeding was lower than for patients not receiving cotherapy for all anticoagulants, although still significantly highest with rivaroxaban.
