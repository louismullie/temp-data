## Question

Cerebral edema treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cerebral edema treatment, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and classification of cerebral edema. Then, I should verify the overarching goals of therapy and the strength of evidence. Next, I will examine first-line hyperosmolar therapy, including hypertonic saline versus mannitol, dosing strategies, and monitoring. After that, I need to check disease-specific nuances for TBI, AIS, ICH, SAH, bacterial/TB meningitis, hepatic encephalopathy, and tumor-related edema. I will then review non-pharmacologic measures, including hyperventilation, CSF diversion, and decompressive surgery. Finally, I should consider emerging therapies, special populations, and synthesize a practical algorithm with safety checkpoints and outcome expectations [^113MSnHA] [^117VGETw].

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology and classification, because treatment hinges on mechanism. Cerebral edema reflects increased brain water content and can be cytotoxic (cellular swelling with intact BBB, e.g., ischemia), vasogenic (BBB disruption with extracellular fluid accumulation, e.g., tumor, hemorrhage), or interstitial (CSF transudation, e.g., hydrocephalus), and these categories often coexist in acute brain injury, which complicates therapy selection and timing [^114rMPjA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about outcomes. I need to ensure the therapeutic goals are explicit and evidence-aligned. The immediate objective is to reduce intracranial pressure and mitigate mass effect to preserve cerebral perfusion and prevent herniation, but I should double-check whether lowering ICP translates into improved neurological outcomes; the literature consistently shows that while hyperosmolar therapy reduces ICP, it does not reliably improve long-term outcomes, underscoring the need for comprehensive neurocritical care and individualized decisions [^117VGETw] [^111MPf2F].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacologic therapy. Hyperosmolar agents remain the cornerstone, with hypertonic saline generally favored over mannitol across TBI, ICH, AIS, SAH, and hepatic encephalopathy, albeit with low to very low quality evidence and conditional recommendations; the rationale includes faster, more sustained ICP reduction and hemodynamic neutrality or benefit with HTS, but I must acknowledge that outcome data are lacking and that mannitol remains an acceptable alternative in many settings [^1136VtEG] [^113phSAH].

> Wait, let me verify dosing strategies because practice varies widely. For hypertonic saline, both symptom-based boluses and targeted sodium strategies are used; in SAH, symptom-based boluses are suggested over sodium-targeted infusions, whereas in ICH either approach is reasonable, and overall there is insufficient evidence that continuous infusions targeting a specific sodium improve outcomes compared with boluses; I should confirm that we avoid hyponatremia and monitor sodium and chloride closely to mitigate AKI risk [^116syFye] [^115qQhBr] [^114bQtSw] [^111zRXnT] [^1162RRou].

> I will now examine traumatic brain injury specifics. The Brain Trauma Foundation recommends treating ICP greater than 22 mmHg, and the NCS suggests HTS over mannitol for initial ICP control, while cautioning that neither agent improves neurological outcomes; mannitol remains an alternative when HTS is contraindicated, and prehospital use of either agent to improve outcomes is not recommended; I should double-check that mannitol is reserved for monitored settings with attention to hemodynamics and osmolar gaps [^114KEs3K] [^1136VtEG] [^115zAVat] [^113Nq7Hg] [^1142ZDhd].

> Let me consider acute ischemic stroke next. Both HTS and mannitol can acutely reduce ICP, but prophylactic scheduled mannitol should be avoided due to potential harm; if mannitol fails, HTS may still be effective as rescue, and brief moderate hyperventilation can be used as a bridge; I need to ensure we do not use corticosteroids or barbiturates for ischemic edema, and I should confirm that decompressive craniectomy is the only intervention with robust mortality benefit in malignant MCA infarction, albeit with uncertain disability trade-offs [^112J8ZEm] [^1114g7bA] [^111BK9b7] [^112eBKWj] [^116koRxV].

> For intracerebral hemorrhage, I should confirm that HTS is favored over mannitol for ICP control, while corticosteroids are contraindicated due to increased mortality and infections; either symptom-based boluses or targeted sodium strategies are acceptable for HTS administration, but I need to remember that the evidence quality is very low and that hematoma expansion risks with mannitol have been reported in some studies, which informed the cautious stance [^113phSAH] [^112RZpxV] [^1116Hfdf] [^112gh6PD].

> Now, subarachnoid hemorrhage. I should double-check that symptom-based bolus dosing of HTS is preferred over sodium-targeted infusions for ICP or edema management, and I must be careful not to overcorrect sodium rapidly given risks of osmotic demyelination in vulnerable patients; the panel emphasizes the lack of outcome benefit despite ICP reductions, so expectations should be tempered [^116syFye] [^114L6Q1Z] [^117GaCMu].

> For hepatic encephalopathy, let me verify that either HTS or mannitol can be used for ICP control, with limited comparative data; small studies suggest HTS may reduce brain water and ICP, but evidence is sparse, so patient-specific factors and close monitoring are essential, and I should avoid overpromising outcome benefits [^114P1kZt] [^114A4xZY] [^115zHSAX].

> Turning to infectious etiologies, I need to ensure I distinguish bacterial from TB meningitis. In community-acquired bacterial meningitis, dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 6 hours for 4 days, ideally before or with the first antibiotic dose, reduces neurological sequelae, whereas in TB meningitis, corticosteroids reduce mortality though optimal agent and duration vary; for cryptococcal meningitis with elevated ICP, aggressive CSF drainage is foundational and corticosteroids may be considered for mass effect, but I should confirm that steroid use is adjunctive and tailored to severity [^116cNMBA] [^114zNVe7] [^115Xdq3x] [^116qnFMF] [^1177CLr1].

> For tumor-related vasogenic edema, I should confirm that corticosteroids remain first-line to reduce peritumoral edema and symptoms, with anti-VEGF agents like bevacizumab as steroid-sparing options in select cases; mechanistically, VEGF-driven permeability underlies much of this edema, and restoring vascular integrity can meaningfully reduce steroid burden and improve quality of life in appropriate oncologic contexts [^111g3YMy].

> Next, I should review non-pharmacologic measures. Brief hyperventilation to a PaCO2 of 30–34 mmHg is reasonable as a bridge to definitive therapy, but prolonged use risks cerebral ischemia and should be avoided; CSF diversion via EVD can acutely lower ICP, with continuous drainage favored over intermittent; decompressive craniectomy reduces mortality in malignant MCA infarction and can be life-saving in selected TBI or cerebellar stroke, but timing and patient selection are critical and disability trade-offs must be discussed [^111BK9b7] [^116jhr8p] [^113pdjx9] [^116koRxV] [^112qFZsh].

> But wait, what about emerging therapies. I should double-check that NKCC1 inhibitors like bumetanide and SUR1-TRPM4 channel blockers like glyburide are mechanistically promising and in clinical development, while vasopressin antagonists such as conivaptan may help in euvolemic hyponatremia–related edema; sustained hypernatremia strategies remain investigational and should not be routine outside trials, and I must be cautious about off-label extrapolation [^111WidRr] [^112G77H3].

> I need to ensure special populations are addressed. In pediatrics, large observational comparative effectiveness data support HTS as first-line for pediatric TBI, aligning with guideline trends; in DKA, prevention hinges on judicious fluid and insulin protocols and early recognition of headache or altered mental status; in high-altitude cerebral edema, descent and oxygen are primary, with adjuncts per wilderness medicine guidance; and in severe hyponatremia, controlled correction with close monitoring mitigates both cerebral edema and osmotic demyelination risks [^111Z1zSr] [^117Q57Pn] [^117GvnJJ] [^111V9Y4A].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm while keeping the evidence limitations front and center. First, stabilize ABCs, elevate the head of bed, avoid hypotension and hyponatremia, and obtain urgent neuroimaging; second, initiate hyperosmolar therapy with HTS as preferred or mannitol as an alternative, using bolus dosing tailored to symptoms and ICP, with sodium targets considered only when clinically justified; third, add non-pharmacologic measures such as brief hyperventilation, CSF drainage, and decompressive surgery for refractory cases; fourth, layer disease-specific therapies such as corticosteroids for bacterial or TB meningitis and anti-VEGF agents for tumor edema; finally, monitor sodium, chloride, osmolarity, renal function, and neurologic status closely, and set expectations that ICP control does not guarantee improved long-term outcomes [^117VGETw] [^1162RRou] [^111zRXnT].

> Hold on, I should verify key safety checkpoints to avoid preventable harm. Avoid rapid sodium overcorrection in chronic hyponatremia, monitor for hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and AKI with hyperosmolar therapy, reassess the need for ongoing osmotherapy to limit rebound or tachyphylaxis, and escalate to surgical decompression when medical measures fail in malignant edema, documenting goals-of-care discussions given potential disability trade-offs [^1162RRou] [^116koRxV].

> In conclusion, I need to emphasize that current evidence supports hyperosmolar therapy as effective for ICP control across etiologies, but does not demonstrate improved neurological outcomes; therefore, treatment must be individualized by mechanism and context, with vigilant monitoring, explicit outcome expectations, and readiness to escalate to surgical options when indicated, all while maintaining a high index of caution regarding adverse effects and the limits of available data [^117VGETw] [^111MPf2F].

Cerebral edema management centers on **hyperosmolar therapy** (hypertonic saline preferred over mannitol) [^1136VtEG] [^114Pyn2x] and **ICP control** with head elevation, analgesia, and sedation [^116g8AHx] [^112AFNXP]. Corticosteroids are reserved for **vasogenic edema** (e.g. tumors, infection) [^116cNMBA] and are not used for cytotoxic edema from ischemia or trauma [^112eBKWj] [^112B9pXE]. Non-pharmacologic options include brief hyperventilation [^111BK9b7], CSF drainage [^116jhr8p], and decompressive craniectomy for refractory cases [^116koRxV]. Therapy should be **individualized** by etiology, with close monitoring of sodium, osmolarity, and renal function to avoid complications [^1162RRou] [^115PuJDW].

## Pharmacological interventions

### Hyperosmolar therapy

Hyperosmolar agents reduce brain water and lower ICP via osmotic effects [^112G77H3]; **hypertonic saline (HTS)** is preferred over mannitol in most neurocritical care settings [^notfound].

| **Attribute** | **Hypertonic saline (hts)** | **Mannitol** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Osmotic draw of water; expands plasma volume; improves CPP | Osmotic diuresis; reduces blood viscosity |
| Preferred use | - TBI <br/> - ICH <br/> - AIS <br/> - SAH <br/> - Hepatic encephalopathy | Alternative when HTS is contraindicated or unavailable |
| Advantages | - Faster, more sustained ICP reduction <br/> - Less rebound edema <br/> - Hemodynamic stability | Useful when HTS is contraindicated (e.g. hypernatremia) |
| Adverse effects | - Hypernatremia <br/> - Hyperchloremic acidosis <br/> - AKI <br/> - Coagulopathy | - Hypotension <br/> - Electrolyte disturbances <br/> - Rebound edema <br/> - Nephrotoxicity |

---

HTS is typically administered as **3% saline** in 100–250 mL boluses or continuous infusion to a serum sodium of 145–155 mEq/L; **mannitol** is given as 0.5–1 g/kg boluses, with serum osmolarity maintained below 320 mOsm/L [^1173ADiC] [^1162RRou].

---

### Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids reduce vasogenic edema via anti-inflammatory effects; **indications** include tumor-associated edema and infection-related vasogenic edema (e.g. bacterial/TB meningitis) [^116cNMBA] [^114zNVe7]. Dexamethasone is the **agent of choice** (10 mg IV every 6 hours for 4 days in bacterial meningitis) [^116cNMBA]. Corticosteroids are not recommended for cytotoxic edema from ischemic stroke or TBI due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^112eBKWj] [^112B9pXE].

---

### Barbiturates

High-dose barbiturates (e.g. pentobarbital) are reserved for **refractory intracranial hypertension** unresponsive to maximal medical and surgical therapy; they lower cerebral metabolic demand and ICP but carry risks of hypotension and immunosuppression [^115BSrHs].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

### Head positioning and basic measures

Elevating the head of bed to 30 degrees improves venous return and reduces ICP; **basic measures** also include maintaining neutral head/neck alignment, adequate analgesia, and sedation to prevent ICP spikes from agitation or pain [^116g8AHx].

---

### Hyperventilation

Brief, moderate hyperventilation (PaCO2 30–34 mmHg) provides **short-term ICP reduction** as a bridge to definitive therapy; prolonged use risks cerebral ischemia and should be avoided [^111BK9b7].

---

### Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage

External ventricular drainage (EVD) is effective for **ICP control**, particularly in communicating hydrocephalus or when CSF dynamics are impaired; continuous drainage is preferred over intermittent [^113pdjx9].

---

### Decompressive craniectomy

Decompressive craniectomy is indicated for **refractory intracranial hypertension** from malignant cerebral edema due to large hemispheric infarction or severe TBI; it reduces mortality but may leave patients with significant disability [^116koRxV] [^112qFZsh].

---

## Monitoring and complications

- **ICP monitoring**: Recommended for severe TBI, malignant cerebral edema, or refractory intracranial hypertension [^notfound].
- **Serum sodium and osmolarity**: Monitor closely during hyperosmolar therapy to avoid hypernatremia, osmotic demyelination, or renal injury [^1162RRou].
- **Renal function**: Hyperosmolar therapy can cause AKI; monitor renal function and adjust therapy accordingly [^1162RRou].

---

## Emerging therapies

- **NKCC1 inhibitors**: Bumetanide is under investigation for cytotoxic edema in ischemic stroke and TBI [^notfound].
- **SUR1-TRPM4 channel inhibitors**: Glibenclamide is being studied for edema in ischemic stroke and TBI [^notfound].
- **Anti-VEGF agents**: Bevacizumab reduces vasogenic edema in tumors and is under study for other indications [^notfound].

---

Cerebral edema management requires a **multimodal, etiology-specific approach** that balances rapid ICP control with the risks of hyperosmolar therapy, sedation, and surgery. Hypertonic saline is **first-line** for most causes, with mannitol as an alternative; corticosteroids are reserved for vasogenic edema, and decompressive surgery is considered for refractory cases. Close monitoring and individualized care are essential to optimize outcomes and minimize complications [^117VGETw].

### The medical management of cerebral edema: past, present, and future therapies [^112AFNXP]. Neurotherapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Cerebral edema is commonly associated with cerebral pathology, and the clinical manifestation is largely related to the underlying lesioned tissue. Brain edema usually amplifies the dysfunction of the lesioned tissue and the burden of cerebral edema correlates with increased morbidity and mortality across diseases. Our modern-day approach to the medical management of cerebral edema has largely revolved around, an increasingly artificial distinction between cytotoxic and vasogenic cerebral edema. These nontargeted interventions such as hyperosmolar agents and sedation have been the mainstay in clinical practice and offer noneloquent solutions to a dire problem. Our current understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms driving cerebral edema is becoming much more advanced, with differences being identified across diseases and populations. As our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms in neuronal injury continues to expand, so too is the list of targeted therapies in the pipeline. Here we present a brief review of the molecular mechanisms driving cerebral edema and a current overview of our understanding of the molecular targets being investigated.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^111MPf2F]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The various treatments for ICP or cerebral edema reviewed in this guideline are used in patients with critical intracranial pathologies worldwide. Despite their ubiquity, the overall quality of the literature in this area is low and there is a paucity of rigorous prospective trials. The strength of the panel's recommendations was frequently downgraded due to the limited evidence available comparing the different treatments. The concepts of hyperosmotic therapy have been entrenched in the critical care management of patients with neurological injuries for years, yet there is limited evidence to guide clinicians on the optimal practical use of mannitol or hypertonic saline. There is a dire need for high-quality research to better inform clinicians of the best options for the individualized care of patients with cerebral edema. The goals of research activities in this area should address specific questions, adequately reflect the scope of planned patient enrollment, and select reasonable outcome measures. Basic criteria of research efforts should include a definition of how cerebral edema is being measured, the specific purpose of any intervention (e.g. resuscitation, management of ICP, effect on physiological parameters), and what outcome measures will be assessed. In addition, research efforts should consider and report on the osmolar equivalents of agents used in the management of cerebral edema, assess the effects of specific ranges of sodium levels on markers of edema, evaluate the best duration of therapy, standardize and report basic care protocols, and consider the impact of all pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on designated outcomes. Finally, while the goal of all interventions in the management of neurological injuries is to improve survival and minimize disability, it must be acknowledged that a single intervention to address a specific physiological variable may have limited impact on the multiple factors that contribute to both short- and long-term outcomes.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^116syFye]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The panel used the GRADE methodology to evaluate the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. These designations denote the degree of certainty that the estimate of effect in each study approximates the true effect. Recommendations generated from this literature review and the subsequent quality of evidence rating accounted for efficacy, risks, potential sources of bias, and treatment effect. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool was used to evaluate bias in sequence generation, allocation, blinding, missing outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. The panel classified recommendations as strong ("We recommend") when they are the preferred treatment for most patients and should be adopted as policy in the majority of situations. Conditional recommendations ("We suggest", "Clinicians should consider") should be further considered based upon the clinical scenario and carefully evaluated by stakeholders before being implemented as policy. Areas where there is insufficient evidence to support recommendations are identified, and, in some instances, "good practice statements" are provided. These statements are meant to state guidance where there may be a lack of published evidence, but the practice is commonly accepted as beneficial.

The panel met in person on September 26–27, 2018, in Boca Raton, FL, and again on January 17–18, 2019, in Chicago, IL. Other meetings were virtual. Members assigned to specific PICO questions presented a summary of the GRADE evidence on each topic, and recommendations were discussed, revised, and validated by the entire panel. Internal experts within the Neurocritical Care Society and external stakeholders reviewed the final guideline.

Treatment of Cerebral Edema in Patients with Subarachnoid Hemorrhage

In patients with SAH, does sodium target-based dosing with hypertonic sodium solutions (sodium chloride, lactate, or bicarbonate) improve ICP/cerebral edema compared to intermittent, symptom-based bolus doses of hypertonic sodium solutions?
In patients with SAH, does sodium target-based dosing with hypertonic sodium solutions (sodium chloride, lactate, or bicarbonate) improve neurological outcomes at discharge compared to intermittent, symptom-based bolus doses of hypertonic sodium solutions?

Recommendations

We suggest using symptom-based bolus dosing of hypertonic sodium solutions rather than sodium target-based dosing for the management of ICP or cerebral edema in patients with SAH (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^1153ZTfE]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Neurocritical Care Society cerebral edema guideline — methods and evidence selection notes that the work was commissioned and approved by the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS) Board of Directors; the NCS Guidelines Committee tasked two Chairs (AC, LS) to form a panel including a GRADE methodologist, and beginning in October 2017 the panel drafted sixteen questions using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and PICO. The literature search used Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and EMBASE from inception (1947) to July 5, 2018, with additional identification from bibliographies and a supplementary PubMed search up to February 2019. The search excluded articles not available in English, pediatric studies, animal studies, and unpublished works; included designs were systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized, controlled trials, observational studies, and case series of five or more patients. Studies with mixed populations were included if the population relevant to the specific PICO question had a sample size of five or more; meta-analyses were included only if their patients were representative of the neurocritical care population in the specific PICO question, and if multiple populations were included, results were only included if differentiated by neurological injury.

Introduction

Cerebral edema is a non-specific pathological swelling of the brain that may develop in a focal or diffuse pattern after any type of neurological injury. The underlying cause of this brain swelling is highly variable and relates to multiple physiological cellular changes. The simplest description of cerebral edema is an accumulation of excessive fluid within either brain cells or extracellular spaces. Cerebral edema can be secondary to disruption of the blood brain barrier, local inflammation, vascular changes, or altered cellular metabolism. The identification and treatment of cerebral edema is central to the management of critical intracranial pathologies. Measurement of cerebral edema is indirect and generally relies on surrogate markers seen on imaging studies, such as tissue shifts or structural changes, or via intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring devices. It is considered one of the more common contributors to elevated ICP, which has been identified as a predictor of poor outcome in patients with TBI, stroke, and other intracranial pathologies. The literature describes multiple treatment modalities including hyperosmolar therapy, acute hyperventilation, temperature modulation, diversion of CSF, surgical decompression, and metabolic suppression. These treatments are often administered without consideration of the underlying disease process, when in fact their efficacy may hinge upon the pathophysiology at hand. Recent guidelines for the management of AIS, ICH, and TBI, among others, discuss the treatment of cerebral edema. However, practical recommendations regarding the selection and monitoring of therapies for optimal efficacy and safety are generally lacking.

This guideline primarily evaluates the role of hyperosmolar agents (mannitol, HTS), corticosteroids, and selected non-pharmacologic therapies in the acute treatment of cerebral edema; strategies used for refractory cerebral edema or increased ICP (e.g. barbiturates, therapeutic hypothermia) are not highlighted. The term cerebral edema was used preferentially as a representative term encompassing elevated intracranial pressure, brain swelling, herniation syndromes, and cerebral edema (intracranial pressure may not be known in many patients, but symptoms of this intracranial abnormality may be present). In references where intracranial pressure was specifically evaluated, the results are stated as such. It should be emphasized that the recommendations in this guideline are based on available medical literature, which may not reflect all aspects of clinical expertise and practical experience.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^1164USip]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute treatment of cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure is a common issue in patients with neurological injury. Practical recommendations regarding selection and monitoring of therapies for initial management of cerebral edema for optimal efficacy and safety are generally lacking. This guideline evaluates the role of hyperosmolar agents (mannitol, HTS), corticosteroids, and selected non-pharmacologic therapies in the acute treatment of cerebral edema. Clinicians must be able to select appropriate therapies for initial cerebral edema management based on available evidence while balancing efficacy and safety.

Methods

The Neurocritical Care Society recruited experts in neurocritical care, nursing, and pharmacy to create a panel in 2017. The group generated 16 clinical questions related to initial management of cerebral edema in various neurological insults using the PICO format. A research librarian executed a comprehensive literature search through July 2018. The panel screened the identified articles for inclusion related to each specific PICO question and abstracted necessary information for pertinent publications. The panel used GRADE methodology to categorize the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low based on their confidence that the findings of each publication approximate the true effect of the therapy.

Results

The panel generated recommendations regarding initial management of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, bacterial meningitis, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Conclusion

The available evidence suggests hyperosmolar therapy may be helpful in reducing ICP elevations or cerebral edema in patients with SAH, TBI, AIS, ICH, and HE, although neurological outcomes do not appear to be affected. Corticosteroids appear to be helpful in reducing cerebral edema in patients with bacterial meningitis, but not ICH. Differences in therapeutic response and safety may exist between HTS and mannitol. The use of these agents in these critical clinical situations merits close monitoring for adverse effects. There is a dire need for high-quality research to better inform clinicians of the best options for individualized care of patients with cerebral edema.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^117VGETw]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Neurocritical Care Society guideline — acute treatment of cerebral edema states that the available evidence suggests hyperosmolar therapy may be helpful in reducing intracranial pressure (ICP) elevations or cerebral edema in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), traumatic brain injury (TBI), acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and hepatic encephalopathy (HE), although neurological outcomes do not appear to be affected; corticosteroids appear to be helpful in reducing cerebral edema in patients with bacterial meningitis, but not ICH, and differences in therapeutic response and safety may exist between hypertonic saline (HTS) and mannitol, and the use of these agents in these critical clinical situations merits close monitoring for adverse effects. The panel generated recommendations regarding initial management of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, bacterial meningitis, and hepatic encephalopathy, and there is a dire need for high-quality research to better inform clinicians of the best options for individualized care of patients with cerebral edema.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^116jhr8p]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Neurocritical care cerebral edema — non-pharmacologic management recommendations: We recommend that brief episodes of hyperventilation can be used for patients with acute elevations in intracranial pressure (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). We suggest that the use of CSF diversion be considered as a beneficial adjunct to reduce intracranial pressure (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Clinicians should be mindful of the limitations of acute hyperventilation related to cerebral blood flow and the extent of PaCO2, reduction and clinicians should also maintain careful awareness of the duration of therapy to avoid deleterious changes in cerebral perfusion. Clinicians should assess the risks and benefits of CSF diversion using patient-specific factors. While non-pharmacological interventions may be effective for acute elevations in intracranial pressure, there is insufficient evidence that non-pharmacological interventions are effective for the treatment of any specific physiological changes that produce brain swelling related to cerebral edema. It must be noted that these non-pharmacological interventions decrease ICP through mechanical or structural changes without actually having any impact on cerebral edema and brain swelling. Other non-pharmacologic therapies such as surgical decompression and therapeutic hypothermia were not included, as they are adequately addressed by other guidelines, and the overall quality of evidence was very low.

### How can cerebral edema during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis be avoided? [^117Q57Pn]. Pediatric Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Cerebral edema during diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a rare complication but it can be devastating, with significant mortality and long-term morbidity. Certain risk factors have been teased out with some large case-control studies, but more research needs to be done to make management guidelines safer. This article will discuss how DKA might be prevented from occurring in the first instance, known risk factors for cerebral edema, fluid and insulin management, the importance of careful monitoring during DKA treatment, and the importance of recognizing and acting on the earliest symptoms to prevent long-term harm.

### Medical management of cerebral edema [^116g8AHx]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Cerebral edema is frequently encountered in clinical practice in critically ill patients with acute brain injury from diverse origins and is a major cause of increased morbidity and death in this subset of patients. The consequences of cerebral edema can be lethal and include cerebral ischemia from compromised regional or global cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracranial compartmental shifts due to intracranial pressure gradients that result in compression of vital brain structures. The overall goal of medical management of cerebral edema is to maintain regional and global CBF to meet the metabolic requirements of the brain and prevent secondary neuronal injury from cerebral ischemia. Medical management of cerebral edema involves using a systematic and algorithmic approach, from general measures (optimal head and neck positioning for facilitating intracranial venous outflow, avoidance of dehydration and systemic hypotension, and maintenance of normothermia) to specific therapeutic interventions (controlled hyperventilation, administration of corticosteroids and diuretics, osmotherapy, and pharmacological cerebral metabolic suppression). This article reviews and highlights the medical management of cerebral edema based on pathophysiological principles in acute brain injury.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^114Pyn2x]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

While the overall quality of the evidence in this area is very low, the panel felt there was enough consistency across the published studies to suggest symptom-based bolus dosing of HTS as an effective means of reducing ICP and cerebral edema in patients with SAH. In addition, HTS bolus administration may also raise serum sodium, improve brain pH, and increase brain tissue oxygenation. At present, there are insufficient data to support the use of HTS to improve neurological outcome, regardless of the administration strategy. We did not identify any substantial evidence to support targeting a specific serum sodium concentration in order to reduce ICP or improve neurological outcome in patients with SAH, demonstrating the need for future research regarding the impact of specific sodium targets on ICP and neurological outcomes.

Treatment of Cerebral Edema in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury

In patients with TBI, does the use of hypertonic sodium solutions improve cerebral edema compared to mannitol?
In patients with TBI, does the use of hypertonic sodium solutions for cerebral edema improve neurological outcomes compared to mannitol?

Recommendations

We suggest using hypertonic sodium solutions over mannitol for the initial management of elevated ICP or cerebral edema in patients with TBI (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest that neither HTS nor mannitol be used with the expectation for improving neurological outcomes in patients with TBI (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel felt that while the quality of evidence was low, the consistency of the literature suggested HTS was at least as safe and effective as mannitol. In addition, the panel agreed that the putative advantages of HTS over mannitol for fluid resuscitation and cerebral perfusion justified the suggestion to use HTS over mannitol. Although treatment effect of these agents on elevated ICP or cerebral edema may be expected based on the literature, neither agent has been demonstrated to improve neurological outcomes.
2 We suggest that the use of mannitol is an effective alternative in patients with TBI unable to receive hypertonic sodium solutions (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

Rationale:

Although HTS was recommended over mannitol, the quality of evidence was low and the literature consistently suggests that mannitol is also a safe and effective option for the initial management of elevated ICP or cerebral edema in patients with TBI, particularly those with concomitant severe hypernatremia or volume overload.
3 We recommend against the use of hypertonic sodium solutions in the pre-hospital setting to specifically improve neurological outcomes for patients with TBI (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^113YJVEQ]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

This work was commissioned and approved by the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS) Board of Directors. The NCS Guidelines Committee tasked two Chairs (AC, LS) to form a panel of experts in neurocritical care, pharmacotherapy, and nursing to execute the guideline. A GRADE methodologist was also included in the panel. Beginning in October 2017, the panel drafted sixteen questions relevant to the treatment and monitoring of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework (Table 1). Questions were drafted using the PICO format and aligned with specific neurocritical care populations (e.g. TBI) so as to render recommendations relevant to underlying pathologies and not the neurocritical care population as a whole. Individual outcomes of interest related to cerebral edema, ICP, neurological status, or other evaluated parameters are listed on the applicable tables that are included as electronic supplementary material. Of note, the response of intracranial pressure or cerebral edema was separated from neurological outcomes such as modified Rankin Score or mortality as the authors were uncertain that treatment response of intracranial pressure or cerebral edema is directly related to neurological outcome. Interventions were specifically identified by name and formulation in most instances. In some PICO questions, various sodium salts with differing concentrations were evaluated. Throughout the document, "hypertonic saline" was referred to as "hypertonic sodium solutions" to account for the differences in sodium salt formulation. In cases where a specific sodium salt or concentration was evaluated, it was identified as stated in the study if the specific formulation was pertinent for the results.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to management of cerebral edema (general principles), AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that patients with large territorial cerebral and cerebellar infarctions are at high risk for developing brain swelling and herniation. Discuss care options and possible outcomes quickly with patients (if possible) and family or next of kin. Ensure that medical professionals and caregivers ascertain and include patient-centered preferences in shared decision-making, especially during prognosis formation and when considering interventions or limitations in care.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Surgical decompression for cerebral oedema in acute ischaemic stroke [^112vtcKk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The high mortality that follows a large cerebral infarction is in part due to brain oedema. Oedema causes mass-effect with raised intracranial pressure and herniation. Medical therapies are used to reduce intracranial pressure but outcome is poor in spite of treatment. Decompressive surgical techniques that attempt to relieve high intracranial pressure due to oedema have been described, but their efficacy in reducing case fatality and disability is uncertain.

Objectives

To compare medical therapy plus decompressive surgery with medical therapy alone on the outcomes death and 'death or dependency' in patients with an acute ischaemic stroke complicated by clinical and radiologically confirmed cerebral oedema.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (4 October 2001). In addition, we searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, issue 3, 2001), MEDLINE (1966 - April 2002), EMBASE (1980 - April 2002), and SCISEARCH (to April 2002). We also searched the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved and contacted individual investigators and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled studies comparing the outcome of treatment with decompressive surgical intervention with treatment not involving surgery. We aimed to include only those studies with low or moderate risk of bias.

Data Collection and Analysis

Titles retrieved by searching were assessed for relevance by one author. Data were extracted independently by two authors with discussion to resolve differences. Relevant sub-group analyses were planned and we planned to calculate Peto odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

Over 9000 citations were retrieved and inspected for relevance. We identified no randomised-controlled trials to include in a meta-analysis. Five observational studies reporting comparative data were found along with a number of small series and single case reports. Two ongoing randomised-controlled trials were identified.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no evidence from randomised-controlled trials to support the use of decompressive surgery for the treatment of cerebral oedema in acute ischaemic stroke. Evidence from randomised-controlled trials is needed to accurately assess the effect of decompressive surgery.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^113ciAaA]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

The pharmacologic treatment of cerebral edema should be guided whenever possible by the underlying pathology. The available evidence suggests hyperosmolar therapy may be helpful in reducing ICP elevations or cerebral edema in patients with SAH, TBI, AIS, ICH, and HE, although neurological outcomes do not appear to be affected. This finding is consistent with many other interventions used in the acute care of patients with neurological conditions in that treatments may affect an immediate abnormality, but outcomes are often influenced by multiple factors that may be beyond the awareness or control of the treating team (e.g. comorbidities, associated injuries, rehabilitation availability, etc.). Corticosteroids appear to be helpful in reducing cerebral edema in patients with bacterial meningitis, but not ICH. Differences in therapeutic response and safety may exist between HTS and mannitol. The use of these agents in these critical clinical situations merits close monitoring for adverse effects.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^1142ZDhd]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale:

Acute treatment of cerebral edema and herniation syndromes is often necessary in the pre-hospital setting. However, well-designed clinical trials did not suggest any benefit from the use of HTS in the pre-hospital setting on long-term outcomes in patients with TBI.
4 We suggest against the use of mannitol in the pre-hospital setting to improve neurological outcomes for patients with TBI (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel felt that the quality of evidence was very low and did not suggest any potential benefit in the pre-hospital setting on long-term outcomes in patients with TBI.

The panel evaluated several studies to inform recommendations on the use of HTS and/or mannitol to improve ICP, cerebral edema, or neurological outcomes (Table 1, Questions 3 and 4). These two agents have been compared in at least eight randomized, controlled trials of patients with elevated ICP from a variety of causes, including TBI. A number of uncontrolled, retrospective, and non-comparative studies have also evaluated either HTS or mannitol in patients with TBI. These studies all support the notion that both hyperosmolar therapies effectively reduce ICP (Table 3). The available data are limited by patient heterogeneity, low sample size, and inconsistent methods among studies. For example, several studies utilized a crossover study design where patients served as their own control, sequentially receiving HTS and then mannitol or vice versa, whereas others randomized patients to receive one agent or the other. In addition, several of the early studies evaluating HTS used a combination product which included HES. The overall quality of evidence was low (Evidentiary Table 2 of Electronic Supplementary Material).

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^112M61TC]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Neurocritical care cerebral edema guideline — scope and terminology clarifies that measurement of cerebral edema is indirect and generally relies on imaging surrogates or intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring devices, and the term cerebral edema was used as a representative construct encompassing elevated intracranial pressure, brain swelling, herniation syndromes, and cerebral edema; when intracranial pressure was specifically evaluated, results are stated as such. Outcomes for intracranial pressure or cerebral edema were separated from neurological outcomes because the authors were uncertain that treatment response of intracranial pressure or cerebral edema is directly related to neurological outcome. In some PICO questions, various sodium salts with differing concentrations were evaluated, and throughout the document "hypertonic saline" was referred to as "hypertonic sodium solutions"; when a specific sodium salt or concentration was evaluated, it was identified as stated in the study if formulation was pertinent. Strategies used for refractory cerebral edema or increased ICP (e.g., barbiturates, therapeutic hypothermia) are not highlighted.

### Brain edema after intracerebral hemorrhage: mechanisms, treatment options, management strategies, and operative indications [^113Xsbyv]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with a high mortality rate and severe morbidity. The treatment of choice is still controversial, given that data from several clinical trials have not provided convincing evidence to support the efficacy of surgical clot removal. Favoring early clot removal is evidence that the limited release of specific neurotoxins associated with the breakdown products of hemoglobin underlies secondary brain injury. Attention has therefore shifted to perilesional brain injury, especially brain edema, as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in patients with ICH. In this review the authors address current understanding of the causes of edema formation following ICH and the treatment options, which are mostly supportive in nature.

### Surgery for brain edema [^114heDQh]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Brain edema is a common pathophysiological process seen in many neurosurgical conditions. It can be localized in relation to focal lesions or generalized in diffuse types of brain injury. In addition to local adverse effects occurring at a cellular level, brain edema is associated with raised intracranial pressure (ICP), and both phenomena contribute to poor outcome in patients. One of the goals in treating patients with acute neurosurgical conditions in intensive care is to control brain edema and maintain ICP below target levels. The mainstay of treatment is medical therapy to reduce edema, but in certain patients — for example, those with diffuse severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and malignant middle cerebral artery infarction — such treatment is not effective. In these patients, opening the skull (decompressive craniectomy) to reduce ICP is a potential option. In this review the authors discuss the role of decompressive craniectomy as a surgical option in patients with brain edema in the context of a variety of pathological entities. They also address the current evidence for the technique (predominantly observational series) and the ongoing randomized studies of decompressive craniectomy in TBI and ischemic stroke.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^1114g7bA]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel felt that the quality of evidence was low and the literature in patients with AIS was not compelling to recommend one agent over the other for initial management of elevated ICP or cerebral edema. Patient-specific factors may be employed to aid clinicians in selecting the appropriate initial agent in patients with either measured elevated ICP or symptoms of cerebral edema.
2 We suggest that clinicians consider administration of hypertonic sodium solutions for management of ICP or cerebral edema in patients with acute ischemic stroke who do not have an adequate response to mannitol (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel felt that the quality of evidence was low, but the literature in patients with AIS suggested that patients who do not have an adequate treatment response to mannitol may still respond to HTS.
3 We suggest against the use of prophylactic scheduled mannitol in acute ischemic stroke due to the potential for harm (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel felt that while the quality of evidence was low, the lack of benefit and the potential association with worse neurological outcomes justified avoiding prophylactic mannitol in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

The panel evaluated whether the use of HTS or mannitol improves ICP, cerebral edema, or neurological outcomes in patients with AIS. The panel did not identify any RCTs that directly compared these agents in AIS using neurological outcomes as an endpoint. Therefore, we included observational studies that either compared mannitol or HTS with no hyperosmolar therapy or that reported on hyperosmolar therapy use without a control group (Table 1, Questions 5 and 6). The overall level of evidence was low (Table 4).

The panel identified 11 studies that evaluated hyperosmolar therapy for reducing ICP or cerebral edema in patients with AIS. Of these, three were prospective, randomized trials that compared mannitol directly with HTS. The remainder were prospective or retrospective cohort studies that evaluated one or both hyperosmolar therapies with or without a control group. The majority of these studies suggested that both HTS and mannitol were efficacious in reducing ICP in AIS, although some of these studies had a mixed patient population. In two prospective, randomized studies, the reduction in ICP from HTS was quicker, more pronounced, and more sustained compared to mannitol. In addition, two studies suggested that HTS may be effective even in patients in whom mannitol has failed.

### Pathophysiology and treatment of cerebral edema in traumatic brain injury [^114rMPjA]. Neuropharmacology (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cerebral edema:

- **Definition**: Cerebral edema is a disorder characterized by an increase in brain tissue water, including in individual cells and their surrounding tissues, with resultant intracranial hypertension.
- **Pathophysiology**: Cerebral edema can be broadly classified as cytotoxic edema (due to ischemic stroke), vasogenic edema (due to neoplasm, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis, or arterio-venous shuts), or interstitial edema (due to hydrocephalus).
- **Disease course**: Cerebral edema presents with manifestations of intracranial hypertension, irreversible brain injury, cerebral herniation, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Cerebral edema associated with mass lesions is associated with an estimated in-hospital mortality of > 60%. In the context of ischemic stroke, the development of cerebral edema is associated with mortality of > 50%.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^1116Hfdf]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The panel acknowledges that there are some commonly referenced articles reporting on the use of mannitol in patients with ICH that were not included in this guideline, as they did not address these specific PICO questions. Two recent publications, both of which demonstrated potential risk of hematoma expansion, were ultimately excluded from our assessment as the study outcomes did not directly address the PICO questions as written (though hematoma expansion is important clinically, the panel did not feel this variable was directly related to cerebral edema or ICP). However, the panel felt that their results may give providers some pause regarding the safety of mannitol in patients with ICH. Given these concerns, along with the lack of published articles assessing the impact of mannitol on short-term outcomes, the panel was unable to recommend use of mannitol in this population at this time.

While the overall quality of evidence in this area is very low, the panel felt there was enough consistency across published studies to suggest that HTS is effective in reducing ICP elevations and cerebral edema. In contrast, the available published studies on mannitol were not directly related to the PICO question and they implied harm; thus, the panel favored HTS over mannitol.

Recommendations for Corticosteroids in Patients with Intracerebral Hemorrhage

We recommend against the use of corticosteroids to improve neurological outcome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage due to the potential for increased mortality and infectious complications (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

The panel evaluated whether use of corticosteroids in patients with ICH impacts neurological outcome, including mortality or functional status at any designated time point. The panel included a Cochrane meta-analysis, two moderate- to high-quality studies, and several other lower-quality studies in their assessment (Table 1, Question 8). The overall quality of evidence was moderate (Table 6).

A 2005 Cochrane Review assessed the impact of corticosteroids on neurological outcome in patients with ICH compared to placebo or standard of care controls. The review found no evidence to support the routine use of corticosteroids in patients with primary ICH and highlighted a potential for harm in these patients. One prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (n = 93) of dexamethasone to placebo in patients with ICH was halted due to increased rates of infectious and diabetic complications, while another (n = 40) showed no difference in mortality or neurological outcomes. Sharafadinzadeh et al. published a placebo-controlled trial of 225 patients which found higher mortality in the dexamethasone group. Four other lower-quality studies all found no improvement in outcomes related to dexamethasone use, with two studies demonstrating increased mortality in the treatment group.

### Mechanisms of tumor-related brain edema [^111hRbCT]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Cerebral edema contributes strongly to symptoms associated with brain tumors. Although the introduction of corticosteroids has greatly simplified treatment of patients with newly diagnosed tumors, these drugs are associated with marked side effects during the long-term treatment that is often necessary in the recurrences. Therefore, a better understanding of mechanisms related to the evolution and clearance of tumor-related edema with the aid of modern imaging and molecular methodology is clearly necessary. Recently, researchers have focused on molecular mechanisms of edema development and have demonstrated alternative routes-such as the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors-to be explored for treating edema. In this review the author focuses on established and current concepts regarding the pathophysiology of cerebral edema and its treatment.

Recommendations for the Optimal Administration Method of Hypertonic Sodium Solution

In patients with cerebral edema, how does continuous infusion of hypertonic sodium solutions compare to bolus infusion of hypertonic sodium solutions in improving neurological outcomes?

There is insufficient evidence to support use of a continuous infusion of HTS targeting a serum sodium goal for the purpose of improving neurological outcomes.
Due to insufficient evidence, we cannot recommend a specific dosing strategy for HTS to improve neurological outcomes in patients with cerebral edema.
Clinicians should avoid hyponatremia in patients with severe neurological injury due to the risk of exacerbating cerebral edema (good practice statement).

The panel evaluated whether titrating a continuous infusion of HTS to a target serum sodium concentration compared to the use of bolus/symptom-based dosing resulted in improved neurological outcomes in patients with cerebral edema across a variety of neurocritical care conditions (Table 1, Question 15). Six publications have specifically addressed the issue of how HTS was administered to patients, but the panel only identified one that directly compared continuous infusion versus bolus administration for control of ICP that met the criteria for this PICO. The overall quality of evidence was very low (Table 13).

While the use of a continuous infusion of 3% NaCl is believed to be a common practice in neurocritical care, this strategy is not well studied. Maguigan et al. directly compared continuous versus bolus dose 3% NaCl for control of ICP elevations in a retrospective study of 162 patients with severe TBI to assess which method was the most effective. No significant difference was found in time to the goal osmolarity, although more patients receiving continuous 3% NaCl reached the goal serum osmolarity than patients receiving bolus dosing. There was no difference in ICP or mortality between the two groups.

Given the lack of evidence comparing these dosing strategies, it is not clear whether continuous or bolus dosing is preferable when targeting a goal serum sodium concentration. Additionally, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding the value of targeting a specific serum sodium concentration in patients with cerebral edema, if it is in fact efficacious. While this discussion focuses on increasing sodium concentrations to treat elevated ICP and cerebral edema, clinicians must maintain awareness of the risk and benefits of sudden sodium changes, particularly in patients with chronic hyponatremia).

A research librarian executed a comprehensive, independent literature search using Ovid Medline and EMBASE from inception (1947) to July 5, 2018. The searches were peer reviewed by a second librarian at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, ON. Additional articles were identified from the bibliographies of the publications included in the literature search, as well as a supplementary PubMed searches of publications and personal files of members of the panel up to February 2019 once data abstraction began. The literature search excluded articles that were not available in English, pediatric studies, animal studies, and unpublished works. The panel included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized, controlled trials, observational studies, and case series of five or more patients. Studies with prospectively collected data which were retrospectively evaluated were consistently considered retrospective observational studies in our quality of evidence assessment. Studies with mixed populations (e.g. SAH, TBI, and ICH) were included if the population relevant to the specific PICO question had a sample size of five or more. Meta-analyses were included only if their patients were representative of the population of neurocritical care patients identified in the specific PICO question. If the meta-analysis included a mixture of multiple populations, the results were only included if they were differentiated by neurological injury. All meta-analyses that were excluded due to an inability to differentiate results by specific neurological injury are listed as footnotes on the applicable evidentiary tables that are included as electronic supplementary material. A systematic review software was used for screening and abstraction of the available literature (DistillerSR, Evidence Partners, Ottawa, Canada). Initial article screening for inclusion criteria was performed by one individual reviewer. Once screened for inclusion, data abstraction from each of the pertinent articles was performed by a minimum of two panel members pertaining to each PICO question (Table 1).

Treatment of Cerebral Edema in Patients with Hepatic Encephalopathy

In patients with hepatic encephalopathy, does the use of hypertonic sodium solutions improve cerebral edema compared to mannitol?
In patients with hepatic encephalopathy, does the use of hyperosmolar therapy improve neurological outcomes at discharge compared to ammonia-lowering agents?

Recommendations

We suggest using either hypertonic sodium solutions or mannitol for the management of ICP or cerebral edema in patients with hepatic encephalopathy (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel felt that the quality of evidence was very low and the literature in patients with hepatic encephalopathy was not compelling to recommend one form hyperosmolar therapy over the other. Thus, either agent could be used and patient-specific factors may be employed to aid clinicians in selecting the appropriate initial agent.
2 There is insufficient evidence to determine whether either hyperosmolar therapy or ammonia-lowering therapy improves neurological outcomes in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.

The panel assessed whether the use of HTS reduced ICP or cerebral edema more effectively than mannitol in patients with HE (Table 1, Question 11). The panel identified five studies that evaluated either mannitol or HTS as monotherapy, but did not find any studies that directly compared the two agents. The overall quality of evidence was very low (Table 10).

Early studies evaluated various combinations of therapies (mannitol, dexamethasone) in patients with liver failure and elevated ICP. These studies were graded as low quality because they variably and inconsistently assessed the effect of mannitol on ICP. Nevertheless, the results suggested some benefits of mannitol in this context. One placebo-controlled study of 30 patients with acute liver failure and elevated ICP evaluated a 3% NaCl bolus to maintain a serum sodium of 145–155 mEq/L, which increased serum sodium and significantly decreased ICP compared to placebo. Retrospective analyses of patients with liver failure who received hyperosmolar therapy show conflicting results based on imaging: 23.4% NaCl reduced brain tissue volume (as measured by MRI or diffusion tensor imaging), whereas mannitol did not affect brain water or clinical status.

The evidence identified by the panel suggests that hyperosmolar therapy can effectively treat elevated ICP or cerebral edema in the setting of fulminant liver failure and HE; however, more research is needed to determine optimal treatment strategies. The availability of a well-designed prospective clinical trial comparing HTS and mannitol in this patient population would substantially change the strength of evidence in this area. In addition, a gap in the literature exists regarding the influence of ammonia-lowering therapy on ICP, cerebral edema, or neurological outcomes.

### Induced and sustained hypernatremia for the prevention and treatment of cerebral edema following brain injury [^112G77H3]. Neurocritical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Cerebral edema develops in response to and as a result of a variety of neurologic insults such as ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, and tumor. It deforms brain tissue, resulting in localized mass effect and increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) that are associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. When administered in bolus form, hyperosmolar agents such as mannitol and hypertonic saline have been shown to reduce total brain water content and decrease ICP, and are currently the mainstays of pharmacological treatment. However, surprisingly, little is known about the increasingly common clinical practice of inducing a state of sustained hypernatremia. Herein, we review the available studies employing sustained hyperosmolar therapy to induce hypernatremia for the prevention and/or treatment of cerebral edema. Insufficient evidence exists to recommend pharmacologic induction of hypernatremia as a treatment for cerebral edema. The strategy of vigilant avoidance of hyponatremia is currently a safer, potentially more efficacious paradigm.

### Novel treatment targets for cerebral edema [^111WidRr]. Neurotherapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Cerebral edema is a common finding in a variety of neurological conditions, including ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, ruptured cerebral aneurysm, and neoplasia. With the possible exception of neoplasia, most pathological processes leading to edema seem to share similar molecular mechanisms of edema formation. Challenges to brain-cell volume homeostasis can have dramatic consequences, given the fixed volume of the rigid skull and the effect of swelling on secondary neuronal injury. With even small changes in cellular and extracellular volume, cerebral edema can compromise regional or global cerebral blood flow and metabolism or result in compression of vital brain structures. Osmotherapy has been the mainstay of pharmacologic therapy and is typically administered as part of an escalating medical treatment algorithm that can include corticosteroids, diuretics, and pharmacological cerebral metabolic suppression. Novel treatment targets for cerebral edema include the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) co-transporter (NKCC1) and the SUR1-regulated NC(Ca-ATP) (SUR1/TRPM4) channel. These two ion channels have been demonstrated to be critical mediators of edema formation in brain-injured states. Their specific inhibitors, bumetanide and glibenclamide, respectively, are well-characterized Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs with excellent safety profiles. Directed inhibition of these ion transporters has the potential to reduce the development of cerebral edema and is currently being investigated in human clinical trials. Another class of treatment agents for cerebral edema is vasopressin receptor antagonists. Euvolemic hyponatremia is present in a myriad of neurological conditions resulting in cerebral edema. A specific antagonist of the vasopressin V1A- and V2-receptor, conivaptan, promotes water excretion while sparing electrolytes through a process known as aquaresis.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^111Jhk66]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel felt that while the quality of evidence was very low, the consistency of the literature suggested HTS was at least as safe and effective as mannitol. In addition, the panel agreed that the putative advantages of HTS over mannitol for fluid resuscitation and cerebral perfusion justified the suggestion to use HTS over mannitol.
2 We suggest that either symptom-based bolus dosing or using a targeted sodium concentration is appropriate hypertonic sodium solution administration strategy for the management of elevated ICP or cerebral edema in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel felt that the quality of evidence was very low and the literature in patients with ICH was not compelling to recommend one method of administration of HTS over the other for initial management of elevated ICP or cerebral edema. Patient-specific factors may be employed to aid clinicians in selecting the appropriate initial agent.

The panel evaluated the relative merits of HTS and mannitol in improving ICP, cerebral edema, or neurological outcomes in patients with ICH (Table 1, Question 7). The panel identified four studies examining HTS alone, one related to mannitol, and no studies comparing the two agents. The overall quality of evidence was very low (Table 5).

Three studies addressed the use of continuous infusion 3% NaCl adjusted to achieve a targeted sodium concentration of 145–155 mEq/L. Hauer et al. reported on a mixed neurocritical care patient population that included 120 patients with ICH. These patients received 3% NaCl infusions with a goal serum sodium of 145–155 mEq/L compared to a historical cohort, and the results are reported specific to patients with ICH. A prospective study of 26 ICH patients treated with 3% NaCl continuous infusion demonstrated a reduction in cerebral edema and number of ICP crises. Conversely, a retrospective cohort study with a subset of eight ICH patients who received 3% sodium acetate/chloride continuous infusion (with additional boluses as needed) found no differences in ICP or mass effect at 12 h. Data from the aforementioned Koenig study was included to address this PICO question as patients with ICH were included even though they could not be separated out from the other patient populations. The data from these studies are conflicting, and clinicians should weigh the risks and benefits of targeting a sodium concentration in the short-term management of ICP and cerebral edema in ICH patients.

### Cerebral edema monitoring and management strategies: results from an international practice survey [^112wzA6X]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cerebral edema is a common, potentially life-threatening complication in critically ill patients with acute brain injury. However, uncertainty remains regarding best monitoring and treatment strategies, which may result in wide practice variations.

Methods

A 20-question digital survey on monitoring and management practices was disseminated between July 2022 and May 2023 to clinicians who manage cerebral edema. The survey was promoted through email, social media, medical conferences, and the Neurocritical Care Society Web site. We used the χ² test, Fisher's exact test, analysis of variance, and logistic regression to report factors associated with practice variation, diagnostic monitoring methods, and therapeutic triggers based on practitioner and institutional characteristics.

Results

Of 321 participants from 160 institutions in 30 countries, 65% were from university-affiliated centers, 74% were attending physicians, 38% were woman, 38% had neurology training, and 55% were US-based. Eighty-four percent observed practice variations at their institutions, with "provider preference" being cited most (87%). Factors linked to variation included gender, experience, university affiliation, and practicing outside the United States. University affiliates tended to use more tests (median 3.87 vs. 3.43, p = 0.01) to monitor cerebral edema. Regarding management practices, 20% of respondents' preferred timing for decompressive hemicraniectomy was after 48 h, and 37% stated that radiographic findings only would be sufficient to trigger surgery. Fifty percent of respondents reported initiating osmotic therapy based on radiographic indications or prophylactically. There were no significant associations between management strategies and respondent or center characteristics. Twenty-seven percent of respondents indicated that they acquired neuroimaging at intervals of 24 h or less. Within this group, attending physicians were more likely to follow this practice (65.5% vs. 34.5%, p = 0.04).

Conclusions

Cerebral edema monitoring and management strategies vary. Features associated with practice variations include both practitioner and institutional characteristics. We provide a foundation for understanding practice patterns that is crucial for informing educational initiatives, standardizing guidelines, and conducting future trials.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^1162RRou]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel rated the quality of evidence as very low. The precise serum values associated with acute kidney injury varies across the literature. Clinicians should evaluate the appropriate sodium and chloride concentrations in individual patients based on renal function, acid–base balance, and the need for acute treatment for elevated ICP or cerebral edema.
2 Clinicians should routinely monitor both sodium and chloride serum concentrations to assess risk of AKI related to elevated concentrations (good practice statement).
3 Renal function should be monitored closely in patients receiving hypertonic sodium solutions due to the risk of AKI with hyperosmolar therapy (good practice statement).

Rationale:

In making these good practice statements on monitoring renal function, serum sodium, and serum chloride, the panel felt that the practice of routine monitoring for acute kidney injury was prudent given the potential risks of both HTS in this setting. Clinicians should use patient-specific factors to determine the frequency of monitoring with ranging from twice daily to every 2 h based on rapidity of change to interventions.

The panel evaluated the safety of HTS as it relates to the development of AKI and unwanted metabolic acidosis (Table 1, Question 14). Hypernatremia and hyperchloremia have both been linked to AKI and poor outcomes in a variety of critical care populations. A small number of publications directly compared serum sodium concentrations to serum chloride concentrations in terms of the risk of AKI. We identified six studies that evaluated the relationship between use of HTS, hypernatremia, and AKI. Varying concentrations of HTS, administration techniques, and serum sodium ranges (generally 155–160 mEq/L) have been described in the literature, which complicates interpretation. Also included in the panel's analysis were several studies that commented on the safety and/or side effects of hyperosmolar therapy in the neurocritical care setting but were not designed to specifically evaluate AKI. The panel defined outcomes of interest as any related to renal dysfunction or acid–base balance. The overall quality of evidence was very low (Table 12).

For CSF diversion, the panel "identified four studies evaluating the efficacy of CSF diversion in reducing ICP", and it "appeared to be effective at reducing the ICP in two separate prospective, observational cohort studies", with "a significant change in ICP immediately after drainage without a measurable improvement in other indices of cerebral perfusion". One study reported that "continuous CSF drainage results in a lower mean ICP and overall ICP burden compared to intermittent drainage".

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^116taJ1E]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The panel discussed at length the lack of high-quality evidence supporting preferential use of one hyperosmolar agent as first line treatment of elevated ICP in TBI. Several meta-analyses have reached conflicting conclusions; some found no difference in ICP-related outcomes in TBI patients, whereas others favored HTS. Differences in the statistical analysis across these meta-analyses may have accounted for the variance in results.

Some advantages of HTS over mannitol have been observed in direct comparison, crossover, and rescue therapy randomized studies. HTS may have a quicker onset of action, a more robust and durable ICP reduction, and may be advantageous in patients in whom mannitol failed. Hypertonic sodium solutions with either a chloride, lactate, or bicarbonate salt seem to all be effective. The panel felt that there was consistency across the numerous, lower-quality studies that HTS was more effective than mannitol for reducing ICP or cerebral edema in this population.

Several meta-analyses and RCTs have demonstrated no significant difference in neurological outcomes when comparing various hyperosmolar therapies. It is notable that two of the RCTs used equi-osmolar doses of HTS and mannitol, whereas the third used twofold higher osmolar dose of 7.5% NaCl compared to mannitol. Another prospective study pooled data from three separate trials and evaluated target-based infusions of 20% NaCl compared to standard care. Overall there was no difference in long-term neurological outcomes between groups, but patients who received 20% NaCl exhibited a reduced mortality rate at 90 days in a propensity-score-adjusted analysis (HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.36–2.23). Nevertheless, the weight of the current evidence does not support the use of hyperosmolar therapies for the specific purpose of improving neurological outcomes.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^113HVd96]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall, the data are weak and contradictory when evaluating the effect of hyperosmolar agents on neurological outcome after AIS. An analysis of a prospective registry of patients reported improved mortality and 3-month mRS in AIS treated with 5.1–7.6% NaCl, but this was not compared with another therapy or control group. Another small case series reported improvement in GCS or pupillary reactivity in some patients after a single mannitol dose, but, with only seven patients and no control group, definitive conclusions are not possible. The Koenig study was also included to address this PICO question, but the potential benefit of 23.4% NaCl in AIS patients is not discernable from this report. The only RCT is an outdated study of 77 patients with AIS which found no change in neurological outcome after a single daily dose of 0.8 to 0.9 g/kg mannitol for 10 days. The majority of the observational studies also reported no difference in neurological outcome after hyperosmolar therapy administration.

Conversely, some reports have suggested harm with prophylactic hyperosmolar therapy with mannitol after AIS. Two large, retrospective, cohort studies reported an increased risk of death at 30 days and/or greater functional dependency with prophylactic use of scheduled mannitol doses. However, the findings of both of these studies may have been skewed by the potential for dosing mannitol more frequently in the most critically ill patients. This potential treatment bias could not be fully accounted for after multivariable adjustment.

While the overall quality of evidence in this area is low, the panel felt there was enough consistency across published studies to suggest that both HTS and mannitol are effective in reducing ICP elevations and cerebral edema in AIS. In contrast, the overall evidence does not support routine hyperosmolar therapy to improve neurological outcome following AIS, and in fact, the use of prophylactic mannitol may be associated with harm.

Treatment of Cerebral Edema in Patients with Intracerebral Hemorrhage

In patients with ICH, does the use of hypertonic sodium solutions improve cerebral edema compared to mannitol?
In patients with ICH, does the use of corticosteroid therapy improve neurological outcomes compared to placebo/control?

Recommendations for Hyperosmolar Therapy

We suggest using hypertonic sodium solutions over mannitol for the management of ICP or cerebral edema in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

### Glycerol infusion versus mannitol for cerebral edema: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116BUjoH]. Clinical Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

For the treatment of cerebral edema, the use of glycerol, an osmotic agent, as well as mannitol, is popular in Asia. However, the relative therapeutic benefit of glycerol remains unknown. The goal of this study was to investigate the comparative efficacy and safety of glycerol infusion versus mannitol infusion for cerebral edema.

Methods

A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Scopus for all eligible articles published before July 2020, with no restrictions on language. Two reviewers independently screened the articles, extracted data, and carefully assessed the quality of the evidence.

Findings

Eight studies (6 clinical, 2 animal) were ultimately included in the qualitative analysis, and five were included in the quantitative analysis. Pooled analyses revealed nonsignificant differences in the successful control of cerebral edema (relative risk [RR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81–1.15). The combination therapy with glycerol led to a favorable trend in neurologic improvements. Regarding safety, glycerol was associated with a significantly lower risk of acute kidney injury (RR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.11–0.69) and electrolyte disturbances (RR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.06–0.64), as well as a lower possibility of rebound effects. No hemolysis was observed at the final follow-up.

Implications

Although the data are limited, compared with mannitol, glycerol shows a similar level of effectiveness, a more favorable safety profile, and promising neurologic improvement in individuals with cerebral edema. Additional research is needed to confirm these findings.

### VEGF inhibitors in the treatment of cerebral edema in patients with brain cancer [^111g3YMy]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2009). Medium credibility.

Most brain tumors oversecrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which leads to an abnormally permeable tumor vasculature. This hyperpermeability allows fluid to leak from the intravascular space into the brain parenchyma, which causes vasogenic cerebral edema and increased interstitial fluid pressure. Increased interstitial fluid pressure has an important role in treatment resistance by contributing to tumor hypoxia and preventing adequate tumor penetration of chemotherapy agents. In addition, edema and the corticosteroids needed to control cerebral edema cause significant morbidity and mortality. Agents that block the VEGF pathway are able to decrease vascular permeability and, thus, cerebral edema, by restoring the abnormal tumor vasculature to a more normal state. Decreasing cerebral edema minimizes the adverse effects of corticosteroids and could improve clinical outcomes. Anti-VEGF agents might also be useful in other cancer-related conditions that increase vascular permeability, such as malignant pleural effusions or ascites.

### Surgical decompression for cerebral oedema in acute ischaemic stroke [^116koRxV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Large cerebral infarction has a high case fatality. Despite the use of conventional medical treatments such as hyperventilation, mannitol, diuretics, corticosteroids and barbiturates, the outcome of this condition remains poor. Decompressive surgery to relieve intracranial pressure is performed in some cases, although evidence of any clinical benefits has not been available until recently. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002.

Objectives

To examine the effects of decompressive surgery in patients with massive acute ischaemic stroke complicated with cerebral oedema, and to judge whether decompressive surgery is effective in improving survival or survival free of severe disability.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group's Trials Register (last searched October 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2010), EMBASE (1980 to October 2010) and Science Citation Index (October 2010). We also searched the reference lists of all relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled studies of decompressive surgery plus medical treatment versus medical treatment alone in patients with clinically and radiologically confirmed cerebral infarcts complicated with cerebral oedema.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author assessed the titles and retrieved the relevant studies. The same author extracted data, with discussion among all authors for clarification. Outcomes were death at the end of follow-up, death or disability defined as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) > 3 at the end of follow-up, death or severe disability defined as mRS > 4 at 12 months and disability defined as mRS 4 or 5 at 12 months. The results are given using the Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

We included three trials in this review, involving 134 patients who were 60 years of age or younger. The time window for the intervention was 30 hours from stroke onset in two studies and 96 hours in one study. All trials were stopped early. Surgical decompression reduced the risk of death at the end of follow-up (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.37) and the risk of death or disability defined as mRS > 4 at 12 months (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.51). Death or disability defined as mRS > 3 at the end of follow-up was no different between the treatment arms (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.15).

Authors' Conclusions

Surgical decompression lowers the risk of death and death or severe disability defined as mRS > 4 in selected patients 60 years of age or younger with a massive hemispheric infarction and oedema. Optimum criteria for patient selection and for timing of decompressive surgery are yet to be defined. Since survival may be at the expense of substantial disability, surgery should be the treatment of choice only when it can be assumed, based on their preferences, that it is in the best interest of patients. Since all the trials were stopped early, an overestimation of the effect size cannot be excluded.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — hyperosmolar therapy selection: While the overall quality of evidence in this area is very low, the panel felt there was enough consistency across published studies to suggest that HTS is effective in reducing ICP elevations and cerebral edema. Given these concerns, along with the lack of published articles assessing the impact of mannitol on short-term outcomes, the panel was unable to recommend use of mannitol in this population at this time. Thus, the panel favored HTS over mannitol.

### Corticosteroids for acute ischaemic stroke [^116WMHuw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of strokes are due to cerebral infarction. Ischaemic cerebral tissue tends to develop cytotoxic oedema which, if the blood-brain barrier is disrupted, may be followed by vasogenic oedema. Large infarcts can develop life-threatening massive oedema. Early treatment with corticosteroids could theoretically help reduce both cytotoxic and vasogenic oedema and so improve the clinical outcome after a stroke.

Objectives

To assess the effect of corticosteroids in acute presumed ischaemic stroke.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched: 17 February 2011).

Selection Criteria

Published randomised trials comparing corticosteroids with placebo or a control group in people with acute (presumed or definite) ischaemic stroke. Trials were included if treatment began within 48 hours of stroke onset and if clinical outcomes were assessed.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, assessed trial quality and extracted the data.

Main Results

Eight trials involving 466 people were included. Details of trial quality that may relate to bias were not available for most trials. No difference was shown in the odds of death within one year (odds ratio (OR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.34). Treatment did not appear to improve functional outcome in survivors. Seven trials reported neurological impairment but pooling the data was impossible because no common scale or time interval was used. The results were inconsistent between individual trials. The only adverse effects reported were small numbers of gastrointestinal bleeds, infections and deterioration of hyperglycaemia across both groups. The results are unchanged since the previous update.

Authors' Conclusions

There is not enough evidence to evaluate corticosteroid treatment for people with acute presumed ischaemic stroke. The conclusions are unchanged since the previous update.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^117GaCMu]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage — hypertonic sodium solutions (HTS) dosing recommendations: We suggest using symptom-based bolus dosing of hypertonic sodium solutions rather than sodium target-based dosing for the management of intracranial pressure (ICP) or cerebral edema in patients with SAH (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Due to insufficient evidence, we cannot recommend a specific dosing strategy for HTS to improve neurological outcomes at discharge in patients with SAH.

### The management of cerebral edema in pediatric practice… [^113EMnfN]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Cerebral edema is one of the most dreaded complications associated with many central nervous system disorders. The condition adds significantly to the morbidity from such diverse conditions as neonatal hypoxia and hypernatremia, water intoxication, meningitis, encephalitis, birth trauma, lead poisoning, and radiation therapy of the brain, as well as brain tumors and abscesses. Cerebral edema increases the volume of the intracranial contents and, thus, may precipitate the intracranial translocation syndromes of uncal and tonsillar herniation which often result in death. Indeed, the mass effect due to edema of the CNS tissue is often more harmful than is that of the underlying blood clot, tumor, or other pathologic process. Diffuse and widespread cerebral edema can produce massive increases in intracranial pressure.

The successful treatment of cerebral edema, therefore, remains a matter of paramount importance and may have a critical effect upon the patient's prognosis. Two types of therapeutic measures must be considered: those that diminish the volume of intracranial contents in a nonspecific manner, and those that reduce cerebral edema. per se. An understanding of their correct use is essential. 1, 2 Prevention of cerebral edema is, of course, preferable to treating it. In infants and children undergoing neurosurgical operations, preoperative prophylactic measures can be instituted to reduce the magnitude of postoperative cerebral edema. In most situations, however, therapy cannot be initiated before the edema-producing insult occurs. Nevertheless, steps to minimize the development of cerebral edema often may be taken, and these will be discussed. Cerebral edema has been defined as the abnormal accumulation of fluid in cerebral tissue. Comments.

### Management of cerebral edema… [^116zTkce]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Although no new drugs have become available for improved treatment of cerebral edema, the increased understanding of the pathophysiology of the edematous process has led to more rational approaches to therapy, both in patients with cytotoxic intracellular brain edema and those with extracellular vasogenic brain edema. In the unconscious patient, the addition of ICP monitoring is invaluable in helping in the selection of therapy and in measuring the results of therapy. The various therapies available have been reviewed and a logical approach to treatment suggested. In patients with extracellular edema, it is likely that intensive treatment will result in good recovery. In patients with intracellular edema, the ultimate factor deciding outcome is the etiology of the metabolic disturbance rather than the cerebral edema itself.

Until there are drugs that specifically reverse the metabolic defacts produced by anoxia of ischemia, it seems unlikely that intensive care in this group of patients will result in a dramatically improved outcome. Comments.

### A new era of comparative effectiveness research in traumatic brain injury… [^111Z1zSr]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Abnormalities in brain water balance play an important role in the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury and other neurologic disorders. Brain edema, the result of an abnormal increase in brain tissue water content, is associated with increased intracranial pressure that can potentially lead to brain ischemia, cerebral herniation, and death. Despite the clinical importance of brain edema, the molecular mechanisms of brain water balance remain poorly understood, and current treatments have changed little since the introduction of intravenous injections of hypertonic solutions by Weed and McKibben1 more than 100 years ago. The most commonly used hypertonic solutions for the treatment of elevated ICP are mannitol and hypertonic saline. This study should be seen as comparative effectiveness research in which effects of HTS and mannitol on ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure are compared.

It illustrates the opportunities provided by large-scale collaborative observational studies but also the challenges involved in CER using nonrandomized studies. In randomized studies, the treatment allocation is random, which makes treatment and control patients by definition comparable, and any difference in outcome can be attributed to the treatment under study. In observational studies, the treatment allocation is clearly not random. The challenge is to assess whether the treatment intervention was targeted appropriately and to understand the treatment allocation mechanism to be able to derive an unbiased treatment effect. In this study, hyperosmolar treatment was targeted to patients with increased ICP and not specifically to those with cerebral edema. Increased ICP can also be caused by brain swelling from vasodilation, in particular in pediatric populations.

It would appear unlikely that hyperosmolar agents would exert a mechanistic effect in patients with a vascular cause of increased ICP. As a consequence, treatment effects may be diluted. Treatment allocation is typically based on patient characteristics; for example, in observational studies exploring the effect of ICP monitoring in outcome, the sickest patients will receive the monitoring; therefore, outcome may well be poorer. This large, multicenter study provides real-world evidence, in conjunction with the current pediatric TBI guidelines, that supports the use of HTS as a first-line agent in the management of pediatric TBI. This study also highlights the importance of large-scale observational studies and the evolving importance of CER and other novel clinical trial designs.
