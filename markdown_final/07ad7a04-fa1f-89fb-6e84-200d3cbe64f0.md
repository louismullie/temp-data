## Question

A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, presents for her routine prenatal visit at 18 weeks’ gestation. She has no complaints and her pregnancy has been uncomplicated so far. She has no history of preterm birth or other risk factors. On review of her chart, you note that she has not reported any vaginal symptoms such as discharge, odor, or irritation. A medical student asks whether she should be screened for bacterial vaginosis to reduce her risk of preterm labor.

Based on current guidelines, should you offer screening and antibiotic treatment for bacterial vaginosis to this asymptomatic pregnant patient to prevent preterm birth? Justify your answer.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to screen and treat asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis at 18 weeks' gestation in a low-risk pregnant patient to prevent preterm birth. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's baseline risk and whether she is "low risk" or "high risk" for preterm birth. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (USPSTF, ACOG, SOGC) recommend for screening asymptomatic BV in low-risk pregnancies. Next, I will review the highest-quality evidence, including RCTs and meta-analyses, to see if screening and treatment reduce preterm birth. After that, I need to check for any subgroup signals or conflicting data that might tempt a different approach. Finally, I will weigh potential harms, consider cost and implementation issues, and synthesize a clear recommendation with counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the risk stratification. This patient is gravida 2 para 1 with no prior preterm birth and no other identified risk factors, so she falls into the "not at increased risk" category for preterm delivery, which is the key determinant for guideline recommendations on BV screening [^b1b5d38e] [^a4113d56].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines. The USPSTF gives a Grade D recommendation against screening asymptomatic BV in pregnant persons not at increased risk for preterm delivery, concluding with moderate certainty that there is no net benefit in preventing preterm birth, and issues an I statement for those at increased risk due to insufficient evidence [^b0a04383] [^c49c3195]. ACOG similarly recommends not screening and treating asymptomatic BV for the purpose of preventing preterm birth, noting that interventional studies have not shown improved perinatal outcomes in general obstetric populations [^967cc368] [^ab7490d2]. SOGC advises against routine screening in asymptomatic patients without risk factors, aligning with this stance [^04cb59e8] [^858ff667].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the evidence base supporting these recommendations. Multiple high-quality syntheses show no reduction in preterm birth with screening and treating asymptomatic BV in general obstetric populations: the USPSTF evidence review found no significant benefit for spontaneous or all-cause preterm delivery before 37 weeks in pooled RCTs of low/average-risk patients, and the Cochrane review likewise found no reduction in preterm birth overall, despite successful eradication of BV [^e36a246c] [^cc2b095b]. Large RCTs such as PREMEVA (clindamycin in low-risk pregnancies) and the auTop molecular screening trial also failed to reduce preterm birth in the overall population, reinforcing the lack of benefit signal in low-risk groups [^76fd8670] [^ba9ddf90].

> Wait, let me verify whether any subgroup suggested benefit that could change practice here. The auTop trial reported a post hoc reduction in preterm birth among nulliparous women, but this was a subgroup finding and should be interpreted cautiously; it does not overturn the overall negative result or the guideline stance for low-risk populations, and it warrants prospective confirmation before routine adoption [^ba9ddf90] [^145f2d53]. Earlier trials targeting "abnormal vaginal flora" (including intermediate flora) and treating with clindamycin before 20 weeks showed reductions in preterm birth, but those populations and definitions differ from standard BV-only screening and are not directly generalizable to asymptomatic, low-risk patients screened for BV alone [^2c138b79] [^75a165ba].

> I need to ensure I weigh potential harms and downsides. Treatment of asymptomatic BV is generally safe, but adverse effects like candidiasis and gastrointestinal symptoms are more common with active therapy than placebo, and unnecessary antibiotics contribute to resistance and costs without proven benefit in this context [^253218d4] [^cc2b095b]. The auTop intervention added approximately €200 per participant without improving outcomes, illustrating the lack of cost-effectiveness in low-risk screening strategies [^ba9ddf90].

> But wait, what if the patient were high risk — would that change the calculus? For patients with a prior preterm birth, evidence remains mixed and insufficient to recommend routine screening; some studies suggest possible benefit, others none, and guidelines issue an I statement, so screening is not routinely advised even in high-risk groups pending better data, though individualized decisions may be considered in select contexts [^c49c3195] [^8391ef06] [^ab7490d2].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing anything. For a low-risk, asymptomatic pregnant patient at 18 weeks, screening and treating BV does not reduce preterm birth and is not recommended by USPSTF, ACOG, or SOGC; the balance of benefits and harms is unfavorable in this population, and resources are better directed toward evidence-based preterm birth prevention strategies such as cervical length assessment and progesterone when indicated, smoking cessation, and addressing modifiable risks [^b0a04383] [^967cc368] [^6a930028].

> Final recommendation: No, do not screen or treat asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in this patient. Counsel that routine BV screening is not recommended in low-risk pregnancies because high-quality evidence shows no reduction in preterm birth, and reserve testing and treatment for symptomatic patients or those in contexts where guidelines specifically advise otherwise [^b0a04383] [^967cc368] [^05551950].

---

Routine screening for bacterial vaginosis (BV) in asymptomatic, low-risk pregnant patients is **not recommended** because it does not reduce preterm birth or adverse perinatal outcomes [^b0a04383] [^e36a246c]. The USPSTF gives a **D recommendation** against screening in this population, and ACOG advises against screening and treatment for asymptomatic BV to prevent preterm birth [^b0a04383] [^967cc368]. Evidence shows no significant reduction in preterm birth with screening and treatment in low-risk patients, and potential harms include unnecessary antibiotics and side effects [^e36a246c] [^253218d4]. Reserve screening for symptomatic patients or those at **increased risk** (e.g. prior preterm birth) [^a4113d56] [^ab7490d2].

## Evidence on screening and treatment of asymptomatic BV

Multiple high-quality studies and reviews show that screening and treating asymptomatic BV in low-risk pregnant patients **does not reduce preterm birth or other adverse outcomes**:

- **USPSTF 2020**: Moderate certainty that screening asymptomatic, low-risk pregnant patients has no net benefit in preventing preterm delivery [^c49c3195] [^c96c7d0d].
- **ACOG 2021**: Recommends against screening and treatment of asymptomatic BV to prevent preterm birth [^967cc368] [^ab7490d2].
- **Cochrane 2013**: Antibiotic treatment eradicates BV but does not significantly reduce preterm birth in asymptomatic women [^cc2b095b] [^78b21291].
- **PREMEVA trial**: Early clindamycin for asymptomatic BV in low-risk pregnancies did not reduce late miscarriage or very preterm birth [^76fd8670].

---

## Potential harms of screening and treatment

Screening and treating asymptomatic BV can cause **unnecessary antibiotic exposure** and side effects (e.g. candidiasis, gastrointestinal upset) [^253218d4] [^cc2b095b]. It may also drive antimicrobial resistance and increase healthcare costs without proven benefit [^023e2736] [^ba9ddf90].

## Guidelines and professional recommendations

| **Organization** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| USPSTF | - D recommendation against screening asymptomatic, low-risk pregnant patients for BV [^b0a04383] [^c49c3195] |
| ACOG | - Recommends against screening and treatment of asymptomatic BV to prevent preterm birth [^967cc368] [^ab7490d2] |
| SOGC | - Insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening or treatment of asymptomatic BV in low-risk pregnancies [^858ff667] [^04cb59e8] |

---

## Situations where screening may be considered

Screening may be considered for **symptomatic patients** (discharge, odor, irritation) or those at **increased risk** (e.g. prior preterm birth, history of BV) [^a4113d56] [^ab7490d2]. Even in high-risk patients, evidence is mixed and insufficient to recommend routine screening [^c49c3195] [^8391ef06].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Routine screening and treatment of asymptomatic BV in low-risk pregnant patients **should not be offered**, as it does not reduce preterm birth or adverse outcomes and may cause harm [^b0a04383] [^e36a246c]. Reserve screening for symptomatic patients or those at increased risk, and base management on individual clinical judgment [^05551950] [^a4113d56].

## References

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant adolescents and women to prevent preterm delivery: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^253218d4]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Preterm delivery results in adverse outcomes; identifying and treating bacterial vaginosis may reduce its occurrence.

Objective

To update the evidence on screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy for the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through May 29, 2019; bibliographies from retrieved articles, experts, and surveillance of the literature through December 31, 2019.

Study Selection

Fair- or good-quality English-language studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of tests feasible within primary care; randomized clinical trials (RCTs); nonrandomized controlled intervention studies (for harms only); or meta-analyses of metronidazole or clindamycin.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently assessed titles/abstracts and full-text articles, extracted data, and assessed study quality; when at least 3 similar studies were available, meta-analyses were conducted.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, preterm delivery, maternal adverse effects, congenital birth defects, childhood cancer.

Results

Forty-four studies (48 publications) were included. No studies evaluated the benefits or harms of screening. Twenty-five studies (n=15 785) evaluated the accuracy of screening tests; across individual studies and tests, sensitivity ranged from 0.36 to 1.0 and specificity ranged from 0.49 to 1.0. Among trials reporting findings from general obstetric populations (n=7953), no significant association was observed between treatment and spontaneous delivery before 37 weeks (pooled absolute risk difference [ARD], -1.44% [95% CI, -3.31% to 0.43%]; 8 RCTs, n=7571) or any delivery before 37 weeks (pooled ARD, 0.20% [95% CI, -1.13% to 1.53%]; 6 RCTs, n=6307). Among 5 trials reporting findings among women with a prior preterm delivery, findings were inconsistent; 3 showed a significant beneficial effect, while 2 did not. Maternal adverse events from treatment were infrequent and minor (eg, candidiasis) but were slightly more common with active treatment compared with placebo across 8 RCTs. Two meta-analyses of observational studies reported no significant association between metronidazole exposure and congenital malformations (odds ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.75 to 1.22]; odds ratio, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.29]). One cohort study reported no significantly increased incidence of childhood cancer among metronidazole-exposed children (adjusted relative risk, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.41 to 1.59]). However, studies of in utero exposure had important limitations.

Conclusions and Relevance

Accuracy of screening tests for bacterial vaginosis varies. The evidence suggests no difference in the incidence of preterm delivery and related outcomes from treatment for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in a general obstetric population but was inconclusive for women with a prior preterm delivery. Maternal adverse events from treatment appear to be infrequent and minor, but the evidence about harms from in utero exposure was inconclusive.

Recommendations of others generally do not support screening for bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists notes that intervention studies based on screening tests, including testing for bacterial vaginosis, in asymptomatic women have not demonstrated improved perinatal outcomes and it does not recommend these tests as a screening strategy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that 'Evidence does not support routine screening for bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery. Symptomatic women should be evaluated and treated.' The American Academy of Family Physicians endorses the 2008 USPSTF recommendation on screening for bacterial vaginosis.

### Antibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy [^cc2b095b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora with an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and a lack of the normal lactobacillary flora. Women may have symptoms of a characteristic vaginal discharge but are often asymptomatic. Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has been associated with poor perinatal outcomes and, in particular, preterm birth (PTB). Identification and treatment may reduce the risk of PTB and its consequences.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2012), searched cited references from retrieved articles and reviewed abstracts, letters to the editor and editorials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment, or comparing two or more antibiotic regimens in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal flora whether symptomatic or asymptomatic and detected through screening.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

We included 21 trials of good quality, involving 7847 women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal flora.Antibiotic therapy was shown to be effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy (average risk ratio (RR) 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.56; 10 trials, 4403 women; random-effects, T² = 0.19, I² = 91%). Antibiotic treatment also reduced the risk of late miscarriage (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.76; two trials, 1270 women, fixed-effect, I² = 0%).Treatment did not reduce the risk of PTB before 37 weeks (average RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.09; 13 trials, 6491 women; random-effects, T² = 0.06, I² = 48%), or the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.84; two trials, 493 women). It did increase the risk of side-effects sufficient to stop or change treatment (RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.68; four trials, 2323 women, fixed-effect, I² = 0%).In this updated review, treatment before 20 weeks' gestation did not reduce the risk of PTB less than 37 weeks (average RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; five trials, 4088 women; random-effects, T² = 0.06, I² = 49%).In women with a previous PTB, treatment did not affect the risk of subsequent PTB (average RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.48; three trials, 421 women; random-effects, T² = 0.19, I² = 72%).In women with abnormal vaginal flora (intermediate flora or bacterial vaginosis), treatment may reduce the risk of PTB before 37 weeks (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.84; two trials, 894 women).One small trial of 156 women compared metronidazole and clindamycin, both oral and vaginal, with no significant differences seen for any of the pre-specified primary outcomes. Statistically significant differences were seen for the outcomes of prolongation of gestational age (days) (mean difference (MD) 1.00; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.74) and birthweight (grams) (MD 75.18; 95% CI 25.37 to 124.99) however these represent relatively small differences in the clinical setting.Oral antibiotics versus vaginal antibiotics did not reduce the risk of PTB (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.52; two trials, 264 women). Oral antibiotics had some advantage over vaginal antibiotics (whether metronidazole or clindamycin) with respect to admission to neonatal unit (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.92, one trial, 156 women), prolongation of gestational age (days) (MD 9.00; 95% CI 8.20 to 9.80; one trial, 156 women) and birthweight (grams) (MD 342.13; 95% CI 293.04 to 391.22; one trial, 156 women).Different frequency of dosing of antibiotics was assessed in one small trial and showed no significant difference for any outcome assessed.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment can eradicate bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. The overall risk of PTB was not significantly reduced. This review provides little evidence that screening and treating all pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis will prevent PTB and its consequences. When screening criteria were broadened to include women with abnormal flora there was a 47% reduction in preterm birth, however this is limited to two included studies.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy [^2283c4a9]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Context

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a strong independent risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. BV is found in 9% to 23% of pregnant women. Symptoms include vaginal discharge, pruritus, or malodor, but often women with BV are asymptomatic.

Objectives

To determine whether screening and treating pregnant women for BV reduces adverse pregnancy outcomes, as part of an assessment for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

Randomized clinical trials of BV treatment in pregnancy that measured pregnancy outcomes were identified from multiple searches in MEDLINE from 1966 to 1999, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and Library, and national experts.

Study Selection

All randomized controlled trials of BV treatment in pregnancy that specifically measured pregnancy outcomes.

Data Extraction

The following information was abstracted: study design and blinding, diagnostic methods, antibiotic interventions, timing of antibiotic treatment in pregnancy, criteria for treatment, comorbidities, demographic details, risk factors for preterm delivery such as previous preterm delivery, compliance, rates of spontaneous and total preterm delivery less than 37 weeks and less than 34 weeks, preterm premature rupture of membranes, low birth weight less than 2500 grams, spontaneous abortion, postpartum endometritis, and neonatal sepsis. For each study, we measured the effect of treatment by calculating the difference in the rate of a given pregnancy outcome in the control group minus the treatment group (the absolute risk reduction [ARR]). A stepwise procedure based on the profile likelihood was applied to assess heterogeneity, to pool studies when appropriate, and to calculate the mean and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the effect of treatment.

Data Synthesis

Seven randomized controlled trials met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. We found no benefit to BV treatment in average-risk women for any pregnancy outcome. Results of studies of high-risk populations, women with previous preterm delivery, were statistically heterogeneous. They clustered into two groups; one showed no benefit (ARR=-0.08, 90% CI=-0.19 to 0.04), whereas the three homogeneous studies showed potential benefit of BV treatment (pooled ARR=0.22; 90% CI=0.13 to 0.31) for preterm delivery before 37 weeks. Four high-risk studies reported results for preterm delivery less than 34 weeks. The pooled estimate showed no benefit (ARR=0.04; 90% CI=-0.02 to 0.09), but variation was noted among individual studies. Two trials of high-risk women found an increase in preterm delivery less than 34 weeks in women who did not have BV but received BV treatment. Comparisons of patient populations, treatment regimens, and study designs did not explain the heterogeneity among studies.

Conclusions

We found no benefit to routine BV screening and treatment. A subgroup of high-risk women may benefit from BV screening and treatment; however, there may be a subgroup for whom BV treatment could increase the occurrence of preterm delivery.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy to prevent preterm delivery: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^dc11f90a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2001 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy.

Methods

The USPSTF weighed the benefits and harms of screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy by identifying new evidence addressing previously identified gaps from the 2001 USPSTF recommendation. Published literature on this topic was identified by using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library databases, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, reference lists, and consultation with experts and was systematically reviewed. When data allowed, a series of meta-analyses (using new and 2001 report data) was done to estimate the pooled effect of treatment on preterm delivery (<37 weeks, <34 weeks, or <32 weeks) and on low birthweight and preterm, premature rupture of membranes.

Recommendation

Do not screen for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women at low risk for preterm delivery. (D recommendation)

Recommendation

Current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery. (I statement).

### Evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and treating pregnant women who are asymptomatic for bacterial vaginosis: an update review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^283e37b3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis is the most common lower genital tract syndrome among women of reproductive age. There has been continued debate about the value of screening and treating asymptomatic pregnant women for bacterial vaginosis.

Purpose

To examine new evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and treating bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women.

Data Sources

English-language studies on Ovid MEDLINE (2000 to September 2007) and Cochrane Library databases (through September 2007), reference lists, and expert suggestions.

Study Selection

Screening, treatment, or adverse effect studies with pregnancy outcome data in women who are asymptomatic for bacterial vaginosis.

Data Extraction

Study and patient characteristics, treatment variables, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and internal validity quality criteria from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and Jadad scale were abstracted.

Data Synthesis

7 new randomized, controlled treatment trials and 2001 report data were combined in a series of meta-analyses to estimate the pooled effect of treatment on preterm delivery (<37, <34, and <32 weeks); low birthweight; and preterm, premature rupture of membranes.

Limitations

No screening studies that compared a screened population with a nonscreened population were found. Significant heterogeneity was found among the high-risk treatment trials (P < 0.001). It is not clear from the detailed description of the studies which factors explain the differences in preterm delivery rates and potentially the association of treatment effect; however, both raise concern for the unintended potential for harm.

Conclusion

No benefit was found in treating women with low- or average-risk pregnancies for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis. More research is needed to better understand these groups and the conditions under which treatment can be harmful or helpful, and to explore the relevance of bacterial vaginosis to other adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as delivery before 34 weeks.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^e041543c]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF response to public comment clarifies that the recommendation applies to screening for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis and does not address treatment of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis. A draft was posted for public comment from October 8 to November 4, 2019. The need for studies that evaluate screening test accuracy in pregnant persons was added to Research Needs and Gaps, and although additional subgroup and test information was sought in the systematic evidence review, no additional evidence was identified.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^7726202a]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Biological understanding and epidemiology note that risk for preterm delivery may be higher when asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis is present, with a pooled odds ratio of 2.16 (95% CI, 1.56-3.00) across 32 studies and 30 518 participants. However, the causal pathway of how bacterial vaginosis may lead to preterm delivery is unclear. Although treating asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons at not increased risk for preterm delivery does not prevent preterm delivery, it remains unclear whether treatment in those at increased risk may help prevent preterm delivery.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^c96c7d0d]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Bacterial vaginosis is common and is caused by a disruption of the microbiological environment in the lower genital tract. In the US, reported prevalence of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women ranges from 5.8% to 19.3% and is higher in some races/ethnicities. Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has been associated with adverse obstetrical outcomes including preterm delivery, early miscarriage, postpartum endometritis, and low birth weight.

Objective

To update its 2008 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on the accuracy of screening and the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery.

Population

This recommendation applies to pregnant persons without symptoms of bacterial vaginosis.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons not at increased risk for preterm delivery has no net benefit in preventing preterm delivery. The USPSTF concludes that for pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery, the evidence is conflicting and insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons not at increased risk for preterm delivery. (D recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery.

### Prediction and prevention of spontaneous preterm birth: ACOG practice bulletin, number 234 [^ab7490d2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis screening and treatment—guidance for prevention of preterm birth is as follows: Interventional studies of screening and treatment of asymptomatic women have not shown a reduction in preterm birth rates, including a Cochrane meta-analysis of 21 trials involving 7,847 pregnant women in which antibiotic therapy did not reduce the risk of preterm birth at less than 37 weeks of gestation (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.71–1.09). Although prophylactic antibiotics reduced preterm delivery compared with no treatment only in the subgroup of women with a prior preterm birth and current bacterial vaginosis (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.47–0.88; one trial, 258 women), for the purpose of prevention of preterm birth, screening and antibiotic treatment for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant individuals without symptoms of vaginitis is not recommended, and there are insufficient data to recommend this as a routine practice in asymptomatic pregnant women with a history of a previous preterm delivery.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^e36a246c]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy—benefits of early detection and treatment: No studies were identified that directly evaluated the benefit of screening for bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant persons. Thirteen randomized clinical trials of treatment in asymptomatic pregnant women—using oral metronidazole (3 trials), oral metronidazole plus erythromycin (1 trial), oral clindamycin (2 trials), and intravaginal clindamycin (7 trials)—showed no statistically significant benefit in general obstetric populations for all-cause preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks (pooled RR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.86-1.20]; 6 studies; n = 6307), spontaneous preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks (pooled RR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.86-1.07]; 8 studies; n = 7571), preterm delivery prior to 32 weeks (pooled RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.54-1.42]; 3 studies; n = 5564), low birth weight less than 2500 g (pooled RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.83-1.29]; 5 studies; n = 5377), birth weight less than 1500 g (pooled RR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.50-2.18]; 3 studies; n = 5149), and PROM or preterm PROM (pooled RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.72-1.72]; 4 studies; n = 3568). Among women with a history of prior preterm delivery, findings were inconsistent: for preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks, RRs ranged from 0.71 to 1.33 (4 trials; n = 451), and for preterm delivery prior to 34 weeks, RRs were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.07-14.05) in 1 study and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.08-2.11) in the other; Ten to 19% of participants in these trials had a history of prior preterm delivery.

### Antenatal lower genital tract infection screening and treatment programs for preventing preterm delivery [^023e2736]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Genital tract infection is associated with preterm birth (before 37 weeks' gestation). Screening for infections during pregnancy may therefore reduce the numbers of babies being born prematurely. However, screening for infections may have some adverse effects, such as increased antibiotic drug resistance and increased cost of treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antenatal lower genital tract infection screening and treatment programs for reducing preterm birth and subsequent morbidity.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 November 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 7) and reference lists of retrieved reports.

Selection Criteria

We included all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials in any language that evaluated any described methods of antenatal lower genital tract infection screening compared with no screening.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked for accuracy.

Main Results

One study (4155 women at less than 20 weeks' gestation) met the inclusion criteria. The intervention group (2058 women) received infection screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis, trichomonas vaginalis and candidiasis; the control group (2097 women) also received screening, but the results of the screening program were not revealed and women received routine antenatal care. The rate of preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation was significantly lower in the intervention group (3% versus 5% in the control group) with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.75; the evidence for this outcome was graded as of moderate quality). The incidence of preterm birth for infants with a weight equal to or below 2500 g (low birthweight) and infants with a weight equal to or below 1500 g (very low birthweight) were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.66 and RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.75, respectively; both graded as moderate quality evidence). Based on a subset of costs for preterm births of < 1900 g, the authors reported that for each of those preterm births averted, EUR 60,262 would be saved.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence from one trial that infection screening and treatment programs for pregnant women before 20 weeks' gestation reduce preterm birth and preterm low birthweight. Infection screening and treatment programs are associated with cost savings when used for the prevention of preterm birth. Future trials should evaluate the effects of different types of infection screening programs.

### Effectiveness and costs of molecular screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis to prevent preterm birth: the auTop randomized clinical trial [^b2a6f9d3]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Preterm birth affects approximately 5% to 11% of births worldwide, with variation by country, ethnicity, or other factors. This figure has remained constant despite different preventive strategies or treatments.Among the risk factors, bacterial vaginosis (BV) is well known.BV is a common vaginal dysbiosis, with a predominance of anaerobic bacteria associated with a lack of lactobacillus, detected with various diagnosis methods. Often asymptomatic, BV increases the risk of preterm birth from 2-fold to 7-fold according to the gestational age at diagnosis; the earlier the age, the higher the risk.The conventional diagnosis of BV can be clinical according to Amsel criteria or based on Nugent criteria, vaginal pH, or molecular diagnosis.

Debate remains regarding the effectiveness of screening and treating BV during pregnancy. Three meta-analyses evaluated the impact on pregnancy outcome of screen and treat interventions for pregnant women using conventional diagnosis methods for BV. Lamont et al(5 studies and 2346 patients) reported a benefit of screen and treat using clindamycin. The Cochrane Database update (21 studies and 7847 patients) does not recommend screening for BVbut highlights that 2 studies that included intermediate flora as part of their criteria showed a 50% reduction in preterm delivery and an 80% reduction in miscarriages. More recently and after the implementation of the present study, the updated systematic review for US Preventive Services Task Force(n = 48 studies), including the results from the large PREMEVA study,still showed that conventional screening tests for BV varied in accuracy, suggested no efficacy of treatment for asymptomatic BV in a general obstetric population, and was inconclusive for women with a history of prior preterm delivery. Based on this literature, international and French recommendations advise against screening with conventional diagnosis tools in low-risk populations,,, even though 65% of preterm births occur in patients with no obstetrical history or identified risk factors.

Results

Between March 9, 2015, and December 18, 2017, 6671 patients (mean [SD] age, 30.6 [5.0] years; mean [SD] gestational age, 15.5 [2.8] weeks) were randomly assigned to study groups: 3333 to the screen and treat group and 3338 to the control group (Figure 1). Demographic characteristics and medical history were similar in the 2 groups (Table 1). At inclusion, 1671 patients (50%) in the screen and treat group and 1767 (52%) in the control group were nulliparous. At the end of the study follow-up on November 18, 2019, the median (range) duration of follow-up was 24 (13-117) weeks. Outcomes of pregnancy were known for all but 300 of the randomized patients, including 143 (4.3%) in the screen and treat group and 157 (4.7%) in the control group.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1db960aa]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth—epidemiology and clinical importance: In the US, reported prevalence of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women ranges from 5.8% to 19.3% and is higher in some races/ethnicities. Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has been associated with adverse obstetrical outcomes including preterm delivery, early miscarriage, postpartum endometritis, and low birth weight. Bacterial vaginosis is often asymptomatic, can resolve spontaneously, and recurs often, with or without treatment. In the US, approximately 10% of live births are preterm (born prior to 37 weeks’ gestation). Preterm birth is associated with serious complications, including major intraventricular hemorrhage, acute respiratory illnesses, and sepsis.

### Predicting and preventing preterm birth: recommendations...-AAFP (...) [^6a930028]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice • Preterm birth rates can be reduced by ceasing tobacco and alcohol use, increasing contraception access, and increasing interpregnancy intervals to at least 18 months. • Daily vaginal progesterone starting between 20 and 24 weeks until 34 weeks’ gestation can reduce preterm birth risk for patients with cervical shortening or a history of preterm birth. Preterm birth, or delivery occurring between 20 and 37 weeks' gestation, may be spontaneous or due to a maternal or fetal complication. Early preterm birth occurs up to 34 weeks' gestation, and late preterm birth occurs between 34 and 37 weeks' gestation. Preterm births account for one in 10 deliveries, and 3% of births are early preterm. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has new recommendations for predicting and preventing preterm birth. Risk Factors All pregnant patients are at risk for preterm birth, and one in 20 nulliparous patients will deliver preterm.

Many risk factors for preterm birth are unmodifiable. Multiple pregnancies confer the highest risk, with preterm births occurring in 60% of twin pregnancies and 98% of triplet pregnancies. A history of preterm birth is a strong risk factor for subsequent preterm birth, although a term birth after the preterm birth reduces future risk. The risk for preterm birth in a subsequent single pregnancy is elevated even when the preterm birth was a twin delivery. A history of dilation and curettage increases the risk of preterm birth by approximately 30% for a single procedure and more for multiple procedures. Although a short cervical length determined using ultrasonography is associated with increased preterm birth risk, having a shortened cervix due to surgical treatment of cervical dysplasia does not appear to increase risk. Some risk factors for preterm birth are modifiable.

Tobacco and substance use increase the risk of preterm birth, and an interpregnancy interval of less than 18 months increases the risk of preterm birth and pregnancy complications. Although unintended pregnancies have an increased risk of preterm birth, increasing access to family planning and long-acting reversible contraception reduces preterm birth risk. Assessing Risk of Preterm Birth A cervical length less than 25 mm measured by endovaginal ultrasonography between 16 and 24 weeks' gestation demonstrates increased preterm birth risk. Endovaginal cervical length is measured with an empty bladder and the endovaginal probe placed in the anterior fornix. Visualized intra-amniotic debris demonstrates further increased risk of preterm birth in patients with a short cervix, but funneling of the internal os, change with fundal pressure, and change with subsequent examinations do not demonstrate further increased risk.

Although the absence of fetal fibronectin by vaginal swab is useful to demonstrate low risk for patients with symptoms of preterm labor, the positive predictive value is low, and the test is not useful for screening asymptomatic patients. SCREENING Although the cost-effectiveness of universal screening is uncertain, the cervix is often visualized on the fetal anatomy ultrasound scan routinely conducted between 18 and 23 weeks' gestation. If the cervical length measurement is 36 mm or less, an endovaginal measurement can be considered. Based on a study of nulliparous patients with singleton pregnancies, 680 patients would need to be screened by endovaginal ultra-sonography with a cervical measurement cutoff of 20 mm to predict one spontaneous preterm birth. Patients with a previous spontaneous preterm delivery are at increased risk and are recommended for endovaginal cervical measurement.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^2d1522c6]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy—prevalence and risk factors for preterm delivery: Bacterial vaginosis occurs in as many as 29% of women in the US and in 5.8% to 19.3% of pregnant women, and history of a prior preterm delivery is associated with a 2.5-fold higher odds for preterm delivery in subsequent pregnancies while bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy is associated with a 2-fold higher odds for preterm delivery; additional risk factors include low maternal body mass index (<20, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Preterm birth rates vary by race/ethnicity in the US, with reported rates of 8.6% among Asian women, 11.8% among Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander women, 9.7% among Hispanic women, 11.5% among American Indian/Alaska Native women, 14.1% among black women, and 9.6% among white women, and among women with a prior preterm delivery the rate of recurrent preterm delivery in African American women is 4 times higher than in white women. Even when these risk factors are present, it is unclear whether screening and treating asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery prevents preterm delivery.

### Effectiveness and costs of molecular screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis to prevent preterm birth: the auTop randomized clinical trial [^ba9ddf90]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a well-known risk factor for preterm birth. Molecular diagnosis of BV is now available. Its impact in the screening and treatment of BV during pregnancy on preterm births has not been evaluated to date.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical and economic effects of point-of-care quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction screen and treat for BV in low-risk pregnant women on preterm birth.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The AuTop trial was a prospective, multicenter, parallel, individually randomized, open-label, superiority trial conducted in 19 French perinatal centers between March 9, 2015, and December 18, 2017. Low-risk pregnant women before 20 weeks' gestation without previous preterm births or late miscarriages were enrolled. Data were analyzed from October 2021 to November 2022.

Interventions

Participants were randomized 1:1 to BV screen and treat using self-collected vaginal swabs (n=3333) or usual care (n=3338). BV was defined as Atopobium vaginae (Fannyhessea vaginae) load of 108 copies/mL or greater and/or Gardnerella vaginalis load of 109 copies/mL or greater, using point-of-care quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. The control group received usual care with no screening of BV.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Overall rate of preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation and total costs were calculated in both groups. Secondary outcomes were related to treatment success as well as maternal and neonate health. Post hoc subgroup analyses were conducted.

Results

Among 6671 randomized women (mean [SD] age, 30.6 [5.0] years; mean [SD] gestational age, 15.5 [2.8] weeks), the intention-to-treat analysis of the primary clinical and economic outcomes showed no evidence of a reduction in the rate of preterm birth and total costs with the screen and treat strategy compared with usual care. The rate of preterm birth was 3.8% (127 of 3333) in the screen and treat group and 4.6% (153 of 3338) in the control group (risk ratio [RR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66-1.05; P=.12). On average, the cost of the intervention was €203.6 (US $218.0) per participant, and the total average cost was €3344.3 (US $3580.5) in the screen and treat group vs €3272.9 (US $3504.1) in the control group, with no significant differences being observed. In the subgroup of nulliparous women (n=3438), screen and treat was significantly more effective than usual care (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45-0.84; P for interaction=.003), whereas no statistical difference was found in multiparous (RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.90-1.87).

Conclusion and Relevance

In this clinical trial of pregnant women at low risk of preterm birth, molecular screening and treatment for BV based on A vaginae (F vaginae) and/or G vaginalis quantification did not significantly reduce preterm birth rates. Post hoc analysis suggests a benefit of screen and treat in low-risk nulliparous women, warranting further evaluation in this group.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery applies to pregnant persons without signs or symptoms of bacterial vaginosis. For pregnant persons not at increased risk for preterm delivery: Grade D Do not screen for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons who have no signs or symptoms of bacterial vaginosis. For pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery: I statement The evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons who have no signs or symptoms of bacterial vaginosis. Implementation steps are: Assess risk for preterm delivery. There are multiple factors that increase risk for preterm delivery; one of the strongest risk factors is prior preterm delivery. Decide whether or not to screen for bacterial vaginosis: Do not screen pregnant persons not at increased risk for preterm delivery. Evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery.

Summary of recommendations (Level A)—Because of the relatively high detection rate and predictive value in individuals with prior preterm birth, and because treatment is available, serial endovaginal ultrasound measurement of cervical length beginning at 16 0/7 weeks of gestation and repeated until 24 0/7 weeks of gestation for individuals with a singleton pregnancy and a prior spontaneous preterm birth is recommended. For the purpose of prevention of preterm birth, screening and antibiotic treatment for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant individuals without symptoms of vaginitis is not recommended. Vaginal progesterone is recommended for asymptomatic individuals without a history of preterm birth with a singleton pregnancy and a short cervix.

### What have we learned about vaginal infections and preterm birth? [^29165078]. Seminars in Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic maternal genital tract infection during pregnancy, particularly bacterial vaginosis, has been consistently associated with preterm birth. In response to this evidence, the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network (MFMU) designed and conducted 2 large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of metronidazole treatment of asymptomatic pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis in a general obstetrical population. These studies showed that treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis failed to prevent preterm birth, regardless of their history of prior preterm birth. Metronidazole treatment of women with trichomoniasis significantly increased the risk of preterm birth compared to placebo. These results formed the basis of the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation that screening for bacterial vaginosis not be undertaken in low-risk pregnant women, and show that MFMU network studies can have a direct and immediate impact on obstetrical practice.

For breastfeeding after maternal metronidazole, certain clinicians recommend deferring breastfeeding for 12–24 hours after maternal treatment with a single 2-g dose of metronidazole, and lower doses are considered compatible with breastfeeding. In HIV, BV appears to recur with higher frequency among women who have HIV infection, and women with HIV infection and BV should receive the same treatment regimens as those who do not have HIV.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^66d21590]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Research needs and gaps for screening and treatment include conducting more studies in pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery; including those with a history of prior preterm delivery or other risk factors such as cervical insufficiency, multifetal gestation, young or advanced maternal age, low maternal body mass index (<20), and African American, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native race/ethnicity. Studies should be adequately powered to detect a reduction of all-cause preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks’ gestation. If a reduction in preterm delivery is found with treatment in persons at increased risk, additional research is needed to better identify persons at increased risk, and further studies are needed to confirm screening test accuracy in this population.

### Vaginal clindamycin in preventing preterm birth and peripartal infections in asymptomatic women with bacterial vaginosis: a randomized, controlled trial [^ad3d80c1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in early pregnancy decreases the risk of preterm delivery and peripartum infectious morbidity.

Methods

In this multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled intervention trial, screening for BV was performed by vaginal Gram stain obtained from 5432 healthy women with singleton pregnancies during the first antenatal clinic visit at 10--17 weeks' gestation. Bacterial vaginosis-positive women with no past history of preterm delivery were randomized to a single course of treatment with either 2% vaginal clindamycin cream or identical placebo cream for 7 days. Repeat Gram stains were taken 1 week after treatment and at 30--36 weeks' gestation. Preterm delivery was defined as spontaneous delivery before 37 gestational weeks. Peripartum infectious morbidity was defined as postpartum endometritis, postpartum sepsis, postcesarean wound infection, or episiotomy wound infection, necessitating antimicrobial therapy. According to the power analysis, 180 patients were needed for both treatment arms to show a three-fold difference in the rates of preterm births.

Results

The overall prevalence of BV was 10.4%. Of all BV-positive women, 375 (66%) were randomized to the treatment arms. The primary cure rate was 66% in the clindamycin group; in the placebo group, 34% spontaneously cleared BV (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3, 2.8). The rate of preterm deliveries was 5% in the clindamycin group and 4% in the placebo group (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.5, 3.5). The rate of peripartum infectious morbidity was 11% in the clindamycin group and 18% in the placebo group (OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9, 2.8). Bacterial vaginosis recurred in 7% of women. The rate of preterm deliveries was 15% in this subgroup compared with 2% among women who remained BV negative (OR 9.3, 95% CI 1.6, 53.5).

Conclusion

Vaginal clindamycin did not decrease the rate of preterm deliveries or peripartum infections, but recurrent or persistent BV increased the risk for these complications.

### Treatment of asymptomatic vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy to prevent preterm birth: an open-label pilot randomized controlled trial [^0362dc88]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Prevention of spontaneous preterm birth remains one of the most important challenges in modern maternity care. Whilst an association between ascending infection and preterm birth is undisputed, research focussed on finding effective preventive treatments has been disappointing. To date, most treatment trials (e.g. for bacterial vaginosis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, trichomoniasis) have found little effect on the rate of preterm birth. In contrast, in a randomized controlled trial of early antenatal screening (15-19 weeks) and treatment for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis and/or trichomoniasis in early pregnancy, Kiss and colleagues reported a 46% reduction in the spontaneous preterm birth rate. Post-hoc subgroup analyses of this trial suggest the benefit was primarily among those women who were treated for asymptomatic candidiasis.

Infection and preterm birth

Microbiological studies suggest that intrauterine infections account for 25-40% of preterm births; but this is likely to be an under-estimate because intrauterine infection is difficult to detect with conventional culture techniques. The mechanisms by which intrauterine infections lead to preterm labour relate to activation of the innate immune system. Microorganisms are recognised by pattern-recognition receptors which in turn elicit the release of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. Microbial endotoxins and proinflammatory cytokines stimulate the production of prostaglandins, other inflammatory mediators, and matrix-degrading enzymes. Prostaglandins stimulate uterine contractility and initiate labour, while degradation of extracellular matrix in the fetal membranes leads to preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes.

Recognition that it is ascending infection that leads to preterm birth has led to a number of studies that have evaluated the treatment of vaginal infection in pregnancy to reduce preterm birth [-]. To date, most of the intervention trials have found little effect on the rate of preterm birth. Antibiotics prior to pregnancy do not reduce preterm birth. A Cochrane systematic review of the effectiveness of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis to prevent prematurity concludes that there is "little evidence that screening and treating all pregnant women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis will prevent preterm birth and its consequences". Similarly, antibiotic treatment of vaginal Ureaplasma urealyticum and Chlamydia trachomatis have not significantly reduced preterm birth rates. Finally, there is a possibility that the use of metronidazole to treat trichomoniasis in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of prematurity.

In contrast to these negative results, a recent randomised controlled trial of antenatal screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis and/or trichomoniasis in early pregnancy (15-19 weeks gestation) among over 4 000 asymptomatic pregnant women reduced the spontaneous preterm birth rate by 46%. The benefit appeared to be limited to those women who were treated for asymptomatic candidiasis, however this interpretation is based on post-hoc subgroup analysis of this trial. On the other hand, two observational studies that included Candida in pregnancy, conducted in low socioeconomic populations in the USA in the 1980 s, found no association with preterm birth although one found a significantly increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation among women with candidiasis (aOR 1.94, 95%CI 1.2-3.1). Importantly, in the latter, studies screening was performed later in pregnancy (22-30 weeks gestation) and did not include women with low-level Candida colonisation. Such conflicting results emphasise the need to evaluate interventions with appropriately designed randomised clinical trials.

### Antenatal lower genital tract infection screening and treatment programs for preventing preterm delivery [^b599ce1a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm birth is birth before 37 weeks' gestation. Genital tract infection is one of the causes of preterm birth. Infection screening during pregnancy has been used to reduce preterm birth. However, infection screening may have some adverse effects, e.g. increased antibiotic drug resistance, increased costs of treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and complications of antenatal lower genital tract infection screening and treatment programs in reducing preterm birth and subsequent morbidity.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (January 2008) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 2).

Selection Criteria

We included all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials in any language that evaluated any described methods of antenatal lower genital tract infection screening compared with no screening. Preterm births have been reported as an outcome.

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

One study (4155 women) met the inclusion criteria. This trial is of high methodological quality. In the intervention group (2058 women), the results of infection screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis, trichomonas vaginalis and candidiasis were reported; in the control group (2097 women), the results of the screening program for the women allocated to receive routine antenatal care were not reported. Preterm birth before 37 weeks was significantly lower in the intervention group (3% versus 5% in the control group) with a relative risk (RR) of 0.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.75). The incidence of preterm birth for low birthweight preterm infants with a weight equal to or below 2500 g and very low birthweight infants with a weight equal to or below 1500 g were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.66 and RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.75, respectively).

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that infection screening and treatment programs in pregnant women may reduce preterm birth and preterm low birthweights. Future trials should evaluate the effects of types of infection screening program, gestational ages at screening test and the costs of introducing an infection screening program.

Introduction

Globally, an estimated 14·8 million infants were born preterm (<37 weeks' gestation) in 2014, and preterm birth rates are increasing in many countries.More than 90% of preterm births occur in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs),where access to, and quality of, antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care vary. Complications from preterm birth are now the leading cause of child mortality and account for 1 million neonatal deaths annually.Survivors of preterm birth have increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment, stunting, and chronic disease.Thus, effective strategies are needed for primary prevention of preterm birth in LMICs.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

A third of preterm births are attributed to pregnancy infections, which are commonly undetected and untreated in low-income and middle-income countries. Abnormal vaginal flora (bacterial vaginosis and intermediate flora—ie, Nugent scores ≥4) is significantly associated with preterm birth. However, routine antenatal screening is not recommended in the general obstetric population. In a Cochrane review, screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in the general obstetric population did not reduce the risk of preterm birth (pooled risk ratio 0·88 [95% CI 0·71–1·09]; n=6491 from 13 trials). However, in pooled analysis of two trials (n=894 women) in the UK that targeted all abnormal vaginal flora, treatment with clindamycin significantly reduced preterm births before 37 weeks (risk ratio 0·53 [95% CI 0·34–0·84]) compared with treatment with placebo. Antenatal screening and treatment of bacteriuria in pregnancy is recommended by WHO. There is strong evidence that such screening and treatment reduces maternal pyelonephritis. However, with respect to birth outcomes, Cochrane grades the quality of evidence as low for preterm birth (risk ratio 0·27 [95% CI 0·11–0·62]; n=242 participants) and low birthweight (risk ratio 0·64 [0·45–0·93]; n=1437 participants). Most studies were done in the 1960s or 1970s, and this strategy of antenatal screening and treatment of bacteriuria has not been rigorously assessed in a low-middle-income country.

### Early clindamycin for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy (PREMEVA): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^76fd8670]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Preterm delivery during pregnancy (<37 weeks' gestation) is a leading cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. Treating bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy can reduce poor outcomes, such as preterm birth. We aimed to investigate whether treatment of bacterial vaginosis decreases late miscarriages or spontaneous very preterm birth.

Methods

PREMEVA was a double-blind randomised controlled trial done in 40 French centres. Women aged 18 years or older with bacterial vaginosis and low-risk pregnancy were eligible for inclusion and were randomly assigned (2:1) to three parallel groups: single-course or triple-course 300 mg clindamycin twice-daily for 4 days, or placebo. Women with high-risk pregnancy outcomes were eligible for inclusion in a high-risk subtrial and were randomly assigned (1:1) to either single-course or triple-course clindamycin. The primary outcome was a composite of late miscarriage (16-21 weeks) or spontaneous very preterm birth (22-32 weeks), which we assessed in all patients with delivery data (modified intention to treat). Adverse events were systematically reported. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00642980.

Findings

Between April 1, 2006, and June 30, 2011, we screened 84530 pregnant women before 14 weeks' gestation. 5630 had bacterial vaginosis, of whom 3105 were randomly assigned to groups in the low-risk trial (n=943 to receive single-course clindamycin, n=968 to receive triple-course clindamycin, and n=958 to receive placebo) or high-risk subtrial (n=122 to receive single-course clindamycin and n=114 to receive triple-course clindamycin). In 2869 low-risk pregnancies, the primary outcome occurred in 22 (1·2%) of 1904 participants receiving clindamycin and 10 (1·0%) of 956 participants receiving placebo (relative risk [RR] 1·10, 95% CI 0·53-2·32; p=0·82). In 236 high-risk pregnancies, the primary outcome occurred in 5 (4·4%) participants in the triple-course clindamycin group and 8 (6·0%) participants in the single-course clindamycin group (RR 0·67, 95% CI 0·23-2·00; p=0·47). In the low-risk trial, adverse events were more common in the clindamycin groups than in the placebo group (58 [3·0%] of 1904 vs 12 [1·3%] of 956; p=0·0035). The most commonly reported adverse event was diarrhoea (30 [1·6%] in the clindamycin groups vs 4 [0·4%] in the placebo group; p=0·0071); abdominal pain was also observed in the clindamycin groups (9 [0·6%] participants) versus none in the placebo group (p=0·034). No severe adverse event was reported in any group. Adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes did not differ significantly between groups in the high-risk subtrial.

Interpretation

Systematic screening and subsequent treatment for bacterial vaginosis in women with low-risk pregnancies shows no evidence of risk reduction of late miscarriage or spontaneous very preterm birth. Use of antibiotics to prevent preterm delivery in this patient population should be reconsidered.

### Screening and treatment of maternal genitourinary tract infections in early pregnancy to prevent preterm birth in rural sylhet, Bangladesh: a cluster randomized trial [^1b80c6ec]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Abnormal vaginal flora (AVF), including bacterial vaginosis (BV), is the most prevalent vaginal infection in pregnancy, and is significantly associated with increased risk of preterm birth. AVF is triggered by an imbalance in the concentrations of endogenous vaginal microflora—a reduction in normal lactobacilli and the opportunistic overgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobic organisms. Nugent et al. defined a scoring system (0–10) for vaginal flora based on a weighted combination of the relative concentrations of 3 bacterial morphotypes: Lactobacillus, Gardnerella or Bacteroides, and curved gram-variable rods (Mobiluncus) [BV = Nugent score ≥ 7, intermediate flora: Nugent score 4–6, and AVF: Nugent score ≥4]. In a meta-analysis of 32 studies, asymptomatic BV was associated with a 6.32 times elevated risk of late miscarriage (95 % CI 3.65–10.94) and 2.16 times increased risk of preterm birth (95 % CI 1.56–3.00). Furthermore, intermediate vaginal flora is a heterogeneous condition which comprises ~15 % of all AVF, and has been associated with elevated risk of preterm birth and neonatal infections. Among women with a prior history of preterm birth, Hauth and colleagues found that screening and treatment of asymptomatic BV with metronidazole and erythromycin at 22 weeks gestation significantly reduced the incidence of preterm birth from 46 to 31 % in the treatment group. In the multi-center National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) BV trial, 1953 average-risk women with asymptomatic BV between 16 and 24 weeks of gestation were randomized to receive two doses of metronidazole (2 g) or placebo. Treatment, however, did not significantly affect preterm delivery or other adverse perinatal outcomes. In a more recent trial, Ugwumadu et al. reported that early (12–22 weeks of gestation) screening and treatment for AVF with 5 days of oral clindamycin resulted in a significant reduction in spontaneous preterm birth rate (12 % in placebo vs. 5 % in treatment group) and late miscarriage (13–24 weeks; 4 % in placebo vs. 1 % in treatment group). Lamont et al. randomized women with AVF between 13 and 20 weeks gestation to receive intravaginal clindamycin cream or placebo between 13 and 20 weeks gestation, and found that among infected women, there was a significant reduction in preterm birth incidence (10 % in control vs. 4 % in treatment group). Potential explanations for the treatment effect in the two latter trials may include: 1) the earlier timing of treatment, prior to the amniotic membranes sealing the uterus at 20 weeks, which may prevent early ascension of bacteria into the intrauterine cavity; 2) antibiotic choice: 5–7 day course of clindamycin, which has greater activity against Mobiluncus and atypical Mycoplasma species vs. 2 days of metronidazole ; and 3) treatment of AVF in Ugwumadu et al. and Lamont et al. vs. treatment of BV only in the average-risk NICHD trial. A Cochrane meta-analysis including 15 trials (n=5888 women) concluded that BV treatment across all gestational ages did not significantly reduce preterm birth, largely due to heterogeneity in definition, timing of treatment and choice of antibiotic. However, the risk of preterm birth was significantly reduced by treatment of BV at <20 weeks gestation (5 trials in 2387 women; OR 0.63, 95 % CI 0.48–0.84) and treatment of AVF (2 trials, 894 women; OR 0.51, 95 % CI 0.32–0.81). Thus, in low-resource settings such as rural Bangladesh, where BV and preterm birth are prevalent, treatment of AVF in early pregnancy may hold promise in reducing the incidence of preterm birth. Evaluation in a well-conducted population-based randomized trial is needed.

### Antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy: a meta-analysis [^cfaeebf4]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy to reduce preterm delivery.

Study Design

We performed a meta-analysis of published, English-language, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women with intact amniotic membranes at <37 weeks of gestation. Primary outcomes included preterm delivery, perinatal or neonatal death, and neonatal morbidity.

Results

Ten studies with results for 3969 patients were included. In patients without preterm labor, antibiotic treatment did not significantly decrease preterm delivery at <37 weeks of gestation, in all patients combined (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.57-1.21) nor in high-risk patients with a previous preterm delivery (odds ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.22-1.12). In both groups, significant statistical heterogeneity was observed. A significant reduction in preterm delivery and no statistical heterogeneity were observed in 338 high-risk patients who received oral regimens with treatment durations of > or =7 days (odds ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.27-0.67). Nonsignificant effects and no statistical heterogeneity were observed in low-risk patients (odds ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.71-1.25) and with vaginal regimens (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% CI: 0.86-1.81). In one study antibiotic treatment in patients with preterm labor led to a nonsignificant decrease in the rate of preterm deliveries (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.03-3.24).

Conclusion

The screening of pregnant women who have bacterial vaginosis and who have had a previous preterm delivery and treatment with an oral regimen of longer duration can be justified on the basis of current evidence. More studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this strategy, both in high-risk patients without preterm labor and in patients with preterm labor.

### Effect of population-based antenatal screening and treatment of genitourinary tract infections on birth outcomes in sylhet, Bangladesh (MIST): a cluster-randomised clinical trial [^98c7a0e1]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis, the most prevalent reproductive tract infection in pregnancy globally, is consistently associated with preterm birth.It is a polymicrobial syndrome triggered by imbalance in concentrations of endogenous vaginal microflora and overgrowth of anaerobic species.The term abnormal vaginal flora includes bacterial vaginosis and an earlier transitional state towards bacterial vaginosis, which is known as intermediate flora.Screening and treatment of bacterial vaginosis has no effect on preterm delivery in low-risk pregnancies,and the US Preventive Services Task Force advises against routine screening in asymptomatic pregnant women.However, two randomised placebo-controlled trials,in the UK in women with abnormal vaginal flora showed that treatment in early pregnancy (ie, <24 weeks), before the sealing of the amniotic membranes, reduced the incidence of preterm birth. These trials separately examined oraland intravaginaltreatment with clindamycin, demonstrating substantive (>50%) reductions in risk of preterm birth.

Urinary tract infections affect an estimated one in four pregnant women in LMICs.In the USA in the 1960s, before routine screening was introduced, 40% of pregnant women with untreated bacteriuria developed pyelonephritis,and 30–50% of women with pyelonephritis delivered preterm.In a meta-analysis,pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria had a two-times higher risk of preterm delivery (relative risk 2·00 [95% CI 1·43–2·77]) compared with those without bacteriuria. Although evidence for the effect of treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria on preterm birth risk is weak,treatment significantly reduces maternal pyelonephritisand risk of low birthweight, and screening and treatment are recommended in pregnancy by the Infectious Diseases Society of America,Canadian Task Force on Preventive Care,and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.In 2016, WHO made context-specific antenatal care recommendations for screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in LMICs.

We hypothesised that abnormal vaginal flora and urinary tract infections were prevalent and not adequately addressed in the rural district of Sylhet in Bangladesh. In view of strong observational data, promising preliminary intervention studies of treatment of abnormal vaginal flora,,and an absence of effective primary prevention measures in low-income and middle-income settings, we aimed to assess the effect of a community-based antenatal screening and treatment programme for abnormal vaginal flora and urinary tract infections in early pregnancy (13–19 weeks) on population-level rates of preterm birth in Sylhet.

### Effectiveness and costs of molecular screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis to prevent preterm birth: the auTop randomized clinical trial [^c5ada331]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Primary Outcomes

Clinical and economic outcomes were compared between groups, and if found relevant, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, expressed as the incremental cost per additional unit of effectiveness gained, was calculated. The effectiveness outcome was the rate of births before 37 weeks’ gestation. Total costs included screening with point-of-care qPCR, control vaginal swabs for women with positive test results and subsequent antibiotic treatments, antenatal hospital admissions, physicians’ consultations, management of complications during pregnancy (either through inpatient or outpatient care), and neonatal care for full-term and preterm infants.

Secondary and Exploratory Outcomes

Prespecified secondary clinical outcomes were rates of preterm birth before 26, 28, and 32 weeks’ gestation, premature rupture of membranes, intrauterine growth restriction, endometritis, and total hospital length of stay. Other exploratory outcomes measured in the intervention group were rate of BV, treatment recurrence rate (defined as a positive control vaginal swab using qPCR after a previous control vaginal swab was negative), spontaneous abortion (before 22 weeks’ gestation), late miscarriage (between 22 and 24 weeks’ gestation), fetal death, preeclampsia, vaginal bleeding, neonatal infection, transfers, length of stay, and neonatal mortality.

Sample Size

The control group was expected to have a preterm birth rate of 4.3% and the screen and treat group a preterm birth rate of 3.0%.With a statistical power of 80%, a threshold for statistical significance set at a P value of.05, and assuming that 20% of patients will be lost to follow-up, the sample size was calculated to be 6800 women (3400 per group) to achieve statistical significance of the effect size. This sample size enabled the cost-effectiveness of the screen and treat intervention to be assessed at an estimated threshold of €22 500 (US $24 089) with an expected incremental cost of €230 (US $246).

### Infection, antibiotics, and preterm delivery [^bf2729b2]. Seminars in Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

The relationship between genital tract infection and preterm delivery has been established on the basis of biochemical, microbiological, and clinical evidence. In theory, pathogenic bacteria may ascend from the lower reproductive tract into the uterus, and the resulting inflammation leads to preterm labor, rupture of the membranes, and birth. A growing body of evidence suggests that preterm labor and/rupture of the membranes are triggered by micro-organisms in the genital tract and by the host response to these organisms, ie, elaboration of cytokines and proteolytic enzymes. Epidemiologic and in vitro studies do not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between infection and preterm birth. However, the preponderance of evidence indicates that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic lower genital tract infections such as bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomoniasis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia will lower the risk of preterm delivery. Based on current evidence, pregnant women who note an abnormal vaginal discharge should be tested for BV, trichomonas, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Those who test positive should be treated appropriately. A 3- to 7-day course of antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy is clinically indicated to reduce the risk of pyelonephritis and preterm delivery. Routine screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea should be performed for women at high risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases. The practice of routine screening for BV in asymptomatic women who are at low risk for preterm delivery cannot be supported based on evidence from the literature. Routine screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy is cost-effective, particularly in high-prevalence populations. The results of antibiotic trials for the treatment of preterm labor have been inconsistent. In the absence of reasonable evidence that antimicrobial therapy leads to significant prolongation of pregnancy in the setting of preterm labor, antibiotics should be used only for protecting the neonate from group B streptococci sepsis. They should not be used for the purpose of prolonging pregnancy. Multiple investigations have shown that, in patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes, prophylactic antibiotics are of value in prolonging the latent period between rupture of the membranes and onset of labor and in reducing the incidence of maternal and neonatal infection. The most extensively tested effective antibiotic regimen for prophylaxis involves erythromycin alone or in combination with ampicilln. Controversy still exists regarding the appropriate length and route of antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Effectiveness and costs of molecular screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis to prevent preterm birth: the auTop randomized clinical trial [^145f2d53]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, our study is the largest prospective randomized study including low-risk pregnant women and the first to use molecular tools for the diagnosis of BV. Our intervention based on a molecular screening and treatment of positive BV did not significantly reduce the relative risks of preterm birth or improve secondary maternal and neonate outcomes. In contrast to the apparent lack of benefit in the overall study population, in the subgroup of nulliparous women, the effect of the intervention was a significant 38% reduction in risk of preterm births (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45-0.84). To note, among the 6671 study participants, more than 3438 women were nulliparous, and were distributed in a balanced way between the 2 groups. The lower risk of preterm birth in nulliparous women could be explained by the fact that these women had an unknown risk of preterm birth early in pregnancy. Conversely, multiparous women in our study had a very low risk because they had no history of preterm birth or late miscarriage. The lower treatment rate in multiparous women (79.1% [102 of 129] vs 85.0% [96 of 113]) may be another explanation. Because the literature reports differences in the level of risk factors for preterm birth in multiparous and nulliparous women, we can speculate that the effect of treatment would be different in these subgroups. In the AuTop trial, women included in the screen and treat group were enrolled in a screening program. Thus, the risk perception of the women and their obstetricians/midwives could have been modified. This may partly explain our results in favor of the intervention.

### Indications for therapy and treatment recommendations for bacterial vaginosis in nonpregnant and pregnant women: a synthesis of data [^42a3b8ac]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Accumulating evidence has associated bacterial vaginosis (BV) with serious medical complications such as premature delivery. The present article synthesizes available data on the treatment of nonpregnant and pregnant women with BV to prevent preterm delivery. A literature search identified articles published since 1976 that evaluated treatment of BV. An intention-to-treat sensitivity analysis was performed, to better compare studies. Studies that evaluated therapy efficacy varied with regard to diagnostic criteria, patient characteristics, clinicians, and laboratories. Therapies varied in efficacy for cure 4 or more weeks after therapy, from 48% to 85%. Intervention studies to reduce BV-related adverse outcomes of pregnancy differed in populations studied, medication used, type of therapy (oral or intravaginal), and timing of treatment. The benefit of treating women at high risk with oral metronidazole has been shown in several studies; however, the effect of treating women without a history of premature delivery is unclear. The use of intravaginal clindamycin therapy, especially during the latter half of the second trimester and thereafter, appears to increase infections during the neonatal period.

### Placental inflammation is associated with rural and remote residence in the Northern territory, Australia: a cross-sectional study [^3024ce2f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Since the establishment of this causal pathway, the evidence for screening, detecting and treating genitourinary infections in the prevention of preterm delivery is emerging. Kiss and associates reported one of the first randomised controlled trials investigating the role of a simple screening program for asymptomatic vaginal infections in 4155 women in the Vienna in 2001. Since then, there have been further trials and now systematic reviews and meta-analyses that support the use of antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteruria and bacterial vaginosis. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis has shown a reduction in preterm birth with the detection and treatment of intermediate flora or bacterial vaginosis, (two trials including 894 women, RR 0.54, 95% CI [0.35 – 0.84]). A second systematic review of asymptomatic genital infections in the prevention or reduction of preterm delivery included one eligible trial by Kiss and associates (4155 women, RR 0.48, 95% CI [0.34 – 66]). In both meta-analyses, preterm delivery rates have been reduced by 40 to 50%. Costs, antibiotic adverse effects and the risk of antibiotic resistance, remain concerns with ongoing debate regarding the most effective type and route of administration (vaginal or oral).

### Effect of population-based antenatal screening and treatment of genitourinary tract infections on birth outcomes in sylhet, Bangladesh (MIST): a cluster-randomised clinical trial [^519be74f]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Our study had several limitations. We tested for infections before 20 weeks' gestation, because we hypothesised that early treatment would prevent bacterial seeding of the amniotic fluid. We did not test for infection in later pregnancy. We targeted two infections that we hypothesised would have high prevalence in our population. However, we did not screen for other genital tract infections, such as trichomonas, candida, or sexually transmitted infections that have been associated with preterm birth for which treatment has been effective.Another limitation is that our study findings might not be generalisable to other regions. Infection prevalence was low in our rural south Asian population. Bacterial vaginosis affected 38% of pregnant women in a study in South Africa and Kenya,and the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria was 86·6% in a Nigerian study.A screening and treatment programme might have more of an effect on the incidence of preterm birth in settings with higher infection burden. We did not have clinical data of sufficient quality to disaggregate preterm birth as spontaneous versus medically indicated. However, most preterm births are spontaneous in this setting, because access to intrapartum care is poor. Only 6% of preterm births were delivered by caesarean section in our population. Finally, our method of establishing gestational age could be considered a limitation. Ultrasonography was not feasible in this trial. We used a menstrual calendar with monthly pregnancy surveillance for early detection of missed periods. This method was validated in Ghaibandha, Bangladesh,and had high diagnostic accuracy for identification of preterm births compared with ultrasonographic dating (sensitivity 96%, specificity 89%).Thus, we think that our gestational age estimates were accurate for measurement of the primary study outcome.

### Evidence-based prenatal care: part II. third-trimester care and prevention of infectious diseases [^6855718c]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

All pregnant women should be offered screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria, syphilis, rubella, and hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus infection early in pregnancy. Women at increased risk should be tested for hepatitis C infection, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. All women should be questioned about their history of chickenpox and genital or orolabial herpes. Routine screening for bacterial vaginosis is not recommended. Influenza vaccination is recommended in women who will be in their second or third trimester of pregnancy during flu season. Women should be offered vaginorectal culture screening for group B streptococcal infection at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation. Colonized women and women with a history of group B streptococcal bacteriuria should be offered intrapartum intravenous antibiotics. Screening for gestational diabetes remains controversial. Women should be offered labor induction after 41 weeks' gestation.

### Effect of early oral clindamycin on late miscarriage and preterm delivery in asymptomatic women with abnormal vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis: a randomised controlled trial [^2c138b79]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Abnormal vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis are associated with amplified risks of late miscarriage and spontaneous preterm delivery. We aimed to establish whether antibiotic treatment early in the second trimester might reduce these risks in a general obstetric population.

Methods

We screened 6120 pregnant women attending hospital for their first antenatal visit--who were at 12-22 weeks' gestation (mean 15.6 weeks)--for bacterial vaginosis or abnormal vaginal flora. We used gram-stained slides of vaginal smears to diagnose abnormal vaginal flora or bacterial vaginosis, in accordance with Nugent's criteria. We randomly allocated 494 women with one of these signs to receive either clindamycin 300 mg or placebo orally twice daily for 5 days. Primary endpoints were spontaneous preterm delivery (birth > or =24 but <37 weeks) and late miscarriage (pregnancy loss > or =13 but <24 weeks). Analysis was intention to treat.

Findings

Nine women were lost to follow-up or had elective termination. Thus, we analysed 485 women with complete outcome data. Women receiving clindamycin had significantly fewer miscarriages or preterm deliveries (13/244) than did those in the placebo group (38/241; percentage difference 10.4%, 95% CI 5.0-15.8, p=0.0003). Clindamycin also reduced adverse outcomes across the range of abnormal Nugent scores, with maximum effect in women with the highest Nugent score of 10.

Interpretation

Treatment of asymptomatic abnormal vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis with oral clindamycin early in the second trimester significantly reduces the rate of late miscarriage and spontaneous preterm birth in a general obstetric population.

### Antibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy [^78b21291]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora with an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and a lack of the normal lactobacillary flora. Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has been associated with poor perinatal outcome and, in particular, preterm birth. Identification and treatment may reduce the risk of preterm birth and its consequences.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (May 2004).

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment, or comparing two or more antibiotic regimens in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal flora.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers assessed trials and extracted data independently. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

Thirteen trials involving 5300 women were included; all were of good quality. Antibiotic therapy was effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy (odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.24, nine trials of 3895 women). Treatment was not significant in reducing the risk of preterm birth before 37 weeks (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03, thirteen trials of 5300 women, and there was significant heterogeneity between trials, p-value 0.002), preterm birth before 34 weeks (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.19, five trials of 851 women), preterm birth before 32 weeks (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.70, four trials of 3565 women), or the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.28, four trials of 2579 women). In women with a previous preterm birth, treatment did not affect the risk of subsequent preterm birth (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.17, five trials of 622 women, with significant heterogeneity between these trials); however, it may decrease the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.38, two trials of 114 women, and low birthweight (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.75, two trials of 114 women).

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment can eradicate bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. However, this review provides little evidence that screening and treating all pregnant women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis will prevent preterm birth and its consequences. For women with a previous preterm birth, there is some suggestion that treatment of bacterial vaginosis may reduce the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes and low birthweight.

### Effect of population-based antenatal screening and treatment of genitourinary tract infections on birth outcomes in sylhet, Bangladesh (MIST): a cluster-randomised clinical trial [^75a165ba]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

However, reductions in the incidence of preterm birth were reported in previous trials that targeted abnormal vaginal flora (ie, intermediate flora in addition to bacterial vaginosis). In a pooled analysis in the Cochrane reviewof two trials,(combined n=894) that targeted abnormal vaginal flora (ie, intermediate flora and bacterial vaginosis), treatment of abnormal vaginal flora was associated with significant reductions in the frequency of preterm birth (ie, <37 weeks' gestation; RR 0·53 [95% CI 0·34–0·84]).

Unlike in these two trials,,in which individual participants were randomly assigned to receive either clindamycin or placebo, we assessed a population-level screening and treatment approach. The overall effective coverage of treatment success for abnormal vaginal flora in our trial was low (58%) despite repeated oral clindamycin therapy for persistent infection. In our post-hoc analysis, compared with participants without abnormal vaginal flora, persistent abnormal vaginal flora was associated with a 45% increased risk of preterm birth, even after adjustment for other risk factors. Conversely, participants with abnormal vaginal flora who responded to antibiotic therapy had risks of preterm birth similar to those of their non-infected peers. Although we did not identify other studies in which the prevalence of persistent abnormal vaginal flora was reported, persistent bacterial vaginosis is a well described clinical entity, with a frequency of recurrence of 15–30% within 3 months of metronidazole treatment and only half of mothers remaining non-infected in long-term follow-up.We anticipated higher rates of cure with oral clindamycin in our trial, because the drug has good clinical efficacy against intermediate flora, anaerobic species,and persistent bacterial vaginosis(specifically metronidazole-resistant Gardnerella vaginalis).The microbial composition of abnormal vaginal flora could differ in the Bangladeshi population compared with that in the UK study populations in which the clinical efficacy of clindamycin was established.Abnormal vaginal flora is a heterogeneous, polymicrobial condition, and the vaginal microbiome varies between ethnic groups in the USA and Africa.Differences in antibiotic response have also been reported between US and Kenyan women.Furthermore, certain microbiota, including bacterial-vaginosis-associated bacteria-2and Lactobacillus iners,are associated with persistent bacterial vaginosis and vaginal inflammation. Study of the vaginal microbiome in our population is needed to identify the specific microbiota associated with persistent abnormal vaginal flora and to target diagnostics and antimicrobial treatment against these species.

### Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of treatment of asymptomatic candidiasis for the prevention of preterm birth [ ACTRN12610000607077 ] [^5955238f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

• there is a concordance in risk factors for Candida colonisation and risk factors for preterm birth including African-American women, maternal medical conditions, low socio-economic status, and bacterial vaginosis 

• Candida can be isolated from the amniotic fluid of women with spontaneous preterm birth 

• within the oral endothelium Candida increases gene expression of metalloproteinases. Similar effects are seen in vitro in the genital tract as Candida increases metalloproteinase 9 production by chorioamniotic membranes. Metalloproteinase 9 is a connective tissue remodelling protein which has an important role in the origin of preterm labour and preterm premature rupture of the membranes.

Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that eradication of Candida in pregnancy may reduce the risk of preterm birth and late miscarriage:

• Kiss and colleagues reported that screening and treatment for infections between 15 and 19 weeks of gestation in 4429 asymptomatic women reduced the preterm birth rate by 46%. Those with: candidiasis (n = 586, 14.1%) were treated with vaginal clotrimazole; trichomonas with vaginal metronidazole; and bacterial vaginosis with vaginal clindamycin. The benefit appeared to be in women treated for candidiasis: spontaneous preterm birth occurred in only 8 of 289 (2.8%) women treated for candidiasis compared with 22 of 291 (7.6%) women with untreated candidiasis in the control group (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14-0.84 P = 0.009). However this is a post-hoc analysis and the numbers are small.

### Interventions to prevent and manage infections in pregnancy [^c8801d15]. Neonatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A total of thirteen interventions constituting antenatal infection prevention and management strategies were identified and analyzed. Overall and LMIC-specific evidence suggested that influenza virus vaccination had no effect on stillbirth, preterm birth, SGA, or LBW. Evidence from LMICs suggested that ITNs in pregnancy reduced the risk of fetal loss due to stillbirth/miscarriage and improved the babies’ birthweight but had no effect on preterm birth or LBW. Changing a two-dose IPTp regimen to more frequent IPTp dosing decreased the risk of LBW babies and significantly improved babies’ birthweight; however, the intervention had no effect on stillbirth, preterm birth, or neonatal mortality in LMIC-only setting. The addition of antibacterial antibiotic to the IPTp regimen significantly reduced the risk of LBW babies. Overall, screening and treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria had no effect on preterm births, LBW babies, birthweight, or gestational age. LMIC-specific evidence suggested a decrease in the risk of SGA, but no effect was demonstrated on the risks of stillbirth, preterm birth, LBW, or neonatal mortality rate. Preventative anthelmintic treatment during pregnancy had no effect on preterm birth, LBW, or perinatal mortality.

Overall and LMIC-specific evidence suggested clindamycin or metronidazole treatment of pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis had no effect on stillbirth, preterm birth, LBW, extremely LBW, or neonatal mortality. No LMIC evidence was available for metronidazole treatment of pregnant women with current bacterial vaginosis and a history of previous preterm birth. Overall evidence suggested that antibiotic treatment for syphilis reduced the risks of stillbirth, preterm birth, LBW, and perinatal mortality, while a significant reduction was noted for risk of stillbirth, preterm birth, and LBW. Overall evidence suggested that antibiotics for the treatment of chlamydia reduced the risk of preterm birth, but no significant effect was noted in LMICs. Overall and LMIC evidence demonstrated the treatment of documented periodontal disease during pregnancy reduced the risk of LBW babies, but no effect was observed on the risks of preterm births, LBW, or SGA babies.

### Benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: a systematic review [^b225f0b6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Most European and North American clinical practice guidelines recommend screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) as a routine pregnancy test. Antibiotic treatment of ASB in pregnant women is supposed to reduce maternal upper urinary tract infections (upper UTIs) and preterm labour. However, most studies supporting the treatment of ASB were conducted in the 1950s to 1980s. Because of subsequent changes in treatment options for ASB and UTI, the applicability of findings from these studies has come into question. Our systematic review had three objectives: firstly, to assess the patient-relevant benefits and harms of screening for ASB versus no screening; secondly, to compare the benefits and harms of different screening strategies; and thirdly, in case no reliable evidence on the overarching screening question was identified, to determine the benefits and harms of treatment of ASB.

Methods

We systematically searched several bibliographic databases, trial registries, and other sources (up to 02/2016) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective non-randomised trials. Two authors independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles and assessed the risk of bias of the studies included. As meta-analyses were not possible, we summarised the results qualitatively.

Results

We did not identify any eligible studies that investigated the benefits and harms of screening for ASB versus no screening or that compared different screening strategies. We identified four RCTs comparing antibiotics with no treatment or placebo in 454 pregnant women with ASB. The results of 2 studies published in the 1960s showed a statistically significant reduction in rates of pyelonephritis (odds ratio [OR] = 0.21, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.07–0.59) and lower UTI (OR = 0.10, 95 % CI 0.03–0.35) in women treated with antibiotics. By contrast, event rates reported by a recent study were not statistically significantly different, neither regarding pyelonephritis (0 % vs. 2.2 %; OR = 0.37, CI 0.01–9.25, p = 0.515) nor regarding lower UTI during pregnancy (10 % vs. 18 %; Peto odds ratio [POR] = 0.53, CI 0.16–1.79, p = 0.357). Data were insufficient to determine the risk of harms. As three of the four studies were conducted several decades ago and have serious methodological shortcomings, the applicability of their findings to current health care settings is likely to be low. The recent high-quality RCT was stopped early due to a very low number of primary outcome events, a composite of preterm delivery and pyelonephritis. Therefore, the results did not show a benefit of treating ASB.

Conclusions

To date, no reliable evidence supports routine screening for ASB in pregnant women.

### ACOG issues recommendations on assessment of risk (...) [^a46a7578]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

The committee on Practice Bulletins—Obstetrics of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has issued new recommendations on assessing risk factors for preterm birth. ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 31, which replaces Technical Bulletin No. 206 issued in June 1995, appears in the October 2001 issue of Obstetrics and Gynecology. These recommendations discuss risk factors, markers for predicting preterm birth, and clinical considerations. Diagnosis and Predicting Risk According to ACOG, preterm labor is defined as regular contractions associated with cervical change before 37 weeks' gestation. Spontaneous preterm birth includes preterm labor, preterm spontaneous rupture of membranes, and cervical incompetence. The pathophysiologic events that trigger preterm birth are largely unknown but may include decidual hemorrhage, uterine overdistention, and hormonal changes possibly mediated by fetal or maternal stress.

Certain bacterial infections also have been associated with preterm labor, including. Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Peptostreptococcus and Bacteroides species. These organisms are usually of low virulence, and it is unclear whether they are etiologic or associated with an acute inflammatory response of another etiology. Predicting risk of preterm labor is only valuable if there is an available intervention that is likely to improve the situation. Even though maternal tocolytic and steroid therapies may prolong pregnancy and decrease morbidity and mortality, they should be limited to those with true preterm labor at high risk for spontaneous preterm birth because of possible fetal and maternal consequences. Identifying women at risk allows for appropriate transfer to a facility with the needed resources, and it avoids the use of unnecessary interventions in those at low risk.

Biologic Markers Home Uterine Activity Monitoring Home uterine activity monitoring has been suggested as a method for predicting preterm birth in high-risk women. It combines telemetric recordings of uterine contractions using a tocodynamometer and daily telephone calls from a physician to offer support and advice. This method was based on the observation that some women who give birth early have an increase in uterine activity earlier in pregnancy than women who give birth at term, and that these uterine contractions may not be recognized by the patient. Studies of HUAM vary in design, inclusion criteria, and measurements of endpoints and outcomes, making comparisons difficult. Because of study limitations, varying results, and flawed study designs, there is uncertainty about the usefulness of HUAM. The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force and the U. S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that the device was not effective.

Data are insufficient to support HUAM in preventing preterm birth, and it is not recommended. Salivary Estriol Observational studies have shown that maternal levels of serum estradiol and salivary estriol increase before the onset of spontaneous term and preterm labor. A test using salivary estriol levels was designed to predict preterm delivery, but maternal estriol levels peak at night and may be suppressed by betamethasone administration. The test carries a high percentage of false-positive results and can add significantly to the cost of prenatal care if used in the low-risk population. Trials with salivary estriol testing have failed to establish its usefulness for anything more than investigational purposes. Bacterial Vaginosis The presence of bacterial vaginosis has been associated with preterm delivery independent of other known risk factors.

### The implication of Chlamydia and bacterial vaginosis among low-risk pregnant women with preterm birth: a prospective multicentric cohort study [^24be02e1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Method

Study design and setting

A prospective cohort study enrolled participants from Al-Yarmouk Teaching Hospital and Al Ramadi Teaching Hospital for Maternity and Children between early 2022 and October 2023. During this period, low-risk pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic who agreed to participate in the study after being briefed about the study’s aim and objectives. The scientific committee of Mustansiriyah University approved the study design, with IRB No. 246, dated February 2022. Participants were screened for CT infection and concurrent BV between weeks of gestation, irrespective of the presenting symptoms. They were further subdivided into two main subgroups, based on CT infection status. Positive CT cases were assigned to the study group, and those who screened negative for CT were allocated to the control group. All participants were followed until the delivery.

The patient criteria and data collection

Inclusion criteria.

Low-risk pregnant women at a confirmed gestational age of (24–28) weeks, willing to participate.
No current antibiotic use or past treatment for CT and BV in the current pregnancy.
Body mass index (BMI) of less than 30 kg/m 2.

Exclusion criteria.

High-risk pregnancy (diabetes, hypertension, multiple pregnancies, positive history of PTB, previous abortion or placenta previa, history of threatened miscarriage).
Current use of drugs (antibiotics, steroids, immunosuppressants) and/or smoking.
Cases terminated by C-section without prior labor due to unrelated obstetric emergencies were excluded to minimize potential confounding.
Missing or incomplete data.

Screening test and therapy regimen. All participants were sent to the lab, where a cervical swab (pap smear) was taken with a spatula. The sample was sent for the detection of CT-associated DNA through a PCR investigation. Positive cases of CT were treated with 1 gram of Azithromycin as a single dose. Additionally, another sample of the vaginal scraping was sent to direct microscope examination with Gram staining for the detection of concurrent association of BV, with the presence of clue cells, a characteristic of BV. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the Whiff test. Positive cases for BV were treated with metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days and repeated in recurrent symptomatic patients following CDC recommendations.

### Prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women: a systematic review [^769a292e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic BV can be treated with oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days. Topical alternatives include vaginal metronidazole gel and clindamycin cream. In multiple recurrent cases of BV, longer therapeutic courses are often recommended. Since BV treatment is based on the presence of abnormal vaginal discharge and the standard syndromic management of STIs, asymptomatic pregnant women may tend to remain untreated due to this therapeutic approach.

In the past, several risk factors have been associated with BV, including race and ethnicity, low socio-economic status, antibiotic therapy, multiple sex partners, smoking, and young or teenage age. However, the risk factors for BV during pregnancy are inconsistent, underreported, and often overlooked. Hence, BV risk factors are typically more prevalent among pregnant women and require further exploration. Clinicians need to understand the risk factors, symptoms, and potential sequelae of BV to monitor and treat women of reproductive age effectively.

The existence of BV among pregnant women has momentously attracted the attention of both clinicians and the scientific community due to its potential link with adverse clinical outcomes during pregnancy. BV has been associated with a higher risk of multiple adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery, miscarriage, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis, and transmission or acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and STIs. Increasing evidence indicates that vaginal microbiota (VMB) dysbiosis may be the causative reason behind premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and preterm birth (PTB). The mechanisms involved in pregnancy complications induced by BV are not fully understood, but it has been suggested that bacterial ascension from the vagina to the membranes and amniotic fluid results in preterm birth. The practical implications of BV during pregnancy are not yet well defined. Further research is needed to formulate the necessary guidelines for prevention and address the associated adverse (maternal/fetal) outcomes. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no previous study to date has explored the current body of literature to collectively synthesize and report the prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of bacterial vaginosis among the pregnant population. Therefore, this is the first systematic review that: (i) delineates the global prevalence of BV among pregnant women receiving antenatal care; (ii) identifies the risk factors associated with BV and; (iii) explores the adverse outcomes during pregnancy due to BV.

### Progesterone, cervical cerclage or cervical pessary to prevent preterm birth: a decision-making analysis of international guidelines [^5c08540e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In clinical practice, physicians and patients often have multiple options to choose from - obstetrics is no exception. The decision criteria may be based on scientific evidence or may be associated with the decision-maker’s attitude (physicians expertise, patient’s preference) or the setting, where the decision is made in.

Preterm birth is still the leading cause of perinatal death and disability. Despite efforts to reduce prematurity in the last decades, prematurity is rising worldwide, currently ranging from 5 to 18% of live births. While experts continue to debate the optimal management, especially before viability, various strategies exist. Conservative approaches include screening for periodontal disease, reduction of physical activity or bed rest, antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis or asymptomatic bacteriuria, and smoking cessation.

Invasive measures include the use of a cervical cerclage (cervical stitch) or a cervical pessary. A cerclage may be inserted as an emergency treatment, when the cervix dilates without contractions (physical examination indicated cerclage). A prophylactic cerclage may be indicated based on the patient’s history - after preterm delivery or preterm rupture of membranes before 34 weeks of gestation and before cervical dilatation occurs (referred to as history-indicated cerclage). An ultrasound-indicated cerclage is applied, when the shortening of the cervix gets evident during a planned ultrasound session e.g. during routine second trimester screening. Rescue cerclage aims to reclose the cervical os and prevent the exposure of the amnion to vaginal bacteria, while history and ultrasound indicated cerclages aim to mechanically support the cervical os, maintaining a biochemical barrier and inducing an inflammatory response. This procedure needs general or regional anesthesia and may cause complications such as iatrogenic rupture of membranes, preterm labor, or intra-amniotic infection, especially in the setting of physical examination indicated cerclage.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 8: interpregnancy care [^7b773733]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

History of high-risk pregnancy—preterm birth: For women who delivered early, obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should obtain a detailed medical history of all previous pregnancies and offer discussion of the preterm birth circumstances, ideally within 6–8 weeks of delivery, and a suggested plan for management of subsequent pregnancies (eg, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, cervical cerclage, cervical length surveillance) should be provided and documented. Women with a history of preterm birth are at increased risk of recurrence and longer-term maternal morbidity, and a prior preterm birth is associated with an increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease. Women with prior preterm births should be counseled that short interpregnancy intervals may differentially and negatively affect subsequent pregnancy outcomes, and given insufficient evidence of benefit, screening and treating asymptomatic genitourinary infections in the interpregnancy period in women at high risk of preterm birth is not recommended.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^cdc94e67]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for asymptomatic bacteriuria, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, pregnant patients, USPSTF 2019 guidelines recommend to screen pregnant females for ASB with a midstream, clean-catch urine for culture at the first prenatal visit or at 12-16 weeks of gestation, whichever is earlier.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^c5656fbc]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Treatment and update of recommendation—pregnancy and nonpregnant adults: Pregnant persons with asymptomatic bacteriuria usually receive antibiotic therapy, based on urine culture results and follow-up monitoring. In this update, the USPSTF continues to recommend screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons with urine culture and recommends against screening in nonpregnant adults; the USPSTF changed the grade for pregnant persons from an “A” to a “B”. Since 1996, the USPSTF has maintained an “A” recommendation for 1-time screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria with urine culture in pregnant persons between 12 and 16 weeks of gestation.

### Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of treatment of asymptomatic candidiasis for the prevention of preterm birth [ ACTRN12610000607077 ] [^ac00be0d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Methods/Design

Aim

to conduct a randomised controlled trial to answer the clinical question

In women with asymptomatic vaginal candidiasis early in pregnancy does treatment with clotrimazole prevent spontaneous preterm birth (less than 37 weeks gestation)?

Hypothesis

that treatment of asymptomatic vaginal candidiasis with clotrimazole is associated with a 40% reduction in spontaneous preterm birth <37 weeks gestation.

Study Design

We will use a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint (PROBE) study design with 2 arms :

Treatment

6-day treatment with vaginal clotrimazole

Usual care

screening result is not revealed, no treatment, routine antenatal care

Although, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trials are regarded as the 'gold standard' of clinical trials, they do have some disadvantages. For our hypothesis, a placebo arm would not represent current clinical practice (no screening and no treatment). Knowledge of vaginal colonisation with Candida may change participants behaviour such that they seek active therapy (clotrimazole vaginal preparations are available over the counter in Australia) rather than, or in addition to, the study medication. Further, the time, expense and feasibility of obtaining a placebo preparation should not be under-estimated. And finally, as a vaginally administered placebo will necessarily contain an alcohol preservative, it may be biologically active and the possibility of an independent affect on vaginal flora cannot be excluded.

These disadvantages can be overcome by a PROBE study design. As in our pilot study, the PROBE study design maintains strict randomisation and allocation concealment procedures but asymptomatic women will be randomised to open-label treatment (Canestan ®), or no treatment and the screening result is not revealed (consistent with current clinical practice) [-]. The primary endpoint (preterm birth) is unambiguously defined and those assessing the end-point will be blinded to the screening results and treatment allocation. Another advantage of using open-labelled medication is that patient management adheres more closely to routine clinical practice than in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, making the results more generalisable to the pragmatic management of patients.

Setting

The study will be carried out in at least five participating maternity hospitals. A range of antenatal care options are provided in these hospitals including standard antenatal clinic care, midwifery-led care, birth centre care, GP-shared care and private obstetric care.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis during the second and third trimester to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes and morbidity [^ce3b2d7f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Several studies have suggested that prophylactic antibiotics given during pregnancy improved maternal and perinatal outcomes, while others have shown no benefit and some have reported adverse effects.

Objectives

To determine the effect of prophylactic antibiotics on maternal and perinatal outcomes during the second and third trimester of pregnancy for all women or women at risk of preterm delivery.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2015) and reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment for women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy before labour.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

The review included eight randomised controlled trials. Approximately 4300 women were recruited to detect the effect of prophylactic antibiotic administration on pregnancy outcomes. Primary outcomesAntibiotic prophylaxis did not reduce the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (risk ratio (RR) 0.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 1.49 (one trial, 229 women), low quality evidence) or preterm delivery (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.09 (six trials, 3663 women), highquality evidence). However, preterm delivery was reduced in the subgroup of pregnant women with a previous preterm birth who had bacterial vaginosis (BV) during the current pregnancy (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.88 (one trial, 258 women)), but there was no reduction in the subgroup of pregnant women with previous preterm birth without BV during the pregnancy (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.77 (two trials, 500 women)). A reduction in the risk of postpartum endometritis (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.92 (one trial, 196 women)) was observed in high-risk pregnant women (women with a history of preterm birth, low birthweight, stillbirth or early perinatal death) and in all women (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.82 (three trials, 627 women), moderate quality evidence). There was no difference in low birthweight (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.39 (four trials; 978 women)) or neonatal sepsis (RR 11.31; 95% CI 0.64 to 200.79) (one trial, 142 women)); and blood culture confirming sepsis was not reported in any of the studies. Secondary outcomesAntibiotic prophylaxis reduced the risk of prelabour rupture of membranes (RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.78 (one trial, 229 women), low quality evidence) and gonococcal infection (RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.94 (one trial, 204 women)). There were no differences observed in other secondary outcomes (congenital abnormality; small-for-gestational age; perinatal mortality), whilst many other secondary outcomes (e.g. intrapartum fever needing treatment with antibiotics) were not reported in included trials.Regarding the route of antibiotic administration, vaginal antibiotic prophylaxis during pregnancy did not prevent infectious pregnancy outcomes. The overall risk of bias was low, except that incomplete outcome data produced high risk of bias in some studies. The quality of the evidence using GRADE was assessed as low for preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, high for preterm delivery, moderate for postpartum endometritis, low for prelabour rupture of membranes, and very low for chorioamnionitis. Intrapartum fever needing treatment with antibiotics was not reported in any of the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis did not reduce the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes or preterm delivery (apart from in the subgroup of women with a previous preterm birth who had bacterial vaginosis). Antibiotic prophylaxis given during the second or third trimester of pregnancy reduced the risk of postpartum endometritis, term pregnancy with pre-labour rupture of membranes and gonococcal infection when given routinely to all pregnant women. Substantial bias possibly exists in the review's results because of a high rate of loss to follow-up and the small numbers of studies included in each of our analyses. There is also insufficient evidence on possible harmful effects on the baby. Therefore, we conclude that there is not enough evidence to support the use of routine antibiotics during pregnancy to prevent infectious adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes.

### Screening and treatment of maternal genitourinary tract infections in early pregnancy to prevent preterm birth in rural sylhet, Bangladesh: a cluster randomized trial [^6a242d0a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of abnormal vaginal flora

Abnormal vaginal flora are classified by microscopic examination of a Gram stained sample of the vaginal smear and Nugent scored (Table 1). Nugent scores between 7 and 10 are classified as BV, and scores between 4 and 6 are classified as intermediate flora; all scores ≥ 4 are classified as AVF. The time window from specimen collection to Nugent scoring is 4 days, and from Nugent scoring to first dose of treatment is 2 days, for a total of 6 days from sample collection to treatment. Treatment is based on a single reading by a trained and standardized microbiologist. The laboratory staff are trained and standardized in Nugent scoring on a non-study sample of slides (n = 250) until there is high concordance of readings (kappa >0.8) between laboratory staff and gold standard scorers, and high sensitivity and specificity of AVF and BV compared to the gold standard reader (>85 %) prior to the initiation of the study.

Table 1 
Nugent scoring for vaginal flora

a Average count per high powered field (1000× oil immersion), viewing at least 10–20 fields

Diagnosis of urinary tract infection

Urine specimens are plated on standard MacConky and Blood agar plates and incubated for 48 h. Bacterial growth is speciated using standard microbial techniques, and antibiotic sensitivity patterns are determined. Bacterial growth is defined in the following categories: 1) high-burden urinary tract infection : bactiuria of >10 5 colony forming units (CFU) per 1 mL of urine of a single uropathogen, 2) intermediate growth : bactiuria with >10 3 –10 5 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen, and 3) contamination : bacterial growth of >1 organism OR growth of a non-urinary tract pathogen. At the time of the specimen collection visit, CHWs inquire about maternal symptoms of UTI (dysuria, urinary frequency, hematuria, abdominal pain, fever, flank pain). Symptomatic intermediate growth is defined as mothers with intermediate burden growth and UTI symptoms. Cystitis is diagnosed in women with positive urine culture (high burden or intermediate growth) and symptoms of dysuria, urinary frequency, hematuria, urinary urgency or suprapubic tenderness, without upper urinary tract symptoms (fever, chills, flank or back pain). Pyelonephritis is diagnosed in women with positive urine culture and systemic symptoms (fever, chills, flank pain or back pain).

Background

One-third of preterm births are attributed to pregnancy infections. We implemented a community-based intervention to screen and treat maternal genitourinary tract infections, with the aim of reducing the incidence of preterm birth.

We did an unblinded cluster-randomised controlled trial in two subdistricts of Sylhet, Bangladesh. Clusters were defined as the contiguous area served by a single community health worker, and each cluster comprised several contiguous villages, contained roughly 4000 people, and had about 120 births per year. Eligible participants within clusters were all ever-married women and girls of reproductive age (ie, aged 15–49 years) who became pregnant during the study period. Clusters were randomly assigned (1:1) to the intervention or control groups via a restricted randomisation procedure. In both groups, community health workers made home visits to identify pregnant women and girls and provide antenatal and postnatal care. Between 13 and 19 weeks' gestation, participants in the intervention group received home-based screening for abnormal vaginal flora and urinary tract infections. A random 10% of the control group also received the intervention to examine the similarity of infection prevalence between groups. If present, abnormal vaginal flora (ie, Nugent score ≥4 was treated with oral clindamycin (300 mg twice daily for 5 days) and urinary tract infections with cefixime (400 mg once daily for 3 days) or oral nitrofurantoin (100 mg twice daily for 7 days). Both infections were retreated if persistent. The primary outcome was the incidence of preterm livebirths before 37 weeks' gestation among all livebirths. This trial is registered with, number. The trial is closed to new participants, with follow-up completed.

Findings

Between Jan 2, 2012, and July 28, 2015, 9712 pregnancies were enrolled (4840 in the intervention group, 4391 in the control group, and 481 in the control subsample). 3818 livebirths in the intervention group and 3557 livebirths in the control group were included in the primary analysis. In the intervention group, the prevalence of abnormal vaginal flora was 16·3% (95% CI 15·1–17·6) and that of urinary tract infection was 8·6% (7·7–9·5). The effective coverage of successful treatment in the intervention group was 58% in participants with abnormal vaginal flora (ie, abnormal vaginal flora resolved in 361 [58%] of the 622 participants who initially tested positive), and 71% in those with urinary tract infections (ie, resolution in 224 [71%] of the 317 participants who initially tested positive). Overall, the incidence of preterm livebirths before 37 weeks' gestation did not differ significantly between the intervention and control groups (21·8% vs 20·6%; relative risk 1·07 [95% CI 0·91–1·24]).

Interpretation

A population-based antenatal screening and treatment programme for genitourinary tract infections did not reduce the incidence of preterm birth in Bangladesh.

### Care for women with prior preterm birth [^e80f132e]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Women who have delivered an infant between 16 and 36 weeks' gestation have an increased risk of preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies. The risk increases with more than 1 preterm birth and is inversely proportional to the gestational age of the previous preterm birth. African American women have rates of recurrent preterm birth that are nearly twice that of women of other backgrounds. An approximate risk of recurrent preterm birth can be estimated by a comprehensive reproductive history, with emphasis on maternal race, the number and gestational age of prior births, and the sequence of events preceding the index preterm birth. Interventions including smoking cessation, eradication of asymptomatic bacteriuria, progestational agents, and cervical cerclage can reduce the risk of recurrent preterm birth when employed appropriately.

### Benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: a systematic review [^73f929e6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Kazemier et al. a multicentre prospective cohort study with an embedded RCT conducted in the Netherlands, included a cohort of low-risk pregnant women screened for ASB using the dip slide method. Consenting ASB-positive women were randomised to nitrofurantoin or placebo. The aim of the RCT was to evaluate the effect of nitrofurantoin on a composite primary outcome, preterm delivery and pyelonephritis, as well as on a number of secondary maternal and neonatal outcomes. The study was stopped early after the planned interim analysis when data were available for 30 % of the planned sample, as pyelonephritis events were much less frequent than expected in both the treatment and control groups.

Mulla provided only a vague description of the study characteristics (see Table 2). In particular, details were missing on the diagnostic strategy used. No information was provided on the specific catheter, the number of positive test results, the cut-offs, and the diagnostic algorithm (i.e. whether both tests were used as a combination and, if so, how the test results were combined to diagnose ASB).

Williams et al. reported the results of two consecutive trials, one of which is relevant for this systematic review. Prior to the relevant trial, the majority of participants had taken part in a preceding trial where they had been hospitalised for 24 h, while fluid intake had been restricted to a minimum.

Risk of bias

In the three studies from the 1960s the risk of bias was high for nearly all items considered, while the recent trial (Kazemier et al.) had a low risk of bias on the study and outcome level (see Table 3).

### The implication of Chlamydia and bacterial vaginosis among low-risk pregnant women with preterm birth: a prospective multicentric cohort study [^966e34a8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Preterm birth (PTB) is a multifactorial pathology that raises feto-maternal morbidity. Infection was associated with higher PTB risk. Earlier studies discussed the inconsistent role of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) with PTB. To examine the contribution of CT to the overall incidence of PL in our population and to verify the concurrent impact of bacterial vaginosis (BV) on PTB risk.

Methods

A prospective cohort study enrolled low-risk pregnant women attending an antenatal clinic at a gestational age of 24-28 weeks. They were screened for CT and BV using cervical smears and subdivided into two groups: positive CT cases (study group; N=79) and negative CT cases (control group; N=235). They were followed until delivery. For each, maternal parameters [Maternal age, parity, socioeconomic class, BV, preterm labor, tocolytic, progestogen drugs, and dexamethasone] and Fetal parameters [Gestational age at delivery, fetal birth weight, admission to intensive care unit for respiratory distress syndrome] were recorded.

Results

Positive CT cases had significantly higher PBT; 20/79 (25.3%) vs. 21/235 (9%) among negative CT cases. Stratifying PTB results according to infection status revealed that 6.3% (12/189) of PTB cases were negative for both CT and BV, 12.2% (5/41) had CT alone, and 19.6% (9/46) were positive for BV alone. 39.5% (15/38) of PTB cases screened positive for CT and BV, thus highlighting a potential synergistic effect between the infection and PTB risk. Positive CT cases had higher BV incidence; 38/79 (48.1%), and higher use of tocolytic; 21/79 (26.6%), progestogen; 20/79 (25.3%), and dexamethasone drugs; 24/79 (30.4%); (P=0.03, 0.006, 0.02, 0.009, and 0.01, respectively). Multiple logistic regression showed that positive BV cases had an increased risk of adverse outcomes, OR=3.78. Overall model fit confirmed CT contribution to overall PTB 3-7%. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test discussed a BV synergistic role in PTB; OR=2.55; 95%CI:1.44 to 4.51; P=0.002.

Conclusion

The current findings suggest that CT infection, especially when combined with BV, may significantly increase the risk of PTB even when both infections are appropriately treated during pregnancy. The observed synergistic interaction highlights the potential role of screening for co-infection during pregnancy and reinforces an integrated management approach beyond treatment.

### Basic vaginal pH, bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis: prevalence in early pregnancy and risk of spontaneous preterm delivery, a prospective study in a low socioeconomic and multiethnic south American population [^63d6748f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

The reasons for the wide variations in the prevalence of BV are only partially known as are their consequences in terms of morbidity. More knowledge about them and a better understanding of the pathological processes that result in BV in different circumstances have been recognized as a research gap at a workshop on BV sponsored by the NIH/USA in 2008. Studies related to BV are very scanty outside the USA and Europe.

A meta-analysis to assess BV as a risk factor for preterm delivery included 18 studies, involving more than 20 thousand women, most of whom examined around the 24th week, found that BV increases twice the overall risk of preterm delivery before 37 weeks. However, for those women tested before 20 weeks’ gestation, the odds ratio was higher than 4; for those tested with less than 16 weeks, the odds ratio was higher than 7. It also found that early BV, around the end of 1st trimester, increased the risk of spontaneous abortion, with an odds ratio of nearly 10. On the other hand, the selected studies that included women after 20 weeks’ gestation and assessed the risk of preterm delivery less than 34 and 32 weeks’ gestation did not find association with BV.

The Nugent method is a standardized method, designed to evaluate bacterial vaginosis. It is highly associated with BV clinical signs and vaginal pH. The relatively low sensitivity of BV tests for preterm birth, close to 30% (both Amsel’s and Nugent’s), is similar to that of other screening tests for spontaneous premature birth in asymptomatic women, such as the Bishop test, cervical ultrasound and fetal fibronectin. A systematic review, involving more than 17 thousand asymptomatic women in the second trimester, compared the accuracy of three different tests for bacterial vaginosis_ Gram staining using Nugent’s criteria (7 studies), Gram staining using Spiegel’s criteria (2 studies) and Amsel’s clinical plus wet mount microscopy criteria (2 studies) _ to predict spontaneous preterm birth (< 37 weeks). Meta-analysis showed that there was no difference in the accuracy of those tests in predicting spontaneous preterm birth.

### Prediction and prevention of spontaneous preterm birth: ACOG practice bulletin, number 234 [^d5e7cbf1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Vaginal progesterone—short cervix in singleton pregnancy—has evidence of benefit and vaginal progesterone is recommended for asymptomatic individuals without a history of preterm birth with a singleton pregnancy and a short cervix. In a randomized trial of asymptomatic patients with a singleton gestation and a cervical length of 10–20 mm, daily 90 mg vaginal progesterone gel beginning between 20 0/7 and 23 6/7 weeks reduced delivery before 33 weeks (7.6% versus 15.3%; adjusted RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.27–0.90). A meta-analysis of five randomized trials using a threshold of 25 mm or less found reduced any preterm birth before 34 0/7 weeks (14.5% versus 24.6%; RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44–0.82) and reduced spontaneous preterm birth before 34 0/7 weeks (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.44–0.88), with 14 patients needing treatment to prevent one spontaneous preterm birth before 34 0/7 weeks. An individual patient data meta-analysis including 31 trials reported lower risk with vaginal progesterone versus untreated controls (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68–0.90), and among women with no prior preterm birth and cervical length of 25 mm or less the relative risk for preterm birth before 34 weeks was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.48–0.98). Although most studies used 200 mg daily from identification of a cervix shorter than 25 mm at 18 0/7–25 6/7 weeks until 36–37 weeks, there are no adequate dosing studies or comparative trials and insufficient data to indicate the most effective formulation or dose.

### Preventing preterm birth with progesterone: costs and effects of screening low risk women with a singleton pregnancy for short cervical length, the triple P study [^eb3576f1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous preterm delivery is the single most important cause of perinatal mortality in the Western world. It is known that cervical length measurement at 20 to 24 weeks gestation can identify women at increased risk for preterm delivery. However, an effective treatment was not available until recently.

A breakthrough in the management of women at increased risk is the use of progesterone. Two randomized clinical trials demonstrated a reduction in preterm birth of 50% in women with a previous preterm birth. The number of women who delivered prior to 32 weeks in both studies decreased from 20% to 10%. The effectiveness of progesterone was also addressed in a recent meta-analysis.

Relative to women allocated to placebo, those who received progestational agents (17[alpha]-hydroxyprogesterone caproate and other forms of progesterone) had lower rates of preterm delivery (26% versus 36%), corresponding to a number needed to treat to prevent one premature delivery of 10. In addition, women who had received progestational agents had lower rates of perinatal mortality (14.8% versus 17.1%).

The problem with the use of progesterone at present is that, based on current evidence, it can only be applied to women with a history of preterm birth. However, the large majority of spontaneous preterm delivery occurs in nulliparous women, and progesterone has not been assessed in those women. On the other hand, prediction of preterm birth in nulliparous women has been studied widely. Fetal fibronectin, cervical length, upper genital tract infection, and bacterial vaginosis are predictors of preterm birth and in various combinations, proved to be stronger predictors, depending on race and gestational age. At 24 weeks, cervical length below 25 mm was the best predictor of spontaneous preterm birth at all gestational ages. Of the risk factors evaluated at 28 and 30 weeks, fetal fibronectin was the only significant predictor of spontaneous preterm birth < 32 weeks.

2.3 Study population, sampling, eligibility and enrolment

The study population consisted of the pregnant women attending antenatal clinic of the hospital for first antenatal check-up irrespective of trimester and gravida. Every day nearly 50 to 150 women used to visit the antenatal clinic, who were first registered in an antenatal register. Randomx android mobile app was used to select the participants by simple random sampling of the line list of the register for that day. The consenting participants were evaluated clinically by a research team consisting of a doctor and a lab technician, and those with any sign or symptom of UTI were excluded. Any participant who had a history of consumption of antibiotics in the preceding week was also excluded. Based on the mission capacity of the study team, maximum ten participants per day and on an average four participants per day were enrolled on weekdays until the sample size was met. Identification details, antenatal history, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and clinical evaluation details were recorded in a pre-approved data collection format. A urine sample was collected in a sterile container from each of the participants.

2.4 Randomization and allocation concealment

The urine samples were sequentially numbered before sending them to the microbiology laboratory. Computerized random allocation sequence was generated by Dr Manish Gehani using Microsoft Excel's random number generation feature, which was concealed from the team members involved in enrolling and assessing participants in the antenatal clinic. Following simple randomization method without any restriction, participants were randomly assigned in microbiology laboratory to either intervention (n = 120) or control (n = 120) group. Selectively, the urine samples from only the intervention arm were provided to the novel test team for further processing.

2.5 Intervention and usual care in control arm

Participants were not informed about their allocation to either intervention or control arm. All the participants, irrespective of the arm in which they were enrolled, underwent routine first antenatal check-up in antenatal out-patient department (OPD), which included history taking, general and obstetric examination, and routine blood and urine tests. The battery of tests conducted during routine antenatal check-up did not include urine culture and sensitivity or rapid test but included routine urine examination and microscopy. Even for pus cells more than ten per high power field, the obstetricians did not order urine culture and sensitivity, and did not prescribe any antibiotics, since the patient was asymptomatic. In control arm, this usual care of hospital for asymptomatic pregnant women coming for their first antenatal check-up was continued without any interference.

### Urogenital cultures and preterm birth in women with cervical cerclage: a single center retrospective cohort study [^5f959ca8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide roughly 1 out of 10 children are born preterm, i.e. before 37 weeks of gestation. Extreme preterm birth (PTB) (< 28 weeks) leads to perinatal death in 53% of cases in Belgium. Children that survive extreme PTB have a pertinent higher risk of cognitive and motor development problems, attention disorders and social difficulties compared with those born after 28 weeks. Hence, gestational age (GA) at delivery is the most determining factor of all neonatal outcomes.

Cervical insufficiency, defined as the inability of the cervix to retain the pregnancy, causes 8–43% of mid-trimester losses and 11–65% of all spontaneous preterm births (sPTB). It can be due to previous direct trauma, for example caused by cervical loop electrosurgical excision or conization or it can be a consequence of a congenital malformation such as a Müllerian anomaly. When cervical insufficiency exists in absence of these causes, the pathogenesis remains unclear. At present, the leading hypothesis suggests a role of cervical inflammation caused by lower urogenital tract infections. Indeed, pyelonephritis, if left untreated, is a known risk factor for sPTB, and in the last decade an association was also found with lower urinary tract infections. Even asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women is recommended to be treated to reduce the risk of pyelonephritis and therefore reduce the risk of sPTB; hence at our institution it is part of routine screening. Furthermore, concerning genital infections, bacterial vaginosis (BV) in pregnancy is recognized as a strong predictor of sPTB. Moreover, some authors speculate that Candida, Chlamydia and Gonorrhea could be associated with sPTB. Therefore urogenital tract infections could lead to cervical insufficiency, and if they remain untreated they may ascend into the uterine cavity. In fact, microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity is present in 51% of women with cervical insufficiency.

### Screening and treatment of maternal genitourinary tract infections in early pregnancy to prevent preterm birth in rural sylhet, Bangladesh: a cluster randomized trial [^3bdf55c2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately half of preterm births are attributable to maternal infections, which are commonly undetected and untreated in low-income settings. Our primary aim is to determine the impact of early pregnancy screening and treatment of maternal genitourinary tract infections on the incidence of preterm live birth in Sylhet, Bangladesh. We will also assess the effect on other adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth (stillbirth and live birth), late miscarriage, maternal morbidity, and early onset neonatal sepsis.

Methods/Design

We are conducting a cluster randomized controlled trial that will enroll 10,000 pregnant women in Sylhet district in rural northeastern Bangladesh. Twenty-four clusters, each with ~4000 population (120 pregnant women/year) and served by a community health worker (CHW), are randomized to: 1) the control arm, which provides routine antenatal and postnatal home-based care, or 2) the intervention arm, which includes routine antenatal and postnatal home-based care plus screening and treatment of pregnant women between 13 and 19 weeks of gestation for abnormal vaginal flora (AVF) and urinary tract infection (UTI). CHWs conduct monthly pregnancy surveillance, make 2 antenatal and 4 postnatal home visits for all enrolled pregnant women and newborns, and refer mothers or newborns with symptoms of serious illness to the government sub-district hospital. In the intervention clusters, CHWs perform home-based screening of AVF and UTI. Self-collected vaginal swabs are plated on slides, which are Gram stained and Nugent scored. Women with AVF (Nugent score ≥4) are treated with oral clindamycin, rescreened and retreated, if needed, after 3 weeks. Urine culture is performed and UTI treated with nitrofurantoin. Repeat urine culture is performed after 1 week for test of cure. Gestational age is determined by maternal report of last menstrual period at study enrollment using prospectively completed study calendars, and in a subset by early (<20 week) ultrasound. CHWs prospectively collect data on all pregnancy outcomes, maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.

Implications/Discussion

Findings will enhance our understanding of the burden of AVF and UTI in rural Bangladesh, the impact of a maternal screening-treatment program for genitourinary tract infections on perinatal health, and help formulate public health recommendations for infection screening in pregnancy in low-resource settings.

### Effectiveness of antenatal screening of asymptomatic bacteriuria in reduction of prematurity and low birth weight: evaluating a point-of-care rapid test in a pragmatic randomized controlled study [^2057f483]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

3.4.1 Analysis of the primary outcome of the incidence of either preterm birth or lbw

When a participant was called on her EDD, there were cases when the telephone numbers were out of service or not reachable and no alternative numbers were available. After three trials of calling the participants on three consecutive days, if they were still not contactable, the address provided by them at the time of enrolment was visited. In case they were not traceable even after home visit, due to migration and lack of information with their neighbors, they were labeled as lost to follow up. Due to loss to follow-up (n = 10), abortions (n = 5), death of new-born (n = 4), twin deliveries (n = 6), and refusal to divulge any information (n = 2), the final analysis included 103 participants in intervention arm and 110 participants in control arm for complete case analysis. There was no deviation from protocol during the study. Out of 213 women, 212 had institutional deliveries, while one woman (in control arm) delivered at home. Among institutional deliveries, eight had caesarean section (two in intervention arm and six in control arm), while 204 had normal delivery. A 14·7% (95% CI: 2·2 to 27·2) lower incidence of preterm birth or LBW was observed in the intervention arm (27 cases in intervention arm and 45 in control arm) (RR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0·43 to 0·95) (Table 2). Six cases in intervention arm and ten cases in control arm had both preterm birth and LBW, while majority of preterm births were late preterm births. The gestational age at delivery for preterm births and LBW babies are provided in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. Out of 21 women who received antibiotics in intervention arm, only four experienced preterm birth or LBW, while three were lost to follow up. A significant association was found between intervention and occurrence of preterm birth or LBW by pre-specified Pearson's chi square test (X 2 = 5·13, p = 0·023). No adverse events were reported due to the intervention. Early diagnosis enabled obstetricians with timely confirmation of bacteriuria and rapid antibiotic susceptibility helped them in prescribing antibiotics based on readily available evidence during the same visit.

### Screen-and-treat strategy for vaginal flora abnormalities in... [^91b784ee]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Screen-and-treat Strategy for Vaginal Flora Abnormalities in Pregnant Women at High Risk of Preterm Birth ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Preterm birth is an important cause of death and disabilities. Bacterial vaginosis is a common vaginal dysbiosis or abnormal microbiota, with a predominance of anaerobic bacteria with a lack of Lactobacillus, with various diagnosis methods. Often asymptomatic, BV increases the risk of preterm birth according to the gestational age at diagnosis. BV is usually diagnosed by conventional diagnosis such as Nugent score. Molecular diagnosis of BV has been demonstrated to be more reproducible, more accurate and to better define dysbiosis.

The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative screen-and-treat strategy for vaginal flora abnormalities by molecular biology using a Point of Care multiplex technology before 18 weeks' gestation to reduce the rate of preterm birth in a population of pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth. The hypothesis is that a strategy for screening and treating vaginal flora abnormalities and their recurrences using molecular biology in women with a history of prematurity or late-term abortion could be effective in reducing premature births by 40%. Preterm birth is an important cause of death and disabilities. Bacterial vaginosis is a common vaginal dysbiosis or abnormal microbiota, with a predominance of anaerobic bacteria with a lack of Lactobacillus with various diagnosis methods. Often asymptomatic, BV increases the risk of preterm birth according to the gestational age at diagnosis.

BV is usually diagnosed by conventional diagnosis such as Nugent score. Molecular diagnosis of BV has been demonstrated to be more reproducible, accurate and to better define dysbiosis. AUTOP was a large randomized multicentre trial to evaluate a "Screen and Treat" strategy for bacterial vaginosis using molecular diagnosis of self-collected vaginal samples in low-risk pregnant women during early pregnancy, with an evaluation of treatment success, and including vaginal swab controls. Among 6, 671 randomized women, the Intent to treat analysis of the primary clinical outcome showed no evidence of a reduction in the rate of preterm birth with the screen and treat strategy compared with usual care. The rate of preterm birth was 3. 9% among 3, 333 women in the screen and treat strategy group and
4. 6% among 3, 338 in the control group.

In the subgroup of nulliparous women, Screening and treating strategy was significantly more effective than usual care. AUTOP I has been submit to JAMA at the beginning of 2023. AUTOP was the first randomized study that evaluates the impact of Screen and Treat strategies using molecular biology during pregnancy, except one ongoing study. The main objective of AUTOP 2 study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative screen-and-treat strategy for vaginal flora abnormalities by molecular biology using Point of Care multiplex technology before 18 weeks' gestation to reduce the rate of preterm birth in a population of pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth, in comparison with a standard strategy with absence of screening.

### Prediction and prevention of spontaneous preterm birth: ACOG practice bulletin, number 234 [^34f47a43]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Cervical length screening in individuals without a prior preterm birth—the positive predictive value of a cervical length of 20 mm or less between 16 and 22 weeks of gestation was only 15.5%, and 680 women would need to be screened at a cutoff of 20 mm to predict one spontaneous preterm birth. A prospective cohort of more than 1,500 women without a prior spontaneous preterm birth reported 1.1% of women having a cervical length of 20 mm or less before 24 0/7 weeks of gestation. The cervix should be visualized as part of the 18 0/7–22 6/7 weeks of gestation anatomy assessment; if on transabdominal ultrasonography a short cervix is found or suspected, endovaginal ultrasonography is recommended to more accurately assess cervical length. Several randomized trials have shown that vaginal progesterone treatment reduces the risk of preterm birth in these patients; however, screening of cervical length with serial endovaginal ultrasonography is not indicated in pregnant individuals without a prior preterm birth.

### Basic vaginal pH, bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis: prevalence in early pregnancy and risk of spontaneous preterm delivery, a prospective study in a low socioeconomic and multiethnic south American population [^bb5b021c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) increases the risk of spontaneous preterm deliveries (PD) in developed countries. Its prevalence varies with ethnicity, socioeconomic conditions and gestational age. Aerobic vaginitis (AV) has also been implicated with spontaneous PD. The present study aimed to estimate the prevalence of asymptomatic BV, the accuracy of vaginal pH level to predict BV and to estimate the risk of spontaneous PD <34 and <37 weeks' gestation of BV and AV.

Methods

Women attending prenatal public services in Rio de Janeiro were screened to select asymptomatic pregnant women, < 20 weeks' gestation, with no indication for elective PD and without risk factors of spontaneous PD. Vaginal smears of women with vaginal pH >= 4.5 were collected to determine the Nugent score; a sample of those smears was also classified according to a modified Donders' score. Primary outcomes were spontaneous PD < 34 and <37 weeks' gestation and abortion.

Prevalence of asymptomatic BV was estimated in 28.1% (n = 1699); 42.4% of the smears were collected before 14 weeks' gestation. After an 8-week follow up, nearly 40% of the initially BV positive women became BV negative. The prevalence of BV among white and black women was 28.1% (95% CI: 24.6%-32.0%) and 32.5% (95% CI: 28.2%-37.2%), respectively. The sensitivity of vaginal pH=> 4.5 and => 5.0 to predict BV status was 100% and 82%, correspondingly; the 5.0 cutoff value doubled the specificity, from 41% to 84%. The incidence of < 37 weeks' spontaneous PDs among BV pregnant women with a pH=> 4.5 was 3.8%. The RR of spontaneous PD < 34 and <37 weeks among BV women with pH >=4.5, as compared with those with intermediate state, were 1.24 and 1.86, respectively (Fisher's exact test, p value = 1; 0.52, respectively, both ns). No spontaneous case of PD or abortion was associated with severe or moderate AV.

Conclusions

A high prevalence of asymptomatic BV was observed without statistically significant difference between black and white women. The RRs of spontaneous PD < 34 and <37 weeks among women with BV, as compared with those with intermediate state were not statistically significant but were consistent with those found in the literature.

### Role of vulvovaginal infection in women with short cervix: an observational clinical trial [^965ddc9e]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Short cervix (SC) and vulvovaginal infections, such as bacterial vaginosis (BV) and vulvovaginal candidosis (VVC), are known risk factors for preterm birth (PTB). The objective of this study was to investigate whether the combined presence of SC and vulvovaginal infections further elevates the risk of PTB.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed data from women treated at our institution for SC between June 2021 and March 2024, defined as having a cervical length ≤25mm prior to 34 +0 gestational weeks. At the time of SC diagnosis, infection screening was performed using Gram-stained smears, and cases of infection were adequately treated. The risk of PTB was analyzed using a Cox regression model.

Results

Among 220 eligible women with SC, 157 (71.4%) had no infection, 26 (11.8%) had BV, 33 (15%) had VVC, and four (1.8%) had both BV and VVC. All participants received standard-of-care antibiotic or antifungal treatment. The median gestational age at SC diagnosis was 26 +2 gestational weeks at an average cervical length of 20mm. Preterm delivery occurred in 94 women (42.7%). Cox regression analysis revealed no significant effect of BV (P=0.48) and/or VVC (P=0.30) on gestational age at delivery in women with SC.

Conclusion

Adequately treated vulvovaginal infections do not appear to exacerbate the risk of PTB in women with SC, highlighting the importance of routine infection screening and timely treatment to ensure effective mitigation of the potential impact of coexisting infections. Prospective studies are required to confirm our findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.
