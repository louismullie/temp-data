## Question

When should an older adult receive a second RSV vaccine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when an older adult should receive a second RSV vaccine dose and whether any revaccination is currently recommended. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current ACIP/CDC recommendations and whether they advise a second dose at all. Then, I should examine durability of protection after a single dose across seasons. Next, I will review what research exists on revaccination and whether any trials justify a second dose. After that, I need to understand ACIP's rationale for deferring revaccination. Then, I should clarify optimal timing for an initial dose since that remains the actionable decision. I will also identify priority populations for first-dose vaccination. Finally, I will anticipate future updates and synthesize practical guidance for clinicians based on the most credible evidence and policy statements.

> Let me first confirm the official recommendation so I don't overstep. ACIP's 2024 update states plainly that adults who have previously received an RSV vaccine should not receive another dose, and the recommendation is a single dose for all adults aged 75 years and for adults aged 60–74 years at increased risk for severe RSV disease; there is no approved interval for a second dose at this time, and practice should align with this guidance until evidence changes [^112qndgU].

> Wait, let me verify the durability data behind that one-dose stance before assuming booster value. The GSK prefusion F vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) showed efficacy of 82.6% in season 1 and 56.1% in season 2 with an overall two-season efficacy of 74.5% in adults ≥ 60 years, with mean follow-up around 15 months, supporting multi-season protection after a single dose [^114KX6u9] [^116LQCbK]. The Pfizer RSVpreF vaccine demonstrated 88.9% efficacy in season 1 and 78.6% in a partial season 2 with approximately 12 months mean follow-up, again suggesting protection into a second season without boosting [^112U2ukP] [^1135jDUx]. Moderna's mRNA-1345 reported 83.7% efficacy over a median of 8.6 months in older adults, consistent with strong near-term protection, though longer follow-up is still accruing [^112TCGJJ].

> Hold on, I should review whether revaccination has been studied pragmatically. The phase 3 AReSVi-006 trial is evaluating a single-dose strategy versus revaccination one year later; participants originally receiving GSK's vaccine were re-randomized before season two to receive a second dose or placebo, and the three-season analyses will be pivotal for policy, but comprehensive clinical outcomes for revaccination are still maturing and not yet practice-changing [^111Gz3xx]. Separately, a phase 2b extension study showed that a third dose given 18 months after dose two was well tolerated and boosted neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ T-cell responses, which reassures on immunogenicity but does not establish clinical efficacy or define an optimal interval for revaccination in routine practice [^111wEL5y].

> I need to ensure I understand ACIP's rationale for not endorsing a second dose yet. The core issues are insufficient evidence on the appropriate interval and target groups for revaccination, uncertain correlates of protection as titers wane, and the need to integrate evolving safety surveillance before adding doses; antibody levels after a single dose remain 2.3–3.1 fold above pre-vaccination at 12 months, but what level best predicts protection is not yet defined in older adults [^112qndgU] [^115NgJzQ] [^113ZhXXy]. I should double-check safety signals too; post-licensure monitoring is ongoing for rare events like Guillain-Barré syndrome and atrial fibrillation, with ACIP noting continued benefit-risk favorability while these signals are actively assessed in VAERS and the Vaccine Safety Datalink, which further justifies a measured approach to any additional dosing [^1178h4PT] [^112YrUSE].

> Next, I should review the practical timing for the first dose, since that remains the decisive action. Optimally, vaccination should occur before local RSV season onset; in the U.S. that typically means late summer to early fall, but because seasonality has been variable post-COVID, clinicians should offer vaccination as soon as supply is available and continue throughout the season for those who remain unvaccinated, with coadministration with influenza or COVID-19 vaccines acceptable and generally noninferior for immune responses in older adults [^113u1Hg4] [^114uFhpj] [^111SrbTv].

> Let me consider who should be prioritized for that initial dose to maximize benefit. Routine recommendation applies to all adults aged 75 years, and adults 60–74 years with risk factors such as chronic cardiopulmonary disease, diabetes, renal or hepatic disease, immunocompromise, frailty, or residence in nursing homes should be targeted; real-world data and surveillance underscore that those ≥ 75 years and those with multiple comorbidities have the highest risk of ICU admission, ventilation, and death, and although immunocompromised patients may have attenuated vaccine effectiveness, a second dose is still not recommended pending data [^112qndgU] [^115wnmhF] [^11597Zgk].

> I will now examine how the policy might evolve so clinicians know what to watch for. ACIP conducts ongoing evidence reviews, and the AReSVi-006 three-season results and other post-licensure studies will clarify whether and when revaccination improves clinical outcomes; current real-world analyses suggest approximately 80% effectiveness against RSV-related hospitalization in older adults, but durability beyond two seasons and net safety with repeat dosing must be demonstrated before policy expands to boosters [^111Gz3xx] [^112ppaK2] [^1155kCgp]. But wait, what if early revaccination study signals look promising on immunogenicity alone? That would still be insufficient without clinical efficacy and safety at population scale to define interval, target groups, and product strategy for additional doses [^112qndgU] [^115NgJzQ].

> Let me reconsider a potential pitfall in phrasing before I finalize. I initially almost said "one lifetime dose", but I should correct that because ACIP's wording is "do not give another dose at this time", which leaves room for future revaccination if and when adequate evidence emerges; for now, the guidance is a single dose with no second dose recommended for any previously vaccinated older adult [^112qndgU] [^115wnmhF].

> Synthesis for clinical practice: No older adult should receive a second RSV vaccine dose at this time, because a single dose provides multi-season protection and revaccination remains investigational while durability, correlates of protection, and safety with repeat dosing are clarified; clinicians should focus on ensuring eligible patients receive their first dose before local season onset, counsel that protection spans at least one to two seasons based on trial data, and monitor ACIP updates annually for potential changes as phase 3 revaccination results and safety surveillance mature [^114KX6u9] [^112U2ukP] [^112qndgU] [^111Gz3xx] [^1155kCgp].

---

According to the **current guidance**, a second RSV vaccine dose is not currently recommended for older adults [^112qndgU]. ACIP/CDC guidance is for a **single lifetime dose** for adults aged ≥ 75 years [^115wnmhF] and for adults 60–74 years at increased risk; **revaccination is not advised** because protection persists for at least two seasons [^111Gz3xx] and there is no evidence of added benefit from a second dose [^113u1Hg4]. If future data show waning immunity or improved outcomes with revaccination, recommendations may change [^112qndgU], but for now, **only one dose should be given**.

---

## Current recommendations for RSV vaccination in older adults

ACIP/CDC recommend a **single lifetime dose** of an approved RSV vaccine (Arexvy, Abrysvo, or mResvia) for all adults aged ≥ 75 years [^115wnmhF] and adults aged 60–74 years at increased risk for severe RSV disease (e.g. chronic medical conditions, moderate or severe immunocompromise, or residing in nursing homes) [^112qndgU]. Adults who have previously received an RSV vaccine should **not receive another dose** [^112qndgU].

---

## Duration of immunity and vaccine effectiveness

- **Persistence of immunity**: Clinical trials and real-world data show that a single RSV vaccine dose provides protection lasting at least two RSV seasons [^111Gz3xx] (approximately 24 months).

- **Efficacy over multiple seasons**: The AReSVi-006 trial [^111Gz3xx] showed sustained efficacy against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) over three seasons, with no significant waning through the second season.

- **Real-world effectiveness**: Recent analyses [^111REkuW] show high effectiveness against RSV-associated hospitalizations and emergency department encounters in adults aged ≥ 60 years during the 2023–2024 season [^112ppaK2].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding revaccination

Evidence for **revaccination** is limited; there is no robust support for routine revaccination of older adults. Available data indicate sustained protection for at least two seasons [^111Gz3xx], with no clear benefit from a second dose [^113u1Hg4]. Ongoing studies are evaluating the **safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of revaccination** [^1155kCgp], but results are not yet available to support routine revaccination [^111wEL5y].

---

## Safety considerations

The **safety profile** of RSV vaccines is acceptable, with mostly mild-to-moderate transient adverse events [^112pNxUS]. Serious adverse events are rare and comparable to placebo in trials [^1135jDUx]. For **potential risks**, rare events such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) [^112ppaK2] and atrial fibrillation are being monitored, but no significant safety signals have emerged to date [^1178h4PT].

---

## Factors influencing future revaccination recommendations

- **Waning immunity**: If future data show significant waning beyond two seasons, revaccination may be considered [^114zCeTP].

- **Emerging variants**: If new RSV variants reduce vaccine effectiveness, updated vaccines or revaccination strategies may be needed [^116S16Zg].

- **High-risk populations**: Revaccination could be considered for immunocompromised individuals or those with chronic conditions if evidence supports benefit [^112qndgU].

---

## Current clinical guidance summary

| **Recommendation** | **Population** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|
| Single lifetime dose | Adults ≥ 75 years | Any time before RSV season |
| Single lifetime dose | Adults 60–74 years at increased risk | Any time before RSV season |
| No revaccination | Adults previously vaccinated | Not recommended |

---

## Conclusion and future directions

- **Current guidance**: A single lifetime dose is recommended for older adults; revaccination is not advised due to sustained protection for at least two seasons [^115wnmhF].

- **Future considerations**: Recommendations may change if data show waning immunity, variant impact, or benefit in high-risk groups [^112qndgU].

- **Ongoing monitoring**: Continued surveillance and research will guide future revaccination policies [^1178h4PT].

---

A second RSV vaccine dose is **not currently recommended** for older adults; a **single lifetime dose** is advised, with revaccination considered only if future evidence supports it [^115wnmhF].

The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The duration of protection after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety over three RSV seasons of the AS01 E-adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein-based vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease (RSV-LRTD) in older adults.

- **Methods**: In this randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (AReSVi-006), participants aged 60 years or older in 275 centres (i.e. GP practices and clinical research sites) across 17 countries in Africa, Asia, Oceania, Europe, and North America were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive RSVPreF3 OA or placebo before RSV season one. RSVPreF3 OA recipients were re-randomly assigned (1:1) before RSV season two to receive a second RSVPreF3 OA dose (RSV revaccination group) or placebo (RSV single-dose group). Recipients of placebo before RSV season one also received placebo before season two (placebo group). The primary objective (efficacy against first occurrence of RSV-LRTD over one RSV season) was reported previously. Confirmatory secondary objectives were to demonstrate efficacy over three RSV seasons of a single RSVPreF3 OA dose and of a first dose followed by revaccination 1 year later, against RSV-LRTD overall and by RSV subtype (success criteria: lower limits of two-sided CIs around efficacy estimates > 20% for RSV-LRTD and > 0% for RSV-LRTD by RSV subtype).

- **Findings**: Participants were enrolled between May 25, 2021, and January 31, 2022. Efficacy analyses included data from these participants.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in adults aged ≥ 60 years: Updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2024 [^112qndgU]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory illness and hospitalization in older adults during fall and winter in the United States. The 2023–2024 RSV season was the first during which RSV vaccination was recommended for U.S. adults aged ≥ 60 years, using shared clinical decision-making. On June 26, 2024, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to update this recommendation as follows: a single dose of any Food and Drug Administration-approved RSV vaccine (Arexvy [GSK]; Abrysvo [Pfizer]; or mResvia [Moderna]) is now recommended for all adults aged ≥ 75 years and for adults aged 60–74 years who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease. Adults who have previously received an RSV vaccine should not receive another dose.

This report summarizes the evidence considered for these updated recommendations, including post-licensure data on vaccine effectiveness and safety, and provides clinical guidance for the use of RSV vaccines in adults aged ≥ 60 years. These updated recommendations are intended to maximize RSV vaccination coverage among persons most likely to benefit, by clarifying who is at highest risk and by reducing implementation barriers associated with the previous shared clinical decision-making recommendation. Continued post-licensure monitoring will guide future recommendations.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices - United States, 2023 [^114KX6u9]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Evaluated efficacy evidence for the GSK RSV vaccine consisted of data from one ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial conducted in 17 countries. The trial included 24,973 immunocompetent participants aged ≥ 60 years who were randomized 1:1 to receive one dose of the vaccine (intervention group, 120 μg preF protein with AS01 E adjuvant) or a saline placebo (control group). Efficacy findings were based on analyses of data collected during May 2021–March 2023, which included two complete RSV seasons for Northern Hemisphere participants and one complete RSV season for Southern Hemisphere participants. Efficacy analyses for the first season spanned May 2021–April 2022, while those for the second season spanned August 2022–March 2023. Exact study-defined season dates were site-dependent. The mean time from vaccination to the end of efficacy follow-up across both seasons was approximately 15 months per participant.

The efficacy of one dose of the GSK vaccine in preventing symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) was 82.6% (96.95% CI = 57.9%–94.1%) during the first RSV season and 56.1% (95% CI = 28.2%–74.4%) during the second season. Overall, the efficacy of one dose over two seasons was 74.5% (97.5% CI = 60.0%–84.5%) in preventing RSV-associated LRTD and 77.5% (95% CI = 57.9%–89.0%) in preventing medically attended RSV-associated LRTD. The study was not powered to estimate efficacy against hospitalization (intervention group = one event; control group = five events) or severe RSV illness requiring respiratory support.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^112YrUSE]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Interim analysis was underpowered to estimate efficacy. Combined Season 1 and 2 (interim) vaccine efficacy estimates reflect efficacy against first events occurring any time during Season 1 or Season 2. The mean time from start to end of efficacy surveillance was approximately 15 months per participant.

Evidence regarding the safety of the GSK vaccine consisted of data from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, including the same ongoing phase 3 trial and a phase 1/2 trial with 201 participants aged ≥ 60 years who received either the vaccine formulation used in phase 3 or placebo. Across both clinical trials, severe reactogenicity events (grade 3 solicited local or systemic reactions recorded during days 0–4 [phase 3 trial] and days 0–7 [phase 1/2 trial] after vaccination) occurred in 3.8% of the intervention group participants, compared with 0.9% of the control group participants (pooled relative risk [RR] = 4.10; 95% CI = 1.99–8.45).

The frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) across both trials was similar in the intervention (4.4%) and control (4.3%) groups (pooled RR = 1.02; 95% CI = 0.91–1.15). A higher number of participants in the intervention group than in the control group reported atrial fibrillation as an unsolicited event within the 30 days after injection (intervention = 10 events [0.1%]; control = four events [< 0.1%]), eight of which were SAEs (intervention = seven; control = one). Three of the SAEs corresponded to new onset atrial fibrillation.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^115SWiEZ]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Since May 2022, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) RSV Vaccines Adult Work Group (Work Group) has met at least monthly to review available evidence regarding the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the GSK and Pfizer RSV vaccines among adults aged ≥ 60 years. A systematic review of published and unpublished evidence of the efficacy and safety of these vaccines among persons aged ≥ 60 years was conducted. The body of evidence consisted of one phase 3 randomized controlled trial and one combined phase 1 and 2 (phase 1/2) randomized controlled trial for each vaccine. The Work Group used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to independently determine the certainty of evidence for outcomes related to each vaccine, rated on a scale of high to very low certainty.

In evaluating safety, the Work Group defined inflammatory neurologic events as cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and acute central nervous system inflammation (e.g. transverse myelitis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [ADEM]) occurring within 42 days after vaccination. The Work Group then employed the Evidence to Recommendation Framework to guide its deliberations on recommendations for RSV vaccination. They reviewed data on the public health problem, benefits and harms, value to the target population, acceptability to key stakeholders, feasibility, resource use, and equity. Conclusions regarding evidence for the use of RSV vaccines among adults aged ≥ 60 years were presented.

### Respiratory syncytial virus humoral antibody responses in older adults after vaccination or infection [^117Jcmi5]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Immunity to RSV is short-lived following infection. We determined if recently licensed RSV preF vaccines induce better immune responses than infection.

- **Methods**: Serum preF binding and neutralizing antibody to RSV A and B was measured in older adults at baseline and 30 days after RSV infection or vaccination with two licensed RSV preF protein vaccines.

- **Results**: Vaccination induced higher serum preF binding antibody and neutralizing responses than RSV infection (A2 RSV: 3306 vs 1254, p < 0.0001; B1 RSV: 5153 vs 2186, p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusion**: Vaccination with preF protein vaccines induces better humoral immune responses than RSV infection in older adults.

### Phase 1/2 randomized study of the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F vaccine in adults with concomitant inactivated influenza vaccine [^1174X8hk]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

For all ages, coadministration of RSVpreF with SIIV did not affect RSV immunogenicity, regardless of dose level or formulation. However, immune responses to SIIV trended lower when RSVpreF was coadministered with SIIV compared to SIIV administered alone. This reduction in responses to SIIV was more pronounced in younger adults, who received standard dose SIIV (15 µg hemagglutinin per strain), than in older adults, who received high-dose SIIV (60 µg hemagglutinin per strain). The underlying reason for the interference is unclear, but it is notable that RSV prefusion F is a relatively immunodominant antigen. This is evidenced by (1) the high RSV neutralizing responses to RSVpreF without adjuvant, and (2) the lack of effect of SIIV on RSVpreF immunogenicity. As this was a dose-ranging, hypothesis-generating study designed primarily to evaluate safety, these observations require further study to determine clinical significance.

The strengths of this study include its large size, randomized controlled design, and evaluation of multiple vaccine formulations administered alone or concomitantly with SIIV. Limitations are a lack of statistical power to analyze comparisons across groups and uncertain generalizability of these findings to adults at greatest risk of severe disease, such as elderly individuals with cardiopulmonary disease or immunosuppression. Additional safety and immunogenicity evaluations of RSVpreF in adult populations will further inform use for this population, including a phase 1/2 study in older adults (NCT03572062) assessing additional adjuvanted formulations of RSVpreF.

### Phase 1/2 randomized study of the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F vaccine in adults with concomitant inactivated influenza vaccine [^112jWT1b]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

- **Background**: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality in older adults and adults with comorbidities, highlighting the need for an effective vaccine. An investigational bivalent prefusion F vaccine (RSVpreF) was assessed in healthy adults.

- **Methods**: This phase 1/2 study randomized adults aged 18–85 years to receive either a placebo or 60, 120, or 240 µg RSVpreF (with or without aluminum hydroxide), administered alone or concomitantly with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV). Safety and immunogenicity were assessed.

- **Results**: In older adults, reactogenicity events were predominantly mild or moderate among RSVpreF recipients. Adverse events through 1 month post-vaccination were similar across formulations. Coadministration with SIIV did not appear to affect safety among younger or older adults. All RSVpreF formulations, whether administered with or without concomitant SIIV, elicited robust RSV serum-neutralizing responses in adults aged 50–85 years 1 month post-vaccination. Neutralizing titers 1 and 12 months post-vaccination were 6.9–14.9 and 2.9–4.5 times, respectively, those before vaccination. SIIV immune responses trended lower when coadministered with RSVpreF.

- **Conclusions**: RSVpreF formulations, administered alone or with SIIV, were well tolerated and highly immunogenic in older adults, supporting the potential for RSVpreF to protect older adults from RSV disease.

- **Clinical trials registration**: NCT03529773.

### Safety and immunogenicity of a revaccination with a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F vaccine in older adults: A phase 2b study [^111wEL5y]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

In the previous (parent) study, two doses of different formulations of an investigational vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSVPreF3 OA) were well tolerated and immunogenic in older adults. This multicenter Phase 2b extension study assessed the safety and immunogenicity of a revaccination (third) dose of the 120 μg RSVPreF3-AS01E formulation.

- **Methods**: In total, 122 older adults (60–80 years), previously vaccinated with two doses of RSVPreF3-AS01E formulations (containing 30, 60, or 120 μg RSVPreF3 antigen), received an additional 120 μg RSVPreF3-AS01E dose 18 months after dose two. Vaccine safety was evaluated in all participants for up to six months, and immunogenicity was assessed in participants who received 120 μg RSVPreF3-AS01E doses until one month after dose three.

- **Results**: Similar to the parent study, mostly mild-to-moderate solicited adverse events were reported, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events or potential immune-mediated disorders. Neutralizing titers and cell-mediated immune responses persisted for 18 months after the two-dose vaccination. Dose three increased RSV-specific neutralizing titers against RSV-A and RSV-B and median CD4+ T-cell frequencies. After dose three, RSV-specific neutralizing titers, but not CD4+ T-cell frequencies, were below levels detected one month after dose one.

- **Conclusions**: Revaccination with 120 μg RSVPreF3-AS01E 18 months after dose two is well tolerated and immunogenic in older adults.

- **Clinical trials registration**: NCT04657198; EudraCT, 2020–000692–21.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^112U2ukP]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Evaluated efficacy evidence for the Pfizer vaccine consisted of data from one ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial. This study was conducted in seven countries and included 36,862 immunocompetent participants aged ≥ 60 years. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive one dose of the vaccine (intervention group, 120 μg preF protein) or a placebo containing the same buffer ingredients as the vaccine but without active components (control group).

Efficacy findings were based on data collected from August 2021 to January 2023, which encompassed one complete RSV season for Northern and Southern Hemisphere participants and a partial second season for Northern Hemisphere participants only. Efficacy analyses for season one spanned August 2021 to October 2022, while season two spanned July 2022 to January 2023, with site-dependent study-defined season dates. Mean follow-up time from vaccination to the end of efficacy follow-up, including a gap in RSV surveillance between the first and second seasons, was approximately 12 months per participant.

- **Efficacy results**: The efficacy of a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine in preventing symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) was 88.9% (95% CI = 53.6%–98.7%) during the first RSV season and 78.6% (95% CI = 23.2%–96.1%) during the partial second season. Efficacy over both seasons was 84.4% (95% CI = 59.6%–95.2%) in preventing RSV-associated LRTD and 81.0% (95% CI = 43.5%–95.2%) in preventing medically attended RSV-associated LRTD.

### Safety and immunogenicity of bivalent RSVpreF vaccine coadministered with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine in older adults [^117SaiiV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory illness in people of all ages and can cause severe illness in infants and older adults. In temperate climates, RSV infection typically follows a seasonal pattern, resulting in annual wintertime epidemics. However, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the RSV season was disrupted, with interseasonal epidemics observed.

Adults aged 65 years and older, and those who have chronic heart or lung conditions or are immunocompromised, have an increased risk of serious RSV infection. The estimated disease burden among adults aged 60 years and older in high-income countries and regions (i.e. the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, and South Korea) in 2019 was more than 5 million cases of acute respiratory illness, almost half a million RSV-associated hospitalizations, and more than 33,000 in-hospital deaths. Although available studies suggest that RSV morbidity and mortality may be comparable to influenza in older adults, the burden of adult RSV disease is underestimated.

Like RSV illness, influenza is typically seasonal, with winter peaks in temperate climates. Older adults, particularly those with medical comorbidities, are at increased risk of influenza morbidity and mortality. Annual seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended in this population to prevent illness or reduce illness severity. In some countries, high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines are preferentially recommended for adults aged 65 years and older.

The RSV prefusion F protein-based (RSVpreF) vaccine is a bivalent.

### Phase 1/2 randomized study of the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F vaccine in adults with concomitant inactivated influenza vaccine [^11689o87]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of severe lower respiratory disease in infants and young children and an important respiratory pathogen in older adults. In adults older than 65 years in the United States, attack rates are 3%–7%, and RSV is associated with approximately 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths annually. However, disease burden in older adults is likely underestimated due to the lack of standard RSV testing practices and lower viral shedding compared with infant RSV disease.

Immunity to RSV is incomplete, with reinfection occurring throughout life despite the presence of relatively high serum RSV neutralization titers. Several risk factors for serious disease have been identified, including older age and comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and immunosuppression. Poor protection against reinfection and risk of severe disease in older adults are likely associated with age-related changes in T-cell responses and effector memory to the virus. Despite no known correlate of immunity among older adults, limited data associate higher serum RSV neutralization titers with less severe disease, and low serum and nasal RSV antibodies are associated with increased risk. Currently, RSV disease management in adults is limited to supportive measures. Antiviral approaches have proven unsuccessful in natural infection. Therefore, vaccination remains a high priority.

### Respiratory syncytial virus humoral antibody responses in older adults after vaccination or infection [^116k6oLa]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a relatively frequent cause of serious respiratory illness in older adults and those with preexisting medical conditions. The burden of RSV in adults is estimated to account for 60,000–180,000 hospitalizations and 10,000–14,000 deaths in adults in the United States per year. Two protein-based vaccines and a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine, all based on the prefusion F protein (preF) structure, have recently been licensed in the United States for use in adults. Initial clinical trials demonstrated similar high efficacy in persons 60 years of age and older (82.4%–85.7%) against lower respiratory tract disease for each of the vaccines. Post-licensure analyses have demonstrated high vaccine effectiveness (VE) to prevent physician office visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations for the two protein-based vaccines during the 2023–2024 winter season in the United States.

Preliminary immunogenicity data in phase 1/2 trials showed geometric mean fold-rises (GMFR) in serum neutralizing antibodies to both group A and B RSV, ranging from 9.5 to 12.0 and 8.5 to 9.2, respectively. It has long been recognized that protection from RSV infection is incomplete and relatively short-lived, with repeat infections occurring throughout life. It has been suggested that an optimal RSV vaccine should induce a better immune response than natural infection. Thus, we compared the serum preF binding and neutralizing antibody responses in older adults vaccinated with the protein-based preF vaccines to responses following natural RSV infection.

### A phase 1/2 study of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F vaccine with and without adjuvant in healthy older adults [^115qFK6W]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Given the high burden of RSV disease in older adults, there is substantial clinical need for an effective vaccine. Prior vaccine candidates have failed to protect against RSV-mediated lower respiratory tract disease in elderly individuals. For example, a nonprefusion stabilized RSV F subunit vaccine candidate did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint in older adults in a phase 3 trial. An adenovirus vectored, prefusion F-based vaccine increased neutralizing titers up to 6-fold and provided approximately 51.9% protection against RSV infection and disease in healthy adults aged 18–50 years in a recent proof-of-concept human challenge study.

When combined with a prefusion F subunit, the adenovirus vectored prefusion F-based vaccine provided 80% protection against confirmed RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease in a phase 2 study in adults aged ≥ 65 years. Although there is no established immune correlate of protection, RSV neutralizing titers in that study correlated with protection from infection. In the proof-of-concept study, neutralizing responses at 1 month were robust, with GMFRs of 4.8–11.6 for RSV A and 4.5–14.1 for RSV B; these are slightly lower than those observed in 65- to 85-year-old adults in the recent phase 1/2 trial of RSVpreF: 7.2–13.2 for RSV A and 6.9–14.9 for RSV B. The neutralizing responses in the study reported here were durable, with neutralizing titers remaining 2.1–4.3 times the baseline titers at 12 months following a single dose. Therefore, despite the lack of effect of adjuvant in this study and discontinuation of development of a CpG/Al(OH)

### Respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus respiratory hospitalizations and outcomes in Colorado adults ≥ 50 years of age: 2016–2023 [^1124B9Fz]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been recognized as a cause of serious acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) in older adults for some time. Its epidemiology, risk factors for hospitalization, and mortality are relatively well understood from many hospital-based studies and fewer population-based studies from the Americas, Europe, New Zealand, and Australia, as well as several countries in Asia and Africa. As of 2023, several RSV vaccines are licensed for use in older adults globally and in the United States, where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed guidelines for their administration.

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has also been recognized as a cause of ARI in older adults, but much less is known about these infections. This is partly due to the virus having been discovered only a little over 20 years ago and also because the burden of influenza and RSV appeared to be higher. Several earlier prospective studies that collected data on RSV also gathered data on HMPV-related ARIs and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs).

- **Surveillance limitations**: The Influenza Division of the CDC has been conducting surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs), but these have been limited due to the inclusion of fever in the definition. Given that fever is less common in RSV and HMPV ARI and LRTI, some modified definitions of SARI do not include fever. Consequently, results from these studies might show a higher burden of RSV and HMPV compared with older studies of ILI and SARI.

### A phase 1/2 study of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F vaccine with and without adjuvant in healthy older adults [^113YZ5Zq]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Nonvaccine antigen-binding IgG responses were assessed in primary cohort participants who enrolled at the beginning of the RSV season. The month 6 post-vaccination visits corresponded to the end of the RSV season. Seroconversion by nonvaccine antigen-binding Ig, defined as a ≥ 4-fold rise in Ig binding to any of the three RSV nonvaccine antigens (Ga/Gb, matrix, nucleoprotein) at month 6 after vaccination, was observed in 9 of 212 participants (4.2%) in the RSVpreF groups and 10% in the placebo group. No participants in the month 0,2 cohort seroconverted to any RSV nonvaccine antigen.

### Vaccination of older adults against respiratory syncytial virus: The final pieces of the puzzle [^115NgJzQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

While van Effelterre et al. strengthen the consensus that vaccination of older adults against RSV has the potential to significantly reduce the RSV seasonal burden, it simply highlights, but does not fill, the pressing knowledge gaps that need resolution. With a large and growing older adult population, these vaccines will rightly come under intense scrutiny about their affordability and cost-effectiveness. With little to distinguish each vaccine product's efficacy against acute respiratory infection, the decision to implement a vaccine program — and which vaccine to choose — will likely rest on the vaccine's duration of disease protection, its protection against very severe outcomes and death, and ultimately, its price.

### Cost-effectiveness of prefusion F protein-based vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus disease for older adults in the United States [^114qFqbU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Two prefusion F protein-based vaccines, Arexvy and Abrysvo, have been authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration for protecting older adults against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated lower respiratory tract illness. We evaluated the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of these vaccines.

We developed a discrete-event simulation model, parameterized with the burden of RSV disease including outpatient care, hospitalization, and death for adults aged 60 years or older in the United States. Taking into account the costs associated with these RSV-related outcomes, we calculated the net monetary benefit using quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained as a measure of effectiveness and determined the range of price-per-dose (PPD) for Arexvy and Abrysvo vaccination programs to be cost-effective from a societal perspective.

Using a willingness-to-pay of $95,000 per QALY gained, we found that vaccination programs could be cost-effective for a PPD up to $127 with Arexvy and $118 with Abrysvo over the first RSV season. Achieving an influenza-like vaccination coverage of 66% for the population of older adults in the United States, the budget impact of these programs at the maximum PPD ranged from $6.48 to $6.78 billion. If the benefits of vaccination extend to a second RSV season as reported in clinical trials, we estimated a maximum PPD of $235 for Arexvy and $245 for Abrysvo, with 2-year budget impacts of $11.78 and $12.25 billion, respectively.

Vaccination of older adults would provide substantial direct health.

### An adjuvanted, postfusion F protein-based vaccine did not prevent respiratory syncytial virus illness in older adults [^111EquSB]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of illness in older adults. This study assessed the efficacy of a vaccine for the prevention of RSV-associated acute respiratory illness (ARI), defined by specified symptoms with virologic confirmation.

- **Methods**: This phase 2b study evaluated RSV postfusion F protein (120 µg) with glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (5 µg) in 2% stable emulsion. Subjects aged ≥ 60 years were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the vaccine or placebo (all received inactivated influenza vaccine). Ill subjects recorded symptoms and provided blood and nasal swab samples.

- **Results**: In the per-protocol population (n = 1894), the incidence of RSV-associated ARI occurring ≥ 14 days after dosing was 1.7% in the vaccine group and 1.6% in the placebo group, resulting in a vaccine efficacy (VE) of -7.1% (90% confidence interval, -106.9% to 44.3%). Efficacy was not observed in secondary analyses that included seroresponse to nonvaccine RSV antigens (VE, 8.9%; 90% CI, -28.5% to 35.4%) or symptoms combined with seroresponse (VE, 10.0%; 90% CI, -45.4% to 44.4%). On day 29, 92.9% of vaccinees had an anti-F immunoglobulin G antibody seroresponse. Overall, 48.5% and 30.9% of RSV vaccine recipients reported local and systemic solicited symptoms, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: The RSV vaccine was immunogenic but did not protect older adults from RSV illness.

Clinical Trials Registration: NCT02508194.

### Characteristics and outcomes among adults aged ≥ 60 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus - RSV-NET, 12 states, July 2022-June 2023 [^114ebnTj]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality in older adults, resulting in approximately 60,000–160,000 hospitalizations and 6,000–10,000 deaths annually among adults aged ≥ 65 years. In May 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved two RSV vaccines for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. In June 2023, the CDC recommended RSV vaccination for adults aged ≥ 60 years using shared clinical decision-making between patient and clinicians; adults at highest risk for severe RSV disease are most likely to benefit and should be prioritized for vaccination.

To describe persons who experienced severe RSV disease requiring hospitalization, data from a large, geographically diverse surveillance system were analyzed to identify characteristics of adults aged ≥ 60 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection during the 2022–23 respiratory virus season.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^116LQCbK]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy of a single dose of the GSK respiratory syncytial virus RSVpreF3 vaccine against RSV-associated disease was studied among adults aged ≥ 60 years across multiple countries from 2021 to 2023. Here are the findings:

- **Manufacturer-calculated efficacy**: Includes events occurring more than 14 days after injection and considers person-time available from the manufacturer's pivotal phase 3 trial. Estimates were adjusted based on participant age and region.

- **LRTD definition**: LRTD is defined as two or more lower respiratory symptoms (such as new or increased sputum, cough, and dyspnea) or signs (including new or increased wheezing, crackles or rhonchi detected during chest auscultation, respiratory rate ≥ 20 respirations per minute, low or decreased oxygen saturation [< 95% or ≤ 90% if baseline was < 95%], and need for oxygen supplementation) lasting for ≥ 24 hours. This must include one or more lower respiratory signs or three or more lower respiratory symptoms over the same duration.

- **Medically attended RSV-associated LRTD**: This is characterized by LRTD along with attention at one or more inpatient or outpatient healthcare services. These estimates were not included in per-protocol assessments.

- **Seasonal vaccine efficacy estimates**:
	- Season 1 estimates reflect efficacy against first events during the complete RSV season for Northern Hemisphere participants and a partial RSV season for Southern Hemisphere participants (May 2021–April 2022; exact study-defined season dates were site-dependent).
	- Season 2 efficacy estimates (data truncated).

The primary trial endpoint 96.95% CI was adjusted for multiplicity, with a standard 95% CI also reported.

**Implications for public health practice**: On February 29, 2024, ACIP announced that, based on a thorough review of currently available data, the estimated benefits of RSV vaccination continued to outweigh potential risks. RSV vaccination continues to be recommended for adults aged ≥ 60 years using shared clinical decision-making. CDC and FDA are conducting active safety evaluations to assess risks for GBS and other adverse events of special interest after RSV vaccination. Results of these studies will help guide future CDC RSV vaccine recommendations.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a group of medical and public health experts that provides advice to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, normally meets three times per year to develop US vaccine recommendations. The ACIP met from October 23 to 24, 2024, to discuss various vaccines, including influenza, chikungunya, COVID-19, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), meningococcal, human papillomavirus, pneumococcal, and other vaccines relevant to the adult and child/adolescent immunization schedule revisions. This update summarizes the proceedings of these meetings, with an emphasis on topics most relevant to the pediatric population.

Major updates for pediatric clinicians include information regarding COVID-19 and influenza vaccine recommendations; meningococcal vaccination considerations; and updates regarding the implementation and effectiveness of RSV immunization in pregnant people and infants.

### Noninferior immunogenicity and consistent safety of respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine in adults 50–59 years compared to ≥ 60 years of age [^116EekpG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The adjuvanted respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prefusion F protein-based vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) is approved for adults aged ≥ 60 years. We evaluated RSVPreF3 OA immunogenicity and safety in adults aged 50–59 years, with or without an increased risk for RSV disease due to specific chronic medical conditions.

- **Methods**: This observer-blind, phase 3, noninferiority trial included adults aged 50–59 years, stratified into two subcohorts: those with and those without predefined, stable, chronic medical conditions leading to an increased risk for RSV disease. Participants in both subcohorts were randomized 2:1 to receive RSVPreF3 OA or placebo. A control group of adults aged ≥ 60 years received RSVPreF3 OA. Primary outcomes were RSV-A and RSV-B neutralization titers (geometric mean titer ratios and sero-response rate differences) one month post-vaccination in 50–59-year-olds versus ≥ 60-year-olds. Cell-mediated immunity and safety were also assessed.

- **Results**: The exposed population included 1,152 participants aged 50–59 years and 381 participants aged ≥ 60 years. RSVPreF3 OA was immunologically noninferior in 50–59-year-olds versus ≥ 60-year-olds; noninferiority criteria were met for RSV-A and RSV-B neutralization titers in those with and without increased risk for RSV disease. Frequencies of RSVPreF3-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T cells increased substantially from pre- to one month post-vaccination. Most solicited adverse events had mild-to-moderate intensity and were transient. Unsolicited and serious adverse event rates were similar in all groups.

- **Conclusions**: RSVPreF3 OA was shown to be immunologically noninferior and demonstrated consistent safety profiles in adults aged 50–59 years compared to those aged ≥ 60 years. Overall, the vaccine supports the extension of protective measures to a broader age group at risk for RSV.

### An adjuvanted, postfusion F protein-based vaccine did not prevent respiratory syncytial virus illness in older adults [^113eQYNr]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

As planned, 1900 subjects were enrolled. Dosing occurred from 30 September to 24 November 2015 and from 15 to 29 April 2016, in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. Median follow-up duration was 368 and 370 days for the RSV vaccine and placebo groups, respectively, and efficacy follow-up was high (Figure 1). Groups were demographically comparable except that more placebo recipients were female. The mean age was 67 years, with 14.1% of subjects aged over 75 years. Similar proportions of subjects had high-risk comorbidities at baseline.

Figure 1. Disposition of subjects (as treated; 1 subject who was randomly assigned to receive respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine received placebo in error). IIV, inactivated influenza vaccine; PI, principal investigator.

Overall, 539 subjects (28.9%) had an illness episode; 25.8% in the RSV vaccine group and 28.6% in the placebo group had at least 1 event that met RSV-associated ARI symptom criteria. At least 1 swab specimen was self-collected by 93.1% of subjects with an illness episode, and 96.5% had a site-collected swab; the optional sputum sample was collected from 37.1% of subjects. RSV was detected in a respiratory sample during 33 illnesses (6.1%). Of 30 viruses sequenced, 15 each were type A (following RSV vaccination in 7 subjects and following placebo receipt in 8) and type B (in 8 and 7, respectively). The genotypes were consistent with that of ON1 for RSV A and BAIX for RSV B. In the RSV vaccine and placebo groups, 96.6% and 98.9% of subjects, respectively.

### Efficacy and safety of an mRNA-based RSV preF vaccine in older adults [^112TCGJJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The study "ConquerRSV" was published by Eleanor Wilson and colleagues in 2023 in the journal New England Journal of Medicine. This research addresses respiratory syncytial virus infection. The primary research question was to determine the role of a single dose of an mRNA-based RSV vaccine in older adults.

- **Study design**: This was a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
- **Population**: The study included 35,413 participants (17,369 female and 18,044 male). The inclusion criteria were adults aged 60 years or older. Key exclusion criteria included an immunocompromised state, a history of a serious reaction to any prior vaccination, Guillain-Barré syndrome within six weeks of any prior influenza immunization, or having received/planned to receive any non-study vaccine within 28 days before or after the first study injection.
- **Interventions**: Participants were divided into two groups: 17,734 received the mRNA-based RSV vaccine (50 mcg of mRNA-1345 injected into the deltoid muscle), and 17,679 received a placebo (saline injection into the deltoid muscle).
- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant decrease in the incidence of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease with two or more signs and symptoms occurring within 14 days to 12 months after injection (1.4/1000 person-years versus 8.8/1000 person-years; absolute difference of -7.4/1000 person-years, 95% CI: -11.79 to -3.01).
- **Secondary outcomes**: There was a significant decrease in the incidence of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease with three or more signs and symptoms (0.5/1000 person-years versus 2.7/1000 person-years; absolute difference of -2.2/1000 person-years, 96% CI: 34.8 to 95.3).

### Real-world effectiveness and safety of nirsevimab, RSV maternal vaccine and RSV vaccines for older adults: A living systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ppaK2]. Thorax (2025). High credibility.

The long-acting monoclonal antibody nirsevimab and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines became available for the prevention of severe RSV-associated disease in 2023. While clinical trials showed good efficacy and safety, their restrictive inclusion criteria, small sample sizes, and short follow-up limit generalizability. This study aimed to summarize real-world evidence on the effectiveness and safety of nirsevimab, RSV maternal vaccine, and RSV vaccines for older adults.

- **Methods**: A living systematic review and meta-analysis, with bimonthly updated searches in three databases, was performed. Eligible studies were published from 1 December 2022 to 10 March 2025. Meta-analyses for the effectiveness of nirsevimab and RSV vaccines were carried out using a random-effects model. Safety data were summarized narratively.

- **Results**: A total of 50 publications, covering approximately 7.6 million people, were included. Nirsevimab showed 80.7% effectiveness (95% CI: 75.7% to 85.7%; seven studies) against RSV-related emergency department visits, 80.7% (95% CI: 76.1% to 85.2%; 17 studies) against hospital admissions, and 75.6% (95% CI: 63.3% to 87.9%; eight studies) against intensive care unit admissions. The effectiveness of RSV vaccines for older adults against RSV-related hospital admissions was 79.6% (95% CI: 73.8% to 85.3%; three studies). No effectiveness data were available for the RSV maternal vaccine. No severe adverse events were reported for nirsevimab, while RSV vaccines in older adults had fewer than 10 Guillain-Barré syndrome cases per million doses. No severe adverse events were reported.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^113mC1rg]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a cause of severe respiratory illness in older adults. In May 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first vaccines for the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged 60 years and older. Since May 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines Adult Work Group has met at least monthly to review available evidence regarding the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of these vaccines among adults aged 60 years and older. On June 21, 2023, ACIP voted to recommend that adults aged 60 years and older may receive a single dose of an RSV vaccine, using shared clinical decision-making. This report summarizes the body of evidence considered for this recommendation and provides clinical guidance for the use of RSV vaccines in adults aged 60 years and older. RSV vaccines have demonstrated moderate to high efficacy in preventing RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease and have the potential to prevent substantial morbidity and mortality among older adults; postmarketing surveillance will direct future guidance.

### A phase 1/2 study of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F vaccine with and without adjuvant in healthy older adults [^115uxVr9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of severe acute lower respiratory tract illness in infants and an important cause of disease in older adults. Although typically associated with mild symptoms in young adults, RSV can lead to more severe complications, including lower respiratory tract illness, in older adults and those with underlying medical conditions. These conditions include chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, solid organ cancer, and hematologic malignancy. In U.S. adults over 65 years old, RSV leads to approximately 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths annually.

Low serum neutralizing titers are associated with an increased risk of severe RSV disease, suggesting that increasing serum neutralizing titers through immunization may reduce disease severity. Although other RSV candidate vaccines have been evaluated, none have been successful in preventing RSV disease, and treatment consists of supportive care. An RSV subunit vaccine (RSVpreF) that contains prefusion stabilized F immunogens from the two RSV antigenic subgroups (A and B) is currently in development. In a first-in-human study in healthy adults aged 18 to 85 years, RSVpreF was safe, well-tolerated, and highly immunogenic. Because immunosenescence can reduce vaccine responses in the elderly, the addition of adjuvants to vaccine formulations may enhance immune responses in older adults.

The first-in-human phase 1/2 study evaluated RSVpreF formulations with and without Al(OH)3, and no benefit of the addition of Al(OH)3 was observed.

### An adjuvanted, postfusion F protein-based vaccine did not prevent respiratory syncytial virus illness in older adults [^116JcArn]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Although neutralizing antibody to the F protein is known to be protective in infants and to correlate with protection in older adults, this adjuvanted F protein-based RSV vaccine joins other F-based vaccines in failing to prevent RSV disease in adults. Most recently, following a successful phase 2 study, the Novavax RSV F-based vaccine failed to prevent RSV disease in a phase 3 study, with outcomes very similar to those reported here. The F protein used in the study, in the postfusion conformation, contains neutralizing epitopes including antigenic sites I, II, and IV on the F1 subunit. Recently, antibodies to the prefusion conformation were shown to have greater neutralizing activity, including in adults, than antibodies to postfusion F. In particular, antibodies to site Ø, which are not induced by postfusion F, are far more important than those to site II (the palivizumab epitope), which are induced by both prefusion and postfusion F. Thus, it is possible that a postfusion F-based vaccine may not generate appropriate neutralizing antibodies to prevent RSV disease in older adults. However, the efficacies of palivizumab and motavizumab suggest that, at least in young children, there is a concentration of antibodies to site II that can protect against RSV disease.

### Phase 1/2 randomized study of the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F vaccine in adults with concomitant inactivated influenza vaccine [^117AP2Gn]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Historically, RSV has primarily been considered a pediatric pathogen. However, during the past 30 years, it has been increasingly recognized as an important cause of respiratory disease among older adults. Despite 50 years of vaccine-development efforts, no vaccine to protect against RSV disease in any population has been licensed. This study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a novel RSV vaccine (RSVpreF) in healthy older adults, with the overall aim to boost immune responses in this population sufficiently to protect against RSV disease.

In healthy adults aged 50–85 years, RSVpreF was found to be safe and well-tolerated. The majority of local reactions and systemic events were mild or moderate in severity across RSVpreF doses and formulations. There was a potential trend toward higher rates of local reactions for RSVpreF formulated with Al(OH)₃. Coadministration with SIIV did not have a substantive impact on reactogenicity or safety. The proportions of participants reporting adverse events were similar across RSVpreF groups, and no serious adverse events were considered related to the study vaccine. These safety findings are consistent with phase 1/2 study results in adults aged 18–49 years, which have been reported separately.

### Respiratory syncytial virus infections in adults: a narrative review [^114zCeTP]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an RNA virus spread by droplet infection that affects all ages, is increasingly recognized as an important pathogen in adults, especially among older people living with comorbidities. Distinguishing RSV from other acute viral infections on clinical grounds alone, with sufficient precision to be clinically useful, is not possible. The reference standard diagnosis is by PCR; point-of-care tests perform less well with lower viral loads. Testing samples from a single respiratory tract site could result in underdetection.

RSV is identified in 6–11% of outpatient respiratory tract infection (RTI) consultations in older adults (≥ 60 years, or ≥ 65 years, depending on the study) and accounts for 4–11% of adults (≥ 18 years) hospitalized with RTI, with 6–15% of those hospitalized admitted to intensive care, and 1–12% of all adults hospitalized with RSV respiratory tract infection dying. Community-based studies estimate the yearly incidence of RSV infection at around 3–7% in adults aged 60 years and older in high-income countries.

Although RSV accounts for a similar disease burden as influenza in adults, those hospitalized with severe RSV disease are typically older (most ≥ 60 years), have more comorbidities, more respiratory symptoms, and are frequently without fever. Long-term sequelae are common and include deterioration of underlying disease (typically heart failure and COPD). There are few evidence-based RSV-specific treatments currently available, with supportive care being the main modality. Two protein subunit vaccines for protection from severe RSV disease are under investigation.

### Identifying gaps in respiratory syncytial virus disease epidemiology in the United States prior to the introduction of vaccines [^1154obGg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) frequently causes lower respiratory tract illness. No effective antivirals or vaccines for RSV are approved for use in the United States; however, there are at least 50 vaccines and monoclonal antibody products in development. Notably, those targeting older adults and pregnant women (to protect young infants) are in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. Unanswered questions regarding RSV epidemiology need to be identified and addressed prior to the introduction of RSV vaccines to guide the measurement of impact and future recommendations.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) convened a technical consultation to gather input from external subject matter experts on their individual perspectives regarding evidence gaps in RSV epidemiology in the United States, potential studies and surveillance platforms needed to fill these gaps, and prioritizing efforts. Participants articulated their individual views, and CDC staff synthesized these inputs into this report.

### The respiratory syncytial virus vaccine and monoclonal antibody landscape: The road to global access [^116S16Zg]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2024).

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the second most common pathogen causing infant mortality. Additionally, RSV is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (age ≥ 60 years), similar to influenza. A protein-based maternal vaccine and monoclonal antibody (mAb) are now market-approved to protect infants, while an mRNA and two protein-based vaccines are approved for older adults. The first-year experience protecting infants with nirsevimab in high-income countries shows a major public health benefit. It is expected that the RSV vaccine landscape will continue to develop in the coming years to protect all people globally.

The vaccine and mAb landscape remains active with 30 candidates in clinical development using four approaches: protein-based, live-attenuated and chimeric vector, mRNA, and mAbs. Candidates in late-phase trials aim to protect young infants using mAbs, older infants and toddlers with live-attenuated vaccines, and children and adults using protein-based and mRNA vaccines. This review provides an overview of RSV vaccines, highlighting different target populations, antigens, and trial results. As RSV vaccines have not yet reached low-income and middle-income countries, we outline urgent next steps to minimize the vaccine delay.

### Cost-effectiveness of prefusion F protein-based vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus disease for older adults in the United States [^116ty9xH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) among older adults, with significant health and socioeconomic burden on a global scale. RSV-related hospitalizations and healthcare costs are exacerbated by the presence of comorbidities, the rates of which have been increasing among older adults. In the United States alone, the annual direct and indirect costs of RSV disease in adults aged 60 years or older are estimated to exceed $3.9 billion. To reduce the burden of RSV disease among older adults, two highly efficacious prefusion F protein vaccines (Arexvy and Abrysvo) have been developed, authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration, and recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

With the availability of these vaccines, determining vaccination strategies that are cost-effective remains an important component of program implementation. In this study, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of various RSV vaccination programs by developing a discrete-event probabilistic model of RSV outcomes for adults aged 60 years or older in the United States. The model includes important characteristics of the study population with estimates of disease burden and the associated costs. Using stochastic simulations, we calculated the net-monetary benefit (NMB), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and the budget impact associated with the programs evaluated. In addition, we determined the range of vaccine price-per-dose (PPD) within which a program would be cost-effective, while accounting for the reported efficacy.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^115XmUoU]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Low credibility.

The efficacy of a single dose of the Pfizer respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RSVpreF vaccine was assessed against RSV-associated disease among adults aged 60 years and older in multiple countries from 2021 to 2023.

- **Efficacy assessment**: Manufacturer-calculated efficacy includes events occurring more than 14 days after injection, utilizing person-time data from the manufacturer's pivotal Phase 3 trial. These estimates are unadjusted.

- **Endpoints**: The RSVpreF trial had two co-primary endpoints. These were defined as RSV lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) with two or more lower respiratory signs or symptoms lasting more than one day, and RSV LRTI with three or more lower respiratory signs or symptoms persisting for over one day. Lower respiratory signs and symptoms included new or worsened cough, sputum production, wheezing, shortness of breath, and tachypnea. In this report, LRTD refers to the RSVpreF trial endpoint of RSV LRTI with three or more lower respiratory signs or symptoms.

- **Medically attended RSV-associated LRTD**: This was defined as LRTD prompting any health care visit, including outpatient or inpatient visits, such as hospitalization, emergency department visits, urgent care visits, home health care services, primary care physician office visits, pulmonologist office visits, specialist office visits, other visits, or telehealth contact. Estimates were not included in per-protocol assessments.

- **Season 1 vaccine efficacy estimates**: These estimates reflect efficacy against first events occurring during the first complete RSV season for Northern and Southern Hemisphere participants.

### Safety and immunogenicity of respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine when co-administered with adjuvanted seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine in older adults: A phase 3 randomized trial [^114uFhpj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of acute respiratory illness. In addition to infants, people of advanced age and those with certain underlying medical conditions (e.g. heart or lung disease and diabetes) are at increased risk for severe RSV disease. The adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein-based vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA, Arexvy, GSK) demonstrated efficacy against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease, was immunogenic, and had an acceptable safety profile in adults aged 60 years and older.

Older adults and people with diabetes, cardiopulmonary, and other chronic conditions are also at increased risk of severe outcomes and complications of influenza. Due to immunosenescence, influenza vaccines are often less effective in individuals aged 65 and older than in younger people. High-dose and adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines have been shown to improve effectiveness compared to conventional vaccines and are therefore recommended in older adults.

Influenza and RSV viruses co-circulate, and in regions with temperate climates, seasonal epidemics of both viruses occur mainly during winter months. In these regions, seasonal influenza vaccination is typically offered in early autumn, which is when RSV vaccination may also be recommended. Co-administration of influenza and RSV vaccines during a single consultation could help protect older adults against both infections, while reducing the number of doctor's appointments, improving convenience, and thereby increasing vaccination rates.

### Cost-effectiveness of prefusion F protein-based vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus disease for older adults in the United States [^1143jVtT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Two prefusion F protein-based vaccines, Arexvy and Abrysvo, have been authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration for protecting older adults against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated lower respiratory tract illness. We evaluated the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of these vaccines.

- **Methods**: We developed a discrete-event simulation model, parameterized with the burden of RSV disease including outpatient care, hospitalization, and death for adults aged 60 years or older in the United States. Taking into account the costs associated with these RSV-related outcomes, we calculated the net monetary benefit using quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained as a measure of effectiveness and determined the range of price-per-dose (PPD) for Arexvy and Abrysvo vaccination programs to be cost-effective from a societal perspective.

- **Results**: Using a willingness-to-pay of $95,000 per QALY gained, we found that vaccination programs could be cost-effective for a PPD up to $127 with Arexvy and $118 with Abrysvo over the first RSV season. Achieving an influenza-like vaccination coverage of 66% for the population of older adults in the United States, the budget impact of these programs at the maximum PPD ranged from $6.48 to $6.78 billion. If the benefits of vaccination extend to a second RSV season as reported in clinical trials, we estimated a maximum PPD of $235 for Arexvy and $245 for Abrysvo, with two-year budget impacts of $11.78 and $12.25 billion, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Vaccination of older adults would provide substantial direct health benefits.

### Noninferior immunogenicity and consistent safety of respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine in adults 50–59 years compared to ≥ 60 years of age [^116oU7u5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Participants in the non-AIR and AIR subcohorts of 50–59-year-olds were randomized (2:1 in each subcohort) to receive one intramuscular dose of RSVPreF3 OA. This included participants in the 50–59-non-AIR-RSV and 50–59-AIR-RSV groups or a placebo in the 50–59-non-AIR-placebo and 50–59-AIR-placebo groups. Participants aged 60 years and older received one intramuscular RSVPreF3 OA dose in the ≥ 60-RSV group. The study was observer-blind for the 50–59-year-old cohort until the primary endpoint analysis, after which it was single-blind. Meanwhile, it was open-label for participants aged 60 years and older.

- **Figure 2: Study design**:
	- **Abbreviations**: 50–59-AIR-placebo, group of 50–59-year-old participants at increased risk for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease who received placebo; 50–59-AIR-RSV, group of 50–59-year-old participants at increased risk for RSV disease who received RSV prefusion F protein–based vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA); 50–59-non-AIR-placebo, group of 50–59-year-old participants without increased risk for RSV disease who received placebo; 50–59-non-AIR-RSV, group of 50–59-year-old participants without increased risk for RSV disease who received RSVPreF3 OA; ≥ 60-RSV, group of ≥ 60-year-old participants who received RSVPreF3 OA.

The study adhered to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements. The protocol and amendment were approved by the relevant ethics committees.

### Safety and immunogenicity of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F (RSVPreF3) candidate vaccine in older adults: Phase 1/2 randomized clinical trial [^112pNxUS]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of vaccine formulations against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) containing the stabilized prefusion conformation of RSV fusion protein (RSVPreF3).

- **Methods**: This phase 1/2, randomized controlled, observer-blind study enrolled 48 young adults (YAs; aged 18–40 years) and 1005 older adults (OAs; aged 60–80 years) between January and August 2019. Participants were randomized into equally sized groups to receive two doses of unadjuvanted (YAs and OAs) or AS01-adjuvanted (OAs) vaccine or placebo two months apart. Vaccine safety and immunogenicity were assessed until one month (YAs) or twelve months (OAs) after the second vaccination.

- **Results**: The RSVPreF3 vaccines boosted humoral (RSVPreF3-specific immunoglobulin G [IgG] and RSV-A neutralizing antibody) responses, which increased in an antigen concentration-dependent manner and were highest after dose one. Compared to prevaccination, the geometric mean frequencies of polyfunctional CD4+ T cells increased after each dose and were significantly higher in adjuvanted than unadjuvanted vaccinees. Postvaccination immune responses persisted until the end of follow-up. Solicited adverse events were mostly mild to moderate and transient. Despite a higher observed reactogenicity of AS01-containing vaccines, no safety concerns were identified for any assessed formulation.

- **Conclusions**: Based on safety and immunogenicity profiles, the AS01E-adjuvanted vaccine containing 120 μg of RSVPreF3 was selected for further clinical development.

Clinical Trials Registration: NCT03814590.

### Immunogenicity and safety following 1 dose of AS01E-adjuvanted respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine in older adults: A phase 3 trial [^113ZhXXy]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The recently approved AS01E-adjuvanted respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prefusion F protein-based vaccine for older adults (RSVPreF3 OA) demonstrated high efficacy against RSV-related disease in individuals aged 60 and older.

- **Methods**: This ongoing phase 3 study in individuals 60 years and older evaluates immune persistence until three years after RSVPreF3 OA vaccination. Here, we describe interim results on humoral and cell-mediated immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety until one year post-dose 1.

- **Results**: A total of 1653 participants were vaccinated. One month post-dose 1, neutralization titers increased 10.5-fold for RSV-A and 7.8-fold for RSV-B compared to pre-dose 1. Titers then declined to levels 4.4-fold for RSV-A and 3.5-fold for RSV-B above pre-dose 1 at month 6 and remained 3.1-fold for RSV-A and 2.3-fold for RSV-B above pre-dose 1 levels after one year. RSVPreF3-binding immunoglobulin G levels and CD4+ T-cell frequencies showed similar kinetics. Solicited administration-site and systemic adverse events, mostly mild to moderate and transient, were reported by 62.2% and 49.5% of participants, respectively. Serious adverse events were reported by 3.9% of participants within six months post-dose 1; one case was considered vaccine-related.

- **Conclusions**: One RSVPreF3 OA dose elicited cell-mediated and RSV-A- and RSV-B-specific humoral immune responses that declined over time but remained above pre-dose 1 levels for at least one year. The vaccine was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Clinical Trials Registration: NCT04732871 (ClinicalTrials.gov).

### Characteristics and outcomes among adults aged ≥ 60 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus - RSV-NET, 12 states, July 2022-June 2023 [^11597Zgk]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality in older adults. In May 2023, two RSV vaccines were approved for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. In June 2023, the CDC recommended RSV vaccination for adults aged ≥ 60 years, using shared clinical decision-making. Using data from the Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network, a population-based hospitalization surveillance system operating in 12 states, this analysis examined characteristics, including age, underlying medical conditions, and clinical outcomes, of 3,218 adults aged ≥ 60 years who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection during July 2022-June 2023.

Among a random sample of 1,634 older adult patients with RSV-associated hospitalization, 54.1% were aged ≥ 75 years. The most common underlying medical conditions were obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes. Severe outcomes occurred in 18.5% (95% CI = 15.9%-21.2%) of hospitalized patients aged ≥ 60 years. Overall, 17.0% (95% CI = 14.5%-19.7%) of patients with RSV infection were admitted to an intensive care unit, 4.8% (95% CI = 3.5%-6.3%) required mechanical ventilation, and 4.7% (95% CI = 3.6%-6.1%) died; 17.2% (95% CI = 14.9%-19.8%) of all cases occurred in long-term care facility residents.

These data highlight the importance of prioritizing those at highest risk for severe RSV disease and suggest that clinicians and patients consider age, particularly age ≥ 75 years, and long-term care facility residence.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^113u1Hg4]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

- **RSV vaccination timing**: RSV vaccination is currently approved and recommended for administration as a single dose; sufficient evidence does not exist at this time to determine the need for revaccination. Optimally, vaccination should occur before the onset of the RSV season; however, typical RSV seasonality was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and has not returned to pre-pandemic patterns. For the 2023–24 season, clinicians should offer RSV vaccination to adults aged ≥ 60 years using shared clinical decision-making as early as vaccine supply becomes available and should continue to offer vaccination to eligible adults who remain unvaccinated.

- **Vaccine administration, including coadministration with other vaccines**: Coadministration of RSV vaccines with other adult vaccines during the same visit is acceptable. Available data on the immunogenicity of coadministration of RSV vaccines and other vaccines are currently limited. Coadministration of RSV and seasonal influenza vaccines met noninferiority criteria for immunogenicity with the exception of the FluA/Darwin H3N2 strain when the GSK RSV vaccine was coadministered with the adjuvanted quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. RSV and influenza antibody titers were somewhat lower with coadministration; however, the clinical significance of this is unknown.

Administering the RSV vaccine with one or more other vaccines at the same visit might increase local or systemic reactogenicity. Data are only available for the coadministration of RSV and influenza vaccines, and evidence is mixed regarding increased reactogenicity.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^112j45PJ]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

On June 21, 2023, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that adults aged 60 years and older may receive a single dose of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, using shared clinical decision-making.

- **Clinical guidance**: Unlike routine and risk-based vaccine recommendations, those based on shared clinical decision-making do not target all individuals within a particular age or risk group. For RSV vaccination, the decision should be based on a discussion between the healthcare provider and the patient. This discussion might be guided by the patient's risk for disease, characteristics, values, preferences, the provider's clinical discretion, and the characteristics of the vaccine.

As part of this dialogue, both providers and patients should consider the patient's risk for severe RSV-associated disease. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that persons aged 60 years and older who are at the highest risk for severe RSV disease, and who might most benefit from vaccination, include those with chronic medical conditions such as lung diseases (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma), cardiovascular diseases (such as congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease), moderate or severe immune compromise (attributable to a medical condition or receipt of immunosuppressive medications or treatment), diabetes mellitus, neurologic or neuromuscular conditions, kidney disorders, liver disorders, hematologic disorders, and individuals who are frail.

### Why the UK is vaccinating its older adult population against RSV-what geriatricians should know [^115EGHUE]. Age and Ageing (2024). High credibility.

The UK is launching a new free vaccination program against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for adults aged 75 or over. This initiative follows the development of safe and effective vaccines against RSV, and a growing realization of the burden of RSV-related disease in older adults — estimated at approximately 8,000 deaths and 175,000 general practitioner episodes every year in the UK. It is likely that the full burden of RSV-related illness is underappreciated and underreported due to a lack of testing and awareness of its dangers in older adults. Healthcare professionals working with older individuals should be aware of the evidence base and be prepared to advise patients on the risks and benefits of vaccination and non-vaccination. We briefly review the evidence for the safety and effectiveness of the two licensed vaccines against RSV, with a special focus on what geriatricians and others working with frailer, older people need to know.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^1155kCgp]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Low credibility.

The CDC will monitor adverse events, including cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and other inflammatory neurologic events after RSV vaccination through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the Vaccine Safety Datalink. The CDC will also prioritize estimating vaccine effectiveness against RSV-associated hospitalization. These data will be evaluated by the CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) as soon as they are available.

- **Studies by pharmaceutical companies**: According to FDA postmarketing requirements and commitments, GSK will conduct a study evaluating the risk for GBS, ADEM, and atrial fibrillation after vaccination with RSVPreF3. Pfizer will conduct two studies: one evaluating the risk for GBS and a second evaluating the risk for atrial fibrillation after vaccination with RSVpreF. Pfizer will also evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a second RSVpreF dose in a subset of participants in the main phase 3 trial. GSK will evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of RSVPreF3 revaccination as part of its main phase 3 trial.

### Respiratory syncytial virus humoral antibody responses in older adults after vaccination or infection [^116TTBxA]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Immunity to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is short-lived following infection. This study determined whether recently licensed RSV preF vaccines induce better immune responses than infection. Serum preF binding and neutralizing antibody to RSV A and B were measured in older adults at baseline and 30 days after RSV infection or vaccination with two licensed RSV preF protein vaccines.

- **Results**: Vaccination induced higher serum preF binding antibody and neutralizing responses than RSV infection (A2 RSV, 3306 vs. 1254, P < .0001; B1 RSV, 5153 vs. 2186, P < .0001).

- **Conclusions**: Vaccination with preF protein vaccines induces better humoral immune responses than RSV infection in older adults.

### Safety and immunogenicity of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F (RSVPreF3) candidate vaccine in older adults: Phase 1/2 randomized clinical trial [^117VYnYS]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

The study investigates the safety and immunogenicity of vaccine formulations against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that include the stabilized prefusion conformation of the RSV fusion protein (RSVPreF3). **Methods**: This phase 1/2, randomized controlled, observer-blind study enrolled 48 young adults (YAs; aged 18–40 years) and 1,005 older adults (OAs; aged 60–80 years) between January and August 2019. Participants were randomized into equally sized groups to receive two doses of unadjuvanted (YAs and OAs) or AS01-adjuvanted (OAs) vaccine or placebo two months apart. Vaccine safety and immunogenicity were assessed until one month (YAs) or 12 months (OAs) after the second vaccination.

- **Results**: The RSVPreF3 vaccines enhanced humoral (RSVPreF3-specific immunoglobulin G [IgG] and RSV-A neutralizing antibody) responses in an antigen concentration-dependent manner, reaching peak levels after the first dose. Compared to pre-vaccination, the geometric mean frequencies of polyfunctional CD4+ T cells increased following each dose and were significantly higher in adjuvanted than unadjuvanted vaccinees. The immune responses persisted post-vaccination through the end of follow-up. Solicited adverse events were mostly mild to moderate and transient. Despite a higher reactogenicity of AS01-containing vaccines, no safety concerns were identified for any assessed formulation.

- **Conclusions**: Based on safety and immunogenicity profiles, the AS01 E-adjuvanted vaccine containing 120 μg of RSVPreF3 was selected for further clinical development.

### Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine effectiveness against RSV-associated hospitalisations and emergency department encounters among adults aged 60 years and older in the United States, October, 2023, to March, 2024: a test-negative design analysis [^111REkuW]. Lancet (2024). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus vaccines, first recommended for use during 2023, were efficacious against lower respiratory tract disease in clinical trials. Limited real-world data regarding respiratory syncytial virus vaccine effectiveness are available. To inform vaccine policy and address gaps in evidence from clinical trials, we aimed to assess the effectiveness against respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalisations and emergency department encounters among adults aged at least 60 years.

- **Methods**: We conducted a test-negative design analysis in an electronic health records-based network in eight states in the United States, including hospitalisations and emergency department encounters with respiratory syncytial virus-like illness among adults aged at least 60 years who underwent respiratory syncytial virus testing from October 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024. Respiratory syncytial virus vaccination status at the time of the encounter was derived from electronic health record documentation, state and city immunisation registries, and for some sites, medical claims. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated by immunocompromise status, comparing the odds of vaccination among respiratory syncytial virus-positive case patients and respiratory syncytial virus-negative control patients, and adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, sex, calendar day, social vulnerability index, number of underlying non-respiratory medical conditions, presence of respiratory underlying medical conditions, and geographical region.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^1135jDUx]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Interim analysis was underpowered to estimate efficacy. Combined vaccine efficacy estimates from season 1 and 2 (interim) reflect efficacy against first events occurring at any time during season 1 or season 2. The mean duration from the start to the end of efficacy surveillance was approximately 12 months per participant.

Evidence regarding the safety of the Pfizer vaccine consisted of data from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, including the same ongoing phase 3 trial and a phase 1/2 trial with 91 participants aged ≥ 65 years who received either the vaccine formulation used in phase 3 or a placebo. Across both clinical trials, severe reactogenicity events (grade 3 or higher local or systemic reactions recorded during days 0–7 after vaccination) occurred in 1.0% of the intervention group participants, compared with 0.7% of the control group participants (pooled RR = 1.43; 95% CI = 0.85–2.39). The frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) across both trials was similar in the intervention group (4.3%) and control group (4.1%) (pooled RR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.94–1.15).

A higher number of participants in the intervention group than in the control group reported atrial fibrillation as an unsolicited event within 30 days after injection (intervention = 10 events [< 0.1%]; control = four events [< 0.1%], of which seven were SAEs [intervention = four; control = three]). Among participants who reported atrial fibrillation, a medical history of atrial fibrillation was reported by six of 10 Pfizer vaccine recipients and two of four placebo recipients.
