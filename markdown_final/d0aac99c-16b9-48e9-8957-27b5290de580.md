## Question

ideal uric acid level to prevent gout attack

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the ideal serum uric acid (sUA) level to prevent gout attacks and how to apply targets in different clinical scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiologic saturation threshold for monosodium urate crystal formation. Then, I should verify the consensus target for most patients with gout. Next, I will consider whether a lower target is needed in severe disease. After that, I need to check the evidence supporting treat-to-target strategies and monitoring cadence. Finally, I should review exceptions, controversies, and practical implementation details, including prophylaxis and dose titration principles.

> Let me first confirm the biological rationale. Monosodium urate crystals form when sUA exceeds the physiologic solubility limit of approximately 6.8 mg/dL, so to prevent new crystal formation and promote dissolution of existing crystals, sUA must be kept below this threshold. Practically, a target below 6 mg/dL provides a safety margin and is consistently associated with reduced flares and tophi regression, which aligns with treat-to-target principles in gout care [^114goZD1] [^1179RcH7] [^112L5Kyt].

> I should confirm the standard target for most patients with gout. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2020 guideline strongly recommends a treat-to-target strategy with dose titration to achieve and maintain sUA less than 6 mg/dL for all patients on urate-lowering therapy, and this is echoed by EULAR and BSR guidance recommending maintenance of sUA below 6 mg/dL lifelong, reflecting broad international consensus [^112L5Kyt] [^116z9DFQ] [^116Rkf8r] [^113YDqw6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether more severe phenotypes require a lower target. For patients with tophi, frequent flares, or chronic arthropathy, EULAR and treat-to-target consensus recommend a more stringent goal of less than 5 mg/dL until total crystal dissolution and clinical remission are achieved, because lower sUA accelerates crystal clearance and improves outcomes in refractory disease [^114N8dyy] [^112yeJDc] [^111hYypL].

> Next, I should review the evidence that supports these targets. Observational and cohort data show a graded relationship between higher baseline sUA and incident or recurrent gout, with markedly lower flare risk when sUA is below 6 mg/dL; prospective studies also demonstrate that maintaining sUA at or below 6 mg/dL over time depletes intra-articular crystals and reduces flares, reinforcing the treat-to-target paradigm as disease-modifying rather than merely symptomatic [^114VkdJP] [^113MVkTw] [^114goZD1].

> Wait, let me verify monitoring cadence and titration strategy. During ULT initiation and dose escalation, ACR recommends checking sUA every 2–5 weeks until the target is reached, then monitoring about every 6 months to sustain control. This cadence balances the need to avoid undertreatment and the risk of mobilization flares during early therapy, which are mitigated by concurrent anti-inflammatory prophylaxis for 3–6 months [^115GKEfs] [^113WdF9o].

> I need to ensure I address exceptions and controversies. ACR 2020 does not endorse routine sUA thresholds below 6 mg/dL for all patients due to insufficient trial evidence for specific lower targets and uncertainty about prolonged hypouricemia at or below 3 mg/dL; nonetheless, many experts accept a lower target in severe disease, and EULAR cautions against maintaining sUA below 3 mg/dL long term, reflecting a need to individualize and avoid overly aggressive lowering without proven benefit [^114YzRfQ] [^111hYypL] [^116MX7n6].

> Let me consider special populations and initiation triggers. For patients with a first gout flare, ACR advises against routine ULT initiation unless there is CKD stage 3 or higher, marked hyperuricemia (sUA > 9 mg/dL), or urolithiasis. Conversely, EULAR supports discussing early ULT at first presentation, especially in younger patients or those with high sUA and comorbidities, underscoring a shared decision-making approach in this gray zone [^1131DPMo] [^115K2FBK] [^1172bSbo].

> I should double-check practical implementation details. Allopurinol remains first-line ULT and should be started low (for example, 100 mg/day, lower in CKD) with gradual titration every 2–4 weeks toward the sUA target. Febuxostat is an alternative when allopurinol is not tolerated or ineffective, and combination therapy with a uricosuric can be considered if monotherapy fails to reach target despite appropriate dosing, with all changes guided by serial sUA measurements [^115Un7gV] [^112Enj59] [^112L5Kyt].

> But wait, what if the patient is concerned about "going too low"? I should reassure that while uric acid has antioxidant properties, inherited hypouricemia syndromes and clinical experience suggest that maintaining sUA in the 4–6 mg/dL range is generally safe. The main caution is to avoid sustained levels below 3 mg/dL in the absence of a compelling indication, and to monitor for any unexpected symptoms if sUA falls very low during aggressive therapy [^111XoK6q] [^116MX7n6].

> Putting this together, the ideal sUA level to prevent gout attacks is less than 6 mg/dL for most patients with gout, with a lower target of less than 5 mg/dL for those with severe disease features such as tophi or frequent flares. These targets are supported by biologic plausibility, observational data, and international guidelines, and they should be operationalized via a treat-to-target strategy with regular sUA monitoring and ULT dose titration to sustain control long term [^112L5Kyt] [^1161UGP6] [^114goZD1].

---

The ideal uric acid level to prevent gout attacks is **< 6 mg/dL (360 μmol/L)** for most patients, as this is below the solubility threshold for monosodium urate crystals and reduces flare risk [^114goZD1] [^1179RcH7]. For patients with severe disease (tophi, frequent flares, or chronic arthropathy), a **lower target of < 5 mg/dL (300 μmol/L)** is recommended to accelerate crystal dissolution and improve outcomes [^114N8dyy] [^112yeJDc]. Lifelong maintenance of serum urate below these targets is essential to prevent recurrence and joint damage [^114WLg4T] [^1179RcH7].

---

## Physiological basis for uric acid targets

Uric acid is a purine metabolite that, when supersaturated, precipitates as monosodium urate (MSU) crystals and triggers inflammation [^114goZD1]. The solubility limit of uric acid in plasma at 37°C is approximately **6.8 mg/dL (400 μmol/L)**; above this, MSU crystals form and persist, driving flares and joint damage [^1179RcH7]. Maintaining serum urate below this threshold is therefore critical to prevent crystal formation and promote dissolution of existing deposits [^114Pzu3i].

---

## Evidence-based uric acid targets

Major rheumatology guidelines converge on a **treat-to-target strategy** with specific serum urate goals:

| **Guideline** | **General target** | **Severe disease target** |
|-|-|-|
| American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2020 | < 6 mg/dL (360 μmol/L) | Not explicitly defined, but lower targets are reasonable in severe disease |
| European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2016 | < 6 mg/dL (360 μmol/L) | < 5 mg/dL (300 μmol/L) for tophi, frequent flares, or chronic arthropathy |
| British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) 2017 | ≤ 6 mg/dL (360 μmol/L) | Lower targets for severe disease |

---

These targets are supported by evidence that achieving and maintaining **serum urate < 6 mg/dL** reduces flares, promotes tophi resolution, and improves quality of life [^114goZD1] [^114Pzu3i]. Lower targets (** < 5 mg/dL**) further accelerate crystal dissolution in severe disease [^114N8dyy] [^112yeJDc].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting uric acid targets

- **Flare reduction**: Achieving serum urate < 6 mg/dL significantly reduces gout flares, with risk declining as urate levels fall [^114VkdJP] [^11229PHU].
- **Tophi resolution**: Maintaining urate < 6 mg/dL leads to gradual dissolution of tophi; lower targets hasten this process [^114Pzu3i] [^111XoK6q].
- **Quality of life**: Sustained urate control improves physical function and quality of life [^notfound].

---

## Individual patient factors influencing target uric acid levels

While < 6 mg/dL is the general target, **individualization is important**:

- **Severity of disease**: Tophi, frequent flares, or chronic arthropathy warrant lower targets (< 5 mg/dL) [^114N8dyy] [^112yeJDc].
- **Comorbidities**: Chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, or metabolic syndrome may influence therapy choice and monitoring, but targets remain similar [^112M1odJ] [^116z9DFQ].
- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making and adherence considerations may justify tailored targets within guideline ranges [^1137gmCk] [^114Nm3Rq].

---

## Risks and benefits of maintaining low uric acid levels

Benefits include fewer flares, tophi resolution, improved joint function, and potential cardiovascular risk reduction; risks are **generally low**, though prolonged hypouricemia (< 3 mg/dL) is discouraged due to uncertain long-term effects [^114goZD1] [^116MX7n6]. Overall, the benefits of maintaining serum urate below 6 mg/dL outweigh potential risks in patients with gout [^114goZD1] [^116z9DFQ].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of urate-lowering therapy

- **Initial monitoring**: Check serum urate every 2–5 weeks during dose titration [^115GKEfs] [^113WdF9o].
- **Maintenance monitoring**: Once at target, monitor every 6 months [^115GKEfs].
- **Dose titration**: Adjust therapy to maintain target urate, using allopurinol first-line and escalating to maximum tolerated dose or adding a uricosuric if needed [^115Un7gV] [^112tN7tR].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The ideal uric acid level to prevent gout attacks is **< 6 mg/dL (360 μmol/L)** for most patients, with a lower target of **< 5 mg/dL (300 μmol/L)** for severe disease. Lifelong maintenance of serum urate below these thresholds is essential to prevent flares, promote crystal dissolution, and improve patient outcomes [^114goZD1] [^116Rkf8r].

### Treating to target: a strategy to cure gout [^114Pzu3i]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute gout attacks and the long-term complications of gout are associated with the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) monohydrate crystals in the joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation. The aim of long-term treatment is to reduce the serum urate (sUA) level to 6 mg/dl (≤ 360 micromol/l), below the saturation point of MSU, so that new crystals cannot form and existing crystals are dissolved. Serial joint aspiration studies confirmed the disappearance of crystals with effective urate-lowering therapy. There is good evidence that achieving sUA < 6 mg/dl (360 micromol/l) results in freedom from acute gout attacks, and shrinkage and eventual disappearance of tophi. Gout patients must be informed about their diagnosis and educated about gout management including the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Patients starting urate-lowering therapy need to understand the importance of prophylactic therapy with colchicine or NSAIDs to reduce the risk of 'mobilization flares' in the first few months. In the long term, reduction in the sUA below the target level will result in gout being effectively cured.

### Refractory gout: what is it and what to do about it? [^1172mLZ9]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to discuss the defining characteristics of refractory gout and the pharmacological management of this problem.

Recent Findings

Refractory gout refers to those patients who have ongoing symptoms of active disease and cannot maintain a target serum urate less than 6 mg/dl. Patients with refractory gout have reduced quality of life, functional impairment, and joint destruction. Multiple factors contribute to refractory gout, and they often relate to delayed or insufficient dosing with allopurinol. Chronic kidney disease imparts a dose limitation on allopurinol that further impairs the effectiveness of urate-lowering therapy. Febuxostat, a novel xanthine oxidase inhibitor, represents a potential alternative to allopurinol in refractory gout patients. Uricase, the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of uric acid into allantoin, is showing promise with its ability to rapidly diminish serum urate levels. The recently defined role of the NALP3 inflammasome in the inflammatory phase of gout suggests a potential role for interleukin-1 inhibition in urate crystal-induced inflammation.

Summary

Refractory gout occurs when urate levels are not adequately controlled. Emerging therapies may improve the clinical course of patients with recalcitrant disease.

### Critical appraisal of serum urate targets in the management of gout [^111hYypL]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Gout management involves two broad aspects: treatment of gout flares to provide rapid symptomatic relief and long-term urate-lowering therapy to lower serum urate sufficiently to prevent gout flares from occurring. All of the major rheumatology societies recommend a target serum urate of < 5mg/dl (< 0.30mmol/l) or < 6mg/dl (< 0.36mmol/l), both of which are below the point of saturation for urate and therefore lead to monosodium urate crystal dissolution. In this Review, we describe the rationale for treat-to-target urate approach in the long-term management of gout and the current evidence and controversy around the appropriate serum urate targets.

The range of drug treatment options to treat acute and chronic gout has changed dramatically over the last 20 years. Yet, there is general consensus that drug therapy selection, dosing and dose titration, of both traditional and novel agents is far from optimally delivered in clinical practice. Updated guidelines disseminated in the last 5 years, from the American College of Physicians, the European League Against Rheumatism, and the American College of Rheumatology, provide clear guidance to the medical community on how and when to optimally integrate these therapeutic options into practice to improve the medical management of gout.

### Gout: an update [^117YHQA5]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Arthritis caused by gout (i.e., gouty arthritis) accounts for millions of outpatient visits annually, and the prevalence is increasing. Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in tissues leading to arthritis, soft tissue masses (i.e., tophi), nephrolithiasis, and urate nephropathy. The biologic precursor to gout is elevated serum uric acid levels (i.e., hyperuricemia). Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is common and usually does not progress to clinical gout. Acute gout most often presents as attacks of pain, erythema, and swelling of one or a few joints in the lower extremities. The diagnosis is confirmed if monosodium urate crystals are present in synovial fluid. First-line therapy for acute gout is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids, depending on comorbidities; colchicine is second-line therapy. After the first gout attack, modifiable risk factors (e.g., high-purine diet, alcohol use, obesity, diuretic therapy) should be addressed. Urate-lowering therapy for gout is initiated after multiple attacks or after the development of tophi or urate nephrolithiasis. Allopurinol is the most common therapy for chronic gout. Uricosuric agents are alternative therapies in patients with preserved renal function and no history of nephrolithiasis. During urate-lowering therapy, the dose should be titrated upward until the serum uric acid level is less than 6 mg per dL (355 micromol per L). When initiating urate-lowering therapy, concurrent prophylactic therapy with low-dose colchicine for three to six months may reduce flare-ups.

### Limitations of the current standards of care for treating gout and crystal deposition in the primary care setting: a review [^112amyuu]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

This article outlines several important issues regarding the management of patients with gout. The topics discussed include best practices for gout based on the most current guidelines, opportunities for improving gout management, and current and emerging therapies for gout.

Methods

[PubMed and Google Scholar databases] were search for all articles and trials published before 2016, using the key terms [hyperuricemia, gout, tophi, joint erosion, joint damage, treatment guidelines, American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), flare, comorbidity, epidemiology, adherence, serum uric acid (sUA), monosodium urate (MSU), < 6 mg/dL, MSU crystal formation, as well as individual drug names and classes of treatments of interest (allopurinol, febuxostat, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)]. Studies were selected that presented data on gout treatment, including drugs under development, and on the management of gout from both the physician and patient perspectives. The reference lists of identified articles were searched manually for additional publications.

Findings

Gout, a progressive debilitating form of inflammatory arthritis, is caused by factors that elevate serum uric acid (sUA) levels, leading to hyperuricemia. Continued elevated sUA can result in monosodium urate crystal deposition in joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation. Crystal deposition can lead to chronic gout, with an increased number of flares, tophi development, and structural joint damage. The aims of gout treatment are to reduce the sUA level to < 6 mg/dL, to inhibit the formation of new crystals, and to promote the dissolution of existing crystals. Gout is often poorly managed for several reasons, including a lack of adherence to treatment guidelines by health care providers, patients' poor adherence to therapy, and differences between a provider's and patient's perspectives regarding treatment.

Implications

Patients need to be educated about their diagnosis and management of the disease, such as the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Gout treatment may also confounded by contraindications to current standards of therapy and the limitations of current treatment paradigms. Recently approved medications, as well as drugs under development, may provide new ways for reaching the sUA target and also "curing" the disease.

### Allopurinol [^11417bTt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Testing Prior to Treatment Initiation

Prior to initiating treatment with allopurinol tablets in patients with gout, assess the following baseline tests: serum uric acid level, complete blood count, chemistry panel, liver function tests (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin), kidney function tests (serum creatinine and eGFR).

2.2 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares

Gout flares may occur after initiation of allopurinol tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with colchicine or an anti- inflammatory agent according to practice guidelines is recommended upon initiation of allopurinol tablets. While adjusting the dosage of allopurinol tablets in patients who are being treated with colchicine and/or anti-inflammatory agents, continue flare prophylaxis drugs until serum uric acid has been normalized and the patient has been free of gout flares for several months. If a gout flare occurs during allopurinol tablets treatment, allopurinol tablets need not be discontinued. Manage the gout flare concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^116MtxWn]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to treatment targets, ACR 2020 guidelines recommend to follow a treat-to-target strategy of urate-lowering therapy dose management, rather than a fixed, standard-dose urate-lowering therapy strategy, in all patients with gout taking urate-lowering therapy that includes dose titration and subsequent dosing guided by serial serum urate values to achieve a serum urate target.

### Updates in the management of gout [^115dzN3p]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with gout are cared for by primary care physicians. Although both the physician and patient may easily recognize the acute arthritis of gout, errors in selecting the most appropriate medication and proper dose are common. The clinical stages of gout include asymptomatic hyperuricemia, intermittent gouty arthritis, and chronic tophaceous gout. Treatment of gout is usually considered after the first attack of arthritis, typically podagra. The aims of treatment are to alleviate the pain and inflammation associated with acute attacks, prevent future attacks, and decrease uric acid levels. Confusion frequently arises because certain medications such as colchicine may have dual purposes: to treat an acute attack and to suppress future attacks. The purpose of this management update is to provide practical advice about prescribing the proper medication considering both treatment goals and patient comorbidities.

### Baseline urate level in adults with history of acute gout is… [^11229PHU]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Is a baseline serum urate level in adults with a history of acute gout accurate for predicting the risk of subsequent gout flare-ups. Bottom Line In patients with a history of gout, higher serum urate levels at baseline are associated with an increased risk of subsequent gout flare-ups and rates of hospitalization for recurrent gout. Synopsis The investigators analyzed data from multiple registries in the United Kingdom from 2006 to 2010 that linked adults with a history of gout and baseline serum urate levels to the subsequent risk of recurrent gout flare-ups. Recurrent gout flare-ups included hospitalization with gout or a diagnosis of new acute gout episodes in primary care with a prescription issued on the same day for corticosteroids, colchicine, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Over a mean follow-up of 8. 3 years, 1, 773 new episodes of gout were treated in primary care or during hospitalization.

More than 95% of recurrent gout flare-ups occurred in patients with baseline serum urate levels of 6 mg per dL or greater. Baseline serum urate levels were associated with recurrent acute gout in a graded manner. Rates of acute gout flare-ups per 1, 000 person-years were 10. 6 for patients with baseline urate levels of less than 6 mg per dL;
40. 1 for levels of 6. 0 to
6. 9 mg per dL; 82. 0 for levels of
7. 0 to 7. 9 mg per dL;
101. 3 for levels of 8. 0 to
8. 9 mg per dL; 125. 3 for levels of
9. 0 to 9. 9 mg per dL; and
132. 8 for levels of 10 mg per dL or greater. Rates of hospitalization were similarly related in a graded manner to baseline serum urate levels.

### What is allopurinol failure and what should we Do about It? [^111UKkfy]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Allopurinol is the most widely used urate-lowering medication worldwide. However, allopurinol failure is frequently observed in clinical practice. In this review, we provide a framework for assessing allopurinol failure, which includes failure of allopurinol to control serum urate concentrations, failure of allopurinol to control clinical symptoms, and failure of allopurinol due to an adverse drug reaction. Understanding the causes of allopurinol failure underpins the approach required to turn failure into success in gout management.

### Relationship between gout flare States and patient-reported outcomes after allopurinol initiation [^116Xneop]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Gout flares are the most important clinical feature for people who have gout. Gout flares affect just about every aspect of life including physical, psychological, social and family life. Prevention of gout flares is therefore a key goal of management for both health care providers and people with gout. Despite this, the majority of studies of urate‐lowering therapies have used serum urate (SU) as a "surrogate" measure for gout flares. However, the burden of gout flares is multifaceted and includes the number of flares as well as the severity of each individual flare. Defining the overall flare burden for people with gout has been challenging because of variable reporting and lack of a validated flares severity definition.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

Flare prevention and treatment are critical aspects of gout management.
As gout flare burden increases, so does the impact of gout on the patient.
Most people commencing allopurinol are able to achieve gout flare patient‐acceptable symptom state or low disease activity in the second six months of treatment.

### Association of uric acid-lowering therapies on gout frequency with bempedoic acid: clinical insights from CLEAR outcomes [^1157R1QY]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Gout is associated with a 17% higher incidence of all-cause mortality mostly attributed to cardiovascular death, compared to those without gout. Episodes of gout are largely preventable with lifestyle changes and use of UA-lowering medications. Many patients with a prior history of gout have hypercholesterolemia and require lipid-lowering therapy. If statins are not tolerated, other options are required to reduce cardiovascular risk. In CLEAR Outcomes patients with a prior history of gout derived similar cardiovascular benefits with bempedoic acid as those without. Data from the phase 3 bempedoic acid clinical development program consistently demonstrated a 0.8 mg/dL mean increase in UA and 1.1% increase in gout with bempedoic acid vs placebo and may result in some patients not being offered this potentially cardioprotective therapy. In this regard, the present study which assessed both incidence of gout and its potential mitigation provides evidence for practical management. Firstly, gout occurred infrequently with bempedoic acid and was comparable to placebo in those without a prior history of gout and with normal UA. In patients without prior gout, elevated UA levels at baseline were associated with a greater incidence of gout, consistent with phase 3 data for bempedoic acid. The highest frequency of gout occurred in those with both elevated UA levels at baseline and prior history of gout, but use of UA-lowering therapies lowered incidence of gout in this subpopulation either when used prior to commencing bempedoic acid or after a first event. For those not on UA-lowering therapies at baseline, the initiation of a UA-lowering medication after a gout AE reduced incidence of subsequent episodes.

### Failure to reach uric acid target of… [^115hcMD9]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout has emerged as the most common inflammatory arthritis in men, as well as one of the most common causes of arthritis in elderly women in high-income countriesA large body of evidence incriminates gout as a major determinant of mortality, both total and cardiovascular (CV). This risk increases with the severity of the gout. Treatment of gout has not been consistently associated with reductions in mortalitydue to the fact that serum uric acid (sUA)–mortality associations have not been sufficiently explored while on therapy.

International guidelines recommend target sUA levels of below 0.36 mmol/L (6 mg/dL) to reduce the frequency of gout flares and morbidity, although many treating physicians accept higher threshold values. High baseline sUA levels plus tophi are associated with elevated mortality, suggesting a plausible pathophysiological link between greater total body urate load and CV disease. It is speculated that patients with sUA levels beyond 0.36 mmol/L experience increased mortality despite urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and, therefore, a target threshold of at least < 0.36 mmol/L should be set as the desired threshold based on this premise.

We recently reported a strong independent association between the severity of gout and increased mortality, but this was during a period when the concept of treat-to-target was not yet established and the optimal target levels were not clearly defined. During this period, most patients were on active ULTs and patients not on target had short periods of follow-up. In this current study, we have expanded the primary cohort of patients with gout and the period of follow-up in order to explore the association of achieved sUA levels with mortality. Our objective was to determine whether elevated sUA levels and their pharmacological control are associated with increased total and CV mortality.

### Gout and NLRP3 inflammasome biology [^1158f87p]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Once gout flare has been effectively treated in the acute setting, long‐term gout management is also required. For people with frequent gout flares (two or more over 12 months), tophaceous gout, or joint damage related to gout, long‐term urate‐lowering therapy is strongly recommended to maintain a serum urate level below 6 mg/dL and dissolve deposited MSU crystals, which ultimately treats the underlying cause of gout flare and prevents ongoing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In the first months of initiating urate‐lowering therapy, gout flares are common, and these flares can be prevented by low doses of oral colchicine or other anti‐inflammatory medications. Consistent with the central role of IL‐1β in the initiation of acute MSU crystal–induced inflammation, canakinumab significantly prevented recurrent gout flares over 24 weeks in a randomized controlled trial.

### Allopurinol [^11713uhJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Gout

The initial recommended dosage for the management of gout is 100 mg orally daily, with weekly increments of 100 mg, until a serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less is reached. Initiating treatment with lower dosages of allopurinol tablets and titrating slowly, decreases the risk of gout flares and drug induced serious adverse reactions.

In patients with renal impairment the initial dosage is 50 mg orally daily with lower dose increases until serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less is reached. For complete dosage recommendations for patients with renal impairment see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

The minimal effective dosage is 100 mg to 200 mg daily and the maximal recommended dosage is 800 mg daily. The appropriate dosage may be administered in divided doses or as a single equivalent dose with the 300 mg tablet. Doses in excess of 300 mg should be administered in divided doses. Monitor patients' kidney function during the early stages of administration of allopurinol tablets and decrease the dosage or withdraw the drug if persistent abnormalities in kidney function occur [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

The dosage of allopurinol tablets to achieve control of gout varies with the severity of the disease. In general, gout control is achieved with 200 mg to 300 mg daily in patients with mild gout, and with 400 mg to 600 mg daily in patients with moderate to severe tophaceous gout. Gout attacks usually become shorter and less severe after several months of therapy.

Introduction — gout epidemiology and care gaps are highlighted, noting that gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, affecting ∼9.2 million adults (3.9%) in the US. The 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines and other international specialty society guidelines recommend treat-to-target strategies with use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), yet over the past 2 decades there has been no increase in ULT utilization and adherence to ULT remains poor and is the lowest adherence among treatments for 7 common chronic medical conditions. Prior 2012 ACR Guidelines have been criticized due to low quality of evidence supporting treat-to-target recommendations, and several clinical trials since then provided additional evidence leading the ACR Guidelines Subcommittee to determine that new guidelines with updated recommendations were warranted.

### Discordant American College of Physicians and international rheumatology guidelines for gout management: consensus statement of the gout, hyperuricemia and crystal-associated disease network (G-CAN) [^115UbSaQ]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

In November 2016, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute and recurrent gout. This guideline differs substantially from the latest guidelines generated by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and 3e (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative, despite reviewing largely the same body of evidence. The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) convened an expert panel to review the methodology and conclusions of these four sets of guidelines and examine possible reasons for discordance between them. The G-CAN position, presented here, is that the fundamental pathophysiological knowledge underlying gout care, and evidence from clinical experience and clinical trials, supports a treat-to-target approach for gout aimed at lowering serum urate levels to below the saturation threshold at which monosodium urate crystals form. This practice, which is truly evidence-based and promotes the steady reduction in tissue urate crystal deposits, is promoted by the ACR, EULAR and 3e Initiative recommendations. By contrast, the ACP does not provide a clear recommendation for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for patients with frequent, recurrent flares or those with tophi, nor does it recommend monitoring serum urate levels of patients prescribed ULT. Results from emerging clinical trials that have gout symptoms as the primary end point are expected to resolve this debate for all clinicians in the near term future.

### Failure to reach uric acid target of… [^1123GDgs]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

To put things in context, the prevalence of gout in adults in the USA has been estimated in 3.7% and the prevalence of gout with an indication of ULT in 2.2% (4.5 million people). Of the latter, target sUA may only be achieved in half of the patients. Very high sUA levels have been reported in association with atherogenesis, independently from HT and other CV risk factors. Some concerns have also been raised on the impact of excessive lowering of sUA, as studies have shown that hypouricaemia is correlated with endothelial dysfunction. The evidence to support this, however, is limited. Taken together, there is increasing evidence to support lower sUA thresholds of at least 6 mg/dL in patients with gout to improve survival.

We and others have advocated for earlier intervention in gout primarily to avoid exposure to long-standing hyperuricaemia and reduce the risk of chronic tophaceous gout. The treat-to-target strategy represents a global effort to improve gout control by reducing acute gout flares, preventing chronic tophaceaous gout and its attendant morbidity. The findings from this study also support a treat-to target strategy for improving the outcomes of patients with gout by preventing low grade inflammation and reducing the risks of CV and total mortality.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^114XNW5a]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

### Gout: can management be improved? [^111Y9QLk]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Ongoing reviews of Cochrane collaboration show that there is still very little reliable information based on randomized controlled trials on which to base treatment decisions in acute and chronic gout. Recent studies have stressed that avoidance of factors contributing to development of gouty attacks such as diuretic therapy, weight gain, and alcohol consumption may lead to a decrease in gouty arthritis. Attention to minidose aspirin and its effect on serum uric acid levels was addressed. A low carbohydrate, high protein and unsaturated fat diet was recommended for gouty patients since they all enhance insulin sensitivity and therefore may promote a reduction in serum uric acid levels. Treatment of gout in transplant recipients brings into focus some of the issues regarding management of gout, because gout is a common problem among transplant patients.

### EULAR evidence based recommendations for gout. part II: management. report of a task force of the EULAR standing committee for international clinical studies including therapeutics (ESCISIT) [^111yGxST]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence based recommendations for the management of gout.

Methods

The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorised according to the level of evidence. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales.

Results

12 key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. Propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (weight loss if obese; reduced alcohol consumption; low animal purine diet) and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasised. Recommended drugs for acute attacks were oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.50)), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long term ULT (ES = 1.39 (0.78 to 2.01)). If allopurinol toxicity occurs, options include other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol desensitisation, or a uricosuric. The uricosuric benzbromarone is more effective than allopurinol (ES = 1.50 (0.76 to 2.24)) and can be used in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency but may be hepatotoxic. When gout is associated with the use of diuretics, the diuretic should be stopped if possible. For prophylaxis against acute attacks, either colchicine 0.5–1 mg daily or an NSAID (with gastroprotection if indicated) are recommended.

Conclusions

12 key recommendations for management of gout were developed, using a combination of research based evidence and expert consensus. The evidence was evaluated and the SOR provided for each proposition.

### Serum uric acid and the risk of incident and recurrent gout: a systematic review [^114VkdJP]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Lowering serum uric acid (SUA) levels can essentially cure gout; however, this is not widely practiced. To summarize epidemiologic evidence related to this causal link, we conducted a systematic review of the published literature reporting the association between SUA level and incident and recurrent gout (i.e., gout flares).

Methods

We systematically searched Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews using separate search strategies for incident gout and recurrent gout. We screened 646 abstracts to identify 8 eligible articles reporting gout incidence and 913 abstracts to identify 18 articles reporting recurrent gout.

Results

For both gout incidence and recurrence, a graded trend was observed where the risk was increased with higher SUA levels. Gout incidence rates per 1000 person-years from population-based studies ranged from 0.8 (SUA ≤ 6 mg/dl) to 70.2 cases (SUA ≥ 10 mg/dl). Recurrent gout risk in clinical cohorts ranged from 12% (SUA ≤ 6 mg/dl) to 61% (SUA ≥ 9 mg/dl) among those receiving urate-lowering therapy (ULT), and 3.7% (SUA 6–7 mg/dl) to 61% (SUA > 9.3 mg/dl) after successful ULT. Retrospective database studies also showed a graded relationship, although the strength of the association was weaker. Studies reporting mean flares or time-to-flare according to SUA showed similar findings.

Conclusion

This systematic review confirms that higher SUA levels are associated with increased risk of incident and recurrent gout in a graded manner. Although few prospective cohorts have evaluated incident and recurrent gout according to SUA, the existing evidence underscores the need to treat to SUA targets, as recommended by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^1131ZDhT]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Methods — ACR guideline development used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to rate the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. The Core Team, Expert Panel, and Voting Panel generated 57 population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) questions covering indications for ULT (5 questions), approaches to initiating ULT (7 questions), ongoing management (18 questions), gout flares (10 questions), and lifestyle and other medication strategies in patients with gout (9 questions) and in individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia (8 questions), which were posted for public comment (October 30–November 30, 2018). An in-person Patient Panel of 8 male patients with gout reviewed the evidence report and discussed the desirable and undesirable outcomes for decision making; then prespecified outcomes were obtained for each PICO question from a systematic literature review, and both patient-identified outcomes and serum urate (SU) concentration (and tophus for PICO question 1) were specified as critical outcomes for all PICO questions specific to ULT.

### Gout [^1179RcH7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Gout is characterized by deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in or around joints, tendons, bursae, and other tissues, resulting in painful recurrent flares and tissue damage. Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, with a prevalence of 5.1% in the United States, affecting 12.1 million adults. When urate levels exceed the limit of solubility (6.8 mg/dL [400 μmol/L]), MSU crystals may form or grow. Gout flares are the result of inflammatory responses to MSU crystals. The primary method to prevent and reduce gout flares, tophi, chronic inflammatory arthritis, and joint damage is to reduce urate levels below the saturation threshold. The pathophysiology of gout is well understood, and inexpensive and effective therapies are available. However, outcomes for patients with gout remain poorly optimized.

### Failure to reach uric acid target of… [^115p6mg4]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Key messages

Severe gout is associated with cardiovascular mortality.
Achieving and maintaining a serum uric acid target below normal levels (< 0.36 mmol/L or 6 mg/dL) in the first year reduces the risk of dying substantially.
Lower uric acid level targets should be recommended for hyperuricaemic patients with gout. This information may help increase adherence to treatment if well explained to patients.

### Abstract… [^114fBRF9]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Prevention Serum urate–lowering therapy should be initiated to prevent recurrences in persons with a history of gout and any one of the following: at least two flares per year, tophi, or a history of nephrolithiasis. 20 Normal serum urate levels do not exclude the diagnosis of gout. They should be monitored periodically to assess preventive therapy in patients with recurrent gout and a history of elevated urate levels. 22 Urate-lowering therapy should be continued for three to six months after a flare if there are no ongoing symptoms. Therapy should continue indefinitely if there are ongoing signs or symptoms.
20. DIETARY MODIFICATIONS Weight gain is a significant risk factor for gout in men, whereas weight loss reduces the risk.

12 Intake of high-fructose corn syrup should be restricted 25, 26 because the fructose contributes to increased uric acid production as a byproduct of adenosine triphosphate catabolism. 20, 27 Patients with gout should limit their intake of purine-rich animal protein and avoid alcohol. 20 Purine-rich vegetables do not increase the risk of gout. 8, 9 Consumption of vegetables 9 and low-fat or nonfat dairy products 9 should be encouraged. PHARMACOLOGIC OPTIONS Pharmacologic options for prevention of chronic gout are outlined in Table 4. 21, 28 Although avoidance of loop and thiazide diuretics has been recommended for patients with hypertension and gout because these agents can increase uric acid levels, a systematic review found only small increases in the risk of gouty flares. 29 Calcium channel blockers and the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan are associated with a decreased risk of incident gout.

24, 30 Losartan is the only angiotensin receptor blocker with this property. Colchicine. Colchicine prevents gout flares at a dosage of 0. 6 to
1. 2 mg per day. The dose should be adjusted in patients with chronic kidney disease and when used with cytochrome P450 3A4 or P-glycoprotein inhibitors. The long-term adverse effects of colchicine include reversible axonal neuromyopathy.

### Therapeutic advances in gout [^116xcbwS]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent developments in the management of gout.

Recent Findings

Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of gout from EULAR, quality of care indicators, and outcome measures for clinical trials have been published. The standards of gout diagnosis and management are very low. Allopurinol remains the mainstay for serum uric acid lowering therapy. In an important percentage of patients receiving allopurinol, serum uric acid levels are insufficient to promote crystal dissolution. Febuxostat, a new serum uric acid lowering drug, has shown good results. Information on uricase continues to appear. For treatment of gouty inflammation, etoricoxib (a new cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor) has been shown to be as effective as indomethacin. Finally, the association of gout with the metabolic syndrome and its comorbidities, and the newly described association of gout with myocardial infarction, bring lifestyle and dietary modifications to the front in the management of gout.

Summary

Proper gout management requires changes to the physician's attitude towards the disease; essentially: (1) an unequivocal diagnosis based in urate crystal identification, (2) a clearly settled aim of the treatment: crystal elimination from the joints and elsewhere, and (3) proper use of the available therapeutic alternatives. Promoting a proper lifestyle appears to be especially important.

### Major unanswered questions in the clinical gout field [^111JghgA]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although gout is one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis, it has been relatively neglected until recently. Despite progress in many areas of pathophysiology and genetics of gout and the development of new urate lowering therapies, there remain a number of unanswered clinical questions. With the resurgence of interest in gout it is important to recognize key aspects of gout management that remain challenging and require further research.

Recent Findings

The unanswered clinical issues outlined in this review are basic aspects of gout management that clinicians treating people with gout face on a daily basis and include when urate lowering therapy should be commenced, the most appropriate target serum urate, use of prophylaxis when starting urate lowering therapy and the most appropriate urate lowering therapy, particularly for those with chronic kidney disease.

Summary

Some of the issues outlined in this article are the subject of ongoing clinical research and some, such as use of allopurinol in people with chronic kidney impairment, may be less relevant with the advent of potentially safer urate lowering therapies but until that time further understanding to aid clinical decision-making is required.

### The impact of gout guidelines [^115xVoQq]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the impact of recent treatment guidelines for the management of gout and the barriers to treating gout patients.

Recent Findings

Multiple guidelines for both the treatment and prevention of gout have been put forth in the last decade including those from the British Rheumatism Society; the European League Against Rheumatism; the Multinational Evidence, Expertise, Exchange Initiative; the Japanese Society of Gout and Nucleic Acid Metabolism; the American College of Rheumatology. These guidelines are designed to facilitate the management of gout by providers with key recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia, which is the greatest risk factor for developing gout. However, despite the extant guidelines, overall adherence to recommendations and uptake have been slow and initiation of urate-lowering therapy, titration of dosing, and monitoring of serum urate is infrequent. Greater education in proper management as well as increased awareness of new treatment strategies appear to be the primary reasons for this gap and offer avenues for improvement in management as well as areas for further research.

Summary

Gout remains a treatment challenge for both acute and chronic disease. Despite the availability of management guidelines, primary care providers are struggling with appropriate management of the disease. More research tools and strategies are needed to improve overall outcomes and quality of care.

### Importance of considering the gout flare: let's learn to walk and chew gum at the same time in gout clinical trial design [^114C3v41]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For people with gout, the most important aspect of the disease is the gout flare. Thus, a key focus in the management of gout should be the prevention of gout flares. Clinical trial design and researcher focus on serum urate (SU) level reduction to a predefined target has been driven by the scientific understanding that reducing the SU level below the point of saturation will lead to dissolution of monosodium urate crystals and thus remove the trigger for the flare; in other words, SU has been used as a surrogate marker for gout flares. For this reason, SU has been the primary end point for clinical trials of urate‐lowering therapy (ULT) in the modern era. The focus on SU in clinical trials without sufficient consideration of gout flares and their impact leaves clinicians with many unanswered questions about management of gout. Herein we discuss the importance of the gout flare and the rationale for changing our thinking to include a greater focus on the gout flare as a clinical trial outcome and what this might mean for gout management and research.

### Treatment of chronic gout. can we determine when urate stores are depleted enough to prevent attacks of gout? [^113MVkTw]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if lowering of serum uric acid (SUA) concentrations below 6 mg/dl or longer duration of lowered SUA will result in depletion of urate crystals from the knee joints and prevent further attacks of gout.

Methods

A prospective study was initiated 10 years ago at Philadelphia VA Medical Center to attempt to maintain SUA levels of patients with crystal proven gout at < 6.0 mg/dl. We recalled all 57 patients who were available during 1999. Patients were divided into 2 groups: Group A, with SUA still > 6 mg/dl, and Group B, with SUA ≤ 6 mg/dl. A knee joint aspirate was requested from all asymptomatic Group B patients and many in Group A. Aspirates were examined by polarized light microscopy for identification of crystals.

Results

There were no differences between the groups in age, sex, duration of gout, or serum creatinine. Group A (n = 38) had a mean of 6 attacks of gout for the recent year, those with tophi having the most frequent attacks. Among the 16 patients in this group who agreed to knee aspiration, monosodium urate (MSU) crystals were found in 14, although they were asymptomatic at the time. Nineteen patients (Group B) were able to maintain serum urate levels ≤ 6 mg/dl for > 12 months. Nearly half of them had no attack of gout for 2 or more years, with a mean of 1 attack in the last year for the whole group. Three patients in whom tophi were found did not have major flares of gout within the past year. Knee joint aspiration was done on 16 asymptomatic patients. Seven (44%) still had MSU crystals present in their knees. Patients in this group who were taking prophylactic colchicine did not differ with respect to the character of synovial fluid from those who had discontinued it for up to several years, although the frequency of attacks was less in those who continued colchicine.

Conclusion

A majority of patients were able to deplete urate crystal stores in their knee joint fluids when their SUA levels were kept to ≤ 6 mg/dl for several years. The mechanisms for persistence in some patients, and whether such crystals have clinical implications, are not known. Patients with chronic gout need serum urate concentrations to be kept low to prevent further attacks.

### Gout: thoughts about a Treat-to-target programme [^116dgtM5]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a rheumatic disease resulting from deposition of uric acid crystals in tissues and fluids within the body. The pathogenesis involves underexcretion or overproduction of uric acid, a biproduct of metabolism of purines, resulting in a metabolic disorder commonly known as hyperuricaemia, has a relatively high prevalence in the population (0.5–1%, similar to rheumatoid arthritis). Patients with hyperuricaemia are at risk to develop acute gouty attacks which may be severely painful. The attacks tend to occur episodically over a few days up to a week or two, but gout may later become chronic. Different aims of therapy and management are well suited as targets of treatment, including reduction of purine intake, increased of excretion of uric acid, mobilisation of urate pools within the body, and reduction of acute and chronic inflammation through anti-inflammatory medications.

### Recent pharmacological advances in the management of gout [^116FjgP5]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common cause of inflammatory arthritis worldwide, and reports show that despite availability of therapies, management is still suboptimal. The new EULAR 2016 recommendations for the treatment of gout highlight the huge development in gout therapies, and the number of drugs being trialled only continues to increase. A clinical review of the evidence that underlies the recommendations from EULAR can reveal possible gaps in the literature and avenues for future research into gout therapies.

### Development of a patient decision aid for the initiation of urate-lowering therapy in gout patients [^116Luks7]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

To enhance usability of a DA in daily practice, it is essential to adhere to national and/or international recommendations (EULAR/ACR). The distinction in the current DA between the first-line (allopurinol) and second-line (febuxostat and benzbromaron) ULT options, advice on lifestyle changes, need for prophylaxis on ULT initiation and the role of a sUA target are all supported in national as well as international recommendations.

The development of the DA posed some challenges, especially regarding evidence-based information on the risk of flares with and without ULT. Flares, the most important indicator of effectiveness for patients, are not or inconsistently reported in RCTs and follow-up is often too short to provide meaningful data on risks and benefits for clinical care. Fortunately, observational studies on the relation between sUA and flares with and without ULT were helpful, the discussion on sUA as biomarker for gout is ongoing. An advantage of this approach was that we could 'personalise' the DA, by presenting different risk for future flares depending on the initial sUA level while keeping the relative effectiveness of ULT. Some studies suggest that febuxostat has exacerbation of acute gout flares at the start of treatment, which is less the case for allopurinol, but evidence is weak. In other words, while febuxostat is more effective in sUA target achievement compared with allopurinol at the recommended dose, this does not translate into better effectiveness on flare reduction. Yet, the relationship between sUA and gout flares is complex.

Hyperuricaemia and monosodium urate crystal formation

Conditions which increase uric acid levels in the body (hyperuricaemia), such as increased intake or production of purines, as well as impaired excretion of uric acid by the kidneys, bear the risk that uric acid cannot be kept in solution and starts to precipitate into crystals. Concentrations of uric acid over 6.4 mg per decilitre, which exceed its solubilisation limit, allow the precipitation of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in the tissue. Increased dietary purine intake by, for example, excessive meat and beer consumption, or increased endogenous purine production associated with cell and tissue catabolism during forced diet or tumour cell lysis, are well-known conditions which increase the uric acid level in the body and facilitate the precipitation of MSU crystals. In addition, decline in kidney function due to ageing, disease or drugs, such as diuretics and aspirin, impairs the appropriate excretion of uric acid and therefore also increases the risk for crystal deposition. On the other hand, pharmacological interventionsare able to lower serum uric acid levels in the body, thereby regaining solubility of uric acid and resolving even already existing MSU crystal deposits. Such measures include those which (1) effectively lower the production of uric acid such as the xanthine oxidase inhibitors allopurinol and febuxostat, or (2) those which directly cleave uric acid, such as the recombinant enzyme pegloticase, or (3) those fostering the excretion of uric acid through the kidneys, such as benzbromarone or lesinurad (figures 1–3).

### Evaluating appropriate use of prophylactic colchicine for gout flare prevention [^116KLR43]. Arthritis Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism guidelines recommend colchicine to prevent gout flares in patients initiating and increasing uric acid–lowering therapy until serum uric acid is maintained at ≤ 6 mg/dl. We aimed to evaluate how well colchicine prescribing practices adhere to these guidelines and to examine factors associated with improved prescribing.

Methods

Electronic medical records were reviewed for 126 patients with active colchicine prescriptions for prophylaxis of gout flares. Colchicine prescribing was defined as inappropriate if 1) no concurrent urate-lowering therapy was prescribed, 2) uric acid was not at goal and urate-lowering therapy had not been increased in the past 3 months, or 3) uric acid goals were met for > 1 year and flares had resolved in the absence of tophi.

Results

Colchicine use was considered inappropriate in 93 patients (73.8%). Thirty-four were prescribed no urate-lowering therapy, 50 were above the uric acid goal without urate-lowering therapy increase in the prior 3 months, and 9 were at the uric acid goal for > 1 year without flares or tophi. Patients appropriately prescribed colchicine were younger and were more likely to have been seen by a rheumatologist. Allopurinol dose and allergy, uric acid level, and renal function were similar in the 2 groups.

Conclusion

We found a high prevalence of what we considered inappropriate prophylactic colchicine use, driven largely by failure to prescribe concurrent urate-lowering therapies or adequately increase these medications. Rheumatology consultation was associated with improved colchicine prescribing.

### Asymptomatic hyperuricemia: to treat or not a threat? A clinical and evidence-based approach to the management of hyperuricemia in the context of cardiovascular diseases [^117WfGia]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is defined by serum uric acid levels above 6.2mg/dl in women and 7mg/dl in men. In the presence of monosodium urate crystal formation and articular inflammation, hyperuricemia may become symptomatic (namely nephrolithiasis and gout). Uric acid results from purine catabolism and is at the centre of a complex metabolic interplay that involves oxidative stress, inflammation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation and insulin resistance. Uric acid levels present a continuous relation with conditions like hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are reported to have an impact on risk of cardiovascular events. However, whether elevated uric acid is a causal agent and thus a possible therapeutic target is still uncertain and matter of further investigation. Treating symptomatic hyperuricemia involves lowering uric acid drugs and controlling inflammation. Urate-lowering agents are well tolerated but show minimal impact on cardiovascular events in patients with gout. Use of direct-acting urate-lowering agents in asymptomatic hyperuricemia associated with cardiovascular diseases does not warrant a clear benefit, whereas addressing cardiovascular issues with guideline-recommended therapies lowers uric acid and reduces the occurrence of cardiovascular events. Regular assessment of uric acid and clinical symptoms is advised before starting and renewing a urate-lowering treatment.

### An update on the management of gout [^114tvpxq]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and its incidence in the UK has steadily increased from 1.5% in 1997 to 2.5% in 2012. 1,2 It is characterised by deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues and usually presents with intermittent painful attacks followed by long periods of remission. 3 It has been suggested that the management of gout in the UK remains suboptimal. 1 In 2004, we concluded that there was a woeful lack of evidence to guide treatment or prophylaxis for gout, particularly with regard to choice of drug or doses. 4 The introduction of new drugs and new evidence on the efficacy and safety of treatment options has led the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the British Society of Rheumatology (BSR) to update their guidelines on the management of gout. 2,5 Nevertheless, there are differing views on target serum uric acid (SUA) levels and the role of urate lowering treatment (ULT). 2,5–7 Here, we review the latest guidance on the management of gout and consider the role of long-term ULT.

### Gout: will the "King of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured? [^111dUatd]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines, treat-to-target serum urate, and new drugs for gout

Treatment guidelines for gout have been recently published by both the ACR in 2012 and the EULAR in 2016. Several key aspects of appropriate management are addressed in these treatment guidelines, which should be helpful to providers since gout care is critically suboptimal. A controversial recommendation to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease by adjusting to creatinine clearance in EULAR guidelines has been challenged since the risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated with allopurinol seems to be related to the starting dose, not the maximal dose. Therefore, there is currently no rationale to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease.

Treat-to-target (T2T) serum urate (sUA) is not a new concept in gout, but one that has been brought to center stage by the leading treatment recommendations in the ACR and the EULAR guidelines, as well as by a recent consensus statement about T2T. The rheumatology community considers the existing evidence regarding T2T to a goal of sUA less than 6 mg/dL in gout as sufficient based on three key correlates for achieving sUA less than 6 mg/dL, namely (1) associated benefits of reduction of gout flares, tophi, and medical care costs by achieving and maintaining this target; (2) the fact that this sUA target is below the solubility threshold of urate, which prevents its crystallization in body fluids at 6.8 mg/dL; and (3) the use of this sUA threshold as a primary outcome in gout randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the drug approval of urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) by the regulatory authorities. Since there is no way to achieve the sUA target without monitoring or reassessing sUA, rheumatologists monitor sUA and aim for an sUA target level of less than 6 mg/dL. Therapeutic doses of allopurinol (100–800 mg/day) or febuxostat (40–80 mg/day) or a combination with uricosurics is often needed to achieve target sUA. Allopurinol maximum dose need not be reduced, even in the presence of renal failure, since adverse events are related to initial, and not final, allopurinol dose; pegloticase is another option. Appropriately titrated ULT doses can help achieve a near cure for gout by resolving all urate crystals.

### Management and cure of gouty arthritis [^115Upk21]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in the United States. Gouty arthritis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the result of chronic hyperuricemia. Gout is effectively managed and potentially cured by decreasing the overall urate burden with serum urate-lowering therapy. When serum urate is maintained at less than 6.0 mg/dL, urate deposition is resolved, and gout can be cured. Unfortunately, because of less than optimal physician monitoring and dose escalation, many patients do not achieve these urate levels.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116D1smR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant prophylaxis, in patients with recurrent gout attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Development of a patient decision aid for the initiation of urate-lowering therapy in gout patients [^1123qn9e]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is worldwide the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and is a well treatable disease. Serum uric acid (sUA) is the main risk factor for gout. Lifestyle modifications, especially weight loss in case of obesity, play a relevant but limited role in controlling gout. Therefore, most patients will require pharmacological urate-lowering therapy (ULT) to prevent recurrent gout flares and damage related to tophi, and possibly to reduce risk for comorbidities.

Several ULTs are available to reduce sUA. Allopurinol and febuxostat inhibit the activity of xanthine oxidase and, thus, reduce uric acid production. Benzbromaron and lesinurad are examples of uricosuric drugs and increase the renal excretion of sUA. Despite the availability of an increasing number and mode of actions of ULT, gout management is far from optimal. Suboptimal treatment is related to various key barriers among both physicians and patients. Importantly, a qualitative study revealed that a substantial proportion of patients receives contradictory information from different physician, contributing to poor treatment initiation and adherence.

Several initiatives have been proposed to improve outcomes of gout treatment in daily practice. Shared decision-making (SDM) is increasingly considered to constitute an essential part of quality of care and is grounded in the paradigm that care should be based on best evidence and should be respectful of, and responsive to, individual patient preferences, needs and values. Decision aids (DAs) are tools that support patients and physicians in the choices when decisions about screening, treatment or other interventions have to be made. Shared decisions involve at minimum a patient and physician, although other healthcare providers or friends and family members may be invited to participate. The process ensures that correct and complete information is readily available for patients and physicians. While effectiveness of DAs on disease outcomes is as yet contradictory, patients exposed to DAs feel more knowledgeable, better informed and more clear about their values.

The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommends to initiate ULT after a first gout flare.EULAR recommendation specifically stated that: ' Patients with gout should receive full information and be fully involved in decision-making concerning the use of ULT to increase uptake and adherence of ULT'. To support the implementation of this recommendation and, thus, improve quality of care, this paper describes the development of a DA for patients with gout that have an indication to (re-)start ULT in a clinical setting.

### How would you manage this patient with gout? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^114HRgjZ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. In 2012, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) issued a guideline, which was followed in 2017 by one from the American College of Physicians (ACP). The guidelines agree on treating acute gout with a corticosteroid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or colchicine and on not initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for most patients after a first gout attack and in those whose attacks are infrequent (< 2 per year). However, they differ on treatment of both recurrent gout and problematic gout. The ACR advocates a "treat-to-target" approach, and the ACP did not find enough evidence to support this approach and offered an alternative strategy that bases intensity of ULT on the goal of avoiding recurrent gout attacks ("treat-to-avoid-symptoms") with no monitoring of urate levels. They also disagree on the role of a gout-specific diet. Here, a general internist and a rheumatologist discuss these guidelines; they debate how they would manage an acute attack of gout, if and when to initiate ULT, and the goals for ULT. Lastly, they offer specific advice for a patient who is uncertain about whether to begin this therapy.

### Gout [^1137gmCk]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The treat to target strategy looks attractive for management of gout because it removes the causal mechanism inducing formation, growth, and aggregation of urate crystals. Further reduction of serum urate (sUA) levels below the threshold may dissolve crystals more rapidly. It is generally agreed that sUA less than 6 mg/dL is acceptable as a therapeutic and long-term preventive target, with < 5 mg/dL for the most severe cases. The challenges that this approach in gout is facing include whether proposed targets are the best for desired outcomes, whether they fit patient-related outcomes, and whether they adequately balance effectiveness and safety.

### Gout [^114goZD1]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Gout is a chronic disease of deposition of monosodium urate crystals, which form in the presence of increased urate concentrations. Although environmental factors contribute to hyperuricaemia, renal and gut excretion of urate is central to regulation of serum urate, and genetic factors are important. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and release of interleukin 1β have key roles in initiation of acute gout flares. A "treat to target serum urate" approach is essential for effective gout management; long-term lowering of serum urate to less than 360 μmol/L leads to crystal dissolution and ultimately to suppression of flares. An allopurinol dose-escalation strategy is frequently effective for achieving treatment targets, and several new urate-lowering drugs are also available. Worldwide, rates of initiation and continuation of urate-lowering therapy are very low, and, consequently, achievement of serum urate targets is infrequent. Strategies to improve quality of gout care are needed.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of gout [^11588AtF]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Gout is characterized by painful joint inflammation, most commonly in the first metatarsophalangeal joint, resulting from precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in a joint space. Gout is typically diagnosed using clinical criteria from the American College of Rheumatology. Diagnosis may be confirmed by identification of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid of the affected joint. Acute gout may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, or colchicine. To reduce the likelihood of recurrent flares, patients should limit their consumption of certain purine-rich foods (e.g., organ meats, shellfish) and avoid alcoholic drinks (especially beer) and beverages sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup. Consumption of vegetables and low-fat or nonfat dairy products should be encouraged. The use of loop and thiazide diuretics can increase uric acid levels, whereas the use of the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan increases urinary excretion of uric acid. Reduction of uric acid levels is key to avoiding gout flares. Allopurinol and febuxostat are first-line medications for the prevention of recurrent gout, and colchicine and/or probenecid are reserved for patients who cannot tolerate first-line agents or in whom first-line agents are ineffective. Patients receiving urate-lowering medications should be treated concurrently with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, or low-dose corticosteroids to prevent flares. Treatment should continue for at least three months after uric acid levels fall below the target goal in those without tophi, and for six months in those with a history of tophi.

### Optimizing current treatment of gout [^113bRmD5]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis worldwide. Although effective treatments exist to eliminate sodium urate crystals and to 'cure' the disease, the management of gout is often suboptimal. This article reviews available treatments, recommended best practice and barriers to effective care, and how these barriers might be overcome. To optimize the management of gout, health professionals need to know not only how to treat acute attacks but also how to up-titrate urate-lowering therapy against a specific target level of serum uric acid that is below the saturation point for crystal formation. Current perspectives are changing towards much earlier use of urate-lowering therapy, even at the time of first diagnosis of gout. Holistic assessment and patient education are essential to address patient-specific risk factors and ensuring adherence to individualized therapy. Shared decision-making between a fully informed patient and practitioner greatly increases the likelihood of curing gout.

### Coronary artery disease:' gout' in the artery? [^113BqSAK]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Accordingly, there is further parallelism between gout and ASCVD: the necessity of a long-term strategy to prevent endpoints by addressing the root cause of the respective disease to be treated. In gout, a prolonged effective urate-lowering therapy by xanthine oxidase inhibitors like allopurinol or febuxostat, uricosurics, absorption inhibitors, or uricase agents can effectively reduce the frequency of gout attacks because the rate of crystal dissolution is slow and proportional to the degree of the urate-lowering achieved. In ASCVD, again, a therapy that inhibits hepatic cholesterol synthesis (statin), inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption (ezetimibe), or prevents the degradation of hepatic LDL receptors (PCSKi), ultimately stimulates the hepatic LDL receptor-mediated uptake of LDL particles, and has been used either alone or in combination to control LDL cholesterol level in the circulation. The efficacy of these therapies for reducing ASCVD endpoints is firmly established. Although xanthine oxidase inhibitors are implicated to affect surrogate endpoints (blood pressure and endothelial function), their effects on clinical outcomes of ASCVD have not been established. Inversely, cholesterol lowering is not known to affect uric acid or gout.

### Relationship of interleukin-1 β blockade with incident gout and serum uric acid levels: exploratory analysis of a randomized controlled trial [^1157EffU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Although studies have shown that interleukin-1β (IL-1β) inhibitors can shorten gout attacks, whether they can prevent gout attacks is unclear.

Objective

To examine the relationship among canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-1β; serum uric acid levels; and the incidence of gout attacks.

Design

Secondary exploratory analysis of a randomized controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01327846).

Setting

Many clinical sites in 39 countries.

Participants

10 059 patients with a prior myocardial infarction and a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level of at least 19.1 nmol/L.

Intervention

Random allocation to canakinumab (50 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg) versus placebo, administered subcutaneously every 3 months.

Measurements

Rates of gout attacks were compared across patients with different baseline concentrations of serum uric acid (≤ 404.5 µmol/L, 404.6 to 535.3 µmol/L, and ≥ 535.4 µmol/L) and in different intervention groups in Cox proportional hazards regression models.

Results

The median baseline concentration of serum uric acid was 362.9 µmol/L (interquartile range, 309.3 to 428.3 µmol/L), and median follow-up was 3.7 years. Among participants receiving placebo, incidence rates of gout attacks for serum uric acid concentrations of 404.5 µmol/L or lower, 404.6 to 535.3 µmol/L, and 535.4 µmol/L or higher were 0.28, 1.36, and 5.94, respectively, per 100 person-years. Canakinumab did not affect serum uric acid levels over time yet significantly reduced rates of gout attacks at all baseline concentrations of serum uric acid: Hazard ratios were 0.40 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.73) for concentrations of 404.5 µmol/L or lower, 0.48 (CI, 0.31 to 0.74) for those between 404.6 and 535.3 µmol/L, and 0.45 (CI, 0.28 to 0.72) for those of 535.4 µmol/L or higher.

Limitation

No adjudication of gout attacks.

Conclusion

Quarterly canakinumab administration was associated with significantly reduced risk for gout attacks without any change in serum uric acid levels. These data have relevance for the development of agents for gout that target the IL-1β pathway of innate immunity.

### Reassessing serum urate targets in the management of refractory gout: can you go too low? [^111XoK6q]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Growing awareness of patients with refractory gout is prompting a reassessment of treatment strategy. This article reviews the current practice of targeting serum urate concentrations (sUA) in the mid-normal range (roughly 4–6 mg/dl) and considers the rationale for more aggressively lowering sUA in patients with poorly controlled chronic gout. Some hypothetical concerns with inducing hypouricemia are considered and relevant clinical evidence is evaluated.

Recent Findings

Recent studies confirm the benefits of modestly reducing sUA in many gout patients. However, tophi and tissue stores of monosodium urate crystals resolve slowly, particularly in patients with longstanding disease. Consistent with physicochemical principles, the rate of decrease in tophus size increases with a reduction in sUA concentration over a broad range. Reducing sUA to near or below 2 mg/dl can be achieved in some patients with current urate-lowering drugs, but new drugs now under investigation may be more effective. As a free radical scavenger, uric acid has been postulated to protect from oxidative stress. However, inherited disorders associated with profound, lifelong hypouricemia indicate that maintaining sUA near or below 2 mg/dl would probably be safe.

Summary

Targeting low sUA could improve the elimination of tissue urate stores and achieve better control of disease in patients with refractory gout.

### Improving the use of allopurinol in chronic gout: monitoring oxypurinol levels to guide therapy [^1114qdmg]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Urate-lowering therapy (ULT), adjusted to achieve and maintain a serum uric acid (SUA) of < 6 mg/dl, remains the standard of care for the chronic management of gout. New urate-lowering medications are important options; however, these agents should be reserved for patients who do not tolerate or cannot achieve SUA < 6 mg/dl on allopurinol. The result of oxypurinol monitoring to guide allopurinol therapy suggests that allopurinol should still be considered first-line ULT for gout.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for gout, more specifically with respect to serum urate monitoring, ACR 2012 guidelines recommend to monitor serum urate every 2–5 weeks during urate-lowering therapy titration, and obtain follow-up measurements every 6 months once the serum urate target is achieved.

### When underlying biology threatens the randomization principle-initial gout flares of urate-lowering therapy [^1117jaHD]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Flare is the dominant feature of gout and occurs because of inflammatory response to monosodium urate crystals; prevention of gout flares should be the major goal of gout care. However, a paradoxical increase in the risk of flare following initiation of urate-lowering therapy presents considerable challenges for proving the expected long-term benefits of flare prevention in clinical trials. Nevertheless, excluding from enumeration flares that occur in the initial post-randomization period (which can last several months to 1 year) can threaten the core benefits of randomization: the characteristics of the remaining participants can differ from those who were randomized, introducing potential bias from confounding (both measured and unmeasured); participants who drop out or die are excluded from the analysis, introducing potential selection bias; and, finally, ignoring initial flares underestimates participants' experience during the trial. This Perspective discusses these issues and recommends measures that will allow for high-level evidence that preserves the randomization principle, to satisfy methodological scrutiny and generate robust evidence-based guidelines for gout care.

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to treatment targets, BSR 2017 guidelines recommend to adjust the dose of urate-lowering therapy to maintain the serum urate level ≤ 360 mcmol/L after some years of successful treatment when tophi have resolved and the patient remains free of symptoms, to avoid further crystal deposition and the possibility of adverse effects associated with a very low serum urate level.

### Serum uric acid and the risk of cardiovascular and renal disease [^113PGPNG]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Substantial evidence suggests that chronic hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for hypertension, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular diseases. This highlights the need for greater attention to serum uric acid levels when profiling patients, and suggests that the threshold above which uricemia is considered abnormal is 6 mg/dl, in light of the available evidence. Another important question is whether lowering serum uric acid can improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes, and what therapeutic mechanism of action could provide more clinical benefits to patients; the available literature shows a trend toward improvement associated with administration of urate-lowering drugs, in particular for the xanthine oxidase inhibitors. The demonstrated efficacy of urate-lowering therapy on outcomes other than gout flares leads to the consideration that treatment may be beneficial even in the absence of overt gout when hyperuricemia accompanies other clinical conditions, such as urate deposition, advanced CKD or cardiovascular risk factors.

Third is the challenge of optimal control of serum urate. Urate-lowering therapy (ULT), including allopurinol and uricosurics are generic, affordable and the most commonly used drugs; febuxostat, a new ULT, is also available but is more expensive. ULT helps to lower serum urate levels, a central biochemical abnormality in gout. Current guidelines recommend achieving target serum urate of < 6 mg/dl, which is achieved by at most 33% of patients. This is a meaningful disease target since it is associated with improved clinical outcomes such as reduction in gout flares, regression of tophi and lower health care costs (Figure 8). Achievement of this serum urate target frequently requires titration of allopurinol dose, sometimes up to 900 mg/day, rather than a monotonic 300 mg/day dose. Physicians aiming to help gout patients avoid flares and improve function to reap the full benefits of treatment need to monitor serum urate after starting ULT and follow a treat-to-target approach. We believe that it is possible to achieve disease remission in many gout patients with this approach. This is a paradigm shift in gout treatment that is likely to improve patient outcomes. A patient-physician collaborative approach is essential for this to succeed.

We have summarized briefly a few opportunities for improving care and outcomes of gout, for which there are several additional opportunities for interventions not mentioned here. We are at the brink of new treatment options for gout, a better understanding of its impact on cardiovascular and renal disease, and better management with existing pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches. This is an exciting era in which we know ever more about this ancient disease.

Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy (ULT) — For patients receiving ULT, a treat-to-target management strategy that includes ULT dose titration and serial serum urate (SU) measurements to achieve a target SU, over a fixed-dose ULT strategy, is strongly recommended for all patients receiving ULT; achieving and maintaining an SU target of < 6 mg/dl over the use of no target is strongly recommended for all patients receiving ULT, and ULT titration should occur over a reasonable time frame (e.g., weeks to months, not years).
