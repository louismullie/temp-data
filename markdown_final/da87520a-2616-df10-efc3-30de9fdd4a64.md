## Question

What are some RA medications and what do they do

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what medications are used for rheumatoid arthritis and what they do. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching treatment goals and the treat-to-target paradigm. Then, I should classify the main drug classes and their mechanisms. Next, I will detail conventional synthetic DMARDs, followed by biologic DMARDs, then targeted synthetic DMARDs, and finally glucocorticoids and NSAIDs. After that, I should integrate how these are sequenced in practice, including special populations and difficult-to-treat RA. Finally, I will synthesize key principles and safety considerations that guide choices and monitoring, making sure I verify claims against guidelines and high-quality reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the treatment goals and framework, because everything else hinges on this. Modern RA care aims for low disease activity or remission using a treat-to-target strategy with frequent assessment and escalation if targets are not met, ideally within 3 to 6 months, and this approach has markedly improved outcomes including halting radiographic progression in many patients [^8a035809] [^a84226bd] [^418340ba]. Hold on, I should verify the initial target recommendation: the ACR advises that an initial goal of low disease activity is reasonable for many patients, with remission pursued when feasible, which aligns with pragmatic, individualized care [^088b8918].

> Next, I should review the drug classes, and I need to ensure I use the accepted taxonomy. The main categories are conventional synthetic DMARDs, biologic DMARDs, and targeted synthetic DMARDs, with glucocorticoids used as bridging therapy and NSAIDs for symptom control; this classification is consistent with contemporary guidelines and reviews [^ff2d481f] [^8a035809]. Wait, let me verify the inclusion of JAK inhibitors: yes, JAK inhibitors are targeted synthetic DMARDs, distinct from biologics, and are integrated into current algorithms [^ff2d481f].

> I will now examine conventional synthetic DMARDs, starting with methotrexate, the anchor first-line therapy. Methotrexate inhibits folate metabolism and has broad immunomodulatory effects, reducing synovitis and slowing radiographic progression; it is typically dosed weekly with folate supplementation and is the preferred initial DMARD in most patients without contraindications [^f3e8edf2] [^ff2d481f] [^8caa58b1]. Hold on, I should verify administration nuances: guidelines allow oral or subcutaneous routes, and if oral therapy fails to reach target, switching to subcutaneous can improve bioavailability and outcomes, which is a practical escalation step [^3a5912ef] [^23d820ba].

> Let me consider other csDMARDs and their roles. Leflunomide inhibits pyrimidine synthesis and is a reasonable alternative or add-on when methotrexate is not tolerated or insufficient; sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine are milder options often used in low disease activity or in combination regimens, with hydroxychloroquine also offering favorable cardiovascular risk profiles compared with some alternatives [^ff2d481f] [^2578bc65]. I should double-check combination therapy: triple therapy with methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine can be effective when methotrexate monotherapy is inadequate, though benefits may be less pronounced when glucocorticoids are used as bridging therapy, which is an important caveat in early disease [^fbba68b6].

> Now, biologic DMARDs. These are monoclonal antibodies or fusion proteins targeting specific immune pathways and are generally reserved after inadequate response to csDMARDs, particularly methotrexate, or when poor prognostic features are present; they are categorized by mechanism such as TNF inhibition, IL-6 receptor blockade, T cell co-stimulation blockade, and B cell depletion [^ff2d481f] [^8a035809]. Wait, let me verify comparative effectiveness: head-to-head and strategy trials show broadly similar efficacy across TNF inhibitors, abatacept, and tocilizumab when combined with methotrexate, with choice often driven by comorbidity, safety, and patient preference rather than clear superiority of one agent [^ece45837] [^862a7807].

> I will now detail TNF inhibitors, since they are the most commonly used biologics. Agents like etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, infliximab, and golimumab neutralize TNF-α, rapidly reducing inflammation, improving symptoms, and halting radiographic progression; they are most effective when combined with methotrexate to mitigate immunogenicity and enhance durability of response [^a887bd5f] [^30ccbea8]. Hold on, I should verify switching within class: if a patient fails one TNF inhibitor, switching to a second can still work, though switching mechanism of action is often favored after primary nonresponse or intolerance [^a887bd5f] [^b5f89581].

> Next, I should review non-TNF biologics. Tocilizumab blocks the IL-6 receptor and is particularly useful in high inflammatory phenotypes and in patients who cannot tolerate methotrexate; abatacept inhibits T cell co-stimulation and is a good option in seronegative disease or when TNF inhibitors are contraindicated; rituximab depletes B cells and is effective after TNF failure or in the presence of autoantibodies, though it is less commonly used early due to infusion-related logistics and safety considerations [^ff2d481f]. Let me reconsider the sequence: current guidance supports choosing among bDMARDs based on comorbidity, safety, and patient factors rather than a rigid hierarchy, reinforcing individualized selection [^ff2d481f].

> Targeted synthetic DMARDs come next, and I need to ensure I distinguish them from biologics. JAK inhibitors such as tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib, and filgotinib block JAK-STAT signaling, providing oral, rapidly acting control with efficacy comparable to bDMARDs; they are particularly valuable when methotrexate is not tolerated or as an alternative to bDMARDs in difficult-to-treat RA, though they carry class warnings for infection, thrombosis, and cardiovascular events requiring screening and monitoring [^ff2d481f] [^3dc7c6e6]. Wait, let me verify positioning: EULAR notes that in patients unable to use csDMARDs as comedication, IL-6 inhibitors or tsDMARDs may be reasonable choices, reflecting pragmatic flexibility in sequencing [^cd5e8431].

> Glucocorticoids deserve a careful, balanced discussion. Low-dose prednisone is used as bridging therapy to control symptoms while DMARDs take effect, and short courses can improve short-term outcomes; however, prolonged use is discouraged due to infection, osteoporosis, cardiovascular, and metabolic risks, and guidelines advise using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with explicit plans to taper [^ff2d481f] [^fc6aeb2d] [^5493cbe9]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of risk: cardiovascular risk is nontrivial with chronic glucocorticoids, reinforcing the need for dose minimization and tapering whenever possible [^2578bc65].

> NSAIDs remain important for symptom control but do not modify disease. They reduce pain and stiffness via COX inhibition and are often used adjunctively, though gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular risks must be weighed, especially in older adults or those with comorbidities [^ff2d481f] [^2578bc65]. I should confirm that NSAIDs are not substitutes for DMARDs: correct, they are adjuncts and should be paired with disease-modifying therapy in active RA [^ff2d481f].

> Next, I should review treatment sequencing and the concept of difficult-to-treat RA, and I need to ensure I align with current definitions. Standard practice is to start methotrexate, escalate dose or switch to subcutaneous if targets are not met, and then add or switch to a bDMARD or tsDMARD if low disease activity or remission is not achieved by about 3 to 6 months; D2T RA is defined by failure of at least two b/tsDMARDs of different mechanisms after adequate csDMARD therapy, with persistent active disease and clinician or patient-perceived challenge, warranting careful phenotyping and mechanism-switching strategies [^ff2d481f] [^b5f89581] [^839802a4]. But wait, what if inflammation is absent despite symptoms? I should double-check that D2T workups must verify true inflammatory activity before further immunosuppression, as noninflammatory drivers like fibromyalgia or osteoarthritis require different management [^fb5f448a].

> I should also consider special populations and safety modifiers. In patients with malignancy, serious infection, heart failure, or liver disease, bDMARD and tsDMARD choices and timing must be individualized, and some agents may be contraindicated or require enhanced monitoring; shared decision-making is essential to balance benefit and risk in these scenarios [^ff2d481f] [^ea39ab24]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines emphasize reassessment every 3 months and tapering only after sustained remission for at least 6 months; yes, that is correct and helps mitigate flare risk during dose reduction [^418340ba] [^79515d27].

> Let me synthesize key principles to ensure coherence. Early, aggressive DMARD therapy with treat-to-target monitoring improves long-term outcomes, methotrexate remains first-line unless contraindicated, and escalation to bDMARDs or tsDMARDs is appropriate when targets are not met; glucocorticoids are short-term bridges, and NSAIDs are adjuncts for symptom relief; in difficult-to-treat disease, switching mechanisms and verifying true inflammation are critical, and emerging options like CAR T cells are investigational rather than standard care [^8a035809] [^ff2d481f] [^ef4ce0b9]. I should confirm that precision biomarkers remain limited, so treatment selection still relies on clinical factors, comorbidities, and patient preferences, reinforcing the need for iterative reassessment and shared decision-making [^25e09665] [^65b4cfe3].

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) medications fall into four main classes: **conventional synthetic DMARDs** (e.g. methotrexate), which suppress the immune system to slow disease progression; **biologic DMARDs** (e.g. TNF inhibitors, IL-6 blockers, B-cell/T-cell modulators), which target specific immune pathways for greater efficacy; **targeted synthetic DMARDs** (JAK inhibitors), which block intracellular signaling to reduce inflammation; and **glucocorticoids**, used short-term for rapid symptom control. Methotrexate is **first-line** [^ff2d481f]; biologics or JAK inhibitors are added if response is inadequate [^b5f89581], and glucocorticoids are tapered to minimize adverse effects [^fc6aeb2d]. Treatment is individualized based on disease activity, comorbidities, and patient preferences, with regular monitoring for efficacy and safety [^418340ba].

## Conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs)

CsDMARDs are the foundation of RA therapy; they suppress the immune system broadly to reduce inflammation and prevent joint damage [^429b99ba]. Methotrexate is **first-line** due to its efficacy, safety, and cost [^ff2d481f]; other csDMARDs include leflunomide, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine [^429b99ba].

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical role** |
|-|-|-|
| Methotrexate | - Folate antagonist <br/> - Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase <br/> - Reduces proliferation of immune cells | - First-line <br/> - Reduces inflammation <br/> - Prevents joint damage [^f3e8edf2] |
| Leflunomide | - Inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase <br/> - Reduces pyrimidine synthesis | Alternative to methotrexate or in combination [^notfound] |
| Sulfasalazine | - Anti-inflammatory <br/> - Modulates immune response | Mild disease or combination therapy [^5493cbe9] |
| Hydroxychloroquine | - Modulates immune response <br/> - Anti-inflammatory | Mild disease or combination therapy [^5493cbe9] |

---

## Biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs)

Biologics target specific immune pathways, offering greater efficacy than csDMARDs, especially in moderate-to-severe disease [^30ccbea8]. They are typically added when csDMARDs are inadequate or not tolerated [^b5f89581].

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical role** |
|-|-|-|
| TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, certolizumab, golimumab) | Neutralize TNF-α, reducing inflammation | - Effective in most patients <br/> - Often combined with methotrexate [^a887bd5f] |
| IL-6 receptor antagonists (tocilizumab, sarilumab) | Block IL-6 signaling, reducing inflammation | Effective in moderate-to-severe RA [^a887bd5f] |
| B-cell depleting agents (rituximab) | Depletes CD20+ B cells | Useful in refractory RA or with autoantibodies [^a887bd5f] |
| T-cell co-stimulation modulators (abatacept) | Inhibits T-cell activation | Alternative for inadequate response to TNF inhibitors [^a887bd5f] |

---

## Targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs)

TsDMARDs are oral small molecules that inhibit intracellular signaling pathways, providing an alternative to biologics [^3dc7c6e6]. JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib, filgotinib) block JAK-STAT signaling, reducing inflammation and are effective in moderate-to-severe RA, including difficult-to-treat cases [^3dc7c6e6].

---

## Glucocorticoids

Glucocorticoids (prednisone) provide rapid anti-inflammatory effects and are used short-term as bridging therapy while DMARDs take effect [^60b87de7]. Long-term use is limited by adverse effects (osteoporosis, infection, cardiovascular risk) [^5493cbe9], so they are tapered to the lowest effective dose or discontinued when possible [^60b87de7].

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

- **Treat-to-target**: Aim for low disease activity or remission with regular assessment and adjustment [^418340ba].
- **Individualization**: Tailor therapy to disease activity, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^65b4cfe3].
- **Monitoring**: Regular labs for liver, kidney, blood counts, and infection screening (e.g. TB) are essential [^16cee2c5].

---

RA medications include csDMARDs, bDMARDs, tsDMARDs, and glucocorticoids, each with distinct mechanisms and roles. Methotrexate is **first-line** [^ff2d481f]; biologics or JAK inhibitors are added if needed [^b5f89581], and glucocorticoids are used short-term [^60b87de7]. Treatment is individualized and monitored to balance efficacy and safety [^418340ba].

### Novel treatment strategies in rheumatoid arthritis [^a84226bd]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

New treatment strategies have substantially changed the course of rheumatoid arthritis. Many patients can achieve remission if the disease is recognised early and is treated promptly and continuously; however, some individuals do not respond adequately to treatment. Rapid diagnosis and a treat-to-target approach with tight monitoring and control, can increase the likelihood of remission in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In this Series paper, we describe new insights into the management of rheumatoid arthritis with targeted therapy approaches using classic and novel medications, and outline the potential effects of precision medicine in this challenging disease. Articles are included that investigate the treat-to-target approach, which includes adding or de-escalating treatment. Rheumatoid arthritis treatment is impeded by delayed diagnosis, problematic access to specialists, and difficulties adhering to treat-to-target principles. Clinical management goals in rheumatoid arthritis include enabling rapid access to optimum diagnosis and care and the well informed use of multiple treatments approved for this disease.

### Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: state of the art 2009 [^c61dd21f]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Few, if any, areas of medical therapeutics have witnessed such dramatic changes as those that have occurred in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) during the past two decades. Improvements in clinical trials methodologies, the introduction of no fewer than nine biologic agents with distinct mechanisms of action, and the development of better strategies for the use of such agents have all contributed to the new age in RA therapeutics. Here, we review these developments and attempt to describe the current landscape of RA therapy in terms of available treatments, agreed-upon principles of RA management, as well as some important controversies in this field. Despite the great pace at which developments are moving, a treatment-free remission for patients with RA remains an elusive goal and unmet medical needs remain. The quest for better therapies for this potentially devastating disease is still as important as ever; research in this exciting area is ongoing, and it is reasonable to hope that, during the next decade, developments will lead to improved, rationally designed, targeted therapies for RA.

### One year in review 2019: novelties in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^c871ade6]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The current treatment approach in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) follows a stepwise management, starting from early introduction of conventional synthetic (cs) disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), moving to biological (b) DMARDs and targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs. In the last few years, new drugs with different mechanisms of action have demonstrated their efficacy in treating such a disabling condition, and their approval, along with other more "experienced" treatments, has established their effectiveness on disease activity, damage accrual prevention, patients' quality of life improvement, confirming their safety profile. Moreover, new molecular pathways are under investigation as potential targets of new advanced therapies. Clinicians' capability of stratifying treatment strategies and decisions has improved, with several new tools for the optimisation of long-term management of RA; however, a high proportion of patients are refractory to the available drugs. Finally, as RA is a systemic disease, the knowledge in multi-systemic complications of the disease has grown, as well as the possibility in improving extra-articular manifestations of the disease, although certain drugs have potentially relevant non-articular effects, which need to be monitored. This narrative review summarises the most relevant studies published over the last year in the field of treatment of RA, with the major aim to let clinicians and researchers reflect on "what is new", "what is effective" and "what is safe".

### Mechanism of action of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis, and the search for biomarkers [^f3e8edf2]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2016). Medium credibility.

The treatment and outcomes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been transformed over the past two decades. Low disease activity and remission are now frequently achieved, and this success is largely the result of the evolution of treatment paradigms and the introduction of new therapeutic agents. Despite the rapid pace of change, the most commonly used drug in RA remains methotrexate, which is considered the anchor drug for this condition. In this Review, we describe the known pharmacokinetic properties and putative mechanisms of action of methotrexate. Consideration of the pharmacodynamic perspective could inform the development of biomarkers of responsiveness to methotrexate, enabling therapy to be targeted to specific groups of patients. Such biomarkers could revolutionize the management of RA.

### Glucocorticoids: action and new therapeutic insights in rheumatoid arthritis [^1abaf074]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize the mechanism of action of glucocorticoids, the direction that current research is taking and what this might mean for clinicians.

Recent Findings

New cellular actions of glucocorticoids have been identified, and offer new drug targets. There is increasing competition to find a glucocorticoid formulation or analogue that enhances therapeutic effects while reducing adverse effects. Clinically, there is increasing evidence for the disease-modifying effects of glucocorticoids, which makes these developments topical and relevant. Better understanding of the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis and the circadian variation in symptoms that is a hallmark of the disease may also affect the way that we use these drugs.

Summary

Glucocorticoids are about to enter a renaissance based on better understanding of how they work and novel approaches to new therapeutic targets.

### Drug development in rheumatoid arthritis [^443f9025]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

In the United States, therapies to treat rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis are approved and regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. This article explores certain aspects of the current Food and Drug Administration guidance for drugs, devices, and biologic products intended to treat these diseases (in this article, the term "drug" refers to any therapy in rheumatoid arthritis). Newer therapeutics are targeting not only important molecular pathways but also new labeling claims intended to represent clinically relevant outcomes. Questions regarding whether the risks of these new therapies are balanced by their effectiveness will evolve. The process of improvement in clinical trial design and metrics, along with improved therapies, will undoubtedly present both familiar and new challenges in the future.

### Is there still a role for traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in rheumatoid arthritis? [^dad5c1cf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic and debilitating disease, affecting an estimated 1% of the population worldwide. The past decade has witnessed an explosion in our understanding of the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis and therefore in our ability to more effectively target the disease process. Although a cure remains elusive, remission is an approachable goal. There has been a complete remodeling of the traditional "pyramid" by rheumatologists, who now treat rheumatoid arthritis earlier and more aggressively than ever before. Standard single therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, which was previously the final step in treating rheumatoid arthritis, is now practically bypassed in the deluge of information suggesting that combinations of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or newer biologic therapy is more effective. It is difficult to assimilate all the data and develop a rational approach; however, the bottom line is often the deciding factor: the newer agents are tremendously expensive. The intent of this article is to review recent and relevant trials in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, suggest a treatment algorithm, and argue that traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs continue to play a pivotal role.

### 2015 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^16cee2c5]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a new evidence-based, pharmacologic treatment guideline for rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

We conducted systematic reviews to synthesize the evidence for the benefits and harms of various treatment options. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to rate the quality of evidence. We employed a group consensus process to grade the strength of recommendations (either strong or conditional). A strong recommendation indicates that clinicians are certain that the benefits of an intervention far outweigh the harms (or vice versa). A conditional recommendation denotes uncertainty over the balance of benefits and harms and/or more significant variability in patient values and preferences.

Results

The guideline covers the use of traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologic agents, tofacitinib, and glucocorticoids in early (< 6 months) and established (≥ 6 months) RA. In addition, it provides recommendations on using a treat-to-target approach, tapering and discontinuing medications, and the use of biologic agents and DMARDs in patients with hepatitis, congestive heart failure, malignancy, and serious infections. The guideline addresses the use of vaccines in patients starting/receiving DMARDs or biologic agents, screening for tuberculosis in patients starting/receiving biologic agents or tofacitinib, and laboratory monitoring for traditional DMARDs. The guideline includes 74 recommendations: 23% are strong and 77% are conditional.

Conclusion

This RA guideline should serve as a tool for clinicians and patients (our two target audiences) for pharmacologic treatment decisions in commonly encountered clinical situations. These recommendations are not prescriptive, and the treatment decisions should be made by physicians and patients through a shared decision-making process taking into account patients' values, preferences, and comorbidities. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies.

### Are biological targets the final goal for rheumatoid arthritis therapy? [^8693fb82]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disorder that is characterized by inflammation of synovial membrane and the release of inflammatory cytokines that ultimately results in joint destruction and disability. The therapeutic treatment plan for treating RA patient initiates with disease-modifying antirheumatic agents (DMARDs) and ends with the use of biological agents. Sometimes a combination of DMARDs and the biological agents are aggressively initiated. But this is not sufficient to retard the underlying progression of the disease and hence the disease-associated pain persists. The solution lies in the treatment of causative factors. Modern therapy aims at targeting newer target sites that can not only overcome the problem of pain and disability but also minimize the occurrence of adverse effects faced by the traditional therapeutic approach.

Areas Covered

This review covers the pathological background of the disease in brief, the traditional and newer biologicals, therapeutic targets and novel therapies for rheumatoid arthritis.

Expert Opinion

Better management of the disease can be achieved by focusing on the causes and the factors of the disease. Newer therapies and targeting sites discussed in this review focus on treating the disability at the cellular level without affecting body's immune response and minimizing the chances of infection and inflammation.

### 'Difficult to treat' rheumatoid arthritis: current position and considerations for next steps [^8f828ad0]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Key messages

The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology definition of difficult to treat (D2T) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) captures a heterogeneous population that have failed multiple mechanism of action targeted therapies,
Management of D2T-RA requires careful characterisation for the presence or absence of inflammation to support pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies,
Further understanding of this population may identify new therapeutic targets and offer the opportunity to intervene earlier in the disease course to mitigate the development of D2T-RA.

### Early start and stop of biologics: has the time come? [^9db6c02b]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite considerable advances in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, results are still not satisfactory for all patients. The treatment goal in rheumatoid arthritis is remission, and there currently are numerous conventional and biological medications available to reach this aim. There are also different treatment strategies but with only limited comparative evidence about their efficacies. More patients now achieve remission while on treatment, but it remains elusive in the majority of patients. Treatment-free remission, the ultimate goal of therapy, is only achieved in very few patients; even when this happens, it is most likely due to the natural course of the disease rather than to any specific therapies. Modern treatment is based on the initiation of aggressive therapy as soon as the diagnosis is established, and on modifying or intensifying therapy guided by frequent assessment of disease activity. In this commentary we will discuss the current treatment paradigm as well as the possibility of an induction-maintenance regimen with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in early rheumatoid arthritis.

### Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with DMARDs: predictors of response… [^4c57222d]. ClinicalTrials (2014). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a common disease with approximately 1% prevalence. RA is also a chronic, progressive disease with no cure. Current treatment goals are to minimize pain, limit joint damage, and prevent loss of function. Drugs used to treat RA include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, including biologics. Methotrexate is the DMARD of choice in the treatment of RA, because it has been shown to be both well-tolerated and effective in achieving clinical response and slowing radiographic progression of disease. However, this drug alone results in remissions in only a small subset of patients and reliable predictors of DMARD response have yet to be identified. This study is open-label of 16-weeks duration to identify factors that help predict clinical responses to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs therapies for rheumatoid arthritis participants.

All participants will receive a starting dose of DMARD medication which may be adjusted by the investigator as needed. Rheumatoid arthritis is a common disease with approximately 1% prevalence.

### Rheumatoid arthritis [^889bcde9]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic inflammatory disorder that mainly affects the diarthrodial joint. It is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, and has a substantial societal effect in terms of cost, disability, and lost productivity. Although the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis remains incompletely understood, much insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved has been gained in the past decade. On the basis of these insights, new therapies have been developed, and clinical trials have shown the efficacy of aggressive treatment of patients with active disease. In this review, we discuss improvements in our understanding of the pathophysiology of inflammatory synovitis in rheumatoid arthritis, and improvements in therapy for patients with the disorder. The past decade has seen substantial advances in these areas. Future studies will be directed at improving methods for early diagnosis and identification of patients with progressive disease, and at improving methods to identify candidates for subclasses of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Long-term safety and efficacy data for the new DMARD agents and combination regimens will also further delineate efficacy and toxicity and thus the appropriate clinical context for use of these therapeutic approaches. The continuing elucidation of pathophysiological pathways relevant in rheumatoid arthritis, coupled with continuing advances in biotechnology and rational drug design, offer substantial hope for the continued development of increasingly potent and specific pharmacotherapy for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

### Novel insights into the management of rheumatoid arthritis: one year in review 2024 [^ea02f6f8]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

New evidence from 2023 has slightly shifted some perspectives on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management. Glucocorticoids have reaffirmed their role as bridging therapy, while novel studies on JAK inhibitors have examined efficacy, mechanism of action, and their potential in high-risk populations, bolstering our understanding with real-world data. Additionally, among treatment strategies, achieving low disease activity has emerged as comparable to achieving remission in the long term, and new insights have been gained regarding tapering both biological and conventional synthetic DMARDs. Furthermore, novel approaches have been proposed for managing difficult-to-treat RA and pre-RA. In this paper, the reviewers aim to present the most relevant studies published during the last year in the field of RA management.

### Glucocorticoid use in rheumatoid arthritis: benefits, mechanisms, and risks [^6bff0e95]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids have long been recognized to have beneficial effects in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (1,2). Several clinical trials over the last decade have further documented the efficacy of glucocorticoids in relieving inflammation and in preventing radiographic erosions in early RA (3–5). Additionally, research has yielded new insights about the cellular mechanisms responsible for these perceived beneficial effects (6,7). Despite potential short term benefits, there is a lack of demonstrated long-term efficacy as well as concerns about short and long-term toxicity. Although these concerns have limited enthusiasm for glucocorticoids by many patients and practitioners, in the U.S. it is estimated that 44% to 75% of RA patients use glucocorticoids (8,9). Confusion and controversy may relate to the fact that toxicity reports are also limited by only modest data quality and quantity. Given growing clinical and basic science evidence supporting the efficacy of glucocorticoids for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, their use may further increase. In this review we will examine the latest data supporting the benefits and risks of glucocorticoid use in RA.

### Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: the earlier the better to prevent joint damage [^a43a064e]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

The management of rheumatoid arthritis has undergone major advances in recent years, both in terms of the drugs armamentarium and therapeutic strategy. Treating disease to target, aiming at remission, through a tight control protocol is regarded as the standard of care. Reaching clinical and radiographic disease remission has therefore become an achievable goal. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that early diagnosis, prompt treatment initiation and early achievement of remission are the major predictors of long-term clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes. Concentrating efforts in controlling disease activity in a very early window of opportunity offers unique sustained benefits. In this short review, we analysed the available evidence supporting the value of treating rheumatoid arthritis early and the impact on disease outcomes, with particular focus on radiographic progression.

### Treatment guidelines in rheumatoid arthritis [^8caa58b1]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune, destructive, inflammatory arthritis in adults. Effective treatments include oral conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs; eg, methotrexate), injectable biologic DMARDs, and targeted synthetic DMARDs (oral). Key recommendations are to start effective treatment immediately with DMARDs to reduce disability; use effective doses of methotrexate (oral or subcutaneous) with folic acid as the initial treatment; rapidly escalate treatment with various DMARDs, if methotrexate alone is not effective in controlling rheumatoid arthritis; and aim for a treat-to-target strategy with a goal of low disease activity or remission by frequently monitoring disease activity and escalating treatment.

Treatment of RA and new challenges

RA, which is defined as a prolonged destructive arthritis, is an autoimmune disease with multiorgan involvement that manifests with polyarthritis as its primary pathology. Based on the elucidation of the pathological mechanisms of RA, immunosuppressive agents are used to adjust immune abnormalities and control the disease. The immunosuppressive agents used for RA treatment are called DMARD. These drugs can be further classified into conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) such as MTX, targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD) such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, and biological DMARD (bDMARD) derived from biological agents.

MTX is the initial standard of care for patients diagnosed with RA without contraindications. When the use of MTX fails to achieve improvement within 3 months or remission within 6 months, use of a bDMARD is recommended. If the goal is still not achieved, other appropriate bDMARDs or JAK inhibitors are administered for ∼3–6 months until remission is induced. Such treatment strategies have enabled physicians to induce remission and prevent progression of structural damage and dysfunction of joints in most patients with RA.

### Therapeutic glucocorticoids: mechanisms of actions in rheumatic diseases [^fc6aeb2d]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Therapeutic glucocorticoids have been widely used in rheumatic diseases since they became available over 60 years ago. Despite the advent of more specific biologic therapies, a notable proportion of individuals with chronic rheumatic diseases continue to be treated with these drugs. Glucocorticoids are powerful, broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory agents, but their use is complicated by an equally broad range of adverse effects. The specific cellular mechanisms by which glucocorticoids have their therapeutic action have been difficult to identify, and attempts to develop more selective drugs on the basis of the action of glucocorticoids have proven difficult. The actions of glucocorticoids seem to be highly cell-type and context dependent. Despite emerging data on the effect of tissue-specific manipulation of glucocorticoid receptors in mouse models of inflammation, the cell types and intracellular targets of glucocorticoids in rheumatic diseases have not been fully identified. Although showing some signs of decline, the use of systemic glucocorticoids in rheumatology is likely to continue to be widespread, and careful consideration is required by rheumatologists to balance the beneficial effects and deleterious effects of these agents.

### Rheumatoid arthritis [^8a035809]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune inflammatory disease that mainly affects the joints and periarticular soft tissues. In this Seminar, we provide an overview of the main aspects of rheumatoid arthritis. Epidemiology and advances in the understanding of rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis will be reviewed. We will discuss the clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis, classification criteria, and the value of imaging in the diagnosis of the disease. The advent of new medications and the accumulated scientific evidence demand continuous updating regarding the diagnosis and management, including therapy, of rheumatoid arthritis. An increasing number of patients are now able to reach disease remission. This major improvement in the outcome of patients with rheumatoid arthritis has been determined by a combination of different factors (eg, early diagnosis, window of opportunity, treat-to-target strategy, advent of targeted disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and combination therapy). We will discuss the updated recommendations of the two most influential societies for rheumatology worldwide (ie, the American College of Rheumatology and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology) for the management of rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, controversies (ie, the role of glucocorticoids in the management of rheumatoid arthritis and safety profile of Janus kinase inhibitors) and outstanding research questions, including precision medicine approach, prevention, and cure of rheumatoid arthritis will be highlighted.

### One year in review 2020: novelties in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^862a7807]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management is driven by evidence, and new 2019 EULAR recommendations help in refining the relevant place of different disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in treatment schedules. At present, new drugs are in phase of development, mainly Janus Kinase inhibitors (JAKis), however, specific treatment strategies seem to count more than individual DMARDs in terms of treatment responses, given the substantial lack of head-to-head comparisons between specific biological (b) and targeted synthetic (ts)DMARDs, and with the general perception of a similar efficacy profile across drugs. In this setting, when reliable biomarkers able to predict treatment responses are lacking, treatment decisions are mainly driven by specific clinical or individual factors, given the recognised role of comorbidities, treatment-specific side effects, patients' preferences, and costs on drug choice. In this narrative review, the authors give their specific point of view on the management of RA, based on a critical revision of the literature published in 2019, focusing on relevant novelties and future research directions.

### Pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies in difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis [^ec40c8db]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Key messages

This systematic literature review, conducted to inform the Task Force on the EULAR recommendations for the management of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis (D2T RA), provides an extensive overview of the current literature regarding pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies in D2T RA.
The identified evidence had several limitations: (1) the evidence is indirect as the study population could not be considered as having D2T RA, (2) heterogeneous outcome criteria were used and (3) most studies had a moderate or high risk of bias.
Several biological/targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs) were found to be effective in RA patients who failed ≥ 2 bDMARDs, although generally effectiveness decreased with a higher number of previously failed bDMARDs.
A subsequent b/tsDMARD of a previously not targeted mechanism of action was somewhat more effective in patients who failed ≥ 1 bDMARD.
Non-pharmacological interventions, especially education, were found to have an additional beneficial effect for improvement of non-inflammatory complaints, goal setting and self-management.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) were discovered in the 1940s and were administered for the first time to patients with rheumatoid arthritis in 1948. However, side effects were subsequently reported. In the last 7 decades, the mechanisms of action for both therapeutic properties and side effects have been elucidated. Mechanisms for minimizing side effects were also developed. GCs are the most frequently used class of drugs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis because of their efficacy in relieving symptoms and their low cost. A review of clinical applications, side effects, and drug interactions is presented.

### 'Difficult to treat' rheumatoid arthritis: current position and considerations for next steps [^835171b2]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology recently defined difficult to treat (D2T) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and provided points to consider in its management. This review summarises the key concepts of D2T-RA that underpinned this recent guidance. D2T-RA is primarily characterised by failure of at least two different mechanism of action biologic/targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARDs) with evidence of active/progressive disease. The basis for progressive disease, however, is not limited to clear inflammatory joint pathology, capturing wider contributors to treatment cycling such as comorbidity, obesity and fibromyalgia. This means D2T-RA comprises a heterogeneous population, with a proportion within this exhibiting bona fide treatment-refractory disease. The management points to consider, however, emphasise the importance of checking for the presence of inflammatory pathology before further treatment change. This review suggests additional considerations in the definition of D2T-RA, the potential value in identifying D2T traits and intervening before the development of D2T-RA state and the need for real world evidence of targeted synthetic DMARD in this population to compare to recent trial data. Finally, the review asks whether the presence of D2T-RA implies a failure to treat effectively from the outset, and the need for pharmacological and non-pharmacological management approaches to address the wider D2T-RA population effectively.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^418340ba]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment — guiding principles in the 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline specify that RA requires early evaluation, diagnosis, and management; that treatment decisions should follow a shared decision-making process and should be reevaluated within a minimum of 3 months based on efficacy and tolerability of the DMARD(s) chosen; that disease activity levels refer to those calculated using RA disease activity measures endorsed by the ACR; that recommendations are intended for the general RA patient population and assume that patients do not have contraindications to the options under consideration; and that recommendations are limited to DMARDs approved by the US FDA for treatment of RA. The principles define serious infection as an infection requiring intravenous antibiotics or hospitalization and state that biosimilars are considered equivalent to FDA-approved originator bDMARDs. Treat-to-target refers to a systematic approach involving frequent monitoring of disease activity using validated instruments and modification of treatment to minimize disease activity with a goal of reaching a predefined target (low disease activity or remission), and targets refer to low disease activity or remission; recommendations specify that patients be at target (low disease activity or remission) for at least 6 months prior to tapering, with dose reduction defined as lowering the dose or increasing the dosing interval of a DMARD and gradual discontinuation defined as gradually lowering the dose of a DMARD and subsequently stopping it.

### Reflections on' older' drugs: learning new lessons in rheumatology [^6edfac29]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

The management of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases has transformed over two decades of exciting discoveries regarding pathogenesis and innovative drug development. The introduction of sophisticated immunomodulatory therapies has given renewed hope to many patients, but notable challenges remain within the field of rheumatology. Before the advent of biologic therapies, conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) provided effective disease control for some patients, although a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which these drugs exert their effects remained elusive. Reflecting upon the efficacy and mechanisms of action of csDMARDs can provide intriguing insights. First, contemplating past approaches brings our remarkable current approaches concerning pathogenesis-driven discovery and drug development into sharper focus. Second, increased understanding of the mode of action of these older drugs might in turn provide exciting opportunities for the understanding of disease and for the development of future therapies.

### Rheumatoid arthritis [^b4b518a6]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic, inflammatory, autoimmune disorder. Enhanced understanding of molecular pathogenesis has enabled development of innovative biological agents that target specific parts of the immune system. These treatments have changed the course and face of rheumatoid arthritis and outcomes for patients and society. New knowledge has emerged of how environmental factors interact with susceptibility genes and the immune system in the pathogenesis of a major subset of rheumatoid arthritis. Research undertaken on the longitudinal disease process and molecular pathology of joint inflammation has led to new therapeutic strategies that promote early use of disease-modifying drugs with tight disease control and distinct and quantifiable treatment goals. Today, such approaches can halt most cases of joint destruction but not all instances of joint inflammation and comorbidity. Understanding the cause and pathogenesis of different rheumatoid arthritis subsets will lead not only to individualised treatments during early phases of the illness but also, possibly, to disease prevention.

### Update on the use of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in the management of rheumatoid arthritis [^711b075d]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review will focus on the role of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in the current management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Recent Findings

Over the past several decades, the treatment of RA has been revolutionized, not only by the development of highly effective biologic agents but also through a better understanding of the critical importance of early DMARD treatment with a goal of remission or low disease activity and of how to effectively and safely use conventional DMARDs, either as monotherapy or in combinations.

Summary

Conventional DMARDs have proven efficacy in the management of RA and remain a valid treatment option, either in monotherapy or as a component of combination regimens. Although conventional DMARDs have associated toxicities, these are distinct from those of the biologic DMARDs. In addition, conventional DMARDs are much less expensive than biologic DMARDs, and in many cases can be successful in achieving similar control of disease activity. The goal for all patients should be achieving remission, or at least low disease activity, with the most cost-effective therapy possible.

### Current understanding of rheumatoid arthritis therapy [^47df0f56]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Progress in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), together with the availability of new therapies, has changed the way we think about RA. The paradigm shift in RA therapy has been from controlling symptoms to controlling the disease process with the abrogation of inflammation. Challenges that are still unresolved include the issues in disease prevention, treatment specificity to restore tolerance, approaches to facilitate tissue repair, and treatment optimization to fit the individual patient's disease phenotype and comorbidity context. This review summarizes the pathogenesis-related rationales for the current therapeutic strategies in RA and for emerging therapies and potential approaches to restoring immune tolerance in RA.

### Glucocorticoids in rheumatoid arthritis: current status and future studies [^60b87de7]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Since their first use for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the late 1940s, glucocorticoids (GCs) have been representing a substantial part of the therapeutic arsenal for RA. However, even if GCs are still widely prescribed drugs, their toxicity is discussed controversially, so obtaining consensus on their use in RA is difficult. Hence, the most recent European League Against Rheumatism and American College of Rheumatology recommendations on early arthritis and RA management advocate the use of GCs as adjunct treatment to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, at the lowest dose possible and for the shortest time possible. However, the recommendations remain relatively vague on dose regimens and routes of administration. Here, we describe literature data on which the current recommendations are based as well as data from recent trials published since the drafting of the guidelines. Moreover, we make proposals for daily practice and provide suggestions for studies that could help clarifying the place of GCs in RA management. Indeed, numerous items, including the benefit/risk ratio of low-dose and very low-dose GCs and optimal duration of GCs as bridging therapy, remain on the research agenda, and future studies are needed to guide the next recommendations for RA.

### Towards better personalized care in rheumatoid arthritis [^65b4cfe3]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The topics discussed by the esteemed authors of this special issue relate to the challenging question of whether we can make a rational choice of targeted therapy in the management of our patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Careful consideration of drug treatment is a key aspect of holistic care which may also involve non-pharmacological intervention. The primary goals of RA treatment are to reduce the signs and symptoms of disease, prevent progression of joint damage and comorbidities associated with systemic inflammation, and improve patients' physical function, thereby enhancing their quality of life. Over the last generation, the introduction of 'targeted therapies' comprising biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) has broadened the therapeutic options for people living with RA and transformed the achievable outcomes for many. Furthermore, with access to this expanded therapeutic armamentarium, it has been demonstrated unequivocally that the best outcomes at a cohort level can be achieved by employing a 'treat-to-target' strategy that aims for an ideal disease activity target of sustained clinical remission, or low disease activity for those individuals for whom remission is not realistically attainable. For adoption of the 'treat-to-target' strategy in clinical practice, EULAR recommends a change of therapeutic regime if the target is not reached by 6 months on a given treatment.

Despite these important advances, making the choice of most appropriate treatment on an individual patient basis has become increasingly complicated! Treatment recommendations highlight that there is a choice of many similarly effective therapeutic agents after an inadequate response to conventional synthetic DMARDs although there may be differences between treatments in the spectrum of associated adverse events. Therefore, the potentials for both benefit and risk should be carefully considered when choosing a targeted therapy, and the estimated likelihood for benefit over risk needs to be acceptable to the individual patient in shared decision making. Other factors that might influence patient preference and prescribing choice include the route and frequency of drug administration, as well as the pharmacological properties. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness considerations may also limit the available treatment choices in many countries. In the face of spiralling global healthcare costs, it is likely that payor pressure to prioritize use of the least costly agents will continue as more and more biosimilars of a wide range of originators are approved and generic tsDMARDs become available. In the face of this complexity, and uncertainties about the most appropriate intervention for a given individual, prescribing choices are often made with an emphasis on cost-effectiveness and the prescriber's familiarity with the treatment class.

### Canadian Rheumatology Association recommendations for pharmacological management of rheumatoid arthritis with traditional and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [^fe953a5e]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The Canadian Rheumatology Association (CRA) has developed recommendations for the pharmacological management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with traditional and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) in 2 parts. Part 1 is reported here.

Methods

The CRA Therapeutics Committee assembled a national working group of RA clinical experts, researchers, patient consumers, and a general practitioner. Treatment questions were developed a priori based on results of a national needs assessment survey. A systematic review of all clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements regarding treatment with traditional and biologic DMARD in patients with RA published between January 2000 and June 2010 was performed in Medline, Embase, and CINAHL databases, and the grey literature. Guideline quality was assessed by 2 independent reviewers, and guideline characteristics, recommendations, and supporting evidence from observational studies and randomized controlled trials were synthesized into evidence tables. The full working group reviewed the evidence tables and developed recommendations using a modified Delphi technique.

Results

Five overarching principles and 26 recommendations addressing general RA management strategies and treatment with glucocorticoids and traditional and biologic DMARD were developed for rheumatologists, other primary prescribers of RA drug therapies, and patients with RA.

Conclusion

These recommendations were developed based on a synthesis of international guidelines, supporting evidence, and expert consensus considering the Canadian healthcare context with the intention of promoting best practices and improving healthcare delivery for persons with RA.

### Windows for intervention in the prearthritis phase of rheumatoid arthritis? A narrative review of key triggering events and potential preventive strategies [^36b7da5b]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Several clinical trials have been conducted in different at-risk populations to test the hypothesis that progression to RA can be halted. Most of these trials have used drugs in current use for manifest disease, that is, drugs designed to dampen ongoing active inflammation. This is not a prominent feature of the at-risk phase, which potentially explains why most trials failed to show preventive effects that last after treatment was stopped. Nevertheless, 12 months of abatacept treatment (ie, inhibition of T cell costimulation) was shown to reduce progression to RA among ACPA-positive symptomatic subjects. However, the effect size was limited 1 year after treatment cessation, suggesting that the treatment did not substantially alter the long-term course. Instead, novel modes of action appear warranted for the prevention of RA, and for this to take place, a deeper understanding of underlying mechanisms is essential. Aberrations in adaptive immunity are a central feature in the at-risk phase for most pre-RA subjects, and the influence from mucosal surfaces in this context has been increasingly revealed in recent years. With this focus, we set out to overview current knowledge on pre-RA mechanisms and how they potentially can be targeted for preventive purposes.

Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has substantially improved in recent years because of the development of novel drugs. However, response is not universal for any of the treatment options, and selection of an effective therapy is currently based on a trial-and-error approach. Delayed treatment response increases the risk of progressive joint damage and resultant disability and also has a significant impact on quality of life for patients. For many drugs, the patient's genetic background influences response to therapy, and understanding the genetics of response to therapy in RA may allow for targeted personalized health care.

### Diagnostic issues in difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis [^fb5f448a]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have largely expanded and treatment strategies have improved over the past decades. Nowadays, many patients reach remission or low disease activity when following the current EULAR recommendations and/or American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the management of RA. However, there is still a substantial proportion of RA patients that remains symptomatic even though they have been treated according to these recommendations. This patient group is referred to as having 'difficult-to-treat (D2T) RA'. This disease state is expected to affect 5%–20% of all patients with RA, depending on the specific definition used.D2T RA has recently been defined as patients who failed at least two biological/targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs) with different mechanisms of action after failing conventional synthetic (cs)DMARD therapy. Additionally, patients should have signs and/or symptoms suggestive of active disease, which is perceived as problematic by the patient and/or rheumatologist. The unmet need for these patients was previously underlined by an international survey that was conducted among rheumatologists. Consequently, the importance has been acknowledged by EULAR with the approval of a Task Force on the development of management recommendations for D2T RA.

In D2T RA patients, DMARD therapy is frequently changed in routine daily practice in case of signs and/or symptoms suggestive of active disease. However, D2T RA is a heterogeneous disease state and various factors could contribute to the persistence of these signs and/or symptoms: factors related to inflammation (eg, having underlying immunological disease mechanisms driving 'true' refractory disease or treatment non-adherence), factors of non-inflammatory origin (eg, concomitant fibromyalgia) or both. All these contributing factors may require different pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies, which are reviewed in a separate systematic literature review (SLR).

Importantly, intensification or other changes in DMARD therapy to reduce inflammation may only be appropriate in patients with insufficient response to therapy due to inflammatory RA activity. Symptoms of other diseases, for example, psoriatic arthritis and polyarticular gouty arthritis, may mimic RA possibly leading to misdiagnosis of the disease. Additionally, coexistence of certain circumstances, for example, obesity, pain syndromes and osteoarthritis, may hamper proper grading of disease activity by influencing diagnostic measures. Therefore, in D2T RA, it will be important to ascertain the diagnosis of RA and the presence of inflammatory RA activity before adjusting therapeutic strategies.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: common questions about diagnosis and management [^0ab55de1]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most commonly diagnosed systemic inflammatory arthritis, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 1% worldwide. Women, smokers, and those with a family history of the disease are most often affected. Rheumatoid arthritis should be considered if there is at least one joint with definite swelling that is not better explained by another disease. In a patient with inflammatory arthritis, the presence of a rheumatoid factor and/or anti-citrullinated protein antibody, elevated C-reactive protein level, or elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate is consistent with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis may impact organs other than the joints, including lungs, skin, and eyes. Rapid diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis allows for earlier treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, which is associated with better outcomes. The goal of therapy is to initiate early medical treatment to achieve disease remission or the lowest disease activity possible. Methotrexate is typically the first-line agent for rheumatoid arthritis. Additional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or biologic agents should be added if disease activity persists. Comorbid conditions, including hepatitis B or C or tuberculosis infections, must be considered when choosing medical treatments. Although rheumatoid arthritis is often a chronic disease, some patients can taper and discontinue medications and remain in long-term remission.

### New therapeutics in rheumatoid arthritis [^91e94de7]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic disorder characterized predominately by a chronic inflammatory polyarthritis, with frequent progression to joint destruction and disability. Radiographic joint damage develops in as many as 75% of patients within the first 2 years of disease. For this reason, current RA treatment approaches have focused on early intensive therapy with multiple disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. The approval of new drugs for this indication has expanded the number of therapeutic options that can potentially allow for tight control of the inflammatory process.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

Pharmacological treatments such as non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, and disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are used to treat both rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. DMARDs, in general, are immunomodulators that suppress disease inflammation and effectively prevent joint damage, hence the term 'disease‐modifying'. Early initiation of DMARD therapy using a 'treat‐to‐target' approach is now the cornerstone of pharmacological treatment for both diseases.

DMARDs are categorised based on their structure and mechanisms of action. Conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) such as methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, and leflunomide have broad mechanisms of action, targeting multiple immune pathways. All these csDMARDs are initial treatment options in both diseases. Combination therapy is typically the preferred initial treatment approach in DMARD‐naive people, with methotrexate considered the cornerstone drug for both diseases, unless there is a contraindication to its use. Intra‐articular or short‐term oral glucocorticoids may be required as adjunct therapy when initiating or changing csDMARDs.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: emerging insights into molecular mechanisms and targeted immunotherapy [^73ba92e1]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune inflammatory disease that characterised by persistent synovial joints inflammation, which ultimately results in progressive joint destruction and significant disability. Ineffective drug treatment for severe arthritis can lead to significant physical disability and a marked decline in quality of life. Recent research has significantly advanced our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of RA, which leads to the emergence of novel immunotherapeutic strategies that provide patients with a broader range of treatment options. This review aims to synthesise the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of RA, related signalling pathways, and the latest immunotherapy approaches, including biologic agents, targeted small molecules, and novel therapies. Furthermore, we will discuss the efficacy and safety profiles of these therapies, analyse pressing issues in contemporary research, and explore future directions in the field.

### Combination conventional DMARDs compared to biologicals: what is the evidence? [^8f28eaca]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Dramatic improvement seen in the prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis has been driven by higher expectations, led by newer drugs and more intensive use of the older drugs. Although methotrexate has retained its place as the first-line agent, there has been great interest in comparing biologicals to conventional Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) over the past few years with the updated guidelines from both the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism. We have tried to critically summarize the findings of some landmark trials that compare these two approaches.

Recent Findings

Treatment of Early Rheumatoid Arthritis, The Swedish Pharmacotherapy study and Rheumatoid Arthritis Comparison of Active Therapies are landmark trials that were designed to compare strategies using biologicals vs. conventional DMARDs. We will review the safety and efficacy data from these three trials here and also briefly the important cost differential.

Conclusion

Methotrexate should be the first-line therapy for most rheumatoid arthritis patients and will produce the desired results in greater than one-third of the patients. When methotrexate is not adequate, triple DMARD therapy should be added which will result in control of approximately another one-third of the patients. Ultimately, and usually before 1 year of disease, the remainder of patients will require biological therapies usually added to conventional DMARDs. There is no evidence that this step-up approach results in any long-term disadvantage and good evidence that it results in substantial cost savings.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: previously untreated early disease [^ae1a3ad4]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease, which most often presents as a symmetrical polyarthritis of the hands and feet. Pharmacological treatments include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids (GCs) and other disease-modifying anti-rheumatoid drugs (DMARDs), which may be synthetic (either conventional [csDMARDs] or targeted [tsDMARDs]) or biological (bDMARDs).

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of methotrexate in combination with other csDMARDs versus methotrexate monotherapy in people with rheumatoid arthritis who have not previously received any DMARD treatment (first-line treatment)? What are the effects of bDMARDs as monotherapy versus methotrexate or other csDMARDs in people with rheumatoid arthritis who have not previously received any DMARD treatment (first-line treatment)? What are the effects of bDMARDs in combination with methotrexate versus methotrexate monotherapy or other csDMARDs in people with rheumatoid arthritis who have not previously received any DMARD treatment (first-line treatment)? What are the effects of glucocorticoids in combination with methotrexate or with other csDMARDs versus methotrexate or other csDMARDs in people with rheumatoid arthritis who have not previously received any DMARD treatment (first-line treatment)? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to December 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 2058 studies. Of the full articles evaluated, 10 systematic reviews, 22 RCTs, and one follow-up report were added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 18 PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for 22 comparisons based on information about the effectiveness and safety of bDMARDs (monotherapy or combined with csDMARDs), csDMARDs (monotherapy or combined with other csDMARDs), glucocorticoids combined with methotrexate or other csDMARDs, and methotrexate (monotherapy or combined with other csDMARDs), identifying interventions which were likely or unlikely to be beneficial.

### Perioperative management of immunosuppressive medications for rheumatoid arthritis [^37cbb059]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Operations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are complicated by the fact that most drugs used in medical management have immunosuppressive mechanisms of action, including corticosteroids and conventional synthetic and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. In deciding to continue or discontinue these medications perioperatively, surgeons must weigh the relative risk of infection from immunosuppression against the risk of rheumatoid arthritis symptom flares from reduced medical disease control. The objective of this article is to review the existing evidence regarding perioperative management of immunosuppressive rheumatoid arthritis medications, with a specific focus on relevance to hand and upper-extremity procedures.

### Different effects of biological drugs in rheumatoid arthritis [^a887bd5f]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Biological drugs have brought new hope to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in whom previously existing treatments could not control inflammation, joint destruction, or the progression of disability. The five currently available TNF blockers are approved for treating RA patients, but they have different structures, morphology, pharmacokinetic properties, and activity. Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) have shown that they improve the signs and symptoms of both early and long-standing RA and other inflammatory arthritides, prevent radiographic progression, and improve the patients' health-related quality of life. However, they are more effective in combination with methotrexate (MTX) than alone. Combined treatment is generally well tolerated, and seems to be relatively safe in the short term, as confirmed by RCTs, long-term observational studies and in clinical practice. Patients who fail to respond or develop adverse effects - when treated with one anti-TNF agent can be successfully treated with a second TNF antagonist. However, in the case of primary failure, it is possible that biological agents with a different mechanism of action may be more successful. Tocilizumab alone or in combination with MTX is more effective than MTX monotherapy in reducing disease activity over 24 weeks. Abatacept is well tolerated and retains its efficacy over time, as does rituximab in non-responders to other anti-TNF drugs. Finally, although these drugs improve the quality of life of RA patients, they considerably increase direct medical costs.

### Does triple conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy improve upon methotrexate as the initial treatment of choice for a rheumatoid arthritis patient? [^fbba68b6]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Although many treatment options exist for the initial management of rheumatoid arthritis, there has long been discussion about whether initial treatment should be with methotrexate (MTX) as monotherapy or in combination with other conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). Although studies initially showed additional benefit from combining MTX with other csDMARDs, this benefit disappears when glucocorticoids are added to MTX, a strategy recommended in current guidelines as a short-term bridging approach until MTX therapy exhibits its full efficacy. Also concomitant use of glucocorticoids, with MTX may not be inferior to combination therapy of MTX with TNF-inhibitors.

### Genotypes, phenotypes and treatment with immunomodulators in the rheumatic diseases [^a7b7e830]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The autoimmune rheumatological diseases rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are treated with conventional immunosuppressive agents and with modern biological immunomodulators. The latter group of medications have brought about a major change in our ability to control RA and SpA, with more modest results for SLE. The biologicals are very specific in their mechanisms of action, targeting one specific cytokine or one particular cellular marker. Because of this, their efficacy can readily be linked to a single immunomodulatory mechanism. This observation has fuelled hopes that the efficacy of these agents can be predicted at the individual level based on the patient's genetic predisposition, immunological profile or disease phenotype. Whilst the biologic therapies have improved the prospects for patients with these diseases very significantly, the hope that they could be targeted to the patient in an individualized manner has not completely born fruit. In this review, I will argue that we are witnessing important progress in this field, and that justified hope exists for true advances in precision medicine in the autoimmune diseases in the coming years.

### The clinical efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol in rheumatoid arthritis [^a2e2229d]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Importance Of The Field

The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis has changed dramatically over the past 25 years, first with the introduction of methotrexate and then the introduction of biologic therapy. These agents have provided patients with multiple treatment options to try to achieve disease remission. Unfortunately, no one single agent is fully effective in every patient; different patients respond to different therapies, even those with the same mechanism of action, in different ways. Another medication, such as certolizumab pegol, is a welcome addition to our treatment armamentarium of rheumatoid arthritis.

Areas Covered In This Review

The basis of this review is all the peer-reviewed manuscripts found in PubMed and Medline searches from 1990 to 2009 and abstracts on certolizumab pegol presented at the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism within the past 5 years.

What The Reader Will Gain

This review should enable the reader to fully understand the benefit:risk ratio of certolizumab pegol in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

Take Home Message

Certolizumab pegol is an effective agent either in combination with methotrexate or as monotherapy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with a safety profile similar to other approved TNF inhibitors.

### Immune mechanisms and novel targets in rheumatoid arthritis [^15e06d7b]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Significant progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis. It is widely recognized that early institution of treatment is one of the best predictive factors for response to therapy. Several novel approaches are currently being investigated and several novel biologics are in various stages of development. With advances in the fields of proteomics, genomics, and metabolomics, specific phenotypes of the disease can be better identified and specific therapies for particular phases of the disease and specific patients will allow for improved control of this condition.

### Biologicals in rheumatoid arthritis: current and future [^6da9f739]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Biologicals offer a new dimension in the treatment of RA, allowing us to translate the knowledge on the molecular pathways into targeted therapies. Today, bDMARDs are increasingly used in patients with an inadequate response or intolerance to csDMARDs. Excellent efficacy and acceptable safety of bDMARDs have been established in the previous years. They also possess the chance of tapering and discontinuation in patients with sustained remission. Beyond approved biologicals, several new biologicals are in developmental status with the potential to fill the current treatment gap and help us to crack the hard nut of patients with refractory RA.

### Cardiovascular effects of approved drugs for rheumatoid arthritis [^2578bc65]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared with the general population owing to the influence of traditional and non-traditional risk factors. Inflammation has a pivotal contribution and can accelerate the atherosclerotic process. Although dampening inflammation with DMARDs should theoretically abrogate this process, evidence suggests that these drugs can also promote atherosclerosis directly and indirectly, hence adding to an increased cardiovascular burden. However, the extent and direction of the effects largely differ across drugs. Understanding how these drugs influence endothelial damage and vascular repair mechanisms is key to understanding these outcomes. NSAIDs and glucocorticoids can increase the cardiovascular risk. Conversely, conventional, biologic and targeted DMARDs control inflammation and reduce this risk, although some of these drugs can also aggravate traditional factors or thrombotic events. Given these data, the fundamental objective for clinicians should be disease control, in an individualized approach that considers the most appropriate drug for each patient, taking into account joint and cardiovascular outcomes. This Review provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of DMARDs and other approved drugs on cardiovascular involvement in rheumatoid arthritis, from a clinical and mechanistic perspective, with a roadmap to inform the research agenda.

### New therapies for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^30ccbea8]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is characterised by pain, swelling, and destruction of joints, with resultant disability. Only disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs can interfere with the disease process. In the past few years, biological agents, especially inhibitors of tumour necrosis factor, have allowed for hitherto unseen therapeutic benefit, although even with these drugs the frequency and degree of responses are restricted. Therefore, new agents are needed, and three novel biological compounds for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis have already been used in practice or are on the horizon: rituximab (anti-CD20), abatacept (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 immunoglobulin), and tocilizumab (anti-interleukin 6 receptor). We discuss the targets of these drugs, the roles of these targets in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, and the efficacy and adverse effects of these agents from clinical trial data. Novel therapeutic strategies in conjunction with optimised disease assessment for better treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and an outlook into potential future targets are also presented.

### Perioperative medication management for the patient with rheumatoid arthritis [^9f96e090]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis has improved dramatically in recent years with the advent of the latest generation of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Despite these advances, in some patients inflammation is not diminished sufficiently to prevent irreversible musculoskeletal damage, thus requiring surgical intervention to reduce pain and improve function. In these cases, the orthopaedic surgeon frequently encounters patients on a drug regimen consisting of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, methotrexate, and biologic agents (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs). Consultation with a rheumatologist is recommended, but the surgeon also should be aware of these medications that could potentially affect surgical outcome. Prudent perioperative management of these drugs is required to optimize surgical outcome. A balance must be struck between minimizing potential surgical complications and maintaining disease control to facilitate postoperative rehabilitation of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

### Benefits and risks of low-dose glucocorticoid treatment in the patient with rheumatoid arthritis [^7a5665bc]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

With increases in the number and mechanisms of action of potent traditional and biologic DMARDs available for the treatment of RA, the goals of treatment have been raised. Thus there is still an unmet need to allow ever more patients to achieve the highest levels of disease control. There is substantial evidence that low-dose GC treatment, when combined with conventional DMARDs, can significantly slow disease progression and increase the number of patients who achieve disease remission. Therefore GCs remain a useful adjunctive treatment for RA and for other systemic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Physicians and other health care providers have had concerns about long-term GC treatment because of the well-known adverse events associated with high doses of these drugs. However, adverse events with GCs are dose related and longer-term use of low-dose GCs may still be a viable therapeutic option for some patients.

Multiple approaches have been undertaken to improve the benefit–risk profile for GC treatment in patients with RA, including the development of a delayed-release low-dose prednisone formulation that has shown some clinical benefit. Additional approaches are in earlier stages of development. Optimal use of low-dose GCs has the potential to improve long-term outcomes for patients with RA.

Rheumatology key messages

Addition of low-dose glucocorticosteroids to synthetic DMARDs improves structural outcomes, decreases inflammatory markers and reduces symptom severity in RA patients.
New approaches to glucocorticoid delivery may further improve RA outcomes.

### Recent progress in treatments of rheumatoid arthritis: an overview of developments in biologics and small molecules, and remaining unmet needs [^3dc7c6e6]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Through treatment with biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) or targeted synthetic (tsDMARDs) such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors in addition to MTX, clinical remission has become a realistic therapeutic goal for the majority of patients with RA, and sustained remission facilitates prevention of joint damage and physical dysfunction. Long-term safety and sustained inhibition of structural changes and physical dysfunction by bDMARDs have been reported. The development of next-generation bDMARDs and expansion of their indications to various autoimmune diseases are expected. Five JAK inhibitors show comparable efficacy to bDMARDs, and the latest ones are effective for overcoming difficult-to-treat RA regardless of prior medications. Patients treated with JAK inhibitors should be adequately screened and monitored for infection, cardiovascular disorders, thrombosis, malignancies and so on. Advances in therapeutic strategies, including the differential use of therapeutic drugs and de-escalation of treatment after remission induction, are prioritized.

### Combination therapy in rheumatoid arthritis [^db902a0f]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

It has become clear that early suppression of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity is important in preventing progressive joint destruction and functional decline. To achieve this goal, many rheumatologists today advocate a more aggressive approach, using combinations of classic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs-often including methotrexate-or new drugs. During the last 2 years, the combination of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and prednisolone has been demonstrated to be more beneficial than monotherapy in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the superior efficacy of the combination of new tumor necrosis factor-alpha blocking agents plus methotrexate to methotrexate alone in patients with chronic disease is very promising. Most studies of combination therapy focus on the efficacy of a combination compared with monotherapy, rather than on the efficacy of a treatment strategy. Although these studies of combination therapy provide useful information about the possible synergistic action of combinations of drugs, many questions remain unanswered, and studies evaluating different treatment strategies are needed before a new approach can be suggested.

### 'Difficult to treat' rheumatoid arthritis: current position and considerations for next steps [^839802a4]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Current concept of D2T RA

An international survey of rheumatologists was undertaken to capture the clinical perspectives of D2T RA and to characterise it further. This highlighted multiple components for consideration, including number of DMARDs failed, disease activity state and persistence of patient symptoms.

In 2021, a EULAR task force undertook an initiative to define this group for greater consistency in clinical and research settings. The task force confirmed D2T-RA as the formal term to describe the patient population of interest and established a EULAR definition comprising three elements: history of failed treatments, features of active disease and the perception of challenging RA by the clinician and/or patient (figure 1).

Figure 1
EULAR definition of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis (D2T-RA). EULAR, European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology.

The first criterion of the EULAR definition of D2T-RA refers to the fundamental concept of treatment-resistant disease as evidenced by a history of multiple b/tsDMARD failures. All patients must fail at least two b/ts DMARDs of different mechanisms of action to qualify as D2T-RA, equivalent to having reached phase 3 of the 2019 EULAR management of RA. The cut-off of ≥ two b/tsDMARDs is somewhat arbitrary but stipulating two different mechanisms of action confers a meaningful drug-resistant state. This is also consistent with trials and registry studies that have illustrated diminished response from most treatments following initial bDMARD failure. In real-world practice, however, a refractory state typically follows exhaustion of all available therapeutic options. The absence of predictive treatment biomarkers and trial and error approach to prescribing has clearly contributed to this state.

### Non-TNF biologics and their biosimilars in rheumatoid arthritis [^8c9bec39]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease that affects both the articular and extra-articular structures, leading to significant joint damage, disability and excess mortality. The treatment algorithm of RA has changed tremendously in the past 1–2 decades because of the emergence of novel biological therapies that target different mechanisms of action in addition to TNFα.

Areas Covered

This article summarizes the evidence and safety of the non-TNF biological DMARDs in the treatment of RA, including those that target B cells, T-cell co-stimulation, interleukin (IL)-6 and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The targeted synthetic DMARDs such as the Janus kinase inhibitors are not included. The availability of the less costly biosimilars has enabled more patients to receive biological therapy earlier in the course of the disease. The evidence for the non-TNF biosimilar compounds in RA is also reviewed.

Expert Opinion

There are unmet needs of developing novel therapeutic agents to enhance the response rate and provide more options for difficult-to-treat RA. These include the newer generation biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs. A personalized treatment strategy in RA requires evaluation of the cellular, cytokine, genomic and transcriptomic profile that would predict treatment response to biologic or targeted DMARDs of different mechanisms of action.

An initial target of low disease activity is preferred because remission by established criteria may not be achievable for many patients, and they emphasized that it would be preferable to initially aim for low disease activity and subsequently consider a goal of remission, while treatment goals should be systematically reassessed over time and individualized to each patient to ensure that remission is targeted when possible.

### Mechanisms underlying DMARD inefficacy in difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis: a narrative review with systematic literature search [^b47cb65e]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Immune mechanisms underlying (unacceptable) side effects

Also for mechanisms underlying (unacceptable) side effects, no studies have been reported in D2T RA patients specifically. In studies in RA patients who failed b/tsDMARDs, mechanisms were generally found to be directly related to the mechanism of action of DMARDs and general immune mechanisms were not found (Supplementary Table S2, available at Rheumatology online). As for mechanisms underlying inefficacy, immune mechanisms underlying side effects were also found to be influenced by (epi)genetics and clinical characteristics.

### CAR T cell therapy for rheumatoid arthritis [^ef4ce0b9]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

As there is currently no cure for RA, therapeutic interventions are focused on decreasing inflammatory pathways though various mechanisms (Table 1). Current treatments include conventional synthetic Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (csDMARDs) and glucocorticoids that have broad acting and poorly defined mechanisms of action, in addition to biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) that target more defined inflammatory pathways. For bDMARDs and tsDMARDs, their mechanism of action includes inhibition of TNFα signalling, inhibition of T cell co-stimulation, CD20-mediated B cell/plasma cell depletion, modulation of IL-6 signalling and inhibition of cytokine-mediated JAK-STAT signalling. Therapeutic regimens are guided by the American College of Rheumatology and the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology in the USA and Europe, respectively. Despite the plethora of available therapies, many patients do not adequately respond to first-line treatments and undergo several cycles of trial and error with next-in-line therapeutic options which is likely due to the heterogeneity of the disease. Furthermore, many patients lose response over time and/or do not achieve clinical remission with any of the currently available therapies. This latter cohort are defined as 'difficult-to-treat'. Overall, drug-free remission in RA is rare. Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a clinically approved treatment for different forms of B cell leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma, and their success in targeting malignant B cells has led to their exploration as a potential therapeutic strategy for difficult-to-treat RA via depletion of B cells (key drivers of inflammation in RA) as well as other immune cell types and tissues.

### Changes in the pharmacological management of rheumatoid arthritis over two decades [^c7ffdfb1]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite modern treatment strategies and increased DMARD prescription, long-term corticosteroid prescribing in RA patients remains substantial, especially among elderly patients, and persists once initiated. Long-term corticosteroid prescribing has clear implications for RA comorbidities and susceptibility to infection (of particular relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic). Rheumatologists need to understand the causes of persistent prescribing and develop alternative strategies of pain management.

### Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: the earlier the better to prevent joint damage [^45eafe1b]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The treatment strategy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has undergone major changes in the past decades. The introduction of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and targeted biologic-DMARDs (bDMARDs) has broadened the therapeutic possibilities, making clinical and radiographic remission an achievable goal. The increasing awareness of the prognostic impact of treating disease to target (T2T), adjusting therapy according to disease activity, has further optimised the outcomes. The evidence from trials using early intensive DMARD strategies introduced the concept of 'window of opportunity' and gave rise to early RA (ERA) clinics, supported by the long-term remission, as well as functional, radiographic and prognostic outcomes of starting treatment early.

### How to use biologic agents in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have comorbid disease [^ea39ab24]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Although biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) have improved the quality of life of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, side effects remain a problem, especially for patients with pre-existing comorbidities. Randomized controlled trials of such drugs in rheumatoid arthritis typically exclude patients with comorbidities and are of short duration, so they do not provide data on adverse events in these people. Other data sources such as national bDMARD registries are limited by the preselection of patients for both conventional synthetic chemical compound disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and bDMARDs, and although these databases document comorbidity, they rarely report its severity. This too limits definitive statements on the progression or resolution of pre-existing disease. Although bDMARDs may not be contraindicated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and certain comorbid diseases, additional assessments or precautions are recommended. This review summarizes current data on the use of bDMARDs in people with rheumatoid arthritis and common comorbid diseases. It provides an evidence base for doctors and their patients when discussing and selecting the appropriate bDMARDs.

### Biologicals in rheumatoid arthritis: current and future [^a20dc957]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of the review is to highlight the current knowledge about established and new biologicals and to summarise recent advances by focusing on comparative efficacy, safety and possible discontinuation of treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Up to now, comparative analyses showed only minor differences with respect to efficacy and safety among the established biologicals. Studies confirmed the excellent drug retention rate as well as efficacy and safety of approved biologicals including their use in monotherapy. Tapering and in some instances discontinuation of biologicals is possible in disease remission. In case of relapse, patients usually show full response after reintroduction of the same compound. The development of biologicals continues fast with several new biologicals targeting different or established cytokines or cellular subsets of the immune system. With several new biologicals in the pipeline and different formulations for established compounds, treatment options for RA will become even more versatile and sophisticated. Although we get closer to the aim of decreasing the proportion of refractory patients, many questions have to be addressed in the near future regarding emerging biosimilars and biologicals with new modes of action.

### Multiple DMARD discontinuations in rheumatoid arthritis: how often and in what patients? Results from a national clinical RA register [^79d1030c]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Multiple discontinuations of biologic (b-) or targeted synthetic (ts-) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may indicate difficult-to-treat disease. We aimed to assess the occurrence of b/tsDMARD discontinuations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), specifically how this varies by definition, across patient subsets and over time.

Methods

Observational cohort study using data from the Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register on patients diagnosed with RA between 2010 and 2019. We identified three populations: (1) newly diagnosed (N = 17780), (2) initiating a first-ever DMARD (N = 18038) and (3) initiating a first-ever b/tsDMARD (N = 8075). In each, we assessed the proportions and characteristics of patients fulfilling either of seven alternative DMARD discontinuation criteria (each encompassing a unique combination of number and type(s) of b/tsDMARD).

Results

At 4.5 years of follow-up, 10% in populations (1) and (2), and 25% in (3), had discontinued ≥ 2 b/tsDMARDs with different modes of action. The proportions meeting each of the other six definitions ranged from 0.3% to 10% in (1) and (2), and 1% to 25% in (3). Regardless of definition or time, the characteristics of discontinuers across populations (1) through (3) remained largely similar.

Conclusions

Applying treatment discontinuation-based definitions to an unselected RA population identifies widely varying proportions of patients with largely similar characteristics. Quantitatively, treatment-based definitions, follow-up time and study population must be clearly specified; qualitatively, the specific definition may be less critical.

### Rheumatoid arthritis [^ed3e5ec8]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is characterised by persistent synovitis, systemic inflammation, and autoantibodies (particularly to rheumatoid factor and citrullinated peptide). 50% of the risk for development of rheumatoid arthritis is attributable to genetic factors. Smoking is the main environmental risk. In industrialised countries, rheumatoid arthritis affects 0.5–1.0% of adults, with 5–50 per 100000 new cases annually. The disorder is most typical in women and elderly people. Uncontrolled active rheumatoid arthritis causes joint damage, disability, decreased quality of life, and cardiovascular and other comorbidities. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the key therapeutic agents, reduce synovitis and systemic inflammation and improve function. The leading DMARD is methotrexate, which can be combined with other drugs of this type. Biological agents are used when arthritis is uncontrolled or toxic effects arise with DMARDs. Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors were the first biological agents, followed by abatacept, rituximab, and tocilizumab. Infections and high costs restrict prescription of biological agents. Long-term remission induced by intensive, short-term treatment selected by biomarker profiles is the ultimate goal.

### RA in 2011: advances in diagnosis, treatment and definition of remission [^a0f7b1e5]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Evidence presented in 2011 suggests that rheumatoid arthritis might comprise two separate diseases — each with different etiological underpinnings — and that kinase inhibitors could soon be added to the therapeutic armamentarium. Together with new definitions of remission, these advances could aid the development of personalized, treat-to-target strategies.

### Starting a disease modifying antirheumatic drug or a biologic agent in rheumatoid arthritis: standards of practice for RA treatment [^5efddf7e]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Our aim was to investigate the practices and standards by which disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) and biologics are and have been prescribed. We reviewed the literature and examined data from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) participating in a national cohort: the National Data Bank for Rheumatic Diseases (NDB). Four pathways for DMARD prescription were identified: (1) A time-based pyramidal approach (the RA pyramid); (2) a severity-based pyramid in which the most effective treatment is given to those with more active disease; (3) a cost-based pathway in which the primary goal is cost containment — this pathway intertwines with the severity-based pathway; and (4) a patient preference pathway where treatment is geared to patient needs and wishes regardless of severity. Data show that the time-based and severity-based pathways are not generally used in contemporary expert practice, and that patients with all degrees of severity and disease duration are receiving DMARD and biologic treatment. With the abandonment of the pyramid and the development of effective therapy, rheumatic disease care has swung away from the imperative of time and severity-based treatment to the imperative of care based on patient preference. It is the standard of practice to treat patients with mild and early disease with aggressive therapy, with the goal of limiting subsequent damage and retarding progression, and with the realistic purpose of relieving symptoms. The standard may at times be in conflict with the goals of insurers, but there is no legitimate medical reason for such limitations.

### Safe use of antirheumatic agents in patients with comorbidities [^aaa951db]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The burden of comorbid diseases is high among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These are often systemic manifestations of RA but may be chronic conditions that predate or develop post-RA diagnosis. Increased mortality in RA is predominantly from nonarticular causes. The expanded armamentarium of disease-modifying drugs and biologics available has revolutionized management of articular disease but has made safe treatment of RA more complex. Drug-induced organ injury and side effects need to be kept in mind when initiating or modifying therapy.

### Immune hallmarks of rheumatoid arthritis management: a brief review [^97fcccd5]. Cytokine (2022). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this review was to examine current evidence on immunomodulation mediated by conventional drugs and the use of novel biological agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Currently, treatment is focused on maximizing quality of life through sustained clinical remission and/or attenuating disease activity. To do so, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, especially methotrexate, are used alone or in combination with other drugs, including leflunomide, biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (tsDMARDs). The most recent strategies modulate the immune response of the individual RA patient using tsDMARDs such as JAK inhibitors and bDMARDs such as ig-CTLA-4, anti- IL6R, anti-TNF-α and anti-CD20. To better understand current immunopharmacological interventions, we also looked at documented mechanisms of RA-mediated immunomodulation, highlighting perspectives potentially boosting RA treatment.

### Conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in early arthritis [^6aafec84]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

This article reviews the use of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in the treatment of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The Finnish early RA cohorts are used as examples of how early and active treatment strategies have improved over time with increasing variety of available DMARDs. Therapy goals of early RA include remission to prevent severe long-term outcomes of RA. Remission can be achieved in a third of patients with early RA using a combination of conventional DMARDs, including methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and prednisolone. Of patients with early RA, 20% to 30% do not improve enough with conventional treatments and should be identified at early phases to consider institution of biologic agents.

### Estimating patient-specific relative benefit of adding biologics to conventional rheumatoid arthritis treatment: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^25e09665]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The treat-to-target strategy is recommended to guide treatment selection for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), where the treatment target is to attain low disease activity or remission within 3 to 6 months. Biologics are recommended to be added to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) as first-line treatment for patients with poor prognostic factors or as second- or third-line treatment for patients with refractory disease. However, the benefit of adding biologics for a specific patient remains inaccurate, which may lead to overuse of biologics or treatment delay. Patient backgrounds are complex, and the precise effect of these backgrounds on treatment outcomes is unclear. Furthermore, poor prognostic factors currently used to guide treatment selection are mainly risk factors for long-term prognosis, which are crucial but lacking straightforwardness in indicating optimal treatments. Because the treat-to-target strategy aims to achieve early low disease activity, the focus of optimal treatment should initially be on improving short-term outcomes. However, despite extensive efforts, no reliable and practicable genetic or biochemical markers strongly associated with treatment response have been identified. On one hand, this lack of information on biochemical markers may cause overuse of biologics, leading to increased adverse effects, difficulties in treatment selection for future flares, loss of response due to antidrug antibodies, and increased medical expenditures. On the other, it may cause trial-and-error–based treatment selection and delay of optimal treatment.

### Active conventional treatment and three different biological treatments in early rheumatoid arthritis: phase IV investigator initiated, randomised, observer blinded clinical trial [^ece45837]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory joint disease associated with joint destruction, pain, functional impairment, and increased comorbidity and mortality. Early and active treatment is associated with improved outcome. The optimal first line treatment for patients with early rheumatoid arthritis has been debated, especially whether it should include a biological disease modifying drug. Currently, treatment recommendations in Europe and the United States advocate early treatment with conventional slow acting synthetic disease modifying drugs, with methotrexate as the anchor drug. The addition of short term low to moderate dose corticosteroids to methotrexate (termed active conventional treatment) might optimise results. Biological disease modifying antirheumatic drugs with different modes of action have been marketed. The most frequently used treatments prescribed early in the disease course are tumour necrosis factor α inhibition, T cell costimulation blocker, and interleukin 6 inhibition. Previous trials have shown superior outcomes in treatment naïve patients who have received biological drugs in combination with methotrexate compared with methotrexate and placebo. Several biological drugs are available whose benefits and harms need to be compared with one another in treatment naïve patients. Studies are needed to determine whether one or more biologicals might be more beneficial or safer, or better tailored to different subgroups of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, a consortium of Scandinavian and Dutch academic investigators planned and conducted a randomised trial examining the comparative benefits and safety of biological drugs with different modes of action versus active conventional treatment in treatment naïve patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

In the first part of the NOrdic Rheumatic Diseases Strategy Trials And Registries (NORD-STAR) study our objective was to assess and compare the efficacy and safety after 24 weeks of active conventional treatment (either methotrexate combined with oral corticosteroids or methotrexate combined with intra-articular corticosteroids and other conventional synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs) versus three biological treatments: a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (certolizumab pegol), a T cell costimulation blocker (abatacept), and an interleukin 6 inhibitor (tocilizumab), all given in combination with methotrexate. Our hypothesis was that a higher clinical disease activity index (CDAI) remission rate would be observed for one or several of the biologicals compared with active conventional treatment.
