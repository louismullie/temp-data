## Question

Which of the following will give small kidneys with narrowing of Renal Arterioles due to Concentri Intimal Thickening: a) Polyarteritis Nodosa b) Diabetes Mellitus c) Syphilis d) Malignant Hypertension e) SLE

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which condition causes small kidneys with concentric intimal thickening and narrowing of renal arterioles, choosing from polyarteritis nodosa, diabetes mellitus, syphilis, malignant hypertension, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key histopathologic feature and whether it reflects small-artery intimal fibrosis versus arteriolar hyalinosis. Then, I should verify which entities on the list classically produce concentric intimal thickening of small arteries or arterioles. Next, I will examine each option for its typical renal vascular pathology and whether it leads to kidney atrophy. Finally, I will synthesize and confirm which single best answer fits the described lesion and clinical picture, ensuring I distinguish overlapping mimics like thrombotic microangiopathy and vasculitis patterns.

> Let me first confirm the target lesion. Concentric intimal thickening with luminal narrowing in small renal arteries/arterioles is a hallmark of hypertensive nephrosclerosis and related arteriosclerotic processes, whereas diabetic nephropathy more prominently features arteriolar hyalinosis rather than concentric intimal thickening; I should double-check that distinction before proceeding [^116Xmywg].

> Now, I will examine polyarteritis nodosa. PAN is a medium-vessel necrotizing vasculitis with segmental transmural inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis, and aneurysms; it does not classically produce concentric intimal thickening of small arteries or arterioles, so it does not fit the described pathology despite occasional renovascular hypertension presentations, which are mechanistically different from nephrosclerosis [^117Ts7uW].

> Next, I should review diabetes mellitus. Wait, let me verify the dominant vascular lesion in diabetic nephropathy. The characteristic intrarenal microvascular change is arteriolar hyalinosis, not concentric intimal thickening; although arterial intimal thickening can be present, it is not the defining lesion, and it does not by itself explain the classic small, scarred kidneys of malignant hypertension, so diabetes is not the best match here [^115NY2Bn].

> I will now consider syphilis. I need to check whether tertiary syphilis produces concentric intimal fibrosis in renal arterioles. The classic vascular lesion of tertiary syphilis is obliterative endarteritis with gummatous inflammation, which is a different pattern than concentric intimal thickening; moreover, syphilis is not a leading cause of the described small-kidney arteriosclerotic phenotype, so this is unlikely [^notfound].

> Let me think about malignant hypertension. Malignant hypertension drives severe hypertensive nephrosclerosis with concentric intimal thickening of small arteries and arterioles, often with fibrinoid necrosis and onion-skin changes, leading to ischemic glomerular collapse, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and kidney shrinkage; this aligns perfectly with the stem's description of small kidneys and concentric intimal thickening with luminal narrowing [^116Xmywg] [^116mFhDQ] [^113vhwrV].

> Hold on, I should verify systemic lupus erythematosus. SLE-associated renal vascular injury spans immune complex lupus nephritis and thrombotic microangiopathy. APS nephropathy can show fibrous intimal hyperplasia, but that is not the prototypical, uniform concentric intimal thickening seen in malignant hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and SLE does not best explain the classic small, scarred kidneys with concentric intimal thickening described here [^114Lmp8E] [^114ge3qi].

> Synthesizing this, the best-fitting answer is malignant hypertension, which uniquely produces severe hypertensive nephrosclerosis with concentric intimal thickening of small arteries/arterioles, disrupted autoregulation, ischemic glomerular injury, and kidney atrophy, matching the stem's pathologic and clinical features most closely among the options provided [^116Xmywg] [^116mFhDQ] [^113vhwrV].

---

The correct answer is **malignant hypertension** [^113vhwrV], which causes small kidneys with concentric intimal thickening and narrowing of renal arterioles due to severe hypertensive injury [^116mFhDQ]. This pattern reflects **fibrinoid necrosis** and **onion-skin** remodeling of small arteries and arterioles, leading to ischemic atrophy and renal shrinkage [^notfound]. Diabetes causes **arteriolar hyalinosis**, not concentric intimal thickening; polyarteritis nodosa involves medium-vessel necrotizing vasculitis with aneurysms [^117Ts7uW]; syphilis causes gummatous interstitial nephritis; and SLE causes immune complex–mediated glomerulonephritis, not concentric intimal thickening [^notfound].

## Pathological features of malignant hypertension

Malignant hypertension is defined by severe hypertension (typically ≥ 180/120 mmHg) with acute end-organ damage, including renal injury [^notfound]. The kidneys show characteristic vascular lesions — **concentric intimal thickening** with luminal narrowing of small arteries and arterioles — driven by smooth muscle cell proliferation, extracellular matrix deposition, and fibrinoid necrosis [^116mFhDQ]. These changes impair renal perfusion, causing ischemic atrophy and shrinkage of the kidneys [^116vdvT6].

---

## Histopathological findings

Histopathological examination in malignant hypertension reveals:

- **Concentric intimal thickening**: Smooth muscle cell proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition cause concentric intimal thickening, narrowing the vascular lumen [^notfound].

- **Fibrinoid necrosis**: Fibrinoid necrosis of arterial walls is a hallmark of malignant hypertension, reflecting severe vascular injury [^notfound].

- **Onion-skin remodeling**: Concentric layers of collagen and smooth muscle cells create an onion-skin appearance, particularly in arterioles [^notfound].

- **Ischemic glomerular injury**: Narrowed arterioles cause ischemic glomerular injury, glomerulosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis, contributing to renal atrophy [^notfound].

---

## Clinical correlation

Malignant hypertension presents with severe hypertension, acute renal failure, hypertensive encephalopathy, and retinopathy [^115SsmBi]. Renal involvement manifests as **rapidly progressive renal dysfunction**, proteinuria, and hematuria. The kidneys are often small and shrunken due to chronic ischemic injury and fibrosis [^113FXU15].

---

## Comparison with other conditions

| **Condition** | **Pathological features** | **Renal involvement** |
|-|-|-|
| Polyarteritis nodosa | Medium-vessel necrotizing vasculitis with aneurysms | Renal infarction, hemorrhage, aneurysms |
| Diabetes mellitus | Arteriolar hyalinosis, mesangial expansion, glomerulosclerosis | Diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease |
| Syphilis | Gummatous interstitial nephritis, granulomas | Chronic interstitial nephritis |
| Systemic lupus erythematosus | Immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis | Lupus nephritis, proteinuria, hematuria |

---

Malignant hypertension is the only condition among the options that consistently produces **concentric intimal thickening** with luminal narrowing of renal arterioles, leading to small, shrunken kidneys [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Malignant hypertension causes small kidneys with concentric intimal thickening and narrowing of renal arterioles due to severe hypertensive injury [^notfound]. This pattern reflects **fibrinoid necrosis** and **onion-skin** remodeling of small arteries and arterioles, leading to ischemic atrophy and renal shrinkage [^11137us6].

### Interrelationship between brachial artery function and renal small artery sclerosis in chronic kidney disease [^111rGTXj]. Hypertension Research (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), characterized by senile inflammation, is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Conduit artery function and small artery structure relate to cardiovascular disease. We examined the correlations, determinants and interrelationships of arterial indices in association with CKD in a cross-sectional study of 139 patients (60% male; mean age 44 years) with CKD (stages 3–5, 39%) who underwent a renal biopsy. Conduit artery function and small artery sclerosis were assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and semiquantitative evaluation of small artery intimal thickening (SA-IT), respectively. The estimated glomerular filtration rate correlated with FMD (r = 0.31, P = 0.0002) and inversely correlated with SA-IT (r = -0.54, P < 0.0001). Multiple regression analysis showed that FMD was inversely correlated with SA-IT and vice versa. In addition, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was significantly correlated with SA-IT, but not FMD. Multiple logistic analysis revealed that higher hs-CRP concomitant with decreased FMD was further associated with the risk of severe SA-IT compared with their individual effects. These findings suggest that both conduit artery and small artery disease develop with mutual interaction in parallel with decreased kidney function. Coexistence of inflammation and conduit artery dysfunction may be closely related to renal small artery sclerosis in patients with CKD.

### Heterogeneous afferent arteriolopathy: a key concept for understanding blood pressure-dependent renal damage [^116Xmywg]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertension, aging, and other factors are associated with arteriosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis, primary morphological features of nephrosclerosis. Although such pathological changes are not invariably linked with renal decline but are prevalent across chronic kidney disease (CKD), understanding kidney damage progression is more pragmatic than precisely diagnosing nephrosclerosis itself. Hyalinosis and medial thickening of the afferent arteriole, along with intimal thickening of small arteries, can disrupt the autoregulatory system, jeopardizing glomerular perfusion pressure given systemic blood pressure (BP) fluctuations. Consequently, such vascular lesions cause glomerular damage by inducing glomerular hypertension and ischemia at the single nephron level. Thus, the interaction between systemic BP and afferent arteriolopathy markedly influences BP-dependent renal damage progression in nephrosclerosis. Both dilated and narrowed types of afferent arteriolopathy coexist throughout the kidney, with varying proportions among patients. Therefore, optimizing antihypertensive therapy to target either glomerular hypertension or ischemia is imperative. In recent years, clinical trials have indicated that combining renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (RASis) and sodium–glucose transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) is superior to using RASis alone in slowing renal function decline, despite comparable reductions in albuminuria. The superior efficacy of SGLT2is may arise from their beneficial effects on both glomerular hypertension and renal ischemia. A comprehensive understanding of the interaction between systemic BP and heterogeneous afferent arteriolopathy is pivotal for optimizing therapy and mitigating renal decline in patients with CKD of any etiology. Therefore, in this comprehensive review, we explore the role of afferent arteriolopathy in BP-dependent renal damage.

### Revascularization for renovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115xsHGK]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on renal artery stenosis:

- **Definition**: Renal artery stenosis is the narrowing of one or both renal arteries, leading to decreased blood flow to the kidneys.
- **Pathophysiology**: The most common causes of renal artery stenosis are atherosclerosis and FMD, accounting for approximately 90% and 10% of renal artery stenosis cases, respectively. Renal artery stenosis decreases renal perfusion, triggering the RAAS, which leads to renovascular hypertension and may cause ischemic nephropathy, resulting in progressive renal dysfunction.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of renal artery stenosis in the general population is estimated at 5–10%, and as high as 25% in elderly patients with hypertension.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for renal atherosclerosis include older age, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, tobacco use, PAD, and a family history of CVD. Risk factors for FMD include female sex, tobacco use, and a family history of FMD.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, renal artery stenosis can present with refractory hypertension, impaired renal function, pulmonary edema, and congestive HF. Physical examination may reveal an abdominal bruit.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of renal artery stenosis can be severe if left untreated, potentially leading to CKD or ESRD. Patients undergoing revascularization for hypertension related to atherosclerotic stenosis should continue pharmacotherapy after the procedure to prevent renal and cardiovascular events. Restenosis occurs in 10–25% of cases.

### Ischemic nephropathy: where are we now? [^115QW5M5]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Identification and reversing the loss of kidney function beyond occlusive disease of the renal arteries poses a major clinical challenge. Recent studies indicate that atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis develops as a function of age and is commonly associated with other microvascular disease, including nephrosclerosis and diabetic nephropathy. The risks of renal artery stenosis are related both to declining kidney function and to accelerated cardiovascular disease, with increased morbidity and mortality. Newer drugs, including agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, have improved the level of BP control for renovascular hypertension. Progressive renovascular disease during medical therapy can produce refractory hypertension, congestive heart failure, and renal failure with tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Recent studies indicate a complex interplay of oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and activation of fibrogenic cytokines as a result of experimental atherosclerosis and renal hypoperfusion. Advances in imaging and interventional devices offer major new opportunities to prevent progressive loss of kidney function. Recent series indicate that although 25 to 30% of patients with impaired renal function can recover glomerular filtration after revascularization, many have no apparent change in kidney function and 19 to 25% experience a significant loss of kidney function, in some cases as a result of atheroemboli. To select patients who are most likely to benefit from vascular intervention, clinicians should understand the pathophysiology of developing ischemic nephropathy and the potential hazards of revascularization in the setting of diffuse atherosclerotic disease. Further research should be directed toward identification of critical disease, regulation of fibrogenesis, and the interaction with other atherosclerotic processes.

### Renal artery stenosis: if and when to intervene [^111FMXcy]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Atherosclerotic renovascular disease remains highly prevalent and presents an array of clinical syndromes. Recent prospective trials have dampened enthusiasm for revascularization generally, but clinicians recognize the need to identify patients likely to benefit from vascular intervention.

Recent Findings

This article highlights the inflammatory nature of vascular occlusive disease and the limits of the kidney to adapt to reduced blood flow. Although moderate reductions can be tolerated, severe impairment of renal perfusion leads to tissue hypoxia and activates inflammatory injury within the kidney. Hence, assessment of kidney viability and potential tools to modify mitochondrial and inflammatory damage may be important to identify patients for whom clinical intervention should be undertaken.

Summary

Clinicians must recognize clinical syndromes that identify 'high-risk' groups and apply revascularization in those likely to benefit. Future efforts to protect the kidney (e.g., mitochondrial protection) or cell-based therapy may amplify clinical recovery when combined with restoring renal blood flow.

### SCAI expert consensus statement for renal artery stenting appropriate use [^111HEYH3]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Medium credibility.

Renal artery revascularization appropriateness thresholds — lesions with a hemodynamic gradient < 10 mm Hg or renal fractional flow reserve (FFR) > 0.8 do not merit revascularization; intervention for an angiographically moderate 50% to 70% diameter stenosis is rarely appropriate without hemodynamic confirmation; patients requiring chronic hemodialysis for greater than three months or with renal atrophy (< 7 cm pole to pole) are not likely to benefit from revascularization; and chronic total occlusions of renal arteries do not warrant revascularization.

### Granulomatosis with polyangiitis presenting as a solitary renal mass: a case report [^117BCUEn]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

In the present case, the histopathological examination of the solitary renal mass in the resected right kidney revealed granulomatous necrotizing arteritis surrounded by interstitial fibrosis with multiple lymph follicles, focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis, granulomas at the destructive lesion of the tubular basement membrane, and vasculitis around the medullary vasa recta. These lesions corresponded to the characteristic lesions of GPA per the 2012 International CHCC criteria (according to which GPA is defined as the presence of granuloma) while microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is defined as the absence of granuloma. The diagnosis of GPA was confirmed using the stepwise algorithm of the 2006 European Medicines Agency Consensus Classification of Vasculitis. However, the present case did not meet the strict criteria for GPA according to the 2022 American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology classification, according to which a total score of ≥ 5 was needed for the classification of GPA. IgG4-related kidney disease, another well-known condition that can present as localized inflammatory tumor-like lesions in the kidney, was ruled out because of the presence of vasculitis found in the present case. Moreover, plasmacytic infiltration, primarily comprising IgG1 but not IgG4, was prominent in areas of interstitial fibrosis (data not shown). The destruction in the kidney was centered on glomeruli, tubuli, and arteries. It also extended to the contiguous zones, resulting in massive tissue destruction. The arcuate artery in the mass, which might have been providing support for the localized fibrotic area, exhibited neointimal thickening of the endothelial cells, which resulted in severe narrowing of the arterial lumen. These findings suggest that the destructive process in granulomatous necrotizing arteritis might have been locally augmented in that area because of ischemic endothelial injury resulting from the narrowing of the corresponding arcuate artery. The exact etiology of severe neointimal thickening of the corresponding arcuate artery was unknown; however, it might be related to the etiology of necrotizing vasculitis. The area outside the renal mass did not exhibit signs of vasculitis or intimal thickening of the arcuate arteries, indicating that endothelial injury and vasculitis in small-sized vessels did not reach the level of histological manifestation in the absence of ischemic endothelial injury, which was locally observed in the mass lesion. In the present case, serum creatinine levels increased further despite the right nephrectomy, suggesting the presence of vasculitis in the remaining left kidney. However, the patient tested negative for both MPO-ANCA and PR3-ANCA. One study reported that 54.6% and 45.5% of Japanese patients with GPA tested positive for MPO-ANCA and PR3-ANCA, respectively, and that only 9.1% of patients were ANCA-negative. Moreover, ANCA sensitivity is particularly lower among patients with active localized lesions, as seen in the present case. Therefore, double-negative ANCA vasculitis was suspected in the present case.

### Structural changes in renal arterioles are closely associated with central hemodynamic parameters in patients with renal disease [^114L1mDJ]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Although central hemodynamics are known to be closely associated with microvascular damage, their association with lesions in the small renal arteries has not yet been fully clarified. We focused on arterioles in renal biopsy specimens and analyzed whether their structural changes were associated with noninvasive vascular function parameters, including central blood pressure (BP) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). Forty-four nondiabetic patients (18–50 years of age) with preserved renal function underwent renal biopsy. Wall thickening of arterioles was analyzed based on the media/diameter ratio, and hyalinosis was analyzed by semiquantitative grading. Associations of these indexes (arteriolar wall remodeling grade index (RG index) and arteriolar hyalinosis index (Hyl index)) with clinical variables were analyzed. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that the RG index was significantly associated with central systolic BP (β = 0.97, p = 0.009), serum cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (β = -0.36, p = 0.04), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (β = -0.37, p = 0.02). The Hyl index was significantly associated with baPWV (β = 0.75, p = 0.01). Our results indicate that aortic stiffness and abnormal central hemodynamics are closely associated with renal microvascular damage in young to middle-aged, nondiabetic kidney disease patients with preserved renal function.

### Chronic total occlusion of renal artery in symptomatic young patient with resistant hypertension: is a revascularization necessary or redundant? [^113rLun3]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) refers to the presence of a lesion that narrows the vessel lumen by at least 60%, the hemodynamic significance of which can be further confirmed by determining the pressure gradient with endovascular methods. It can occur in up to 5–10% of the general population, and its main cause is the presence of atherosclerotic plaque. Thus, the prevalence of the disease increases with age and correlates with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, male sex, diabetes, chronic kidney disease or a family history. In 20%, it occurs bilaterally or involves the single functioning kidney. Rarer causes include fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), a history of or active vasculitis including the presence of Takayasu arteritis (type 3, 4 or 5 disease). FMD occurs in a younger population, is nine times more common in women and is more common in people without cardiovascular risk factors, except for smoking, which contributes to its occurrence. It develops in less than 1% of the general population and is usually diagnosed in the fifth decade of life, often incidentally during diagnostic imaging performed for other clinical indications, but cases diagnosed in childhood have also been described. The pathogenesis of FMD is not fully understood. There are suggestions that it is related to the presence of genetic and environmental factors, smoking and estrogens. In 10%, the disease occurs in a family member. FMD takes the form of narrowing or widening (ectasias, aneurysms) of medium-sized arteries, and the sudden dissection of the vessel at the site of the primary lesion may occur. The condition most often affects the arteries of the central nervous system and renal arteries, less often other locations in the abdomen and vessels of the extremities. RAS, regardless of the cause, can lead to a number of adverse consequences. Reducing the flow behind the stenosis results in increased secretion of renin in the affected kidney, which leads to the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system and consequently the development of secondary hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk. RAS is the most common form of renovascular hypertension and one of the most common (5–28%) of secondary hypertension in general. Progressive renal ischemia may contribute to the deterioration of its excretory function and lead to chronic kidney disease and, in advanced cases, to loss of function and atrophy of the organ. During RAS, there may also be recurrent pulmonary oedema with abrupt onset (flash pulmonary edema), and in those cases, exclusion of structural disease in the heart suggests the presence of RAS. Other conditions that raise suspicion of renal artery disease include onset of hypertension less than 30 years of age, rapid acceleration of previously well controlled blood pressure, onset of resistant hypertension, hypertensive crisis (acute heart failure, hypertensive encephalopathy), unexplained renal atrophy or disproportion in kidney size, unexplained kidney failure, worsening of kidney function after starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB).

### Renal arteriolar hyalinosis, not intimal thickening in large arteries, is associated with cardiovascular events in people with biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy [^117Hyfnf]. Diabetic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Diabetic nephropathy, a pathologically diagnosed microvascular complication of diabetes, is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular events, which mainly involve arteries larger than those affected in diabetic nephropathy. However, the association between diabetic nephropathy pathological findings and cardiovascular events has not been well studied. We aimed to investigate whether the pathological findings in diabetic nephropathy are closely associated with cardiovascular event development.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study analysed 377 people with type 2 diabetes and biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy, with a median follow-up of 5.9 years (interquartile range 2.0 to 13.5). We investigated how cardiovascular events were impacted by two vascular diabetic nephropathy lesions, namely arteriolar hyalinosis and arterial intimal thickening, and by glomerular and interstitial lesions.

Results

Of the 377 people with diabetic nephropathy, 331 (88%) and 295 (78%) had arteriolar hyalinosis and arterial intimal thickening, respectively. During the entire follow-up period, those with arteriolar hyalinosis had higher cardiovascular event rates in the crude Kaplan-Meier analysis than those without these lesions (P = 0.005, log-rank test). When fully adjusted for clinically relevant confounders, arteriolar hyalinosis independently predicted cardiovascular events [hazard ratio (HR) 1.99; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12, 3.86], but we did not find any relationship between arterial intimal thickening and cardiovascular events (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.60, 1.37). Additionally, neither glomerular nor interstitial lesions were independently associated with cardiovascular events in the fully adjusted model.

Conclusions

Arteriolar hyalinosis, but not intimal thickening of large arteries, was strongly associated with cardiovascular events in people with diabetic nephropathy.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^113mHrmt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Atypical clinical features in diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) — atypical clinical features should prompt evaluation for non-DKD and people with diabetes and CKD may have increased risks of testing and treatments (Moderate). Evaluation of a person with atypical features should include additional diagnostic testing in selected cases, depending on the clinical presentation; for example, refractory hypertension and/or a significant decrease in kidney function after RAS blockade should prompt consideration of renal artery stenosis. Rapidly decreasing kidney function and/or increasing proteinuria (particularly if nephrotic), active urinary sediment, or evidence of other systemic disease should raise concerns about nondiabetic glomerular disease. Diagnosis of these diseases may require invasive testing or interventional procedures, administration of radiographic contrast, with or without angiography, may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in other people, and in the absence of another identifiable and treatable cause of kidney disease, patients with diabetes and CKD should be treated as if they have DKD.

### Attending rounds: a patient with accelerated hypertension and an atrophic kidney [^1129jjEQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

This case represents an individual with accelerating hypertension and declining kidney function associated with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. Key features include loss of GFR (reaching stage V CKD) during intensified antihypertensive drug therapy including agents that block the renin-angiotensin system and failure to appreciate the extent to which moderate renal artery stenosis was affecting his better kidney. Interpretation of duplex ultrasound studies was complicated by a discrepancy between near-normal peak systolic velocities and markedly abnormal segmental arterial waveforms. It was essential to recognize that both kidneys were abnormal and focus on recovery of perfusion to the better of these kidneys. Successful revascularization of one kidney allowed major improvement in GFR and BP control.

### Truly resistant hypertension? [^112zYvc8]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A young man presented with severe hypertension with evidence of both neurological and cardiovascular end-organ damage. Investigation revealed a small right kidney and a left renal artery aneurysm. Significant hypertension persisted even after right nephrectomy. Despite extensive investigation, no evidence was found to implicate the aneurysm in the causation of his high blood pressure. No alternative cause for hypertension was found, yet blood pressure was high even during hospital admission and observed medication dosing with eight antihypertensive agents. Sustained hypertension resulted in worsening left ventricular hypertrophy and he died suddenly at a tragically young age several years after presentation. This gentleman had truly resistant hypertension, a clinical problem which can be very difficult to manage.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) indications for revascularization vary by clinical context: for asymptomatic stenosis, percutaneous revascularization may be considered for an asymptomatic bilateral or solitary viable kidney with a hemodynamically significant RAS, while the usefulness for asymptomatic unilateral hemodynamically significant RAS in a viable kidney is not well established and is presently clinically unproven; for hypertension, percutaneous revascularization is reasonable for hemodynamically significant RAS with accelerated, resistant, or malignant hypertension, an unexplained unilateral small kidney, or intolerance to medication; for preservation of renal function, percutaneous revascularization is reasonable for RAS with progressive chronic kidney disease with bilateral RAS or a RAS to a solitary functioning kidney, and may be considered for RAS with chronic renal insufficiency with unilateral RAS; for heart failure or ischemia syndromes, percutaneous revascularization is indicated for hemodynamically significant RAS with recurrent, unexplained congestive heart failure or sudden, unexplained pulmonary edema and is reasonable for hemodynamically significant RAS with unstable angina.

### Heterogeneous afferent arteriolopathy: a key concept for understanding blood pressure-dependent renal damage [^114JCByV]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyalinosis and ischemic renal damage

Severe hyalinosis accompanied by narrowing of the afferent arteriole lumen has been suggested to be associated with ischemic damage in connected glomeruli. The presence of arteriolar hyalinosis represents an additional risk for ischemic injury in renal transplants. Moreover, hyalinosis may serve as a potential surrogate marker of reduced interstitial blood flow and hypoxia in patients with glomerulonephritis. In addition, an observed association between advanced arteriolar hyalinosis and poor renal outcomes has been associated with the induction of collapsing glomerular damage accompanied by ischemic podocyte injury.

### Disentangling the multiple links between renal dysfunction and cerebrovascular disease [^1129kdGN]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

In the kidney, the juxtamedullary afferent arterioles are small, short vessels that have to maintain a strong vascular tone in order to provide a large pressure gradient in a short distance. These types of vessels are therefore referred to as 'strain vessels' as they are most susceptible to hypertensive renal injury. Myogenic reflexes of the smooth muscle arterioles (along with tubuloglomerular feedback) mediate the kidney's autoregulatory response. However, with the development of hypertension, hyaline arteriolosclerosis replaces the arteriolar smooth muscle, impairing autoregulation with resultant transmission of increased systemic pressure into the glomerulus. When these afferent arterioles are damaged by hypertension, they lose their autoregulatory ability, leading to glomerular hypertension and sclerosis, progressive loss of renal function and worsening systemic hypertension. Thus, microalbuminuria, the classic manifestation of glomerular injury, may be an early marker of vascular damage of renal strain vessels.

Strain vessels also exist in the central nervous system in the form of deep perforating arteries that arise directly from large high-pressure arteries, such as anterior, middle or posterior cerebral arteries, and then penetrate into the brain tissues. Similar to the juxtamedullary afferent arterioles, these perforating arteries are also exposed to high pressures and therefore have to transmit large pressure gradients from their parent arteries to brain tissue capillaries. Analogous to renal arteriolosclerosis, lipohyalinosis may form in these strain vessels as a result of chronic hypertension, and this is also a characteristic finding in lacunar stroke. Lipohyalinosis can impair cerebral autoregulation and decrease regional cerebral blood flow, resulting in higher rates of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke in the areas supplied by these subcortical perforating arteries.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Renal arterial disease — clinical clues to the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis (RAS): Class I — the performance of diagnostic studies to identify clinically significant RAS is indicated in patients with the onset of hypertension before the age of 30 years (Level of Evidence: B) or with the onset of severe hypertension after the age of 55 years (Level of Evidence: B); it is also indicated for accelerated hypertension, resistant hypertension defined as failure to achieve goal blood pressure on a full 3‑drug regimen that includes a diuretic, or malignant hypertension with acute end‑organ damage including acute renal failure, acutely decompensated congestive heart failure, new visual or neurological disturbance, and/or advanced [grade III to IV] retinopathy (Level of Evidence: C); it is indicated with new azotemia or worsening renal function after administration of an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocking agent (Level of Evidence: B); it is indicated with an unexplained atrophic kidney or a discrepancy in size between the 2 kidneys of greater than 1.5 cm (Level of Evidence: C); and it is indicated with sudden, unexplained pulmonary edema (especially in azotemic patients) (Level of Evidence: B). Class IIa — the performance of diagnostic studies to identify clinically significant RAS is reasonable in patients with unexplained renal failure, including individuals starting renal replacement therapy (dialysis or renal transplantation) (Level of Evidence: B).

RESULTS

Hypertensive patients with native and transplanted kidneys

Patient 1 was a 74-year-old woman who died in November 2014 at the Tor Vergata University Hospital. She had a history of irreversible hypertension-related nephropathy, treated with dialysis for 5 years. Following kidney transplantation from a non-hypertensive donor in May 2014, she suffered from persistent hypertension, even though responsive to treatment. The patient, who was also undergoing continuous immunosuppressive treatment, developed a fatal cytomegalovirus infection in November 2014 and died. Autopsy showed pseudomembranous pancolitis, cardiac hypertrophy and acute terminal ventricular dilation. At histological examination, native kidney was characterized by evidence of hypertensive vascular damage with diffuse arteriolar wall thickening and significant internal elastic lamina duplication (score 5; Figure 1 A). Renal parenchyma featured diffuse changes of chronic pyelonephritis with foci of tubular atrophy and widespread glomerulosclerosis. Histological evaluation of 5-month kidney transplant revealed interstitial chronic inflammation and focal glomerulosclerosis along with mild arteriolar damage (i.e. concentric intimal arteriolar thickening similar to the thickness of the tunica media; score 3). Native renal arteries exhibited evidence of fibromuscular dysplasia, with luminal stenosis < 30%. In both arteries numerous nerves were observed in the adventitia, with 26- to 121-µm diameter nerves being more abundant in the area close to the tunica media (mean nerve density = 4.34 ± 0.21 nerves/mm 2; Table 2, Figure 1 B). Small nerves were concentrated in the innermost area of the adventitia, surrounded by larger nerves. Density and size of nerves were consistent with data of a previous study of kidneys in ESRD patients on haemodialysis. Evaluation of transplant renal artery, distal to arterial anastomosis, revealed the presence of few stainable nerves in the innermost area of adventitial tissue (mean nerve density = 1.08 ± 0.16 nerves/mm 2; Figure 1 D). Such nerves were predominantly small (32–52 µm diameter), mainly consisting of regenerating axons, as demonstrated by GAP43 positivity. Additional evidence of nerve sprouting was found in native ganglions sampled in proximity to arterial anastomosis (Figure 1 G).

Dilemma in defining nephrosclerosis and hypertensive nephrosclerosis

The term "nephrosclerosis" is often used interchangeably with hypertensive nephrosclerosis owing to shared pathological findings in patients with hypertension. Additionally, similar findings have been documented in elderly individuals. Notably, indices of small artery intimal thickening increase progressively from younger to older age groups. Consequently, diagnosing nephrosclerosis typically relies on clinical observations, particularly in hypertensive patients with longstanding disease or in elderly individuals with renal dysfunction and minimal proteinuria, after excluding other primary renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis. Given the frequent comorbidity of hypertension among the elderly, determining the causal factor for nephrosclerosis becomes challenging. Moreover, establishing precise diagnostic criteria proves difficult owing to similar findings associated with metabolic disorders, such as diabetes, smoking, hypertension, and aging. Previous studies have highlighted the diagnostic inaccuracies in identifying hypertensive nephrosclerosis in clinical practice.

Although delineating a distinct clinical entity for "(hypertensive) nephrosclerosis" remains elusive, it is indisputable that arteriosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis constitute primary pathologic features. Kopp et al. advocated for adopting an etiologically neutral term, such as "arteriosclerosis", to denote the disease rather than merely describing its pathology. However, the vast number of hypertensive patients with renal impairment renders renal biopsy impractical for diagnosing nephrosclerosis in elderly individuals with CKD and hypertensive patients. Additionally, vascular lesions akin to nephrosclerosis are observed in other renal diseases, including diabetic nephropathy and glomerulonephritis, albeit to varying degrees. Determining the primary factors responsible for these vascular lesions remains challenging. Notably, morphological features consistent with nephrosclerosis do not invariably correlate with reduced renal function. For instance, elderly kidney transplant donors, generally considered free of CKD, exhibit a considerably higher prevalence of such morphological changes. Therefore, it is more pragmatic to assess how the pathogenic conditions associated with arteriosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis influence progressive renal function decline, rather than focusing on specific etiologies and precise diagnoses. Luke et al. suggested that the interaction between systemic blood pressure and arteriosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis may contribute to renal function decline. In particular, morphological and functional alterations in the afferent arteriole (afferent arteriolopathy) contribute to glomerular hemodynamic abnormalities. In the following sections, we further explore the potential role of afferent arteriolopathy in blood pressure–dependent renal damage.

### Managing acute presentations of atheromatous renal artery stenosis [^112hkNfv]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

We believe that three important considerations are necessary when contemplating renal revascularization for patients with atherosclerotic RAS. The clinical presentation is key but so too is the severity of the RAS lesion and the extent of parenchymal damage within the kidney (with better results anticipated when there is minimal proteinuria and absence of significant renal atrophy). Our case series highlighted cases compatible with the recommendations of the ACC/AHA 2018 guidelines that suggest revascularisation should be reserved for those patients with "high risk" presentations such as recurrent flash pulmonary oedema, rapidly declining renal function and refractory hypertension (Fig. 3).

Renal artery stenosis is common especially in patients with generalized atherosclerosis. It is frequently associated with difficult-to-treat hypertension and with renal failure. There is an ongoing debate about the appropriate screening and treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. Advances in imaging and interventional devices offer new opportunities, however, clinicians still have to decide individually in every patient to treat or not to treat stenosis with revascularization. This review evaluates the current literature in order to help the physician to find the right decision in this challenging clinical issue.

Results

Characteristics of patients

Fifty-eight patients were enrolled in the study according to the inclusion criteria. Their characteristics are summarized in Table 1. They were predominantly male (68.9%). Their median age was 49 years [23–89]. Their median eGFR and proteinuria/creatininuria ratio were respectively 59 mL/min/ 1.73 m 2 [5–130] and 245 mg/mmol [7–2000]. Forty seven (81%) patients presented glomerular nephropathy. On biopsy, median sclerotic glomeruli and interstitial fibrosis percentage were respectively 13% [0–96] and 10% [0–90]. The presence of arteriolosclerosis or arteriosclerosis could not be studied in 5 and 12 patients, respectively, because of the absence of visible arteriole or artery on biopsy sample. Hyaline arterial deposits were observed on 25 of the 53 biopsies with visible arteriolar sections (47.2%). Arteriosclerosis was observed in 21 of the 46 patients (45.6%) for whom at least one artery was present on the biopsy. Eight (17.3%) patients had severe arteriosclerosis with an intima/media ratio ≥ 1 (Table 1). Median RI was 0.62 [0.31–1.0].

CKD

Retinopathy (diabetic, hypertensive, or otherwise) is more prevalent in patients with CKD, independent of standard CVD risk factors including diabetes and proteinuria. Retinopathy severity also shows a graded relationship with declining estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and its presence predicts future decline in renal function. Analysis of ∼1000 patients from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort with serial fundus photographs found that retinopathy progression also tracks CKD progression in a subgroup of patients. However, these initial associations were lost after adjusting for baseline risk factors for progression, suggesting little added benefit of retinal metrics. Both arteriolar narrowing and venular widening have been associated with prevalent CKD, but whether retinal vessel calibers predict incident or progressive CKD is not clear (Table 2). The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study examined retinal photographs of ∼10,000 middle-aged patients and showed that those in the lowest arteriole-to-venule ratio quintile had the greatest increase in serum creatinine level over a 6-year period; this held true after adjusting for baseline vascular risk factors. Analysis of retinal images from ∼4500 patients without baseline CKD from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis found that narrower arterioles predicted the development of CKD in white patients alone. However, other large well-designed studies have failed to find an independent association between any vascular caliber metric and CKD progression.

### Call for revolution: a new approach to describing allograft deterioration [^115NrXqM]. American Journal of Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

I propose a set of definable entities in the renal transplant course, eliminating the need for the term 'chronic rejection'. The status of a renal transplant can be defined by the presence and extent of rejection (T-cell-mediated or antibody-mediated); allograft nephropathy (parenchymal atrophy, fibrosis, and fibrous intimal thickening in arteries); transplant glomerulopathy; specific diseases; and factors which could accelerate progression. The level of function and the slope of the loss of function should be separately determined. This approach can be applied both in research and in clinical practice, and can be adapted to other organ transplants.

### The structural factor of hypertension: large and small artery alterations [^113W8B4a]. Circulation Research (2015). Low credibility.

Pathophysiological studies have extensively investigated the structural factor in hypertension, including large and small artery remodeling and functional changes. Here, we review the recent literature on the alterations in small and large arteries in hypertension. We discuss the possible mechanisms underlying these abnormalities and we explain how they accompany and often precede hypertension. Finally, we propose an integrated pathophysiological approach to better understand how the cross-talk between large and small artery changes interacts in pressure wave transmission, exaggerates cardiac, brain and kidney damage, and lead to cardiovascular and renal complications. We focus on patients with essential hypertension because this is the most prevalent form of hypertension, and describe other forms of hypertension only for contrasting their characteristics with those of uncomplicated essential hypertension.

### Heterogeneous afferent arteriolopathy: a key concept for understanding blood pressure-dependent renal damage [^113vhwrV]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Susceptibility to blood pressure–dependent renal damage

Biddani and Griffin provided an important concept for understanding the underlying mechanisms involved in susceptibility to blood pressure–dependent renal damage. For example, renal injury is unlikely to occur in patients with essential hypertension unless their blood pressure is elevated, as observed in malignant hypertension. An increase in vascular resistance in the afferent arteriole has been observed in patients with essential hypertension, and narrowing of the afferent arteriole may precede the development of hypertension, likely due to elevated peripheral vascular resistance. Conversely, increased vascular resistance in the afferent arteriole may protect glomeruli by preventing high systemic blood pressure from being transmitted directly to the glomerulus. The slow progression of renal injury generally observed in essential hypertensive patients may be attributed to ischemia-driven pathology via narrowing of the arteriole lumen and small artery. In contrast, even slight increases in systemic blood pressure can cause glomerular damage in patients with other CKDs, such as diabetic nephropathy and advanced CKD, due to glomerular hypertension induced by autoregulatory mechanism disruption in the afferent arteriole, with the autoregulatory mechanisms including myogenic and tubuloglomerular feedback. The linear increase in risk observed between blood pressure and the development of kidney injury may be attributable to impaired autoregulation systems.

### Diagnosis and treatment of renal artery stenosis [^1141u3Yn]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

A reduction in the diameter of the renal arteries can lead to hypertension, renal dysfunction and/or pulmonary edema. About 90% of patients with renal artery stenosis have atherosclerosis, and 10% have fibromuscular dysplasia. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is a common condition that typically occurs in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease with coexistent vascular disease at nonrenal sites. Patients who undergo revascularization to treat hypertension associated with atherosclerotic stenosis need to continue medication with statins, antiplatelet agents and renin-angiotensin antagonists after the procedure to prevent renal and cardiovascular events. Two recent trials compared renal outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic stenosis who were treated with antihypertensive medication plus stenting with those in patients who were treated with medication alone. Available results favor a conservative approach (medication only) for most patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. These results, however, concern patients with stable clinical conditions and, in many cases, only moderate renal artery lesions. Blood pressure outcome after angioplasty is more favorable in patients with fibromuscular renal artery disease, who usually do not have renal failure, than in those with atherosclerosis.

Table 2
Time courses of the ADAMTS-13 activity and the microangiopathic hemolytic parameters

To determine the etiology of the renal disease which was unresponsive to plasma exchange, renal biopsy was performed on day 26. The specimen for light microscopy contained 15 glomeruli; 7 exhibited global sclerosis, 2 severe segmental sclerosis, and 2 exhibited only minor abnormalities. The remaining 4 glomeruli had dilated capillary loops that were filled with red blood cells (Figure 1 -A). Aggregations of severe tubular necrosis were seen in several foci (Figure 1 -B). One of these glomeruli had an afferent arteriole with occlusive intimal changes (Figure 1 -C; arrowhead) and what appeared to be a small intraluminal thrombus (Figure 1 -D; arrow). Arteriosclerotic fibrous thickening of the intima was seen in the larger arteries. Smaller interlobular arteries and arterioles, on the other hand, showed occlusion or extensive narrowing of their lumen which was interpreted to represent the sequel of TMA (Figure 1 -E). Fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall was not observed. No obvious thrombi were observed in the vascular lumina except for the above-mentioned modest lesion in an afferent arteriole. Tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis were seen in approximately 50% of the cortical area. Immunofluorescence studies showed no immunoglobulin, complement or fibrinogen deposition in the glomeruli or the blood vessels.

Histological Protocol

All autopsies were performed within 12 to 24 hours of death. Arteries, after sampling, to avoid folding and kinking were set without making any traction on a tablet and immediately fixed in buffered formalin. For renal arteries collected during the course of autopsies, at least 6 tissue specimens were sampled at distances of 5 mm from each other. Each artery, with the surrounding peri‐adventitial tissue, was equally divided into proximal and distal segments. The arteries harvested from the surgical nephrectomy specimens had a length of ≈2.5 cm; therefore, 4 tissue specimens were collected at distances of 5 mm from each other. Each segment was serially cut into 5‐mm‐thick sections. Two sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Weigert stain. The other 3 sections were used for the immunohistochemistry analyses.

Moreover, in each patient, a sample of kidney tissue, including both cortex and medulla, was collected to evaluate the histological changes associated with hemodialysis and hypertension. A sample of the wall from the left ventricle of the heart was also biopsied in the autopsy cases to evaluate histological lesions and the sympathetic innervation of the pericardium.

Determination of Hypertensive Status by Histological Evaluation of the Renal Arterioles

To obtain an objective evaluation of the patients' hypertensive status, 20 arterioles with a diameter ranging between 150 and 500 μm were evaluated from each kidney section according to the score system of Burke et al. 27 A median score equal to 4 (concentric intimal thickening greater than the thickness of the media without concentric elastic duplication) or 5 (concentric intimal thickening greater than the thickness of the media with concentric elastic duplication in 3 or more vessels examined) was considered to be an objective marker of hypertensive nephropathy, independent of clinical history and therapy.

Immunohistochemistry

Nerves were identified in tissue sections using the methods and antibodies reported by Sakakura et al. 28 To obtain accurate nerve contour for nerve size measurements, immunostaining for neurofilament protein (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc, Tucson, AZ) and S100 (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc) was performed in all cases. Anti‐tyrosine hydroxylase antibody (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) has been used to identify efferent nerves, and a rabbit anti‐calcitonin gene‐related peptide antibody (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to identify afferent nerves.

### Pre-existing arteriosclerotic intimal thickening in living-donor kidneys reflects allograft function [^114du2FM]. American Journal of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Donor shortage is a serious problem worldwide and it is now debated whether kidneys from marginal donors are suitable for renal transplantation. Recent studies have shown that the findings of preimplantation kidney biopsy are useful to evaluate vasculopathy in the donated kidney, and may predict transplant outcomes in deceased- donor kidney transplantation. However, few studies have focused on the pathological findings of preimplantation biopsy in living-donor kidney transplantation. Therefore, we investigated whether arteriosclerotic vasculopathy in living-donor kidneys at the time of transplantation predicts the recipient's kidney function (allograft function) later in life.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 75 consecutive adult living-donor kidney transplants performed at Kagawa University Hospital. Renal arteriosclerotic vasculopathy was defined according to the presence of fibrous intimal thickening in the interlobular artery.

Results

Forty-one kidneys exhibited mild arteriosclerotic vasculopathy on preimplantation kidney biopsies. The decreases in estimated glomerular filtration rate after donation were similar in donors with or without renal arteriosclerotic vasculopathy. Pre-existing arteriosclerotic vasculopathy did not affect graft survival rate, patient survival rate or the incidence of complications. Recipients of kidneys with arteriosclerotic vasculopathy had lower allograft function at 1 and 3 years after transplantation than the recipients of arteriosclerosis-free kidneys with or without donor hypertension. In multivariate analysis, fibrous intimal thickening on preimplantation biopsy was predictive of reduced allograft function at 1 year after transplantation.

Conclusions

The present study demonstrated that mild arteriosclerotic vasculopathy in the donated kidney is an important pathological factor that reflects future impaired function of renal allografts from marginal donors.

### Renal involvement in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)-APS nephropathy [^114Lmp8E]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Although the kidney represents a major target organ in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), renal involvement in APS was poorly recognized until recently. The most well-recognized renal manifestations of APS are the renal artery thrombosis/stenosis, renal infarction, hypertension, renal vein thrombosis, end-stage renal disease, increased allograft vascular thrombosis, some types of glomerular disease, and a small-vessel vaso-occlusive nephropathy, recently defined as APS nephropathy. APS nephropathy was first described in primary APS patients, characterized by acute thrombotic lesions in glomeruli and/or arterioles (thrombotic microangiopathy) and chronic vascular lesions such as fibrous intimal hyperplasia of arterioles and interlobular arteries, organized thrombi with or without recanalization, and fibrous arterial and arteriolar occlusions or focal cortical atrophy. APS nephropathy was also detected in further studies including patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-related APS and SLE/non-APS patients with positive antiphospholipid antibodies, independently of lupus nephritis. The same histologic lesions, especially thrombotic mictroangiopathy, were also observed in patients with catastrophic APS. The most frequent clinical and laboratory characteristics of APS nephropathy in all the above groups of patients are hypertension (often severe), proteinuria (ranging from mild to nephrotic range), hematuria, and acute or chronic renal insufficiency.

### Kidney intrinsic mechanisms as novel targets in renovascular hypertension [^112MQ8QC]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Almost a hundred years have passed since obstruction of the renal artery has been recognized to raise blood pressure. By now chronic renovascular disease (RVD) due to renal artery stenosis is recognized as a major source of renovascular hypertension and renal disease. In some patients, RVD unaccompanied by noteworthy renal dysfunction or blood pressure elevation may be incidentally identified during peripheral angiography. Nevertheless, in others, RVD might present as a progressive disease associated with diffuse atherosclerosis, leading to loss of renal function, renovascular hypertension, hemodynamic compromise, and a magnified risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Atherosclerotic RVD leads to renal atrophy, inflammation, and hypoxia but represents a potentially treatable cause of chronic renal failure because until severe fibrosis sets in the ischemic kidney, it retains a robust potential for vascular and tubular regeneration. This remarkable recovery capacity of the kidney begs for early diagnosis and treatment. However, accumulating evidence from both animal studies and randomized clinical trials has convincingly established the inadequate efficacy of renal artery revascularization to fully restore renal function or blood pressure control and has illuminated the potential of therapies targeted to the ischemic renal parenchyma to instigate renal regeneration. Some of the injurious mechanisms identified as potential therapeutic targets included oxidative stress, microvascular disease, inflammation, mitochondrial injury, and cellular senescence. This review recapitulates the intrinsic mechanisms that orchestrate renal damage and recovery in RVD and can be harnessed to introduce remedial opportunities.

### The impact of renal artery stenting on therapeutic aims [^112W7iyi]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is an anatomical categorisation of several disease processes that result in reduced renal perfusion. The impact is two-fold: directly — through reduced renal perfusion resulting in reduced function and ultimately ischaemic atrophy; and indirectly — through activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems leading to systemic hypertension, cardiovascular complications and ultimately, end-organ damage including glomerulosclerosis. The most common causes of RAS are atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Atherosclerotic RAS is not uncommon and may be present on imaging in up to 50% of patients with coronary artery disease. In contrast, the incidence of pathologically impaired renal perfusion leading to clinical conditions is much less clear with the clinical presentation influenced by speed of onset and the type/severity of organ dysfunction.

Given the variable presentation of symptomatic RAS, there may be several therapeutic aims of treating RAS either acutely (reducing blood pressure, improving renal function, treating acute cardio-renal syndromes) or in the longer term (preventing hypertensive end-organ damage and ischaemic renal atrophy). The current treatment of clinically relevant RAS consists primarily of medical optimisation with anti-hypertensive agents. Endovascular treatment may be undertaken with angioplasty alone (usually only in patients with FMD) or with stenting (RASt) in atherosclerotic disease, where ostial calcification makes recoil and restenosis more likely if angioplasty is performed in isolation. It is possible that amongst populations with a heavy atherosclerotic burden, a significant number of people could merit intervention, but the role of RASt is uncertain as two large randomised clinical trials (RCTs) failed to show a significant benefit to either renal or cardiovascular outcomes.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Renal artery stenosis — epidemiology and treatment effects: Renal artery stenosis refers to a narrowing of the renal artery that can result in a hemodynamically significant restriction of blood flow, usually by > 75%. Atherosclerotic disease (90%) is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis, whereas nonatherosclerotic disease, of which fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common, is much less prevalent and tends to occur in younger, otherwise healthier patients with a predilection for women. Atherosclerotic renovascular disease may be present in 14% to 40% of adults with hypertension; however, only a small fraction (0.1%-5%) is considered to be hemodynamically significant to result in renovascular hypertension. Several trials designed to compare the efficacy of these procedures with medical therapy suggested no benefit over aggressive medical therapy alone among adults with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. Nonetheless, there may be benefit in certain subgroups of individuals with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis who were not represented in the trials, including those with progressively worsening kidney function or sudden onset of pulmonary edema. The absence of severe albuminuria is associated with better outcomes after endovascular renal artery stenosis interventions.

### Renal artery diameter, renal function and resistant hypertension in patients with low-to-moderate renal artery stenosis [^114wpLGA]. Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Atherosclerotic renovascular disease is associated with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease, although the causal relationship is discussed. To date, the role of renal artery diameter on these pathological conditions was not clearly studied. We aimed to identify the association of reference diameter and minimal luminal renal artery diameter with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and resistant hypertension in a high cardiovascular risk population.

Methods

In this cross-sectional, single-center study, we enrolled 734 patients who underwent a renal angiography immediately after a coronary angiography indicated for a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease.

Results

Mean age was 64 ± 10 years (men 72%). GFR was 79 ± 22ml/min per 1.73m(2). Five hundred and eighteen patients had no luminal narrowing and 216 patients had low-to-moderate luminal narrowing (10–70%, mean 36%). A positive significant association between reference diameter and GFR was detected in patients without luminal narrowing [beta 2.2ml/min per 1.73m(2) for 1mm increase, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3–4.0, P < 0.05] and in those with low-to-moderate luminal narrowing (beta 7.7ml/min per 1.73m(2) for 1mm increase, 95% CI 4.2–11.1, P < 0.001). The lowest quartile of reference diameter (< 5.2mm) was associated with GFR less than 60ml/min per 1.73m(2) [odds ratio (OR) 3.18, 95% CI 1.61–6.29, P < 0.001]. Patients with resistant hypertension had low minimal diameter and reference diameter. Reference diameter less than 5.2mm was associated with an increased risk of resistant hypertension (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.02–6.77, P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Small renal arteries, defined by a low reference diameter or minimal luminal diameter, are independently associated with low GFR and resistant hypertension, independent of the degree of stenosis and major confounders.

In summary, the diagnosis of vasculitis is not easy, requires extensive clinical experience and access to immunological and histopathological tests. Appropriate treatment, both inductive and supportive, is even more challenging. The absence of markers unequivocally correlating with disease activity and differentiating from other clinical conditions makes management difficult. We expect that the results of the presented study will serve for a better interpretation of the available laboratory tests.

### Renal arterial resistive index is associated with severe histological changes and poor renal outcome during chronic kidney disease [^116DjWbH]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

As previous authors, we found a positive correlation between RI and age and in a lesser extent with pulse pressure. Prior studies reported an association between RI and other markers of arterial stiffness as pulse wave velocity and ankle-brachial blood pressure index. In our study, RI was not associated with systolic nor with diastolic blood pressure despite its relationship with pulse pressure. This suggests that the elevation of RI rather reflects the vascular consequences of hypertension than hypertension itself. An alternative explanation is the lack of power of our study. Nevertheless, this result was demonstrated by previous authors who showed that RI is a marker of target organ damage in essential hypertension as left ventricular hypertrophy, carotid and coronary atherosclerosis. Other studies demonstrated that high RI was also associated with systemic atherosclerosis in diabetic patients and renal transplant recipients. Moreover, Pearce et al. recently showed that elevated renal RI is predictive of cardiovascular events in the elderly.

The elevation of RI with severe arteriosclerosis may account for its association with cardiovascular risk. As previous authors, we actually found an association between RI and renal arteriosclerosis. It is interesting to note that only patients with severe intima thickening exhibited high RI. Nor hyaline arteriolar deposits nor moderate intima thickening were associated with increased RI. This could be due to the lack of power of our study. Nevertheless, it could also suggest that the presence of moderate vascular lesions is not sufficient to induce an elevation of RI and that these alterations must be important enough to reduce artery lumen, raise arterial stiffness and vascular resistance, and consequently generate an increase in RI. Overall, these findings suggest that high RI reflects severe renal arteriosclerosis and maybe systemic arteriosclerosis.

Our study also questioned the correlation of RI with renal fibrosis. We did not find any relationship between RI and glomerulosclerosis. Moreover, RI was significantly lower in case of isolated glomerular involvement, i.e. without any vascular and/or tubulo-interstitial damage. This result corroborates previous findings of Platt et al. Only one among three previous studies found a significant association between glomerulosclerosis and RI. This correlation was weak in a second study and not significant in a multivariate analysis in the third one. Altogether, these findings suggest that glomerulosclerosis does not influence the value of RI.

### A high normal ankle-brachial index is associated with biopsy-proven severe renal small artery intimal thickening and impaired renal function in chronic kidney disease [^115wYbp9]. Hypertension Research (2020). Medium credibility.

A significant relationship has been established between central hemodynamics and renal microvascular damage. We hypothesized that the increase in the ankle-brachial index (ABI) with age is due to increased arterial stiffness and wave reflection and is thus associated with the pathogenesis of the renal small artery in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We recruited 122 patients with CKD (stages 1–5) who underwent renal biopsy and ABI measurements between 2010 and 2013. Renal small artery intimal thickening (SA-IT) severity was assessed by semiquantitative grading. The median age was 47 years, with a range of 15–86 years (47% women). The median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 62mL/min/1.73m 2. Compared with patients with the lowest 1–3 SA-IT index quartile, those with the highest quartile of the SA-IT index were older in age had higher mean arterial pressure, ABI, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, and lower eGFR. ABI was positively associated with SA-IT severity and inversely associated with eGFR. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that ABI was significantly associated with the highest quartile of the SA-IT index (odds ratio per SD increase in ABI, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–3.26) and low eGFR (< 60mL/min/1.73m 2) (odds ratio per SD increase in ABI, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–3.03). In conclusion, a high normal ABI was associated with severe renal small artery intimal thickening and low eGFR in patients with CKD.

### Cumulative smoking dose is associated with subclinical renal injury: a pathological study in individuals without chronic kidney disease [^116sqyB8]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidemiological studies have identified smoking as an independent risk factor for development of chronic kidney disease. However, the early renal pathological lesions have not been clearly elucidated.

Methods

We investigated time-zero biopsy specimens from 547 living kidney donors and evaluated the relationships between smoking and renal histological changes, including arteriolar hyalinization, intimal thickening of small-medium arteries, global glomerulosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IF/TA).

Results

A total of 199 subjects (36.4%) had smoking history; 92 (16.8%) and 107 (19.6%) subjects had < 20 pack-years and ≥ 20 pack-years of smoking, respectively. Cumulative smoking dose was significantly associated with prevalence of arteriolar hyalinization: the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) per 20 pack-year increase was 1.50 (95% confidence interval 1.15–1.97). The ORs for smokers with < 20 pack-years and ≥ 20 pack-years versus never-smokers were 1.76 (1.01–3.09) and 2.56 (1.48–4.44), respectively. Smoking was also associated with prevalence of > 10% global glomerulosclerosis: the OR per 20 pack-year increase was 1.24 (0.96–1.59). The ORs for smokers with < 20 pack-years and ≥ 20 pack-years versus never-smokers were 1.50 (0.98–2.78) and 2.11 (1.18–3.79), respectively. The ORs for these pathological changes increased significantly depending on cumulative smoking dose. Intimal thickening of small-medium arteries and IF/TA were not associated with smoking status. The prevalence of arteriolar hyalinization remained higher in patients with ≥ 10 years since smoking cessation than in never-smokers [OR 2.23 (1.03–4.83)].

Conclusions

Subclinical pathological injury caused by smoking is potentially associated with renal arteriolar hyalinization and glomerular ischaemia.

### Characterization of diabetic kidney disease in 235 patients: clinical and pathological insights with or without concurrent non-diabetic kidney disease [^116TNYgf]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Therefore, a significant negative correlation exists between the progression of glomerular grading and the exacerbation of renal anemia. Glomerular grading demonstrated a significant negative correlation with urinary specific gravity and urine osmolality, indicating that more severe glomerular injury is associated with lower specific gravity and osmolality. This result is likely due to glomerular injury frequently leading to tubulointerstitial damage, which decreases tubular concentrating capacity and lowers urinary specific gravity and osmolality.

Tubulointerstitial lesions exhibited a significant positive correlation with blood creatinine and a significant negative correlation with GFR, reflecting the close association between tubulointerstitial lesions and renal function. Damage to the tubulointerstitial stroma affects the filtration and excretory functions of the kidneys, resulting in a weakened ability to filter waste products, such as creatinine, leading to their accumulation in the body, elevated blood creatinine levels, and decreased renal function. The positive correlation between tubulointerstitial lesions and blood uric acid may be attributed to hyperuricemia causing vascular and tubulointerstitial damage by activating the renin-angiotensin system and immune system response.

Furthermore, tubulointerstitial lesions can hinder uric acid excretion, contributing to secondary hyperuricemia.

Vitrification of renal arterioles was positively correlated with age and blood creatinine levels, and negatively correlated with urine osmolality and GFR. Physiological aging of blood vessels accelerates the vitrification of renal arterioles with increasing age. Diabetes-induced vitrification of renal arterioles reduces vascular elasticity, affecting renal blood supply and disrupting kidney filtration function, resulting in decreased GFR and impaired creatinine removal from the blood. The severity of renal arteriolar vitrification is negatively correlated with urine osmolality due to ischemic damage to glomeruli and tubules associated with the diseased arterioles. Consequently, the concentrating and reabsorbing functions of both distal and proximal tubules are impaired, resulting in decreased urine osmolality and increased nocturia.

Renal vascular atherosclerosis is positively correlated with age and negatively correlated with GFR. Renal vascular sclerosis may be part of systemic arteriosclerosis, affecting multiple organ blood supply and function, including the glomeruli. Increased renal vascular atherosclerosis severity is more likely to cause renal artery narrowing, leading to renal ischemia, glomerular atrophy, fibrosis, and necrosis, thereby reducing GFR.

### Influence of arteriolar hyalinization on arterial intimal fibroplasia in the renal cortex of subjects in the United States, Peru, and Bolivia, applicable also to other populations [^116yjqXF]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Microvasculopathies of nephrosclerosis progress with age in contrasting patterns. Arterial intimal fibroplasia (R(r) and R(c), respectively, in small and large interlobular arteries) previously showed close linkages to hypertension and to "nephrosclerosis", defined by fibrous replacement of atrophied nephrons, whereas hyalinization of arterioles (Hy) failed to show consistent linkages. In this study, renal samples from seven populations, three newly assembled and four reassessed from archived data, were evaluated for R(r), R(c), and Hy in forensic autopsies of basal subjects (ie, those lacking conditions known to correlate with hypertension or nephrosclerosis, mostly deaths by violence). The patterns of progression on age were alike in all populations, but the rates of progression differed greatly. The observed ranges indicate a 547% higher rate for Hy in the fastest compared with the slowest population, a 49% higher rate for R(c), and a 107% higher rate for R(r). About one third of variation in R(r) and R(c) between populations can be attributed to the correlation with Hy, leaving a substantial residual effect independent of Hy. The findings suggest that the etiology propelling hyalinization in arterioles seems somehow to accelerate the progression of intimal fibroplasia in arteries. The reverse direction, fibroplasia somehow accelerating hyalinization, seems unreasonable, because the presumed consequence, Hy, fails to increase notably with age after 40 years, whereas the presumed causes, R(r) and R(c), rise unremittingly into old age. The etiologies of the population differences are of great consequence to public health but remain unknown.

### Central fibrous area in the glomerular vascular pole consists of fibrous collagens and is associated with advanced age: a cross-sectional study [^115obkWB]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Another interesting question is whether CFA progresses to glomerulosclerosis and causes kidney dysfunction. Uesugi et al. Showed 3D imaging of the vascular tree of aging kidneys and determined that arteriosclerosis of the distal interlobular artery contributed to glomerulosclerosis. In our study, CFA formation was univariately associated with vascular sclerosis of both the interlobular artery and arteriole, but not with glomerular tuft size, glomerulosclerosis, or kidney dysfunction. In addition, none of these histological findings were significantly associated with CFA formation on multivariate analysis. Although CFA often encircles afferent arterioles or vascular chambers, the vascular lumens do not become narrow, and the glomerular tuft does not shrink or enlarge. Furthermore, membranous nephropathy was more frequent in the CFA (+) group than in the CFA (−) group, but no clinicopathological difference was observed between the two groups of membranous nephropathy. Similarly, Kanetsuna et al. did not find any correlation between CFA formation and serum creatinine, estimated GFR, or glomerular sclerosis rate in either the IgA nephropathy group or zero-hour biopsy group. Thus, CFA does not yet appear to directly cause glomerulosclerosis or kidney dysfunction and this point should be elucidated by a large cohort study in the future given the cross-sectional designs of both our study and the previous study.

Factors associated with small arterial intimal thickening

Autopsy studies, and examinations of patients with CKD who underwent renal biopsy have demonstrated associations between small arterial intimal thickening and various factors. Prehypertension and hypertension were associated with a higher wall-to-lumen ratio of renal small arteries in an autopsy study, and in another autopsy study, elevated uric acid levels were linked to arterial intimal thickening. Furthermore, smoking was associated with intimal thickening in renal biopsy studies. Animal studies have indicated that a high-salt diet induces medial thickening of renal arterioles and subsequent hypertension via enhanced salt sensitivity.

### Heterogeneous afferent arteriolopathy: a key concept for understanding blood pressure-dependent renal damage [^114yoG2F]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Factors associated with renal arteriolar medial thickening

Various factors have been associated with renal arteriolar medial thickening. Prehypertension and hypertension were linked to arteriolosclerosis in the general population in an autopsy study. Additionally, central blood pressure may correlate with arteriolar wall thickening in young to middle-aged patients with nondiabetic kidney disease and preserved renal function. We previously found that higher levels of uric acid and diabetes were associated with arteriolar wall thickening in patients with CKD undergoing renal biopsy. Moreover, smoking combined with elevated uric acid levels was associated with a greater arteriole wall-to-lumen ratio.

In genetically hypertensive rats, renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors prevent arteriolar remodeling In Dahl salt–sensitive rats, RAS activation contributes to hypertension development by inducing renal arteriolar wall thickening, a pathogenic process inhibited by RAS inhibitors. Additionally, a high-salt diet can initiate such processes by inducing arteriolar medial thickening. We previously reported a significant association between urinary angiotensinogen, a potential intrarenal RAS indicator, and the arteriolar wall-to-lumen ratio in patients with CKD not treated with RAS inhibitors. These findings suggest a potential link between intrarenal RAS and medial smooth muscle proliferation. Contrary to these findings, studies have shown that RAS inhibition induces smooth muscle layer proliferation in the afferent arteriole of hypertensive patients and animal models of hypertension. However, Nagai et al. reported that renin inhibitors did not produce such vascular lesions. Moreover, RAS inhibition, either through medication or genetic knockout of angiotensinogen, may cause marked smooth muscle cell proliferation by inducing phenotypic changes toward the synthetic type in renin-producing cells. These findings imply that RAS inhibitor treatment may lead to glomerular hypoperfusion and subsequent tubular ischemia.

Obesity and certain lipid abnormalities have also been associated with arteriolosclerosis, characterized by arteriolar wall thickening and hyalinosis.

Additionally, complement C3 deposition in arterioles has been correlated with indices of wall thickening and hyalinosis in patients with biopsy-confirmed arterionephrosclerosis. One study suggested that phenotypic changes in profibrotic secretory vascular smooth muscle cells may mediate arteriolar fibrosis. Another study indicated that increased levels of MMP-9, which plays a pivotal role in hypertension-induced kidney microvascular remodeling, promote the phenotypic transformation of afferent arterioles, resulting in the loss of myogenic constriction and hypertensive nephropathy.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease: a KDIGO (kidney disease: improving global outcomes) controversies conference [^114jQUbB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology

ARVD causes a reduction of blood flow and perfusion pressure to the kidney which initiates a series of changes, including compensatory mechanisms and adverse parenchymal injury. It has long been recognized that renal artery pressure reduction activates the release of renin, thereby increasing the production of angiotensin and aldosterone. Modest changes in renal arterial diameter have minimal hemodynamic effects, and activation of these systems occurs only when translesional gradients across RAS develop with 70%-80% luminal obstruction. These hormonal systems aimed at restoring renal perfusion have widespread effects, including increasing sympathetic nerve activity, arterial remodeling and vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and activation of inflammatory pathways. The increase in arterial pressure is dependent on these functional changes and can be reversed by restoring renal perfusion pressure, at least initially. At some point, renovascular hypertension is no longer reversed simply by resolving the stenotic lesion.

An important corollary related to the gradient between systemic and renal pressures is that effective antihypertensive drug therapy that lowers systemic pressures magnifies the reduction in blood flow to the poststenotic kidney. As blood pressure goals remain the same independent of high-grade ARVD, many kidneys are subjected to substantially reduced blood flow for prolonged periods of time. The kidneys are filtering organs, and they normally receive more blood and oxygen delivery than needed for metabolic demands. Within the kidney, the cortex is abundantly perfused, whereas the deeper medullary regions have less blood flow via postglomerular arterioles and greater oxygen consumption related to metabolic work, including solute transport. Despite this gradient leading to relative medullary hypoxia, the kidney can withstand substantial reductions (30%-40%) of blood flow without exacerbation of tissue hypoxia. Part of this "adaptation" is due to reduced filtration and the consequent reduced oxygen consumption.

However, as blood flow is further reduced in the setting of high-grade RAS, the limits of compensation are exceeded. Experimental and clinical investigations indicate that overt cortical hypoxia develops. This is associated with rarefaction of renal microvessels, mitochondrial dysfunction, and activation of tissue inflammatory pathways, including oxidative stress, as reflected in renal vein biomarkers and cellular infiltration in kidney tissue (Fig 1). These processes are amplified by dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking, and other atherosclerotic disease risk factors. With time, inflammation induces fibrosis and nephron loss, and, consequently, deteriorating kidney function can no longer recover despite the restoration of renal blood flow.

Atherosclerotic disease in the renal arteries — supportive text on management and revascularization: Atherosclerotic disease in the renal arteries represents systemic disease and indicates higher risk for both kidney failure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and no RCT has demonstrated a clear clinical advantage of renal artery revascularization over medical therapy in individuals with hypertension; by meta-analysis, renal angioplasty with stenting results in a small reduction in DBP and antihypertensive medication requirement. On the basis of the CORAL trial, the recommended medical approach includes a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker plus lipid, diabetes, and antiplatelet management. Revascularization can be favorable for select individuals with uncontrolled hypertension and progressively worsening kidney function and/or acute HF who were not represented in RCTs, and may be considered for nonatherosclerotic renal artery disease and hypertension and may be curative. Fibromuscular dysplasia is most common in women (90%) and may present at a younger age (mean age 53 years), and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty alone without stenting can improve BP control and even normalize BP, especially when hypertension is of recent onset or resistant.

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory arterial disease, commonly involving the renal arteries. Here we report a case of a 16-year-old Chinese male who was found to have severe hypertension with proteinuria for 2 years. Computed tomography showed absence of the left kidney and enlargement of the right kidney. Subsequent angiography confirmed the above findings and revealed narrowing of both the upper and lower branches of the right renal artery caused by FMD. These combined lesions are very rare, and individuals affected are at increased risk of renal dysfunction if left untreated. Treatment with percutaneous balloon angioplasty is the first choice in such a patient and usually results in optimal outcomes.

Use of contrast in vascular imaging — Ultrasound contrast agents appear useful in enhancing suboptimal images and improving arterial diagnosis in areas where calcification in the vessel wall obscures the view of the lumen and the ability to determine velocity. Contrast agents have been shown investigationally to better outline the lumen of the carotid arteries, facilitate measurement of intimal-medial thickness, help in outlining plaque morphology, and in differentiating between occlusion and high-grade stenosis; contrast enhancement of the renal vasculature has been reported to be useful where multiple main renal arteries are present, and several large-scale studies have found improvement in peripheral artery diagnosis using contrast after suboptimal baseline ultrasound scans. Contrast appears to have use in improving images of vessels difficult to capture with traditional techniques and may also be useful in differentiating between patent and nonpatent vessels in patients with conditions that interfere with ultrasound scanning; nonetheless, despite these reports, they have not received US Food and Drug Administration approval for all these indications and this application should still be, at present, considered experimental.

Histologic features of native and transplanted kidneys in Patient 1. (A) Renal arterioles of native kidney featured concentric intimal thickening greater than thickness of media and concentric elastic duplication (score = 5; Weigert stain — bar = 40 μm). (B) In the native renal artery several nerves were observed within the adventitia, especially in the area close to the tunica media; nerve diameter ranged from 26 to 121 μm (NFP stain — bar = 100 μm). (C) Evidence of GAP43-positive nerve sprouting was noted in native ganglions close to arterial anastomoses (GAP43 stain — bar = 40 μm). (D–F) In renal nerves of native kidneys, TH-positive sympathetic efferent fibres (D) were more numerous than CGRP-positive sympathetic afferent fibres (E) and NOS-positive parasympathetic fibres (F) (D, bar = 10 μm; E, bar = 5 μm; F, bar = 5 μm). (G) Few GAP43-positive nerve axons could be observed in the renal artery from kidney transplant, distal to arterial anastomosis (GAP43 stain — bar = 100 μm). (H) In transplant renal artery, nerves consisted only of TH-positive sympathetic efferent fibres (TH stain — bar = 10 μm). (Adventitial–medial borders are highlighted by arrows.)

Patient 3 was a 62-year-old woman who underwent kidney transplantation for chronic hypertension-related chronic renal failure in 2004 from a non-hypertensive donor. Hypertension persisted following transplantation; she died in 2015 due to bilateral bronchopneumonia associated with cardiac hypertrophy. At histological examination, it was found that native kidney was affected by severe chronic pyelonephritis with diffuse hypertensive vascular damage (score 5). Kidney transplant was found to harbour glomerulosclerosis and chronic pyelonephritis; concentric thickening in arteriolar intima was found to be greater than thickness of media (score 4). Nerve density in transplanted kidney was similar to that measured in the native kidney (mean nerve density in the innermost area = 4.81 ± 0.18 versus 4.22 ± 0.21 nerves/mm 2). All nerves stained positively for GAP43 (Figure 2 F).

### Clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients with IgA nephropathy and renal vasculitic lesions [^1155DCnB]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, more than half of the IgAN patients who presented to our hospital over a 6 year period had RVLs, more than reported by Pankhurst et al. who reported this condition in only 67 of 363 (18.5%) IgAN patients. Another retrospective cohort study from China found that 20.6% (194/944) of adult IgAN patients had renal arteriolar microangiopathic lesions (including endothelial cell swelling, subintimal edema, arteriolar thrombosis, fibrinoid necrosis, and arterial fibrous intimal thickening with concentric lamination). In contrast, Khalil et al. indicated that 53% (68/128) of IgAN patients presented with lesions characterized as thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), acute or organized, in renal arteries, and/or arterioles. The discrepancies among these studies might be due to different sample sizes, different study populations, and different definitions of RVL. For example, Pankhurst et al. did not include patients with segmental thrombosis, disruption of glomerular capillary loops, and crescent formation in the glomerulus. The definition of microangiopathic lesions in the study of Cai et al. emphasized endothelial, intimal, and subintimal lesions in the renal arterioles, and did not include cell necrosis in the capillary loops or crescent formation. However, our study paid more attention to pathologic changes of glomerular vasculitis.

### Significance of intrarenal vascular lesions in Ig A nephropathy prognosis [^114cLoik]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Vascular lesions are frequently observed in renal biopsy specimens from patients with IgAN. However, the prognostic significance of these lesions remains unclear. Our study indicates that arteriolar wall thickening and fibrous intimal thickening are associated with a reduced eGFR and increased UPCR. These lesions also correlated with the presence of global sclerosis and tubular atrophy, consistent with the findings of other studies. Notably, global sclerosis and high serum creatinine levels were observed and eventually lead to patients requiring dialysis, thereby suggesting the potential involvement of vasculopathies in the progression or prognosis of IgAN. Although our study was cross-sectional, the presence of these lesions implies the need for an aggressive treatment approach in affected patients.

The results indicate that vascular lesions are related to hypertension, and decreased eGFR aligns with the findings of other studies. While this association was also observed in the original Oxford cohort, it did not exhibit a significant relationship with kidney failure events, and as a result, vascular lesions were not included in the classification criteria. In our study, vascular lesions did not show a significant relationship with the occurrence of end-stage renal disease. Even when analyzed separately for arteriolar wall thickening and fibrous intimal thickening, no significant relationship was found. However, a case-control study by Huang et al. reported a significant relationship between the presence of vascular lesions and the transition to end-stage renal disease or death in patients with IgAN. The discrepancy in the results may be attributed to the relatively small number of cases in our study, which resulted in a limited number of endpoint events. Nonetheless, in our study, arterial wall thickening showed a marginally significant correlation with the endpoint, and we hypothesized that similar results could be obtained with an increased sample size and comprehensive eGFR follow-up data.

### Heterogeneous afferent arteriolopathy: a key concept for understanding blood pressure-dependent renal damage [^116vdvT6]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneous blood pressure–dependent renal damage

At the single nephron level, the autoregulatory system in the afferent arteriole maintains stable glomerular pressure despite fluctuations in systemic blood pressure. However, afferent arteriolopathy can disrupt this balance, leading to glomerular hypertension and/or ischemia. Disrupted autoregulation in the afferent arteriole exacerbates susceptibility to hypertensive renal damage; therefore, under conditions with dilated afferent arteriolopathy (Fig. 2, G2), even slight increases in systemic blood pressure can directly transmit pressure to the glomerulus, causing glomerular hypertension. Conversely, under conditions with narrowed afferent arteriolopathy (Fig. 2, G3), even normal systemic blood pressure levels can result in ischemic glomerular damage due to hypoperfusion. Given that both types of afferent arteriolopathy, namely dilated and narrowed, coexist in the kidney at varying rates, the overall impact of these vascular lesions depends on the interaction between systemic blood pressure and the prevalence of each afferent arteriolopathy type (Fig. 3). For example, even systolic blood pressure levels of 130 mmHg can induce glomerular damage in individuals with a higher prevalence of dilated afferent arteriolopathy, whereas systolic blood pressure levels of 120 mmHg can cause ischemic glomerular damage, a scenario often referred to as "normotensive ischemic acute renal failure".

### Ischaemic nephropathy secondary to atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis: clinical and histopathological correlates [^113FXU15]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Advanced renal artery stenosis (RAS) may cause progressive deterioration in renal function. We correlated the histopathological findings and clinical characteristics in selected patients with atherosclerotic RAS who underwent nephrectomy of their small kidneys for resistant renovascular hypertension.

Methods

We studied 62 patients who underwent nephrectomy of a small kidney for uncontrolled hypertension between 1990 and 2000.

Results

The mean patient age was 65.4 ± 9.6 years; 28 (45%) were men. Significant tubulointerstitial atrophy with relative glomerular sparing was the predominant pattern of injury in 44 (71%) patients. In 14 (23%) patients, diffuse global glomerulosclerosis was present. The severity of tubulointerstitial atrophy and the extent of glomerulosclerosis were both associated with smaller kidney size (P = 0.002). Three patterns of vascular involvement were present: atheroembolic, atherosclerotic and hypertensive vascular changes, which were documented in 39, 98 and 52% of subjects, respectively. The presence and severity of these vascular changes positively correlated with both atherosclerotic risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia and renal insufficiency, and cardiovascular morbidity, including abdominal aortic aneurysm and myocardial infarction. Patients on statin therapy were noted to have less evidence of renal fibrosis as measured by transforming growth factor-beta staining (P = 0.003).

Conclusion

The severity of renal histopathological findings in patients who underwent nephrectomy for resistant hypertension correlated with an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease, a greater degree of renal dysfunction and more severe dyslipidaemia. Statin therapy may affect development of intra-renal injury by slowing the progression of fibrosis.

### Impact of kidney function on stiffness of small conduit arteries in hypertension and obesity [^113VuPqg]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

All these mechanisms could explain, in our opinion, why the impact of CKD on radial stiffness is maximal and independent of blood pressure values only in ESRD.

In this study, we also observed that obesity-induced changes in the arterial geometry, namely hypertrophic outward remodeling, are present not only in large arteries but also in the small conduit arteries. Individuals affected by severe obesity tend to have increased total blood volume and a greater demand for blood flow, causing compensatory adaptation of the arteries to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. Flow-induced remodeling (inward vs. outward) depends on vasoregulation and smooth muscle cell activity, which regulate blood vessel diameter and respond to mechanical cues essential for extracellular matrix remodeling. This may lead to arterial outward remodeling to accommodate the increased blood volume and reduce vascular resistance, as wall shear stress decreases with luminal enlargement. Conversely, in hypertensive participants, the increased blood pressure leads to thickening of the arterial wall and inward remodeling to resist high pressures, as our study confirms too.

Until now, medium-sized arteries have not been extensively explored noninvasively, largely because of the limited spatial resolution of standard ultrasound machines. Consequently, the clinical implications of increased stiffness in radial arteries, and more broadly in small conduit arteries, are not fully understood but may offer valuable insights into vascular adaptations, remodeling, and modifications in wall ultrastructure associated with cardiovascular risk factors. Unlike large arteries, they share histological and functional similarities with coronary arteries, which are pivotal for understanding cardiovascular diseases. For example, in a longitudinal study performed in 416 patients with suspected CAD, referred to myocardial perfusion scintigraphy and followed up for about 3 years, radial IMT outperformed carotid IMT and was an independent predictor of cardiovascular events on top of classical risk factors.

Radial artery investigation may have an additional advantage compared to carotid artery, being easy to investigate even in the presence of higher BMI and larger neck circumference. Indeed, unlike previous studies, we were not able to show the expected significant increase in carotid stiffness with declining eGFR because of greater measurement dispersion compared to HT and C groups, despite a similar correlation coefficient. For this reason, in obese patients, the measurement of the radial artery may gain greater importance in the future, as a measure of arterial stiffness and its prognostic role will be crucial to investigate in longitudinal studies.

### Endovascular intervention in renovascular disease: a pictorial review [^112spGdW]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a narrowing of the renal arteries, often associated with renovascular hypertension and an increased risk of renal insufficiency. Atherosclerotic RAS constitutes 90% of RAS cases, increasing in prevalence in patients with diabetes, hypertension, aortoiliac occlusive disease, and coronary artery disease, as well as with age. Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) accounts for fewer than 10% of RAS cases. FMD occurs nine times more frequently in females than in males, tending to affect women aged 15 to 50.

Numerous physiologic and imaging-based modalities exist for the evaluation of patients with clinical suspicion of RAS. Generally, noninvasive evaluations by duplex ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or computed tomographic angiography (CTA) serve as initial diagnostic tools. Subsequent catheter-based angiography permits confirmation of the RAS, aetiology, extent of intrarenal vascular disease, as well as intervention planning. Contrast medium must be used cautiously in patients with renal failure given the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. Digital subtraction techniques may decrease the required contrast volume, thereby minimising impact on renal function.

RAS resulting from atherosclerotic disease typically involves the ostium and proximal third of the main renal artery (Fig. 1a). FMD refers to a collection of vascular diseases of the intima, media (90%), and adventitia (periarterial). RAS secondary to medial FMD is characterised by a beaded, aneurysmal appearance localised to the distal two-thirds of the renal artery and its branches (Fig. 2a), whereas intimal and periarterial FMD is commonly associated with progressive vessel dissection and thrombosis. Bilateral renal artery FMD is observed in greater than 35% of patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patient selection

Native and transplanted kidneys, with corresponding renal arteries and periadventitial tissue, from three kidney transplant recipients with post-transplant hypertension were selected for this study; clinical data of patients are reported in Table 1. All patients had received immunosuppressive treatment. Study patients underwent surgery for kidney transplantation in May 2014 (Patient 1), May 2012 (Patient 2) and April 2004 (Patient 3). Death occurred in November 2014 for Patient 1 (age 74 years; transplant-to-death interval = 5 months), in April 2014 for Patient 2 (age 54 years; transplant-to-death interval = 23 months) and in April 2015 for Patient 3 (age 62 years; transplant-to-death interval = 132 months).

Table 1
Patients' characteristics

Controls included four transplanted kidneys with no histological evidence of hypertensive arteriolar damage from non-hypertensive patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment.

All kidney transplants, surgical nephrectomies and autopsies were performed at the Tor Vergata University Hospital in Rome. Study procedures were approved by the Human Research Committee of the Tor Vergata University Hospital (authorization no. 54/14), and they were conducted in accordance with Italian regulations.

Histological protocol

Native and transplanted kidneys collected during the course of autopsies were immediately formalin-fixed and embedded in paraffin for histological evaluation. Kidneys were processed according to a previously reported protocol designed to evaluate nerve density. Briefly, each artery was sampled along its entire length from origin to renal hilum, together with surrounding periadventitial tissue; for each artery, a minimum of six specimens was collected at average intervals of 5 mm, and serially cut into 5-μm-thick sections. For each specimen, two sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and Weigert stain, respectively, while additional sections were obtained for immunohistochemical studies.

In addition, for each patient a kidney sample featuring both cortex and medulla was collected to evaluate hypertension-related histological changes. Burke et al. 's scoring system was used in order to evaluate hypertensive status, assessing 20 arterioles, 150–500 µm thick, per kidney sample. Median scores of 4 (i.e. concentric intimal thickening greater than the thickness of the media without concentric elastic duplication) or 5 (i.e. concentric intimal thickening greater than the thickness of the media with concentric elastic duplication in three or more vessels examined) were regarded as histological markers of hypertensive nephropathy.

Renal artery duplex ultrasonography — atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis contributes to resistant hypertension and may promote deterioration in renal function; patients with severe bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary functioning kidney are at risk for end-stage renal disease, and long-term survival requiring dialysis support is dismal; duplex ultrasonography is the ideal method of determining adequacy of renal artery revascularization, is helpful for detecting restenosis after endovascular therapy, includes spectral Doppler velocities from the renal arteries, renal parenchyma, and abdominal aorta, uses PSV and peak end-diastolic velocities in intrarenal branches to calculate the renal resistive index, and should define the pole-to-pole length of each kidney.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Renal artery stenosis — synopsis (epidemiology, thresholds, and evidence): Renal artery stenosis is a narrowing that can produce a hemodynamically significant restriction of renal blood flow, usually by > 75%. Atherosclerotic disease (90%) is the most common cause, whereas nonatherosclerotic disease — most commonly fibromuscular dysplasia — is less prevalent and occurs more often in younger, otherwise healthier patients with a predilection for women. Atherosclerotic renovascular disease may be present in 14% to 40% of adults with hypertension, but only a small fraction (0.1%-5%) is hemodynamically significant to result in renovascular hypertension. Trials comparing endovascular procedures with medical therapy showed no benefit over aggressive medical therapy alone in adults with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, although there may be benefit in subgroups such as those with progressively worsening kidney function or sudden onset of pulmonary edema. The absence of severe albuminuria is associated with better outcomes after endovascular renal artery stenosis interventions.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome and kidney disease [^114ge3qi]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

The antiphospholipid syndrome is a common autoimmune disease caused by pathogenic antiphospholipid antibodies, leading to recurrent thrombosis and/or obstetrical complications. Importantly for nephrologists, antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with various renal manifestations including large renal vessel thrombosis, renal artery stenosis, and a constellation of intrarenal lesions that has been termed antiphospholipid nephropathy. This last condition associates various degrees of acute thrombotic microangiopathy, proliferative and fibrotic lesions of the intrarenal vessels, and ischemic modifications of the renal parenchyma. The course of the disease can range from indolent nephropathy to devastating acute renal failure. The pejorative impact of antiphospholipid antibody-related renal complication is well established in the context of systemic lupus erythematous or after renal transplantation. In contrast, the exact significance of isolated antiphospholipid nephropathy remains uncertain. The evidence to guide management of the renal complications of antiphospholipid syndrome is limited. However, the recent recognition of the heterogeneous molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of intrarenal vascular lesions in antiphospholipid syndrome have opened promising tracks for patient monitoring and targeted therapeutic intervention.

### Hypertension in kidney transplantation is associated with an early renal nerve sprouting [^115cP4um]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Immunohistochemical analysis of renal nerves in native kidneys revealed a higher density of TH-positive sympathetic efferent fibres compared with CGRP-positive sympathetic afferent fibres and eNOS-positive parasympathetic fibres. Data regarding density of parasympathetic fibers, however, should be considered with caution, as several studies seem to suggest that NOS might be involved in the afferent neuronal system rather than the parasympathetic system. On the contrary, renal nerves in transplanted kidneys from both hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients consisted only of TH-positive sympathetic efferent fibres (Figures 1 D–F).

### Systemic sclerosis complicated with renal thrombotic microangiopathy: a case report and literature review [^11272HKJ]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Her pulmonary CT showed a small-sized pericardial effusion without obvious pulmonary interstitial change. Her heart echo showed pulmonary hypertension and her urinary ultrasound revealed decreased blood flow signal in both kidneys.

Renal, skin, and muscle biopsies were performed after her recovery from anemia and thrombocytopenia. Her skin biopsy showed reticulodermal keratosis, local basal cell proliferation, tpigmentation of the basal layer, disappearance of epidermal protrusion, proliferation of small blood vessels, and proliferation of collagen fiber in the superficial dermis. The above data met with pathology changes of scleroderma skin. Her muscle biopsy showed the pathology change of inflammatory myopathy. Her renal biopsy showed TMA changes in the kidney. The walls of the renal arterioles were thickened due to endothelial edema and endometrial fibrosis. The renal arterioles' lumen was diffusely narrow and occluded. The glomerulus capillary loops were diffusely narrow and the glomerulus showed diffused ischemia. Electron microscopy showed occlusion of the vascular lumen, widening of the basement membrane, and the diffused fusion of the foot process (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Stenosis and ischemia in glomerular capillary loops; moderately thickened vessels; edema endothelial, intimal thickening and occlusion in arteries (A, PAS; B, PASM; Magnification, × 400)

Her diagnoses were overlap syndrome of SSc, SLE and PM, and secondary TMA caused AKI. She was treated with glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 500 mg/day for 3 days, then prednisone with gradually tapered dose), rituximab 500 mg twice with 2 weeks' interval, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, and sildenafil. Also, she was administered emergency hemodialysis (HD) and plasma exchange (PE) for 9 times. After the above treatment, her anemia and thrombocytopenia were quickly recovered. Her sedimentation rate and complement became normal. However, her renal function did not recover and she was switched to peritoneal dialysis (PD) before discharge. At discharge, we added mycophenolate mofetil (250 mg twice per day) and hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice per day) to maintain the immunosuppressive treatment. Two months after being discharged, her serum creatinine decreased to 292 μmol/L and her urine volume increased to 1200 mL per day. Then, she stopped peritoneal dialysis. Her serum creatinine decreased to 109 μmol/L 8 months after her first admission.

In conclusion, despite its rarity, GPA should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses of solitary renal mass in patients without prior respiratory manifestations, irrespective of their ANCA status. Severe narrowing due to neointimal thickening of the artery may worsen the injury of vasculitis in the localized area through endothelial ischemia, resulting in a renal mass. Patients with a solitary renal mass associated with GPA may show a favorable response to steroid or immunosuppressive treatment, even after nephrectomy.

Arteriolar medial thickening, small arterial intimal thickening, and renal outcomes

There is no clear evidence suggesting that arteriolar medical thickening is responsible for CKD progression. However, small arterial intimal thickening has been associated with an increased risk of composite renal outcomes (30% decline in eGFR or renal replacement therapy) in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Severe arterial intimal thickening is associated with worse renal outcomes in patients with diabetic nephropathy and those with IgA nephropathy. Moreover, arteriolosclerosis lesions involving arterial intimal fibrosis and arteriolar hyalinosis are correlated with composite renal outcomes (a 50% eGFR decline and ESRD) in patients with IgA nephropathy.

Heterogeneous afferent arteriolopathy and heterogeneous glomerular morphology

In patients with nephrosclerosis, glomerular sizes and volumes varied widely among glomeruli throughout the kidney (Fig. 1). Laragh et al. indicated the existence of two functionally abnormal nephron populations in the whole kidney of individuals with essential hypertension: ischemic nephrons and adapting hyperfiltrating normal nephrons. Ischemic nephrons are attributed to narrowed afferent arterioles. Tracy et al. revealed that focal intimal fibroplasia associated with blood pressure may be responsible for the heterogeneous pattern of ischemic glomeruli. Hill et al. showed a wide distribution in both the afferent arteriole's lumen diameter and glomerular size in elderly individuals. The rate of swollen glomeruli accompanied by a large lumen diameter in the afferent arteriole is comparable to that of smaller glomeruli accompanied by a small lumen diameter. Moreover, in patients with hypertension, the rate of smaller glomeruli accompanied by a lower lumen diameter in the afferent arteriole is relatively high. Elevated perfusion pressure leads to an increase in glomerular volume. Accordingly, swollen glomeruli are considered to reflect glomerular hypertension. In an autopsy study, glomerular volume in the juxtamedullary cortex tended to be larger than that in the superficial cortex, accompanied by a significantly higher arteriolar hyalinosis score in diabetic patients. Therefore, it has been suggested that glomeruli suffering from glomerular hypertension in association with arteriolar hyalinosis exist heterogeneously in the kidney. Previous research involving models of aging and hypertension revealed that juxtamedullary nephrons are larger than superficial nephrons and that a greater proportion of proteinuria originates from the former. A study involving a diabetic model rat demonstrated a heterogeneous pattern of absorbed albumin in the tubules, with the rate of such findings increasing with albuminuria. These results may account for heterogeneous glomerular hypertension. In studies examining normal lesions in kidneys with renal cell carcinoma, swollen glomeruli were found to coexist with collapsed glomeruli. Given that collapsed glomeruli occur due to hypoperfusion, these findings suggest that glomerular hypertension and ischemia coexist throughout the kidney. Collectively, the abovementioned findings suggest that heterogeneity in afferent arteriolopathy, consisting of dilated and narrowed lumens, and in small arterial intimal thickening with narrowed lumens, may result in a heterogeneous distribution of hypertension-affected and ischemic glomeruli.

Clinical importance of arteriosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis

Hyalinosis and renal outcomes

Renal arteriolar hyalinosis has been associated with adverse renal outcomes across various clinical settings. In patients with diabetes, hyalinosis was linked to the development of albuminuria, rapid decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), incidental CKD, and ESRD. Similarly, in patients with IgA nephropathy, hyalinosis was associated with substantial declines in eGFR (30% or 50%) and progression to ESRD. In renal transplant recipients, hyalinosis was correlated with long-term graft function and graft loss. Furthermore, arteriolar damage, defined by the presence of arteriolar hyalinosis and medial wall thickening, was associated with poor renal survival in patients with lupus nephritis.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Renal artery stenosis — pathophysiology and epidemiology are summarized as a narrowing of the renal artery that can result in a hemodynamically significant restriction of blood flow, usually by ≥ 75%. Atherosclerotic disease (90%) is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis, whereas nonatherosclerotic disease, of which fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common, is much less prevalent and tends to occur in younger, otherwise healthier patients with a predilection for women. Atherosclerotic renovascular disease may be present in 1% to 40% of adults with hypertension; however, only a small fraction (0.1%–5%) is considered to be hemodynamically significant to result in renovascular hypertension. Although randomized trials suggested no benefit of revascularization over aggressive medical therapy in unselected adults with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, there may be benefit in certain subgroups, including those with progressively worsening kidney function or sudden onset of pulmonary edema, and the absence of severe albuminuria is associated with better outcomes after endovascular renal artery stenosis interventions.

### Renal vascular changes in renal disease independent of hypertension [^116cy8KT]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease is common in patients with renal disease, but little is known about the effect of renal disease and loss of renal function on vascular morphology. Intima proliferation of small renal arteries, which correlates with atherosclerosis in the aorta, is sometimes present in renal disease and has been shown to increase with age and hypertension. We studied the effect of chronic renal disease and renal function, independent of hypertension, on intima proliferation.

Methods

We retrospectively selected renal biopsies of subjects in whom a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement with [(125)I] iothalamate had been performed. To separate the effects of renal disease and renal function, we selected biopsies from (A) normotensive controls undergoing nephrectomy because of renal carcinomas; (B) normotensive patients with renal disease and GFR > 90 ml/min; (C) normotensive patients with GFR 30–90 ml/min, and (D) hypertensive patients with a GFR < 90 ml/min. The area of the arteriolar lumen, intima, and media were measured.

Results

No significant changes from control subjects were observed in group B. Intima proliferation was observed when renal function declined (intima/total vessel surface ratio was 0.262 ± 0.071 in group C, 0.192 ± 0.032 in group A, and 0.205 ± 0.035 in group B, P < 0.05). The intima proliferation was aggravated in patients with renal insufficiency and hypertension (0.333 ± 0.121, P < 0.05). Media surface area was not different between groups.

Conclusion

Renal disease with preserved GFR does not cause significant intima proliferation of small renal arteries. Loss of renal function is accompanied by intima proliferation, even in the absence of systemic hypertension.

### A case of renovascular hypertension due to polyarteritis nodosa [^117Ts7uW]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

In renal vasculitis, luminal narrowing can reduce blood flow and activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, causing renovascular hypertension. We present the case of a 47-year-old man with previous intestinal tuberculosis and episodes of lumbar pain, tender erythematous nodules and arthralgias. He had grade 3 hypertension, unresponsive to treatment, with left ventricular concentric hypertrophy and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU due to a hypertensive emergency, with acute kidney failure and a large peri-renal hematoma. The computed tomography and angiography showed bilateral renal scarring, intrarenal pseudoaneurysms and irregularities in the renal, common hepatic and mesenteric arteries, suggesting a medium-vessel vasculitis, namely polyarteritis nodosa. Cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids were started. His blood pressure was controlled, and his kidney function remained stable. Renovascular hypertension is, in infrequent cases, caused by an inflammatory systemic disease. When this is the case, the diagnosis must be considered and appropriately addressed.

### Histologic and morphologic character of pediatric renal artery occlusive disease [^112o9SRb]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The pathologic nature of pediatric renal artery occlusive lesions causing renovascular hypertension has been the subject of numerous anecdotal reports. This study was undertaken to define the character of childhood renal artery stenoses. A better understanding of this disease is particularly germane, given its unknown etiology and the limited success of certain contemporary treatment options.

Methods

Renal artery specimens obtained during open operations in children being treated for renovascular hypertension from 2004 to 2016 were studied. Excluded from study were arteries subjected to earlier open or endovascular operations. Histologic preparations employing hematoxylin-eosin, Movat, Masson trichrome, and Verhoeff-van Gieson stains allowed characterization of the intima, media, and adventitial tissues. External and luminal diameters were measured. Microscopic data were correlated with preoperative arteriographic images. The histologic and morphologic findings were assessed in regard to coexistent nonrenal arterial and aortic lesions as well as known syndromic diseases.

Results

Thirty-three stenotic renal arteries from 28 children were subjected to examination. Stenoses involved the proximal-ostial renal arteries (24), central renal arteries (7), and distal segmental renal arteries (2). Ostial stenoses commonly exhibited preocclusive concentric hyperplasia of intimal tissues, frequent internal elastic lamina disruptions, and diminutive and discontinuous media. Central and distal renal stenoses most often exhibited lesser intimal cellular hyperplasia and more noticeable fibrodysplasia of the media and adventitia. The mean external and luminal diameters of the renal arteries having ostial stenoses were smaller than the expected renal artery size for a given age. Abdominal aortic coarctation or hypoplastic aortas occurred in 14 children. Neurofibromatosis type 1 affected four children with ostial renal artery disease and one child with midrenal artery disease, but there were no distinguishing features unique to their stenoses.

Conclusions

Pediatric renal artery stenotic disease affects exceedingly small arteries. Ostial lesions frequently exhibit extensive luminal encroachments characterized by cellular hyperplasia of intimal tissues and scant medial smooth muscle. Central and distal renal arterial stenoses were characterized most often by extensive fibrodysplasia of the media and adventitia. The early success and durability of catheter-based angioplasty may be compromised by the cellular abnormalities of pediatric renal artery occlusive disease observed in this investigation.

### Retinal arteriolar narrowing, hypertension, and subsequent risk of diabetes mellitus… [^112WRgYn]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Participants with both hypertension and retinal arteriolar narrowing had a 3-fold higher risk of incident diabetes than normotensive participants without arteriolar narrowing. Conclusions Retinal arteriolar narrowing is related to risk of incident diabetes. These data suggest a possible link between systemic arteriolar narrowing associated with hypertension and diabetes development. Histopathologically, the retinal arterioles undergo a series of pathophysiological changes in response to elevated blood pressure. 20 Initially, arteriolar narrowing reflects an active vasoconstriction phase secondary to local autoregulatory mechanisms. Persistently elevated blood pressure leads to intimal thickening, media wall hyperplasia, and hyaline degeneration in the arteriolar walls.

It has previously been demonstrated that retinal arteriolar narrowing, assessed from photographs, is related not only to concurrently measured blood pressure10, 15, 21 but also to blood pressure measured 6 to 8 years previously, 10, 21 suggesting an association with chronic hypertension. In addition, independent of blood pressure, retinal arteriolar narrowing has been associated with systemic markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.
11. 23, 24 These changes have been further hypothesized to be related to abnormalities in the capillary and arteriolar endothelium, which is in contact with metabolically active, insulin-sensitive tissues such as skeletal muscles. 25 Endothelial dysfunction and impaired nitric oxide–mediated vasodilatation have been further hypothesized. Our study provides new insights into the relationship of hypertension and risk of type 2 diabetes.

We demonstrated that elevated blood pressure was independently associated with risk of incident diabetes, consistent with findings of other studies. 7–9 Furthermore, preexisting hypertension and narrowed arterioles appear to be associated with a risk of diabetes that is greater than the effect of either factor alone. If there is selective misclassification of diabetes at baseline in which the diabetic participants are mislabeled as nondiabetic and have narrower arterioles, this might partly account for our findings. In conclusion, data from this population-based study show a prospective association of retinal arteriolar narrowing and hypertension with incident diabetes, independent of known risk factors. These data suggest that arteriolar narrowing, possibly related to chronic hypertension, may be associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. If this finding is supported by further studies, microvascular disease may be a potential target for diabetes prevention.

Renovascular disease (RVD) is a major cause of secondary hypertension. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common type of RVD followed by fibromuscular dysplasia. It has long been recognized as the prototype of angiotensin-dependent hypertension. However, the mechanisms underlying the physiopathology of hypertensive occlusive vascular renal disease are complex and distinction between the different causes of RVD should be made. Recognition of these distinct types of RVD with different degrees of renal occlusive disease is important for management. The greatest challenge is to individualize and implement the best approach for each patient in the setting of widely different comorbidities.
