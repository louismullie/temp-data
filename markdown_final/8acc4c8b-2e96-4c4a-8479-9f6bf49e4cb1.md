## Question

Can a seizure cause a lactate of 10.7?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a seizure can cause a serum lactate of 10.7 mmol/L and how to interpret that value in context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about baseline definitions for hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of lactate generation during seizures and status epilepticus. Next, I will review direct clinical evidence linking seizures to marked lactate elevations. After that, I need to assess whether a value around 10.7 mmol/L is physiologically and clinically plausible post-seizure. I should also consider alternative and artifactual causes of elevated lactate and how to distinguish transient postictal lactatemia from persistent or type B etiologies. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer with practical interpretive and follow-up steps, making sure I double-check that each claim is supported by the literature.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical thresholds so I am not anchoring on the wrong definition: normal venous lactate is generally less than 2 mmol/L, hyperlactatemia is typically defined as greater than 2 mmol/L, and lactic acidosis is most often defined as lactate greater than 4 mmol/L with pH less than 7.35; by those standards, a level of 10.7 mmol/L represents severe hyperlactatemia and would meet lactic acidosis criteria if accompanied by acidemia, which I should verify from the blood gas before concluding anything further.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions until I review seizure physiology: generalized convulsions and status epilepticus drive dramatic increases in cerebral and systemic metabolic demand; when oxygen delivery lags, anaerobic glycolysis predominates, generating lactate consistent with type A hyperlactatemia, and sustained convulsive activity beyond about 30 minutes is associated with cerebral metabolic decompensation, which further amplifies lactate production; microdialysis and neurometabolic studies also show seizure-associated rises in lactate, lactate/pyruvate ratio, and excitotoxic glutamate, and the epileptogenic hippocampus can show high interictal lactate and impaired glucose utilization, all reinforcing the biological plausibility of sizable lactate elevations during and after seizures [^114fnbUA] [^116kvqZe] [^114Sh7aD] [^114aB9uS].

> Next, I should review direct clinical evidence so I am not relying on mechanism alone: case reports describe severe lactic acidosis immediately following clusters of generalized tonic–clonic seizures with spontaneous resolution after supportive care, and observational cohorts in status epilepticus document that a substantial fraction of patients exhibit acid–base disorders driven in part by lactate production; moreover, in mitochondrial-related status epilepticus, elevated blood lactate is frequently observed at onset and increases with disease progression, which triangulates the association between seizures and lactate elevation across different clinical contexts [^112qd44q] [^114EkykH] [^112eUBED].

> Hmm, wait a minute — do brief seizures commonly drive lactate to 10.7 mmol/L? My first instinct is to say that seems too high for a single short event, but let me verify against patterns seen in convulsive status and clustered generalized tonic–clonic seizures: levels in the 8–12 mmol/L range are entirely plausible during or immediately after prolonged convulsive activity, particularly with hypoventilation, transient hypoxia, or repeated seizures without full recovery; severity can be accentuated by underlying mitochondrial disease such as MELAS, where seizure activity superimposes on impaired oxidative phosphorylation, so 10.7 mmol/L is physiologically credible in those scenarios and should prompt a careful look at seizure burden, respiratory status, and any coexisting cytopathies [^114fnbUA] [^117LMy8E] [^112sZ6Ve].

> I should double-check distinguishing features and the differential so I do not misattribute the elevation: postictal lactate driven by convulsions often declines quickly, typically normalizing within roughly an hour as perfusion and ventilation recover; persistence beyond that window should make me reconsider ongoing convulsive or nonconvulsive status, occult hypoperfusion/ischemia, or type B causes such as impaired clearance and mitochondrial dysfunction; medications like metformin and beta-agonists can contribute to type B hyperlactatemia, and hepatic dysfunction limits lactate metabolism, while artifactual elevations can occur in ethylene glycol poisoning due to assay interference, in which a "lactate gap" between analyzers is a key diagnostic clue I need to check before concluding true lactic acidosis [^112qd44q] [^116kvqZe] [^1171xQPt] [^115L1fYa] [^117YEph4] [^113SNbVX].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit: yes, a seizure can cause a lactate of 10.7 mmol/L, and this magnitude is most consistent with prolonged generalized convulsive activity or closely spaced seizures, potentially compounded by transient hypoxia or underlying mitochondrial disease; importantly, in straightforward postictal states the elevation is usually transient and should downtrend rapidly with seizure control and supportive care, so if the lactate remains markedly elevated or the pH remains low, I should promptly reassess for ongoing seizures, hypoperfusion, toxicologic or medication-induced type B causes, or analytic artifact, and repeat lactate after stabilization to document the expected decline before closing the loop on etiology [^112qd44q] [^114EkykH] [^116kvqZe].

---

A lactate of 10.7 mmol/L following a seizure is most often due to **postictal anaerobic glycolysis** from intense muscle activity and transient hypoxia [^112qd44q]; it typically normalizes within 1–2 hours with supportive care. Persistent or recurrent hyperlactatemia warrants evaluation for **mitochondrial disorders** (e.g. MELAS [^112sZ6Ve], POLG [^112eUBED] [^notfound]), metabolic crises, or drug/toxin exposures (e.g. metformin [^1171xQPt], propylene glycol [^114HFkrA]). Management is **supportive** — secure the airway, provide oxygen, control seizures, correct acidosis, and treat underlying causes [^114fnbUA]; hemodialysis is indicated for metformin or propylene glycol toxicity. Prognosis is generally favorable if lactate normalizes quickly [^112qd44q]; **persistent elevation** signals higher risk of complications and mortality [^1134BsJv].

---

## Pathophysiology of lactic acidosis in seizures

Lactic acidosis in seizures arises from **increased anaerobic glycolysis** during intense muscle activity and transient hypoxia [^112qd44q]; lactate typically normalizes within 1–2 hours postictally.

---

## Clinical significance of lactate level 10.7 mmol/L

A lactate of 10.7 mmol/L represents **severe hyperlactatemia** and reflects significant anaerobic metabolism [^1134BsJv]; transient elevations after seizures usually resolve with supportive care [^112qd44q], whereas persistent elevation suggests ongoing hypoxia, mitochondrial dysfunction, or metabolic derangement [^116kvqZe].

---

## Differential diagnosis for persistent lactic acidosis after seizures

Persistent lactic acidosis after seizures requires evaluation for:

- **Mitochondrial disorders**: MELAS, POLG-related disease, lipoic acid synthetase deficiency [^112sZ6Ve] [^112eUBED] [^114wWFdo].
- **Metabolic crises**: Inborn errors of metabolism, thiamine deficiency [^1158q6QZ] [^1115jFrL].
- **Drug/toxin-induced lactic acidosis**: Metformin [^1171xQPt], propylene glycol, beta-agonists [^114HFkrA] [^113ToUzS].
- **Sepsis or shock**: Ongoing tissue hypoperfusion or hypoxia [^1134BsJv] [^116kvqZe].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** includes [^115RbJd4]:

- **Clinical assessment**: History, exam, and review of medications/toxins [^115cHVD3].
- **Laboratory tests**: Serial lactate, ABG, electrolytes, renal/hepatic function, glucose, ammonia, and metabolic panels [^116kvqZe].
- **Imaging**: MRI/MRS for mitochondrial disease; CT/MRI for structural lesions [^113hKMoA].
- **Genetic testing**: For suspected mitochondrial or metabolic disorders [^111erx6T].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on:

- **Supportive care**: Airway, oxygen, fluids, and seizure control [^114fnbUA].
- **Correction of acidosis**: Sodium bicarbonate for severe acidosis (pH < 7.1) [^1134BsJv].
- **Treatment of underlying causes**: Anticonvulsants, antibiotics for sepsis, and specific therapies for metabolic disorders [^1158q6QZ].
- **Hemodialysis**: For metformin or propylene glycol toxicity.

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis depends on the cause, duration, and response [^1134BsJv]. Transient postictal lactate elevations usually resolve without sequelae [^112qd44q], but persistent lactic acidosis increases the risk of **neurological injury**, organ dysfunction, and mortality.

---

A lactate of 10.7 mmol/L following a seizure is **typically transient** and resolves with supportive care [^112qd44q]; persistent elevation **requires evaluation** for mitochondrial, metabolic, or toxic causes, and management should be tailored to the underlying etiology [^116kvqZe].

### Status epilepticus in POLG disease: A large multinational study [^112eUBED]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Biochemical, electroencephalogram, and neuroimaging findings reveal that laboratory investigations in individuals with status epilepticus (SE) show increased lactate levels in the blood in 41% of cases (n = 24/58) and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 38% of cases (n = 16/24) at disease onset. During the disease progression, increased lactate was observed in 68% (n = 47/69) and 62% (n = 20/32) of cases, respectively. Aspartate and alanine aminotransferases were elevated in 29% (n = 20/70) and 23% (n = 18/78) at disease onset, escalating to 81% (n = 67/83) and 77% (n = 69/87) later in the disease. Approximately one-third (n = 21/72, 29%) of SE patients exhibited a pathologically low hemoglobin value at disease onset, and anemia developed in most patients (n = 60/74, 81%) as the disease progressed. CSF protein or albumin levels were elevated in more than two-thirds (n = 44/61, 72%) at disease onset and in 83% (n = 30/36) later on.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) findings predominantly indicated epileptiform activity over the occipital lobes (n = 55/83, 66%), followed by the temporal lobes (n = 33/83, 40%), parietal lobes (n = 24/83, 29%), and frontal lobes (n = 18/83, 22%). Multifocal activity was noted in 22% of cases (n = 18/83). EEG data were not available for 17% of patients (n = 14/83).

The available brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) indicated abnormalities in 64% (n = 55/86) of patients at the onset of SE. The most prevalent MRI finding, in 67% of cases (n = 55/77), was cortical focal lesions (CFLs) presenting as T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in cortical and subcortical regions. Less frequent findings included T2-hyperintense thalamic lesions (n = 36/77, 47%) and generalized cerebral atrophy (n = 10/30, 33%). A description of MRI findings is provided.

### Lipoic acid synthetase deficiency causes neonatal-onset epilepsy, defective mitochondrial energy metabolism, and glycine elevation [^114wWFdo]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Lipoic acid is an essential prosthetic group of four mitochondrial enzymes involved in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate, branched chain amino acids, and in the glycine cleavage. Lipoic acid is synthesized stepwise within mitochondria through a process that includes lipoic acid synthetase. We identified the homozygous mutation c.746G > A (p. Arg249His) in LIAS in an individual with neonatal-onset epilepsy, muscular hypotonia, lactic acidosis, and elevated glycine concentration in plasma and urine. Investigation of the mitochondrial energy metabolism showed reduced oxidation of pyruvate and decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity. A pronounced reduction of the prosthetic group lipoamide was found in lipoylated proteins.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^1134BsJv]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Unbalanced lactate production or consumption leads to elevated lactate levels, known as hyperlactatemia (lactate > 2 mmol/L). Lactic acidosis is defined by a serum lactate > 4 mmol/L and pH < 7.35. Hyperlactatemia can be further subdivided based on the etiology of the elevated lactate level. Type A hyperlactatemia includes states of dysoxia and decreased tissue perfusion, as seen in shock, significant anemia, and severe hypoxia. Type B hyperlactatemia broadly encompasses disorders of oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondria, such as sepsis, ineffective lactate clearance in the liver, and congenital inborn errors of metabolism. Septic shock is a common cause of hyperlactatemia in critically ill patients encountered in the ED. Hypotension leads to increased anaerobic glycolysis (type A) and decreased hepatic clearance of lactate. Acidemia also shunts excess pyruvate towards lactate production and prevents lactate from entering the Cori cycle for gluconeogenesis. Sepsis can cause significant hyperlactatemia in the absence of hypoperfusion through accelerated glycolysis in the absence of hypotension (type B).

A 45-year-old alcoholic man presented following several short grand-mal seizures. He was not known to be epileptic. Initial investigations demonstrated severe lactic acidosis, with the rise in lactate being one of the highest levels reported in similar patients. The patient recovered within four hours of management with oxygen, fluids, and sodium bicarbonate. Lactic acidosis following convulsions is often associated with spontaneous resolution and a favorable outcome.

### Phenotypic analysis of epilepsy in the mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes-associated mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation [^112sZ6Ve]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

The A to G mitochondrial DNA point mutation at position 3243 (A3243G) is the most common cause of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS), a systemic multiorgan disease. Epilepsy is a common finding, but there is wide phenotypic variation that has not been thoroughly explored. We report the epilepsy phenotypes of seven patients with the A3243G mutation. Most presented with typical MELAS and epilepsy characterized by infrequent prolonged focal seizures, including epilepsia partialis continua, hemiclonic status epilepticus, nonconvulsive status, and occipital status epilepticus. Seizures usually occurred during the acute phase of a strokelike episode. Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges may be seen electrographically. Some patients with this mutation are completely asymptomatic or have mild symptoms typical for mitochondrial diseases. Slow spike-wave activity consistent with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and electrographic status epilepticus was seen in one patient who responded to ethosuximide.

WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

- **Postmarketing cases**: Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by non-specific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years or older, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g. acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

- **Risk reduction and management**: Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high-risk groups are provided in the full prescribing information [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 and 2.4), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

### Effect of hyperventilation on extracellular concentrations of glutamate, lactate, pyruvate, and local cerebral blood flow in patients with severe traumatic brain injury [^111LCfLK]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The objective was to determine the potential adverse effects of brief periods of hyperventilation commonly used for acute neurologic deterioration.

- **Design**: Prospective clinical trial.
- **Setting**: University medical school.
- **Patients**: Twenty patients with severe traumatic brain injury.
- **Interventions**: The effect of 30 minutes of hyperventilation (mean PaCO2, 24.6 mm Hg) on the extracellular metabolites associated with ischemia and on local cerebral blood flow was studied using microdialysis and local cerebral blood flow techniques. Normal appearing brain adjacent to evacuated hemorrhagic contusions or underlying evacuated subdural hematomas was studied. Hyperventilation trials were conducted 24–36 hours after injury and again at 3–4 days post-injury. Dialysate concentrations of glutamate, lactate, and pyruvate were measured before and for 4 hours after the hyperventilation trials.

Measurements and main results indicated that at 24–36 hours, hyperventilation led to a ≥ 10% increase in the extracellular concentrations of glutamate in 14 of 20 patients. Concentrations in those 14 patients were 13.7–395% above baseline, with a ≥ 10% increase in lactate in 7 of 20 patients (11.6–211% above baseline), and a ≥ 10% increase in the lactate/pyruvate ratio in 8 of 20 patients (10.8–227% above baseline). At 3–4 days post-injury, ten of 13 patients exhibited an increase in glutamate of ≥ 10%, while only three of 13 patients had an increase in extracellular lactate, and two of 13 patients had an increase in the lactate/pyruvate ratio of this magnitude.

### Excitotoxicity and metabolic crisis are associated with spreading depolarizations in severe traumatic brain injury patients [^113SWaVs]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

Cerebral microdialysis has enabled the clinical characterization of excitotoxicity (glutamate > 10 μM) and non-ischemic metabolic crisis (lactate/pyruvate ratio [LPR] > 40) as important components of secondary damage in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Spreading depolarizations (SD) are pathological waves that occur in many patients in the days following TBI and, in animal models, cause elevations in extracellular glutamate, increased anaerobic metabolism, and energy substrate depletion.

Here, we examined the association of SD with changes in cerebral neurochemistry by placing a microdialysis probe alongside a subdural electrode strip in the peri-lesional cortex of 16 TBI patients requiring neurosurgery. In 107 hours (median; range: 76–117 hours) of monitoring, 135 SDs were recorded in six patients. Glutamate (50 μmol/L) and lactate (3.7 mmol/L) were significantly elevated on day 0 in patients with SD compared with subsequent days and with patients without SD, whereas pyruvate was decreased in the latter group on days 0 and 1 (two-way analysis of variance [ANOVA], p values 10 μmol/L and > 40 μmol/L, respectively).

Taken together with previous studies, these preliminary clinical results suggest SDs.

### Postictal transient hyperammonemia [^1134JaPR]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

We report cases of several patients who were sent to our hospital because of seizure attacks. Transient hyperammonemia was noted.

### Cerebrospinal fluid findings in patients with neurological manifestations in post-COVID-19 syndrome [^114NoabQ]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate levels were examined in patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome. Only one patient exhibited slightly increased levels of CSF L-lactate at 2.7 mmol/L. A white cell count (WCC) of 1 cell/µL indicated that neutrophil pleocytosis was not the cause of the elevated CSF L-lactate. The patient also had elevated CSF glucose levels at 6.8 mmol/L and increased CSF total protein (TP) levels at 51 mg/dL without blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCB) disruption. In contrast to CSF TP values, CSF L-lactate levels did not exhibit a statistically significant relationship to the albumin quotient (QAlb) in regression analysis (r = 0.188, r² = 0.035, p = 0.089, n = 83).

### Metformin-induced lactic acidosis (MILA): Review of current diagnostic paradigm [^115T57Ka]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A new diagnostic paradigm has been proposed to better categorize causes of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA). The diagnostic criteria define a link between metformin and lactic acidosis if lactate is greater than 5 mmol/L and the pH is less than 7.35. Metformin assays are not readily available in emergency departments, including nationwide Veteran's Affairs Hospitals, thereby making this proposed classification tool difficult to use in today's clinical practice.

We describe a case report of a 45-year-old male who took twice the amount of metformin prescribed and presented with metformin-induced lactic acidosis. According to the new criterion, our case would be classified as "lactic acidosis in metformin-treated patients (LAMT)". However, the term LAMT does not distinguish between a septic patient taking metformin with lactic acidosis and a patient who ingested toxic amounts of metformin and has lactic acidosis in the absence of a metformin assay.

Our case highlights the importance of medication reconciliation done upon arrival at the emergency department. Timing and dosing of metformin in patients who present to the emergency department with lactic acidosis may cinch the diagnosis of metformin-induced lactic acidosis (MILA) in the absence of a metformin assay, but in the right clinical context.

### L-lactic acidosis: Pathophysiology, classification, and causes; emphasis on biochemical and metabolic basis [^116kvqZe]. Kidney International (2020). Low credibility.

L-lactic acidosis (L-LA) is the most common cause of metabolic acidosis in the critical care setting, which has been associated with a large increase in mortality. The purpose of this article is to provide clinicians with an overview of the biochemical and metabolic background required to understand the different pathophysiological mechanisms that may lead to the development of L-LA.

We propose a classification based on whether the pathophysiology of L-LA is due predominantly to increased production or decreased removal of L-lactic acid. In this article, we provide an overview of the biochemical and metabolic aspects of glucose oxidation, the production and removal of L-lactic acid, and a discussion of the pathophysiology of the various causes of L-LA.

### Acute metformin overdose: Examining serum pH, lactate level, and metformin concentrations in survivors versus nonsurvivors: A systematic review of the literature [^115YFg1N]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is known to cause potentially fatal metabolic acidosis with an increased lactate level in both overdose and therapeutic use. However, no association between mortality and serum pH, lactate level, or metformin concentrations has yet been described. This systematic literature review is designed to evaluate the association between mortality and serum pH, lactate level, and metformin concentrations in acute metformin overdose.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the literature using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and TOXNET databases for cases of metformin overdose with documented mortality data and values of serum pH, lactate level, and metformin concentrations. When available, patient age, sex, and whether they received intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy or hemodialysis were also analyzed. Cases meeting inclusion criteria were analyzed to determine whether a difference existed in the distribution of nadir serum pH, peak serum lactate level, or peak serum metformin concentrations between overdose survivors and nonsurvivors.

- **Results**: We identified 10 articles with one or more cases that met our inclusion criteria. In total, there were 22 cases of metformin overdose (5/22 died) that met inclusion criteria. No intentional overdose patients died with a serum pH nadir greater than 6.9, a maximum lactate concentration less than 25 mmol/L, or a maximum metformin concentration less than 50 μg/mL (therapeutic range 1 to 2 μg/mL). Intentional overdose patients with a nadir serum pH less than 6.9 had 83% mortality (5/6).

### Autosomal dominant transmission of transient neonatal lactic acidosis: A case report [^114sb6FH]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a common finding in neonates, often occurring secondary to tissue hypoperfusion, respiratory failure, and/or sepsis. In contrast, primary (non-physiological) lactic acidosis, which suggests an inborn error of mitochondrial energy metabolism, is comparatively rare. Optimal medical management and accurate prognostication require the correct determination of the etiology of lactic acidosis in a given patient. However, genetic diagnoses are rare and highly variable for neonates presenting with primary lactic acidosis. Individual case reports may offer the most promise for treatment considerations.

The mitochondrion incorporates the products of more than 1000 distinct nuclear genes, making lactic acidoses characterized by high genetic heterogeneity. A specific genetic diagnosis remains out of reach in most cases. Most mitochondriopathies with neonatal onset follow autosomal recessive inheritance and carry a poor prognosis. Here, we detail the case of a father and daughter with dominantly-inherited, resolving (i.e. transient) neonatal hyperlactatemia due to complex IV deficiency. We found no other published descriptions of benign transient complex IV deficiency with autosomal dominant inheritance.

- **Case presentation**: Both individuals presented as neonates with unexplained, marked lactic acidosis, suggesting a primary mitochondrial disorder. Within the first weeks of life, elevated blood lactate levels normalized. Their clinical and developmental outcomes were normal.

### L-arginine in mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes: A systematic review [^113PjtHy]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Safety of IV-arginine**: In response to IV-arginine, five articles (three case reports/case series, one cohort, and one open-label) specifically reported no associated adverse events (AEs) related to therapy. While the reporting of AEs was absent in all remaining case reports, AEs were reported in two open-label trials. Moderate AEs reported by Koga et al. included fever (n = 5), decreased hematocrit (n = 3), hemoglobinuria (n = 3), bleeding at the injection site (n = 1), and epilepsy (n = 1). Deterioration in clinical status also occurred in one patient, which was attributed by the authors to the patient being prone to seizures. Two patients also developed a headache when arginine was infused too rapidly.

- **Oral-arginine**: Nasopharyngitis was the most common AE in patients on prophylactic oral-arginine (n = 10). Seven episodes of severe AEs were reported in patients on prophylactic oral-arginine, including drug hypersensitivity; increased aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and creatine phosphokinase; metabolic acidosis; arrhythmias; and volvulus. All AEs resolved upon discontinuation of oral-arginine. Three patients discontinued oral treatment in a 2-year open-label trial due to increased frequency of seizures (n = 1), pneumonia (n = 1), and unverified efficacy (n = 1). Of the five patients treated acutely with oral-arginine, emesis occurred in a single patient.

- **Mortality (IV and oral-arginine)**: Eleven (12%) of all 91 patients treated with arginine (both oral and IV) died during follow-up or while on prophylactic therapy.

### Extracellular metabolites in the cortex and hippocampus of epileptic patients [^114aB9uS]. Annals of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Interictal brain energy metabolism and glutamate-glutamine cycling are impaired in epilepsy and may contribute to seizure generation. We used the zero-flow microdialysis method to measure the extracellular levels of glutamate, glutamine, and the major energy substrates — glucose and lactate — in the epileptogenic and the non-epileptogenic cortex and hippocampus of 38 awake epileptic patients during the interictal period. Depth electrodes attached to microdialysis probes were used to identify the epileptogenic and the non-epileptogenic sites. The epileptogenic hippocampus had surprisingly high basal glutamate levels, a low glutamine/glutamate ratio, high lactate levels, and indications of poor glucose utilization. The epileptogenic cortex had only marginally increased glutamate levels.

We propose that interictal energetic deficiency in the epileptogenic hippocampus could contribute to impaired glutamate reuptake and glutamate-glutamine cycling, resulting in persistently increased extracellular glutamate, glial and neuronal toxicity, increased lactate production along with poor lactate and glucose utilization, and ultimately worsening energy metabolism. Our data suggest that a different neurometabolic process underlies the neocortical epilepsies.

### Postoperative exacerbated cough hypersensitivity syndrome induces dramatic respiratory alkalosis, lactatemia, and electrolyte imbalance [^115L1fYa]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). High credibility.

In the reported case, sudden aggravation of the chronic cough was the primary cause of severe hypocapnia, resulting in alkalosis and life-threatening electrolyte imbalances. Hyperventilation in the sense of psychiatric stress could not be objectified in the patient; she expressed herself in a differentiated manner throughout. Due to the pre-existing cough hypersensitivity syndrome and complication-free surgery, intubation seems to be the most likely trigger; an opioid-induced cough is also debatable. Hyperventilation is known to have a dramatic effect on the acid-base balance.

Hypocapnia, primarily caused by coughing, accompanied by severe electrolyte and acid/base disturbances, has not been described in the literature at the time of writing. An interesting secondary finding was the persistence of lactatemia for more than 12 hours. In particular, type A lactic acidosis with underlying tissue hypoxia requires rapid diagnosis but could not be confirmed in this case. According to a meta-analysis, lactatemia is possible after inhalation therapy with the beta-2 agonist salbutamol in rare cases. Of note, psychogenic hyperventilation — which we do not assume in this case — is associated with increased lactate levels and an inverse correlation between pCO2 and lactate concentration in 30% of patients.

While in septic or cardiogenic shock, the duration of lactic acidosis is an early predictor of mortality or multi-organ failure; the impact of lactatemia without acidosis is less well known. Lactatemia in the setting of psychogenic hyperventilation appears not to be associated with poor outcomes.

### Glumetza [^111SJrbV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. Metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, increasing lactate blood levels, which may elevate the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with the immediate discontinuation of Glumetza. In Glumetza-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in the reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis. If these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue Glumetza and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.

- **Warning: Lactic acidosis**: Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concurrent use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years or greater, undergoing a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g. acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high-risk groups are provided [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue Riomet and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: Part 1. Classification and pathophysiology [^115RbJd4]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidaemia (pH < 7.35 not primarily related to hypoventilation) is common amongst the critically ill, and it is essential that clinicians caring for these patients understand the common causes. The exclusive elimination routes of volatile (carbon dioxide), organic (lactic and ketone), and inorganic (phosphate and sulphate) acids mean compensation for a defect in any one is limited and requires separate provision during critical illness.

We discuss the models available to diagnose metabolic acidosis, including CO2/HCO3(-) and physical chemistry-derived (Stewart or Fencl-Stewart) approaches, but we propose that the base excess and anion gap, corrected for hypoalbuminaemia and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia, remain most appropriate for clinical usage. Finally, we provide some tips for interpreting respiratory responses to metabolic acidosis and how to reach a working diagnosis, the consequences of which are considered in part 2 of this review.

### Metabolic alkalosis: a new red flag in status epilepticus [^114EkykH]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Our study reveals that approximately 50% of status epilepticus (SE) patients present with an acid–base disorder within the first 24 hours of SE according to the Henderson–Hasselbalch approach.

About 35% of patients experienced respiratory and/or metabolic acidosis, likely directly related to respiratory dysfunction and/or lactate production. The antiepileptic effect of acidosis is well established: neuronal excitability and seizure activity are strongly suppressed by a decrease in brain and blood pH, with some anticonvulsants such as acetazolamide acting by reducing extracellular brain pH. However, the prognostic role of acidosis in critically ill patients remains debated. Some studies associate acidosis with higher mortality, while others find no relationship with outcome, or even a correlation to better prognosis. In our study, we did not find a clear association between acidosis and outcomes, but a larger sample size may be needed to detect small differences.

In the first 24 hours of SE, 15% of patients showed alkalosis, split evenly between metabolic and respiratory causes. The pathogenesis of alkalosis in SE is less clear and likely influenced by the overall pathophysiological context. Alkalosis, especially metabolic alkalosis, has been recognized as a common acid–base disturbance in critically ill patients, increasing with invasive therapies like mechanical ventilation, gastric aspiration, and intravenous infusions. In our cohort, we assessed pH only in the very first stage of SE, and only a small percentage of patients experienced alkalosis, with no relationship to intensive care unit outcomes.

### L-arginine in mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes: A systematic review [^1118j3ga]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial diseases are the most common group of inherited neurometabolic diseases, with a prevalence of 1 in 4,300. They are frequently multisystemic in nature and exhibit extensive heterogeneity in both genotype and phenotype. The clinical management of stroke-like episodes in the context of mitochondrial disease is especially challenging. These paroxysmal events define the mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome and are considered manifestations of seizure activity that is often refractory or super-refractory to conventional anticonvulsive treatments.

The exact mechanisms and pathophysiology of stroke-like episodes remain elusive, with historically two leading hypotheses: microangiopathy versus neuronal hyperexcitability and cytopathy. Endothelial dysfunction, reduced nitric oxide (NO) synthesis rates, and low plasma concentrations of L-arginine in patients with MELAS support the argument for a therapeutic role for L-arginine (a potent NO donor) in mitochondrial stroke-like episodes. This has led to increasing advocacy for L-arginine in the treatment of MELAS, despite a paucity of supporting evidence. To close this gap in knowledge, we systematically investigated the efficacy and safety of L-arginine and sought to undertake a meta-analysis in individuals with reported stroke-like episodes and genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease.

### Elevated lactate secondary to gastrointestinal beriberi [^1115jFrL]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Thiamine deficiency usually occurs with prolonged nutritional deficiency and is almost universally identified with Wernicke's encephalopathy or beriberi. It is also, however, a rare cause of elevated lactate and gastroenterological symptoms. This case report describes a 30-year-old man with two weeks of gastroenterological symptoms and intermittent oral intake, who was found to have an elevated lactate level.

The neurological exam was normal, and an extensive workup was negative. However, after being treated with thiamine, his lactate level improved overnight, and all of his symptoms resolved. Thiamine levels returned low at 44 nmol/L (normal 78–185 nmol/L). Lack of recognition of this phenomenon, while rare, can lead to unnecessary tests and procedures, and increased morbidity and mortality.

### Hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome — the markers for an early HSES diagnosis [^113tcjVh]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

There was a tendency to maintain elevated serum lactate levels in 6 patients, with levels ranging from 2.2 to 11.5 mmol/L (median: 4.2 mmol/L) upon admission, from 2.3 to 11.8 mmol/L (median: 6.0 mmol/L) at 12 hours after admission, and from 2.1 to 10.8 mmol/L (median: 6.2 mmol/L) at 24 hours after admission.

- **CT scan findings**: CT scans revealed abnormalities between 24 and 72 hours after onset of coma or seizures. When the CT revealed bilateral cortical and subcortical areas of low density, patients had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), anemia, and multiple organ failure; however, respiratory function was maintained during the clinical course for all patients.

- **Changes in CT findings for Case 1**:
	- A: CT scan on admission showing slight edema without loss of gray or white matter differentiation.
	- **B**: CT scan 24 hours after admission showing definite basal cistern and cerebral sulci.
	- **C**: CT scan 48 hours later showing severe edema with vanishing basal cisternae and loss of gray and white matter differentiation.

Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring (REF 110–4BT, Camino, USA) was started in Cases 1 and 2. In Case 1, ICP monitoring began when the abnormal CT finding was discovered. In Case 2, it started immediately after admission, before an abnormal CT finding was evident. The ICP was controlled with whole-body hypothermia (34° – 34.5°C), barbiturate infusion, and osmolar diuretics.

### Persistent hyperlactacidaemia: About a clinical case [^115ZeaGb]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Lactate is the endogenous end product of anaerobic glycolysis, whose production is favored in situations of hypoperfusion or mitochondrial dysfunction. Leigh syndrome is a rare, progressive encephalomyopathy that represents a spectrum of mitochondrial genetic diseases that are phenotypically distinct but exhibit neuroradiological and pathological uniformity. We present the case of a 7-month-old infant with a history of prematurity, psychomotor retardation, and epilepsy, admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) due to cardio-respiratory arrest resulting from a respiratory infection. Hyperlactacidaemia was detected and persisted. The study of redox potential was normal; however, MRI with spectroscopy identified bilateral and symmetrical lesions involving the thalamic and basal ganglia, with small lactate peaks at T2 FLAIR, findings that were suggestive of Leigh syndrome. Subsequent enzymatic study revealed a lack of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Persistent hyperlactacidaemia, in the appropriate clinical context, should prompt screening for mitochondrial diseases.

### Identification of human D lactate dehydrogenase deficiency [^1143EUTA]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

- **Metabolic analysis**: Metabolic analysis reveals elevated D-lactate levels in two patients. The levels of D-lactate in urine and plasma are elevated in our patients compared to controls. Increased levels of D-2-hydroxyisovaleric acid and D-2-hydroxyisocaproic acid are also observed in urine and plasma, respectively. Separate metabolic measurements for Patient 1 and Patient 2 in urine (n = 3; n = 2) and plasma (n = 1; n = 2) are shown, with mean and standard deviation.

The unique biochemical phenotype of this patient prompted us to examine new patients for elevated D-lactate concentrations, leading to the identification of a second patient with a clinical diagnosis of West syndrome. This patient also exhibited elevated D-lactate in urine and plasma, as well as increased levels of both D-2-hydroxyacids. As increased D-lactate excretion is not known to be a feature of either a 11p13 deletion or West syndrome, we investigated the possibility of a different genetic cause. This investigation was driven by reports in neurometabolic patient cohorts, which indicate a high rate (13–14%) of patients with multiple molecular diagnoses.

### Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes mimicking occipital idiopathic epilepsy [^111fT67a]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

We report on a 19-year-old man with a 9-year history of occipital seizures characterized by deviation of the eyes and tonic ipsilateral turning of the head during sleep, initially diagnosed as idiopathic childhood occipital epilepsy, Gastaut type. The eventual development of status epilepticus, associated with a T(1) hypointense as well as T(2), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and diffusion-weighted hyperintense brain lesion, led to pathologic and genetic testing that identified an A3243G mitochondrial DNA point mutation associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes. This case emphasizes that occipital epileptic seizures can be the only presenting and long-lasting sign in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes.

### Riomet [^116thJnx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

- **Lactic acidosis**: There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio. Metformin plasma levels are generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, increasing lactate blood levels, which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with the immediate discontinuation of Riomet. In Riomet-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in the reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis. If these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue Riomet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.

### Identification of human D lactate dehydrogenase deficiency [^113ViWz1]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

Metabolic analysis reveals elevated D-lactate

The first patient, born of Sicilian parents from the same village, was originally described by Duran et al. He was seen by a clinical geneticist at age 4 due to delayed motor and mental development. Urinary lactate excretion was high and consisted almost exclusively of D-lactate instead of the common isomer L-lactate. Upon reexamination at age 40 because of family counseling, he still had an extremely increased D-lactate excretion (mean: 1686 mmol per mol creatinine) (Fig. 2a). Plasma analysis also revealed elevated D-lactate concentration (0.7 mM) (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, 2-hydroxyisovaleric acid and 2-hydroxyisocaproic acid were elevated in urine and plasma organic acid profiles. Upon identification of the increased D-lactate isomer, the chirality of these increased metabolites was subsequently also determined to be in the D-isomer form (Fig. 2c–f). Repeated antibiotic treatments failed to correct D-lactate levels, making a bacterial origin of this elevated metabolite unlikely. Additionally, the continued presence of increased D-lactate suggested that this was not a temporary metabolic disturbance. Array CGH analysis revealed a de novo 11p13 deletion, known to cause intellectual disability and explaining his syndromal features, though elevated D-lactate levels are not associated with this syndrome.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^113ToUzS]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a serious condition often associated with tissue hypoxia or sepsis, but it can also be caused by beta-adrenergic agonists such as albuterol. This report describes a case of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis in a male patient in his 70s with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. The patient presented with progressively worsening dyspnoea and increased albuterol use. During the initial evaluation, an elevated lactate level was observed, which further increased after albuterol treatment in the emergency room. A thorough sepsis workup was performed, yielding negative results, which ultimately led to the diagnosis of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis. After reducing the frequency of albuterol treatments, the patient's lactate levels normalised.

This case underscores the importance of considering medication-induced causes of lactic acidosis, particularly in patients with respiratory conditions who are frequently administered beta-adrenergic agonists. Recognising this under-reported phenomenon can help clinicians avoid unnecessary sepsis workups and ensure more accurate treatment plans.

### Profound neonatal hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis caused by pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy [^113cqRr1]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) was first described in 1954. The ALDH7A1 gene mutations resulting in α-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency as a cause of PDE was identified only in 2005. Neonatal epileptic encephalopathy is the presenting feature in over 50% of patients with classic PDE. We report the case of a 13-month-old girl with profound neonatal hypoglycemia (0.6 mmol/L; reference range > 2.4), lactic acidosis (11 mmol/L; reference range A [p. Val278Val]), and a novel putative pathogenic missense mutation c.1192G > C [p. Gly398Arg] in the ALDH7A1 gene. She has been seizure-free since 1.5 months of age on treatment with pyridoxine alone. She has motor delay and central hypotonia but normal language and social development at the age of 13 months. This case is the first description of a patient with PDE due to mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene who presented with profound neonatal hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis masquerading as a neonatal-onset gluconeogenesis defect. PDE should be included in the differential diagnosis of hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis in addition to medically refractory neonatal seizures.

### Diagnostic value of MRS-quantified brain tissue lactate level in identifying children with mitochondrial disorders [^113hKMoA]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

In our study, no significant differences were found between the mitochondrial disease groups and the unlikely group for CSF lactate values. This contrasts with the results of Magner et al, who found that 83% of the children with mitochondrial disorders had increased CSF lactate levels. This lack of support for our data by previous findings may be explained by selection bias or the incompleteness of our data. Due to our retrospective study design, not all patients who underwent MRS studies also underwent lumbar punctures. With respect to our results, we think that elevated MRS-measured brain tissue lactate, and even more so MRS L/Cr, are better predictors for mitochondrial disease than laboratory-measured CSF lactate.

With regard to venous lactate, we found that of the 17 children in the definite mitochondrial disease group, 53% (nine patients) had elevated venous lactate values. In the combined possible, probable, and definite mitochondrial disease groups (n = 44), only 41% (18 patients) had elevated venous lactate values. These findings are supported by the work of Munnich et al, who examined 1000 children referred for investigation of their mitochondrial disorders. They found an elevated venous lactate value in only 30% of the 234 patients. Given the large size of that study, their result is likely to be representative of the prevalence of lactic acidosis in children with mitochondrial diseases and indicates that even up to 70% of children with mitochondrial diseases can have a normal venous lactate value.

### Spurious point-of-care lactate elevation in ethylene glycol intoxication: Rediscovering a clinical pearl [^113SNbVX]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 76-year-old man was found unresponsive and brought to the emergency department. Initial workup showed profound lactic acidosis on a point-of-care arterial blood gas, without clinical signs of hypoperfusion. Investigations for types A and B lactic acidosis revealed no unifying diagnosis to explain both his altered mental status and profound lactic acidosis. A toxicology workup revealed an increased osmolar gap and an elevated ethylene glycol level. The lactic acidosis and his mental status completely normalized within 8 hours of renal replacement therapy initiation and fomepizole administration. Ethylene glycol metabolites have similar molecular structure with L-lactate. Some blood gas analyzers are unable to differentiate them, resulting in an artefactual lactate elevation. Our case highlights the importance of recognizing a falsely elevated lactate, which should raise clinical suspicion of ethylene glycol poisoning, as the treatment is time-sensitive to prevent complications and mortality.

### An exercise in clinical reasoning: Use of social context in diagnosing an elevated lactate [^113AP4yb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

While undergoing diagnostic workup for malignancy, it is never too early to start considering a patient's beliefs about biomedical models for health, values around end-of-life, and planning regarding future access to oncologic care. In the US, cancer care access, and thus associated outcomes, remains inequitable. For example, between 2008 and 2017, immigrants to the U.S. from China had higher cancer mortality than U.S.-born Chinese individuals, which may be due to barriers to diagnosis and/or guideline-concordant treatment. Discussions about treatment planning must be tailored to the individual patient and family rather than relying on stereotypes, assumptions, or prior experiences with ethnically similar patients.

Here is my final PR: A 65-year-old man who immigrated to San Francisco from Guangzhou 13 years ago presented with systemic and co-localizing cranial symptoms. He was found to have a nasal mass, increased bone marrow NK cells, peripheral blasts, splenic infarctions, and likely latent TB, overall concerning for NK/T-cell lymphoma (nasal type) with marrow involvement, complicated by type B lactic acidosis.

In the final PR, the discussant has continued to include a specific geographic exposure (immigration from Guangzhou) that plausibly contains a pathophysiologic link to the most likely diagnosis (NK/T-cell lymphoma (nasal type)). The discussant has also removed gastric cancer, as the workup narrowed the differential diagnosis to unrelated conditions. While prior cancer is often relevant when contextualizing an undifferentiated finding, once it becomes clear the diagnosis…

### Zituvimet [^115dZBhb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Lactic acidosis**: There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence. However, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. Metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, increasing lactate blood levels, which may heighten the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

### Status epilepticus [^114fnbUA]. Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus is a medical emergency that requires rapid and vigorous treatment to prevent neuronal damage and systemic complications. Failure to diagnose and treat status epilepticus accurately and effectively results in significant morbidity and mortality. Cerebral metabolic decompensation occurs after approximately 30 minutes of uncontrolled convulsive activity, and the window for treatment is therefore limited. Therapy should proceed simultaneously on four fronts: termination of seizures; prevention of seizure recurrence once status is controlled; management of precipitating causes of status epilepticus; and management of the complications. This article reviews opinions about the classification, aetiology, and pathophysiology of adult generalised convulsive status epilepticus and details practical management strategies for the treatment of this life-threatening condition.

### Serum lactate level and mortality in metformin-associated lactic acidosis requiring renal replacement therapy: A systematic review of case reports and case series [^112FXMtV]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Our findings align well with a recent comprehensive review by Calello et al, where a decision-making algorithm for RRT in MALA was proposed. The decision to initiate RRT is mainly triggered by serum lactate level and refractory severe acidosis. The proposed cut-off value of lactate, 20 mmol/L, coincides with our dose-response analysis, indicating a linear increase in mortality, particularly at lactate concentrations greater than 20 mmol/L.

The role of serum lactate in metformin-related acidosis remains controversial from a diagnostic perspective. The elevation of lactate is usually induced by mutually reinforcing factors, such as predisposing impaired kidney function and resultant acidemia-related circulatory failure. Conversely, serum lactate could serve as a useful integrated marker to guide the initiation and adjustment of RRT.

Compared to the general intensive care unit (ICU) population, where baseline serum lactate level is a reliable predictor of ICU mortality, the proposed lactate threshold for increased mortality risk, 20 mmol/L, is significantly higher than the usual alarming lactate range of 2.0–4.0 mmol/L due to hypoperfusion (e.g. sepsis and trauma). This discrepancy may reflect the unique pathogenesis of MALA, characterized by cellular energy failure and impaired redox state.

More than half of the study population had hypothermia upon arrival at the care hospital. This provides indirect evidence of cellular energy failure, as thermogenesis driven by ATP turnover would be compromised in MALA.

### Metabolic alkalosis: A new red flag in status epilepticus [^116FQ4mK]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency characterized by ongoing epileptic seizures. It is often viewed as a complication resulting from other acute or chronic insults, rather than a disease in itself.

The prognosis for SE is highly variable, ranging from severe neurological disability to death. The outcome is primarily determined by the underlying disease and significantly influenced by the pathophysiological context in which SE develops. These contextual factors include both those independent of SE, such as age, comorbidities, and concomitant therapy, and those triggered by SE, such as organ, metabolic, and electrolytic dysfunctions. This bidirectional relationship presents challenges in prognostication.

Research has demonstrated that low brain and blood pH levels strongly suppress epileptic activity. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that alkalosis may trigger febrile and hypoxic-related seizures. However, few studies have systematically examined acid–base disorders and their association with outcomes in SE patients.

Notably, pH alterations are common in critically ill patients and can substantially impact their outcomes. SE may cause various acid–base disturbances, including respiratory acidosis due to impaired respiratory function and metabolic acidosis resulting from anaerobic muscle metabolism.

Our study aims to investigate acid–base disturbances in a large and heterogeneous SE population, examining the relationship between acid–base disorders, functional outcomes, and mortality.

### Epilepsy characteristics and clinical outcome in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) [^117LMy8E]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). High credibility.

Epileptic seizures in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) are heterogeneous with no pathognomonic features. We reviewed epilepsy characteristics and clinical outcomes exclusively in a pediatric population.

- **Methods**: Twenty-two children and adolescents (13 males) with confirmed mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes due to the mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation and epilepsy were recruited. Clinical data, including seizure semiology, treatment response, neuroimaging findings, and electroencephalography, were analyzed. We also examined the effect of the age at seizure onset and initial symptoms on the clinical variables.

- **Results**: Seizure semiology and electroencephalography abnormalities showed no syndrome-specific findings. Focal seizures occurred in 21 of 22 subjects (95.5%), whereas generalized seizures developed in seven of 22 subjects (31.8%). Twenty of 22 subjects (90.9%) achieved partial to complete reduction of clinical seizures for more than one year with a combination of more than two antiepileptic drugs. The subgroup with earlier seizure onset presented significantly earlier and showed significantly higher rates of drug-resistant epilepsy compared with the late-onset group, although there were no significant differences in the initial symptoms. The subjects with severe epileptic conditions tended to have more severe clinical dysfunction and more severe organ involvement.

- **Conclusions**: Both focal and generalized seizures occurred in patients with MELAS.

### Hyperlactatemia after intracranial tumor surgery does not affect 6-month survival: A retrospective case series [^113DHZN1]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Outcomes of patients with normal or elevated serum lactate**: Compared with those with normal lactate levels, patients with hyperlactatemia on admission to the HDU had significantly longer surgery durations, greater blood loss, less positive fluid balance, higher doses of dexamethasone, and higher blood glucose levels. Moreover, patients with elevated serum lactate upon arrival at the HDU had significantly higher lactate levels the morning after surgery compared with those with normal lactate at HDU admission. Interestingly, despite the elevated lactate levels, these patients also had significantly higher pH levels than those with normal serum lactate the morning after surgery.

- **Trends in tumor type and anesthesia method**: Although there was no significant association between tumor type and serum lactate levels at HDU admission, the following trend was identified: patients with glioblastoma had elevated lactate more often than those with meningioma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, or medulloblastoma. Patients who received TIVA had hyperlactatemia less frequently than those who received balanced anesthesia (48.4% vs. 61.5%, P = 0.008). The balanced anesthesia group received sevoflurane (65.7%) or isoflurane (34.3%) as maintenance anesthetic.

### Elevated lactate as an early marker of brain injury in inflicted traumatic brain injury [^1161VCUS]. Pediatric Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury is a major cause of disability and death in the pediatric population. The metabolic and neurochemical abnormalities that underlie traumatic brain injury remain poorly understood, but hypoxia-ischemic injury might play an important role.

This study evaluated children with inflicted traumatic brain injury using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). It was postulated that children with hypoxic-ischemic injury, indicated by elevated lactate in the acute phase of injury, would have worse early neurological status and short-term clinical outcomes than those without lactate upon MRS.

- **Materials and methods**: This prospective study employed proton MRS to sample bilaterally the frontal lobes and the parasagittal cortex within the parietal and occipital lobes of 11 patients with inflicted traumatic brain injury who were undergoing a clinical MRI examination. Patients' clinical course while hospitalized was measured, including initial neurological evaluation, presence of seizure activity, need for admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), number of days hospitalized, presence of retinal hemorrhages, and presence of bone fractures. Measurement of outcome was determined using the Pediatric Overall Performance Category Scale (POPCS; 1 = good performance; 6 = death).

- **Results**: Four children demonstrated elevated lactate and diminished N-acetyl aspartate (a neuronal marker) within several regions, indicating global ischemic injury (lactate-positive global group). These four children all had seizure activity and abnormal initial neurological examination.

### Recognizing and managing a metabolic crisis [^1158q6QZ]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2023). Low credibility.

In some relatively common inborn errors of metabolism, there can be the accumulation of toxic compounds, including ammonia and organic acids such as lactate and ketoacids, as well as energy deficits at the cellular level. The clinical presentation is often referred to as a metabolic emergency or crisis. Fasting and illness can result in encephalopathy within hours, and without appropriate recognition and intervention, the outcome may be permanent disability or death. This review outlines easy and readily available means of recognizing and diagnosing a metabolic emergency as well as general guidelines for management. Disease-specific interventions focus on parenteral nutrition to reverse catabolism, toxin removal strategies, and vitamin/nutrition supplementation.

### Autosomal dominant transmission of transient neonatal lactic acidosis: a case report [^112xVA5P]. BMC Pediatrics (2020).

Lactic acid is an anaerobic metabolite that tends to accumulate whenever cellular respiration is inadequate to meet cellular energy requirements. Commonly, lactic acidosis reflects acquired mitochondrial dysfunction due to impaired tissue oxygenation ('shock'). In neonates, hyperlactatemia is commonly observed in sepsis, hypoxic-ischemic injury, and congenital heart disease. When secondary, blood lactate levels mirror the patient's clinical state, resolving with correction of the underlying disease process. Primary lactic acidosis that is inappropriate to the clinical context suggests an inborn error of cellular energy metabolism. Collectively, these primary lactic acidoses are numerous. They are genetically heterogeneous, with disorders of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation or pyruvate metabolism accounting for most cases. Because the mitochondrion is complex, comprising the products of more than 1000 distinct nuclear genes, genetic diagnosis of primary mitochondrial disorders is rarely found, occurring only in approximately 25–50% of cases. With few exceptions (e.g. holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency, which is treatable with biotin, and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, which is somewhat treatable with the ketogenic diet), specific treatments are lacking, and many patients die in infancy or childhood.

Here we detail the case of a father and daughter with dominantly-inherited, resolving (i.e. transient) neonatal hyperlactatemia due to transient complex IV deficiency. No previous description of such an autosomal dominant form of benign, transient complex IV appears to exist.

### Kombiglyze XR [^114B2ouu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Lactic acidosis**: There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis.

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with the immediate discontinuation of Kombiglyze XR. In Kombiglyze XR-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in the reversal of symptoms and recovery.

### Elevated lactate in Mauriac syndrome: Still a mystery [^1141CtYt]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

In 1930, P. Mauriac described children who had diabetes mellitus type 1, enlarged liver with glycogen accumulation, poor growth, and delayed pubertal development. Accumulation of glycogen within the hepatocytes leading to liver enlargement and/or elevation of liver enzymes is defined as glycogenic hepatopathy; it may also occur in adults with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes. Glycogenic hepatopathy can be associated with lactic acidosis, particularly following insulin treatment. In a series of reported children with Mauriac syndrome, approximately half had elevated lactate levels despite no signs of illness or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). In DKA, elevation of lactate may be associated with glycolysis induced by hyperglycemia and seems to vary according to ketogenesis. Thus, there seems to be a metabolic abnormality in Mauriac syndrome that differs from, or occurs in addition to, insulinopenic diabetes. The pathophysiological mechanisms and hypothetical causes responsible for this constellation are still the subject of discussion.

### Autosomal dominant transmission of transient neonatal lactic acidosis: a case report [^111erx6T]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Although rapidly becoming the first-line diagnostic test of choice for suspected mitochondrial disorders, whole exome sequencing (WES) results in a high-probability gene assignment in less than one-third of individuals tested. This aligns with the general WES-associated molecular diagnostic rate of 20–30% for other unsolved Mendelian disorders. Potential reasons for the modest molecular diagnostic rate are manifold. At present, we are aware of only 6,000 human disease genes, and we suspect that there are many more, with estimates of 6,000–13,000 disease genes yet to be identified. Furthermore, the variation responsible for the transient lactic acidosis may not be detectable by "exon" level methods. For instance, variation in the non-coding region, a chromosomal deletion or duplication, complex chromosomal rearrangement(s), or expansion mutations may not be detected. Technological advances such as whole-genome sequencing and RNA-Seq may resolve some of these issues and provide answers for the family in the near future.

The transient disorder described in this report should be considered a rare exception to the poor prognosis characteristic of most primary lactic acidoses. In the absence of an accurate clinical and family history, transient primary hyperlactatemia may easily be mistaken for typical etiologies of lactic acidosis such as sepsis, congenital heart disease, and perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury. Although uncommon, the condition presented here should be considered when counseling parents of neonates with primary lactic acidosis regarding prognosis. This case report emphasizes how the incorporation of parents and their family history is crucial in understanding the prognosis of such conditions.

### Artifactual elevation of lactate in ethylene glycol poisoning [^117YEph4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning is based on nonspecific clinical symptoms and signs and indirect and direct laboratory measurement. Few institutions have timely access to direct measurement of ethylene glycol, resulting in potential delays in diagnosis and initiation of therapy. We present two cases of ethylene glycol poisoning, which demonstrate the need to recognize the false elevation of lactate in some chemistry analyzers due to the interference of glycolic acid, a metabolite of ethylene glycol.

- **Lactate gap interpretation**: Using the "lactate gap" in comparing the measurement of lactate with two commonly used chemical analyzers aids in differentiating ethylene glycol poisoning from lactic acidosis.

### Pediatric encephalopathy and complex febrile seizures [^112RrBmc]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Another proposed pathogenetic mechanism implicates energy failure followed by mitochondrial dysfunction. AESD patients found to have a lactate peak on MRS, which reflects a shift toward anaerobic glycolysis and an energy supply and demand imbalance, had a worse outcome. Consistent with this hypothesis, early initiation of vitamins and co-enzymes, including vitamin B1, B6, and L-carnitine, has been proposed as a therapy and can improve outcomes in suspected AESD cases.

Early recognition is important, as delay has been shown to have cellular and molecular consequences. Shiihara and colleagues reported that tau protein, a CSF biomarker of axonal damage, is elevated in children with AESD within the first two days of illness, suggesting that waiting to treat until the appearance of biphasic seizures or until BTA changes are observed may be too late to ameliorate pre-existing brain damage.

While the mortality rate for AESD is reported to be low in Japan (< 5%), a wide spectrum of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes have been described. In all, 28% to 45% of patients have a good recovery, 40% to 50% experience mild deficits, and 5% to 45% severe sequelae. Poor outcomes include motor and/or cognitive impairment as well as refractory epilepsy. PEE has been reported to occur 2 to 39 months after AESD and often involves multiple seizure types that are difficult to control. Here, one case resulted in withdrawal of care, whereas the remaining two had significant morbidities and one developed PEE, which may reflect the relatively late diagnosis of AESD in our practice.

### Synjardy [^113HfdcQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Lactic acidosis**: There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, increasing lactate blood levels, which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of Synjardy or Synjardy XR. In Synjardy or Synjardy XR-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in the reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis. If these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue Synjardy or Synjardy XR and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.

### Autosomal dominant transmission of transient neonatal lactic acidosis: a case report [^113vuaxw]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a common finding in neonates, in whom mitochondrial dysfunction is often secondary to tissue hypoperfusion, respiratory failure, and/or sepsis. Primary (non-physiological) lactic acidosis is comparatively rare and suggests the presence of an inborn error of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Optimal medical management and accurate prognostication require the correct determination of the etiology of lactic acidosis in a given patient. Unfortunately, genetic diagnoses are rare and highly variable for neonates presenting with primary lactic acidosis; individual case reports may offer the most promise for treatment considerations.

The mitochondrion is a complex molecular machine incorporating the products of over 1000 distinct nuclear genes. Primary lactic acidoses are therefore characterized by high genetic heterogeneity, and a specific genetic diagnosis currently remains out of reach in most cases. Most mitochondriopathies with neonatal onset follow autosomal recessive inheritance and carry a poor prognosis. Here, we detail the case of a father and daughter with dominantly inherited, resolving (i.e. transient) neonatal hyperlactatemia due to complex IV deficiency. We found no other published descriptions of benign transient complex IV deficiency with autosomal dominant inheritance.

- **Case presentation**: Both individuals presented as neonates with unexplained, marked lactic acidosis, suggesting a primary mitochondrial disorder. Within the first weeks of life, elevated blood lactate levels normalized. Their clinical and developmental outcomes were normal.

### Diagnostic and prognostic value of very high serum lactate dehydrogenase in admitted medical patients [^113qSTBZ]. The Israel Medical Association Journal (2014). High credibility.

Increased serum lactate dehydrogenase can be attributed to a variety of causes, including:

- **Infections and inflammatory conditions**: infectious mononucleosis, acute viral meningitis, infectious encephalitis, COVID-19 infection, testicular cancer, myositis
- **Critical illnesses**: rhabdomyolysis, shock, acute pancreatitis
- **Cardiac and pulmonary disorders**: pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, myocardial infarction
- **Hematological conditions**: lymphoma, leukemia, megaloblastic anemia, ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolytic anemia
- **Metabolic and endocrine disorders**: hypothyroidism, glycogenosis type 7, hepatocellular injury
- **Other conditions**: renal infarction

Additionally, certain medications can lead to increased serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. These include:

- **Antibiotics and antifungals**: moxifloxacin, cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, ofloxacin, doxycycline hyclate, cefadroxil, ceftriaxone, doxycycline monohydrate, cefixime, amphotericin B lipid complex, amphotericin B liposomal
- **Cardiovascular and related agents**: diltiazem, nifedipine ER, nifedipine, diltiazem ER, acebutolol, fenoldopam
- **Immunomodulatory and antineoplastic agents**: bexarotene, zanidatamab, belinostat, acitretin
- **Other medications**: ibuprofen, dextromethorphan/quinidine, mesalamine DR, mesalamine ER, niacin ER, amantadine, fosinopril

### Consensus statement from the 2014 International Microdialysis Forum [^114Sh7aD]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The lactate/pyruvate ratio (LP ratio) serves as a crucial marker of cellular redox status. A high LP ratio is associated with unfavorable outcomes. It quantitatively measures this status independent of relative recovery. An elevated LP ratio may result from either a failure of oxygen delivery, known as ischemic hypoxia, or non-ischemic causes such as mitochondrial dysfunction. When interpreting the LP ratio, it is essential to consider the absolute concentrations of lactate and pyruvate. The spectrum of factors increasing the LP ratio ranges from ischemia to mitochondrial dysfunction. An increase in the LP ratio with low pyruvate and low oxygen suggests ischemia, whereas an increase with normal or high pyruvate and normal oxygen indicates mitochondrial dysfunction.

Glutamate plays a significant role as both an excitatory amino acid and neurotransmitter. Excess glutamate is considered an additional injurious mechanism, especially when exacerbating injury in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Ischemia and seizures are conditions where excess glutamate release is observed. There is a documented association between glutamate levels and the clinical course and outcome in TBI and SAH. Measuring cerebral glutamate levels may be useful for aiding in prognosis estimation.

Glycerol serves as a marker of cell membrane breakdown and is a potential indicator of oxidative stress. However, glycerol has limited specificity; brain glycerol concentrations are influenced by systemic concentrations. Systemic levels often reflect a stress response or the administration of glycerol-containing substances.

### Late-onset mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes and the role of serial imaging [^113unMAc]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Mitochondria are essential for human metabolic function, and over 350 genetic mutations are associated with mitochondrial diseases, which are inherited in a matrilineal fashion. In mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), defective mitochondrial function and resultant impaired cellular energy production compromise vascular perfusion in affected tissues. Early diagnostic criteria suggested that the diagnosis should be considered in individuals under 40. However, a broader range of phenotypes is now recognized, including those that present for the first time later in life.

The primary presenting feature in MELAS is a stroke-like episode invariably resulting in patients undergoing neuroradiological imaging. We present a case of a woman with a first presentation of a stroke-like episode and seizures in her 40s who was eventually diagnosed with MELAS. We detail her clinical presentation, treatment, and diagnosis, emphasizing the role of serial imaging in her diagnosis.

### Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS): A case report and critical reappraisal of treatment options [^1176QrjH]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Stroke-like episodes signal progression and significant disability in the mitochondrial encephalomyopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome. Arginine is widely used as a treatment for stroke-like episodes, although there is little evidence for this intervention. We discuss the management of a patient with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes who presented with a stroke-like episode.

During a seizure, which triggers the stroke-like episode, neurons are forced to utilize glycolysis as a source of adenosine triphosphate. Glycolytic by-products are damaging to the neuron. Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier leads to vasogenic edema.

Treatment of stroke-like episodes should include anticonvulsants interictally to prevent seizures and dexamethasone ictally to help repair the blood-brain barrier.

### Identifying encephalopathies from acute metabolic derangements [^115hWDJj]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Metabolic derangements, when acute and severe, affect brain function, presenting mostly with a marked decline in the level of consciousness. This results in impaired responsiveness, abnormal receptivity, impaired content, and loss of memory retention. While the term "metabolic encephalopathy" has been used, it is a conjecture that can be challenged in the age of modern neuroimaging. We now recognize that many metabolic encephalopathies may involve structural lesions at an early stage.

- **Clinical conundrums**: Common dilemmas include evaluating the degree of brain injury and its recoverability.
- **Review focus**: This review discusses the appropriate terminology for these conditions, the diagnostic approach, therapy recommendations, and the prediction of recovery potential.
- **Evaluation considerations**: When evaluating a presumed metabolic cause for encephalopathy, we must (1) search for and rule out structural injury to the brain despite an obvious explanatory metabolic derangement, (2) recognize that several confounding conditions often co-exist, and (3) acknowledge that the resolution of brain dysfunction may be protracted despite normalization of laboratory values.
